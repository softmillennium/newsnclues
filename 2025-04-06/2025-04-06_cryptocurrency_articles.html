Bitcoin bulls, though, may have spoken too soon. In late Sunday afternoon action, bitcoin was trading just above $79,000 down 5% from 24 hours earlier. The term "black monday" is trending on X — a reference to Monday October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly one quarter of its value in one session. Back then, the triggering event was the threat of a currency war by then Secretary of Treasury James Baker. "If we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," tweeted hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who previously had been at least modestly supportive of President Trump. "The President has an opportunity on Monday to call a time out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system," he continued. The 10-year Treasury yield is down 14 basis points from its Friday close at 3.85%. Updated (22:05 UTC): Added early stock and bond market trading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin showed signs of decoupling from stocks last week, but today's drop below $80,000 suggests BTC and altcoins are primed for a sell-off when US equities markets open. Last week, Bitcoin (BTC) began showing early signs of decoupling from the US stock markets. Bitcoin was relatively flat over the week, while the S&P 500 plunged by 9%. The sell-off was triggered following US President Donald Trump's April 2 global tariff announcement, which escalated further on April 4 as China retaliated with new tariffs on US goods. Even gold was not spared and was down 1.9% for the week. Alpine Fox founder Mike Alfred highlighted in a post on X that a gold bull market is bullish for Bitcoin. During previous cycles, gold led Bitcoin for a short while, but eventually, Bitcoin caught up and grew 10 times or more than gold. He added that it would not be any different this time. Crypto market data daily view. Although the short-term outperformance of Bitcoin is an encouraging sign, traders should remain cautious until further clarity emerges on the macroeconomic front. If the US stock markets witness another round of selling, the cryptocurrency markets may also come under pressure. A handful of altcoins are showing strength on the charts, but waiting for the overall sentiment to turn bullish before jumping could be a better strategy. If Bitcoin breaks above its immediate resistance, what are the top cryptocurrencies that may follow it higher? Bitcoin bulls have failed to push the price above the resistance line, but they have not ceded much ground to the bears. The 20-day exponential moving average ($84,241) is flattening out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is just below the midpoint, signaling a balance between supply and demand. This advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls on a break and close above the resistance line. There is resistance at $89,000, but if the level gets taken out, the BTC/USDT pair could ascend toward $100,000. If this level cracks, the pair could plummet to $76,606 and then to $73,777. The pair has been consolidating between $81,000 and $88,500. This level could attract sellers, but the pair may jump to $95,000 if the bulls prevail. The pair may then dump to $76,606. Pi Network (PI) has been in a strong downtrend since topping out at $3 on Feb. 26. The relief rally on April 5 shows the first signs of buying at lower levels. Any recovery is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA (0.85), which remains the key short-term level to watch out for. If the PI/USDT pair does not give up much ground from the 20-day EMA, it indicates that the bulls are holding on to their positions. The pair could then jump to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.10 and next to the 61.8% retracement level of $1.26. A break and close below $0.40 could sink the pair to $0.10. If they do that, the pair could travel to $1.20. The negative momentum could pick up on a break below $0.54. OKB (OKB) turned up sharply on April 4 and closed above the moving averages, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. If the price turns down sharply and breaks below $54, the pair may oscillate inside the channel for a few more days. On the other hand, if buyers do not give up much ground from the resistance line, it increases the likelihood of a break above the channel. The pair will complete an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on a break and close above the neckline. If that happens, the pair could start its march toward the pattern target of $70. Related: Solana TVL hits new high in SOL terms, DEX volumes show strength — Will SOL price react? GateToken (GT) has been finding support at the 50-day SMA ($22.05) for a few days, which is an important level to watch out for. A break and close above $23.18 could push the price to $24. This remains the key overhead resistance for the bears to defend because a break above it could catapult the GT/USDT pair to $26. This positive view will be invalidated in the short term if the price breaks and maintains below the 50-day SMA. Buyers will gain the upper hand on a break and close above the resistance line. Such a move suggests that the corrective phase may be over. Cosmos (ATOM) is trying to form a bottom but is facing selling at $5.15. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to break below the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the moving averages with force, it signals buying on dips. If that happens, the ATOM/USDT pair could surge toward $6.50 and then to $7.17. Contrarily, a break and close below the moving averages suggests a possible range formation in the near term. The pair could swing between $5.15 and $4.15 for a while. Sellers will be back in command on a slide below $4.15. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $4.15 level. Instead, if the price stays above the 20-day EMA, it signals solid demand at lower levels. A break and close above this resistance could start a new up move.

The price of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has collapsed by 10%, according to data provided by CoinGecko. 

The altcoin has plunged to an intraday low of $1,601, and the sell-off is seemingly getting worse. 

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has also plunged below the $79,000 level, reaching a new intraday low of $78,882. 

The cryptocurrency market is getting crushed after the U.S. stock market lost more than $6 trillion in two days earlier this week.

Even though Bitcoin performed surprisingly well during the aforementioned crash, it is now showing its risk-on side once again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Block CEO Jack Dorsey has offered his thoughts on how Bitcoin could fail. Dorsey's thoughts go against the current prevailing narrative. The Block CEO's statements have unsurprisingly sparked pushback. This question continues to be the subject of serious debate, especially in core Bitcoin circles. The debate has now been rehashed by statements from Twitter co-founder and Block Inc. (NYSE:XYZ) CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey has asserted that Bitcoin will fail if it becomes nothing more than a store of value. He said this while speaking with Haley Berkoe, product marketing manager of Block subsidiary and Bitcoin-focused development firm Spiral, on a "Presidio Bitcoin" podcast episode last week. Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Dorsey's statements come at a time when the leading narrative for Bitcoin is that it has the potential to become a store of value on par with gold due to its limited supply. This thesis has left many unwilling to spend their coins in hopes that the asset's value will continue to grow. But in Dorsey's telling, the current store of value focus presents a path to “irrelevance.” Otherwise, it's just something you kind of buy and forget and only use in emergency situations or when you want to get liquid again. So I think if it doesn't transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it just gets increasingly irrelevant. And that's failure to me,” he told Berkoe. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Dorsey appeared to hold the view that Bitcoin had currently veered away from its original vision. “There's tons of stuff we need to do to really get back to the white paper, which is, you know, a system for electronic peer-to-peer digital cash like we have not seen that yet,” he asserted. See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. For example, Bitcoin Keeper Lead Developer Ben Kaufman contended that contrary to Dorsey's statements, Bitcoin was more needed as a store of value than a means of payment. It is needed for payments to circumvent financial censorship. Interestingly, “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the pseudonymous creator of the cryptocurrency, did appear to envision a future for Bitcoin as a store of value, widely quoted as saying, “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.” Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HashKey Group Chairman and CEO Xiao Feng kicked off the 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Sunday with a keynote address highlighting blockchain technology's transformative impact on global financial infrastructure. Speaking to an early morning crowd at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Xiao described blockchain as “a new generation of financial infrastructure” that fundamentally changes how financial transactions are recorded, settled and governed. “Any industrial revolution must wait for a financial revolution,” Xiao told attendees at the four-day event hosted by his company. Xiao emphasized historical parallels between technological and financial evolution: banking credit supported the British Industrial Revolution, stock markets enabled the electrical revolution in America, and venture capital fueled Silicon Valley's information revolution. The executive highlighted key differences between traditional and blockchain-based finance, including the shift from bank accounts to digital wallets and the move from batch settlement systems to instantaneous transaction completion. Xiao noted the significance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent decision not to classify dollar-backed stablecoins as securities, suggesting this allows more institutions to participate in monetary creation processes. “Traditional exchanges will eventually need to adapt to compete with cryptocurrency markets that have operated 24/7 since day one,” Xiao predicted. While mainland China maintains strict prohibitions on cryptocurrencies, analysts view Hong Kong's supportive stance as a strategic testing ground for the technology's potential. This approach effectively creates a regulatory breathing space where blockchain innovations can develop under controlled conditions, potentially informing future policies across the broader Chinese economy. The Web3 Festival continues through Wednesday with industry panels, demonstrations and networking events, bringing together blockchain developers, investors and technology enthusiasts from around the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weekly trading volumes have been falling like dominoes for weeks, scaring off capital and dragging the market back to levels not seen since its explosive 2020 debut. Blockchain analytics firm DappRadar shows that trading volumes in 2021 were riding high, hitting nearly $3 billion. That figure has nosedived 93% to just $23.8 million as “active traders have vanished,” blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas noted. “This rapid growth coincided with global shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating the adoption of digital platforms and pushing artists to explore innovative methods of engaging with their audiences. However, three years later, the hype around Art NFTs has significantly decreased.” In 2024, trading volume dropped nearly 20% from the year prior, while total sales declined 18%. In the U.S., they're often treated like securities, meaning platforms must walk a legal tightrope. This lack of regulatory clarity creates an environment that is ripe for fraud and erodes investor confidence. Frei also highlighted a deeper issue: beyond the worlds of cryptocurrency and gaming, NFTs are still “trying to prove that they offer real value.” “In theory, they could revolutionize several industries — think concert tickets that prevent scalping, digital IDs for online verification, or property deeds stored on the blockchain. Speaking of gaming, where NFTs have the most potential for mainstream use, their adoption is also struggling, Frei pointed out, recalling that Ubisoft's Project Quartz, an attempt to integrate NFTs into AAA games, was met with “resistance from players, forcing the company to shut it down.” The crypto exchange, still reeling from a $1.46 billion theft linked to North Korea-affiliated hackers, quietly closed its platform. “Take Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example – once the pinnacle of NFT status, its prices have dramatically dropped. At the peak, a single Bored Ape sold for $400,000, but now some are barely fetching $50,000. If people cannot see long-term value, they are unlikely to return.” “Smaller platforms will continue to shut down, leaving only a few dominant players like OpenSea and Blur,” she said. She explained that the shift is being driven by two major forces.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why the Restaurant Firm Behind Fatburger and Johnny Rockets Is Embracing Bitcoin The publicly traded FAT Brands (Nasdaq: FAT), which boasts 18 different franchise concepts and more than 2,300 locations worldwide, said the move “underscores its commitment to financial and technological innovation.” He said that international franchisees in particular, which operate over 20% of its restaurants, may especially benefit from the shift. “We look forward to utilizing Bitcoin as an efficient tool for streamlining and simplifying the payment process,” Wiederhorn added. Franchisees, or those that own one of FAT Brands' quick-service, casual dining locations, can pay franchise and development fees, as well as their royalty payments by sending Bitcoin to a “crypto wallet business account,” a FAT Brands representative told Decrypt. As for adding other payment options like Ethereum or Solana, it could “possibly” happen “in the future,” a representative for FAT Brands told Decrypt, “but we're starting with Bitcoin.” What about paying for a Fatburger or milkshake from Johnny Rockets with Bitcoin? In 2024, on-chain dining rewards platform Blackbird helped bring crypto payments to some of New York's most acclaimed restaurants. Plus, fast food chains McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut have all run collaborations in Web3. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Cosmos (ATOM) surges in price, the spotlight is also shining on its staking program and security issues that could pose risks to its future growth. Let's explore how Cosmos (ATOM) is navigating its staking program while Coldware (COLD) shows promising potential with cutting-edge blockchain technology. The Coldware (COLD) platform's ability to offer both decentralized finance and traditional finance solutions gives it an edge over Cosmos (ATOM), whose focus remains on blockchain interoperability. By providing a seamless bridge between these two worlds, Coldware is attracting interest from whales and institutional investors who see its potential to reshape the future of finance. However, recent security concerns have brought the effectiveness and sustainability of this program into question. Coldware's commitment to financial inclusion and accessibility is set to challenge Cosmos (ATOM)'s model, as it tackles not just staking but the entire financial ecosystem. Despite the bullish trends surrounding Cosmos (ATOM), Coldware (COLD) is building a more sustainable ecosystem that aligns with the increasing demand for secure and scalable blockchain applications. With Coldware's advanced Web3 features, it is setting itself up as a dominant force in the crypto space, one that could easily overtake Cosmos (ATOM) as it continues to innovate and gain investor confidence. The rise of Coldware (COLD), with its financial inclusion and Web3 focus, could pose a significant challenge to Cosmos (ATOM), which remains tied to a traditional staking and DeFi framework. As Cosmos (ATOM) pushes forward with its staking program amidst security concerns, Coldware (COLD) is quietly positioning itself to take the lead in the blockchain space. Coldware's integration of Web3 technology and focus on financial inclusion presents a compelling alternative to the traditional blockchain models employed by Cosmos (ATOM). With growing support from whales and a mission that aligns with the future of decentralized finance, Coldware could soon eclipse Cosmos (ATOM) as the go-to blockchain platform in 2025</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dogecoin could set a new all-time high (ATH) record if it matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum. Recall that DOGE ranked among the early gainers in the post-election relief rally, which saw its price rise to a high of $0.4835 on December 8. Consequently, some wonder what would happen if DOGE resumes its post-election rally and potentially matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP). Like DOGE, XRP and ETH have experienced massive declines, losing most of their post-election gains. Nonetheless, both coins still rank among the top three non-stablecoin crypto by market cap. While ETH sits in the second position with a market cap of $218.63 billion, XRP's valuation of $124.39 billion puts it in the third spot. Similarly, DOGE requires a greater surge of 768.61% to equal Ethereum's $218.63 billion market cap. Notably, if DOGE rises 394.19% and matches XRP's market cap, its price would increase to $0.8366. This estimate assumes Dogecoin's circulating supply remains fairly stable at 148.72 billion tokens. Recall that DOGE hit its previous ATH on May 8, 2021. It has remained far from this level ever since. However, hitting the $0.8366 or $1.47 targets would potentially mark new ATHs for DOGE. Several analysts have predicted Dogecoin's potential surge to the $0.8 and $1.4 price range. However, not everyone attached a timeline for when these predictions would materialize. Last month, popular TradingView analyst ‘Cobra Vanguard' identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Dogecoin's chart to predict a potential rally to the $0.8 price mark. In addition, popular chatbot service ChatGPT predicted that DOGE could soar to around $1.4 if it becomes the default payment method across Elon Musk's ecosystem. Meanwhile, Changelly set possible timelines for Dogecoin's potential surge to $0.8366 and $1.47, respectively. It remains to be seen whether these predictions will play out. Factors such as increased adoption, ETF approval, and celebrity influence could pave the way for a hefty rally to lofty targets like $0.8366 or $1.47.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anticipating the next big upswing isn't just about luck; it's about identifying trends, projects with real utility, and, importantly, undervalued opportunities. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, AI-powered cryptocurrencies are shaping up to be the stars of the next bull run. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), an Ethereum-based meme coin powered by AI-driven technology, is making waves as an emerging player. With applications extending into efficiency, community engagement, and predictive analytics, projects like Dawgz AI aim for more than speculative appeal. Here's why they might dominate the next market cycle. AI-driven cryptocurrencies are more than buzzwords; they bring actionable solutions to blockchain ecosystems. Beyond being “another token,” it actively advances decentralized technology through real-world utility. Major players such as BlackRock and Fidelity are increasing their stakes in AI-related crypto projects. This influx of investment highlights why AI-driven cryptocurrencies are top contenders in the next bull market. Meme coins have come a long way since the early days of Dogecoin. Projects like Dawgz AI combine the lightheartedness of meme culture with tangible innovation, offering not just fun but functional utility. For anyone considering the best cheap crypto to buy now, Dawgz AI represents the evolving potential of meme coins meeting technical innovation. If you're hunting for high-potential investments, here's a short list of altcoins that are gaining traction. Each project bridges technological innovation and future possibilities, ensuring they don't just ride the wave of hype but sustain long-term value. With over $3 million raised during its presale, Dawgz AI combines virality and robust tech into a smart narrative tailored for the 2025 market. Ocean Protocol provides essential infrastructure that could see widespread demand as AI expands. While the above are excellent considerations, Dawgz AI stands out for integrating both functional technology and viral community power. Its roadmap, filled with AI-powered tools and community-focused engagement, is built to create sustained growth. Instead of organic social media trends, Dawgz leverages machine learning to identify viral patterns, ensuring continuous momentum. Unlike projects lacking depth, Dawgz AI has a long-term plan: These strategies cement $DAGZ as a multi-functional and durable investment option. Every crypto cycle transforms how we think about investing. Dawgz AI stands out as an affordable option during its presale at $0.004. It offers both technological resilience and community-driven appeal for early investors. Investors often point to projects combining real-world utility with mass appeal, such as Dawgz AI. Its unique approach to combining AI and meme culture could catalyze exponential gains during the next bull market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bitcoin price has outperformed stocks, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent issuing a surprise endorsement. Now, as BlackRock's chief executive issues a near-$1 trillion warning to the U.S. dollar, Wall Street banks are staring down the barrel of an “existential” bitcoin and crypto crisis as Trump pushes for radical new legislation. Congress is rushing to pass major new crypto legislation in the form of a stablecoin bill that could see interest paid out to people holding the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, with Bo Hines, who leads Trump's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, saying last month that the White House wants a stablecoin bill passed before August. A stablecoin bill currently headed to the House floor prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying out interest to holders while a twin bill in the Senate' excludes interest on some types of stablecoins but falls short of banning them. If permitted, higher-than-average interest stablecoin accounts could see people move their money out of insured bank accounts, opening them up to risk if those crypto companies were to fail. “Stablecoins are emerging as the first real blockchain use case to be fully integrated into traditional finance, and we are witnessing the early stages of this transformation,” Hina Sattar Joshi, digital assets sales director at TP ICAP, said in emailed comments. “Strong global momentum in stablecoins is likely to attract institutional interest in a digital asset that has long-term growth potential while acting as a credible bridge between traditional assets and crypto.” "The government shouldn't put its thumb on the scale to benefit one industry over another," Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong posted to X earlier this week. The stablecoin market, led by Tether's $144 billion USDT, has grown rapidly in recent years, with financial technology companies and Wall Street giants from PayPal to Bank of America rushing to launch their own stablecoins, enticed by the massive $13 billion of profit Tether printed in 2024 as a result of the bitcoin, gold, U.S. Treasury bonds and other financial instruments it holds to back USDT. "It's pretty clear there's going to be a stablecoin," Brian Moynihan, Bank of America chief executive, said in an interview at the Economic Club it was reported by DL News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In past cycles, capital tends to rotate from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies as investors look for maximum gain before the arrival of the bear market. However, the story has been very different for the cryptocurrency market so far this year, with most large-cap assets failing to enjoy the same capital rotation seen in past cycles. The latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto market, outperforming all categories of altcoins. In an April 5 post on the X platform, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost shared an interesting on-chain insight into the performance of all altcoin categories relative to the world's largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the altcoins are underperforming compared to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization growth. Typically, when the short-term moving average (30-day MA) rises faster than the long-term moving average (365-day MA), it implies rapid market cap growth. On the flip side, a reduced growth momentum is indicated by a lagging 30-day moving average. As observed in the chart above, Bitcoin is outpacing the large-cap and mid-to-small-cap altcoins in terms of their market cap growth. Darkfost noted that this difference in the growth ratio has reached a level last seen in October 2023, a period correlated with a brief altcoin rally and subsequently BTC's dominance. The analyst further highlighted that when this growth ratio turns negative, it often signals that a strong correction has occurred. Historically, a negative ratio might present a potential buying opportunity for investors looking to get into the market. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $83,500, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. This gap in performance underscores how woeful the “king of altcoins” has been in the past few months. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luckily, there are crypto detectives and blockchain sleuths who track down stolen funds and help those who suspect they've been defrauded. The business of these investigators has flourished in recent years, three of them told Business Insider, in part because scams in the crypto sphere are becoming more sophisticated and even harder for even intelligent, computer-savvy people to avoid. Losses stemming from crypto investment frauds, the most common type of crypto scam, ballooned to $3.96 billion in 2023, according to data from the FBI, up 335% in two years. Scam activity has grown an average of 24% year-over-year since the pandemic, with bad actors likely pulling in a record $12.4 billion in revenue last year, according to estimates from the analytics firm Chainalysis. Here are investigators' top tips on how you can protect yourself from crypto scammers. Powers, who worked as a PI for years prior to doing investigative work on the blockchain, thinks scams are becoming so good they're defining a new era of con-artistry. "We've moved beyond the Nigerian 419 scams where the prince was contacting you by email," Powers told BI in an interview. And it turns out that chatting online with random strangers is not necessarily a low-risk activity, especially if that seeming casual contact is actually just the tip of the spear." Pig butchering scams — one type of fraud where a scammer establishes an online relationship with someone before asking them to invest or send money — have been on the rise, with revenue from this type of fraud soaring 40% in 2024, according to Chainalysis. Joe Greenfield, the chief forensic examiner at the investigative firm Maryman, strongly urges investors not to take anything at face value. "Assume in today's day and age that everything is a fraud. Everything's a scam until you prove otherwise to yourself," Greenfield said. There's no such thing as a crypto exchange withholding your funds for tax reasons. There's also no such thing as an exchange requiring you to send in a fee in order to withdraw your money. But those are common examples of fraudulent expenses scammers come up with to extort money out of their victims, according to Kyla Curley, a partner at the professional services firm StoneTurn who frequently investigates financial fraud. Curley says she often sees clients who had been unknowingly defrauded for months, due to a scammer repeatedly making small financial asks. In pig butchering schemes, victims can also be roped into fake relationships that involve sending payments for months — or sometimes, years —before victims finally realize they've been scammed, Greenfield adds. "It can drag for some time before people realize, like, oh shoot. One nightmare scenario Greenfield frequently investigates is when investors wake up and realize that their crypto wallets have been emptied overnight. In many cases, the theft was made possible by cybersecurity weaknesses within the person's crypto storage, such as by using a cloud-based wallet, weak passwords, and setting up SMS authentication instead of an app-based verification method. For the strongest security, he recommends using a cold storage wallet, using app-based authentication on sensitive accounts when possible, and following best-practices when it comes to picking a password. Fraud victims, often strung along for months, frequently come to the realization that they've been scammed far too late. But it's most useful if people get help right away. Curley says scam victims will also need the help of an attorney or law enforcement if they hope to recover some of their funds. It's common for attorney and investigator fees to rack up in the thousands, according Powers. He added that his firm typically does not take on fraud victims who have lost less than $100,000 in crypto, which he said was in clients' financial best interests. Curley estimates that around 20% of cases she oversees will end with a client getting at least some money back. Unfortunately, Curley also expects scams to become more sophisticated and damaging over time, due to how rapidly scams evolve.</p>

Hayes says that if the White House follows through on reducing its debt and current account deficit, then other countries will be forced to finance their economies by selling their US stocks and bonds, creating a permanent change in the global financial order since finance ministers around the world won't take a chance that Trump will change his mind. If the US current account deficit is eliminated, then foreigners do not have dollars to buy bonds and stocks. If foreigners have to juice up their own nations' economies, they will sell what they own, US bonds and stocks, to fund their nation-first policies.” Gold must flow freely and cheaply in the new world monetary order. “BTC hodlers need to learn to love tariffs, maybe we finally broke the correlation with Nasdaq, and can move onto the purest form of a fiat liquidity smoke alarm.” Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
