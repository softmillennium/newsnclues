                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin just notched its worst first quarter in a decade, falling 11.7% as markets struggled to understand the new administration's economic agenda. In the first quarter of 2020, amid a market sell-off tied to fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, BTC saw a 9.4% drawdown but then recovered to end the year up over 300%. This time around, the backdrop is murky. Cryptocurrency prices surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November after running a pro-crypto campaign. While under the Trump administration, the sector has been gaining greater regulatory clarity, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed off a number of lawsuits against crypto firms, it isn't all bullish. Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs against nearly every country in the world last week, leading to a massive $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days. This led to the S&P 500 index's lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100's entry into bear market territory. While bitcoin has outperformed so far, what will happen after Monday's opening bell is unclear. Historically, a weak Q1 doesn't always spell doom for BTC, NYDIG's data shows. The recent macroeconomic backdrop has seen analysts raise recession odds, which could test BTC's role as a “U.S. isolation hedge.”Read more: Chart of The Week: Will April Bring Good Luck or Fool's Hope for Bitcoin?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why the Restaurant Firm Behind Fatburger and Johnny Rockets Is Embracing Bitcoin The publicly traded FAT Brands (Nasdaq: FAT), which boasts 18 different franchise concepts and more than 2,300 locations worldwide, said the move “underscores its commitment to financial and technological innovation.” He said that international franchisees in particular, which operate over 20% of its restaurants, may especially benefit from the shift. “We look forward to utilizing Bitcoin as an efficient tool for streamlining and simplifying the payment process,” Wiederhorn added. Franchisees, or those that own one of FAT Brands' quick-service, casual dining locations, can pay franchise and development fees, as well as their royalty payments by sending Bitcoin to a “crypto wallet business account,” a FAT Brands representative told Decrypt. As for adding other payment options like Ethereum or Solana, it could “possibly” happen “in the future,” a representative for FAT Brands told Decrypt, “but we're starting with Bitcoin.” What about paying for a Fatburger or milkshake from Johnny Rockets with Bitcoin? In 2024, on-chain dining rewards platform Blackbird helped bring crypto payments to some of New York's most acclaimed restaurants. Plus, fast food chains McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut have all run collaborations in Web3. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency markets could be on track for recovery as investor sentiment begins to stabilize following US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcement — what some analysts are calling the peak of recent market uncertainty. Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which sent tremors across global markets. Still, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement. Van de Poppe added that he believes Trump is using tariffs as a strategic move to stimulate domestic growth and reduce yields. “Tariffs are literally the only way to do that,” he said. “I wouldn't be surprised if they're reversed within the next six to 12 months.” President Trump's plan imposes a 10% baseline tariff on all US imports from April 5 and a higher “reciprocal tariff” of up to 54% on select countries with larger trade deficits from April 9. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, has predicted Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 if the Fed formally enters a QE cycle. Related: Satoshi Nakamoto turns 50 as Bitcoin becomes US reserve asset “We can count on President Trump changing his mind a few times within the first couple of weeks,” Acheson told Cointelegraph. “For crypto, BTC continues to act like a risk asset short-term while its analog counterpart gold breaks through one all-time high after another,” a development that may impact crypto investor sentiment in the short term, Acheson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adopting new digital technologies enables financial institutions to considerably reduce operating costs, enhance transparency, and offer innovative services. “Tokenized deposits will be the largest unlock for liquidity movement within banks. Tokenizing deposits (which could be IOUs or earn interest) allows for more capital-efficient movement. We are already seeing that with SAB 121 being repealed, the desire for banks to hold tokenized assets is increasing. It involves the conversion of traditional financial assets such as a certificate of deposit, or a savings account into a digital token that offers investors potential benefits like faster 24/7 round the clock transactions with smart contracts used to automate interest rates, increased liquidity, fractional ownership, transparency—eliminating any possibility of fraud or manipulation. Instead of holding physical cash or keeping money in a bank account, investors can hold digital tokens representing their certificate of deposit or savings account amount on a secure and decentralized ledger by empowering them to participate in the digital asset ecosystem, ultimately leading to cost savings. This gives investors more flexibility and liquidity than a certificate of deposit, which often has an early redemption penalty. Last year, after running over a dozen proofs of concept, or PoC, with multiple global banks, technology companies, and intergovernmental organizations, UDPN  launched two digital asset management systems for commercial use, designed to reshape the landscape of digital payments and assets in the financial sector: Both solutions allow the optional ability to interoperate with other regulated digital currency systems through UDPN's infrastructure. This feature promotes seamless collaboration and integration within the digital asset ecosystem. Tim Bailey, VP of Global Business and Operations, Red Date Technology, explained: “Financial institutions and banks are embracing innovation to stay ahead by utilizing UDPN's cutting-edge tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system and digital asset tokenization system to forge the future of tokenized banking. This chart [above] is a general comparison between different types of digital currencies, such as tokenized deposits vs. stablecoins vs. retail and wholesale CDCs, not necessarily the capabilities of UDNP's tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system.” SEC revisits crypto rules, tariffs cause market downturn, Circle IPO uncertain | Weekly Recap Circle files IPO amid declining profits and stiffening competition — will this shake Tether's stablecoin dominance?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Cosmos (ATOM) surges in price, the spotlight is also shining on its staking program and security issues that could pose risks to its future growth. Let's explore how Cosmos (ATOM) is navigating its staking program while Coldware (COLD) shows promising potential with cutting-edge blockchain technology. The Coldware (COLD) platform's ability to offer both decentralized finance and traditional finance solutions gives it an edge over Cosmos (ATOM), whose focus remains on blockchain interoperability. By providing a seamless bridge between these two worlds, Coldware is attracting interest from whales and institutional investors who see its potential to reshape the future of finance. However, recent security concerns have brought the effectiveness and sustainability of this program into question. Coldware's commitment to financial inclusion and accessibility is set to challenge Cosmos (ATOM)'s model, as it tackles not just staking but the entire financial ecosystem. Despite the bullish trends surrounding Cosmos (ATOM), Coldware (COLD) is building a more sustainable ecosystem that aligns with the increasing demand for secure and scalable blockchain applications. With Coldware's advanced Web3 features, it is setting itself up as a dominant force in the crypto space, one that could easily overtake Cosmos (ATOM) as it continues to innovate and gain investor confidence. The rise of Coldware (COLD), with its financial inclusion and Web3 focus, could pose a significant challenge to Cosmos (ATOM), which remains tied to a traditional staking and DeFi framework. As Cosmos (ATOM) pushes forward with its staking program amidst security concerns, Coldware (COLD) is quietly positioning itself to take the lead in the blockchain space. Coldware's integration of Web3 technology and focus on financial inclusion presents a compelling alternative to the traditional blockchain models employed by Cosmos (ATOM). With growing support from whales and a mission that aligns with the future of decentralized finance, Coldware could soon eclipse Cosmos (ATOM) as the go-to blockchain platform in 2025</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dogecoin could set a new all-time high (ATH) record if it matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum. Recall that DOGE ranked among the early gainers in the post-election relief rally, which saw its price rise to a high of $0.4835 on December 8. Consequently, some wonder what would happen if DOGE resumes its post-election rally and potentially matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP). Like DOGE, XRP and ETH have experienced massive declines, losing most of their post-election gains. Nonetheless, both coins still rank among the top three non-stablecoin crypto by market cap. While ETH sits in the second position with a market cap of $218.63 billion, XRP's valuation of $124.39 billion puts it in the third spot. Similarly, DOGE requires a greater surge of 768.61% to equal Ethereum's $218.63 billion market cap. Notably, if DOGE rises 394.19% and matches XRP's market cap, its price would increase to $0.8366. This estimate assumes Dogecoin's circulating supply remains fairly stable at 148.72 billion tokens. Recall that DOGE hit its previous ATH on May 8, 2021. It has remained far from this level ever since. However, hitting the $0.8366 or $1.47 targets would potentially mark new ATHs for DOGE. Several analysts have predicted Dogecoin's potential surge to the $0.8 and $1.4 price range. However, not everyone attached a timeline for when these predictions would materialize. Last month, popular TradingView analyst ‘Cobra Vanguard' identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Dogecoin's chart to predict a potential rally to the $0.8 price mark. In addition, popular chatbot service ChatGPT predicted that DOGE could soar to around $1.4 if it becomes the default payment method across Elon Musk's ecosystem. Meanwhile, Changelly set possible timelines for Dogecoin's potential surge to $0.8366 and $1.47, respectively. It remains to be seen whether these predictions will play out. Factors such as increased adoption, ETF approval, and celebrity influence could pave the way for a hefty rally to lofty targets like $0.8366 or $1.47.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anticipating the next big upswing isn't just about luck; it's about identifying trends, projects with real utility, and, importantly, undervalued opportunities. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate, AI-powered cryptocurrencies are shaping up to be the stars of the next bull run. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), an Ethereum-based meme coin powered by AI-driven technology, is making waves as an emerging player. With applications extending into efficiency, community engagement, and predictive analytics, projects like Dawgz AI aim for more than speculative appeal. Here's why they might dominate the next market cycle. AI-driven cryptocurrencies are more than buzzwords; they bring actionable solutions to blockchain ecosystems. Beyond being “another token,” it actively advances decentralized technology through real-world utility. Major players such as BlackRock and Fidelity are increasing their stakes in AI-related crypto projects. This influx of investment highlights why AI-driven cryptocurrencies are top contenders in the next bull market. Meme coins have come a long way since the early days of Dogecoin. Projects like Dawgz AI combine the lightheartedness of meme culture with tangible innovation, offering not just fun but functional utility. For anyone considering the best cheap crypto to buy now, Dawgz AI represents the evolving potential of meme coins meeting technical innovation. If you're hunting for high-potential investments, here's a short list of altcoins that are gaining traction. Each project bridges technological innovation and future possibilities, ensuring they don't just ride the wave of hype but sustain long-term value. With over $3 million raised during its presale, Dawgz AI combines virality and robust tech into a smart narrative tailored for the 2025 market. Ocean Protocol provides essential infrastructure that could see widespread demand as AI expands. While the above are excellent considerations, Dawgz AI stands out for integrating both functional technology and viral community power. Its roadmap, filled with AI-powered tools and community-focused engagement, is built to create sustained growth. Instead of organic social media trends, Dawgz leverages machine learning to identify viral patterns, ensuring continuous momentum. Unlike projects lacking depth, Dawgz AI has a long-term plan: These strategies cement $DAGZ as a multi-functional and durable investment option. Every crypto cycle transforms how we think about investing. Dawgz AI stands out as an affordable option during its presale at $0.004. It offers both technological resilience and community-driven appeal for early investors. Investors often point to projects combining real-world utility with mass appeal, such as Dawgz AI. Its unique approach to combining AI and meme culture could catalyze exponential gains during the next bull market. They drive innovations such as predictive decision-making, fraud detection, and decentralized automation. Believer in Open-Source Software, Blockchain Technology & a Free and Fair Internet for all.

In a new interview with Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast, Gromen calls attention to the America First Investment Policy, a memo released by the Trump Administration in February that aims to make the US foreign investment policies more cautious and conscious of national security. “That, I think will ultimately be a catalyst to the separation of Bitcoin and Nasdaq, and that, I think, is starting to drive Nasdaq down – it has a long way to go because multiples are high – and in the short run, traders control the flows… If you back up to a five-year or ten-year chart, you can see very clearly these periods where Bitcoin has massively outperformed Nasdaq, but they still tend to go directionally similarly, when Bitcoin's up Nasdaq's up and vice versa… The America First Investment Policy memo, I think, will start to break that correlation because I think right now in the short run, that correlation is holding, [but] at some point I think capital flow is going to see Bitcoin for what it is which is a neutral reserve asset linked to energy, uncontrollable by any govenment and I think it'll start siphoning some flows off from Nasdaq as America continues to say, ‘Listen, you want to invest in some factories here?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In past cycles, capital tends to rotate from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies as investors look for maximum gain before the arrival of the bear market. However, the story has been very different for the cryptocurrency market so far this year, with most large-cap assets failing to enjoy the same capital rotation seen in past cycles. The latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto market, outperforming all categories of altcoins. In an April 5 post on the X platform, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost shared an interesting on-chain insight into the performance of all altcoin categories relative to the world's largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the altcoins are underperforming compared to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization growth. Typically, when the short-term moving average (30-day MA) rises faster than the long-term moving average (365-day MA), it implies rapid market cap growth. As observed in the chart above, Bitcoin is outpacing the large-cap and mid-to-small-cap altcoins in terms of their market cap growth. Darkfost noted that this difference in the growth ratio has reached a level last seen in October 2023, a period correlated with a brief altcoin rally and subsequently BTC's dominance. The analyst further highlighted that when this growth ratio turns negative, it often signals that a strong correction has occurred. Historically, a negative ratio might present a potential buying opportunity for investors looking to get into the market. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $83,500, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. This gap in performance underscores how woeful the “king of altcoins” has been in the past few months. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luckily, there are crypto detectives and blockchain sleuths who track down stolen funds and help those who suspect they've been defrauded. The business of these investigators has flourished in recent years, three of them told Business Insider, in part because scams in the crypto sphere are becoming more sophisticated and even harder for even intelligent, computer-savvy people to avoid. Losses stemming from crypto investment frauds, the most common type of crypto scam, ballooned to $3.96 billion in 2023, according to data from the FBI, up 335% in two years. Scam activity has grown an average of 24% year-over-year since the pandemic, with bad actors likely pulling in a record $12.4 billion in revenue last year, according to estimates from the analytics firm Chainalysis. Here are investigators' top tips on how you can protect yourself from crypto scammers. Powers, who worked as a PI for years prior to doing investigative work on the blockchain, thinks scams are becoming so good they're defining a new era of con-artistry. "We've moved beyond the Nigerian 419 scams where the prince was contacting you by email," Powers told BI in an interview. And it turns out that chatting online with random strangers is not necessarily a low-risk activity, especially if that seeming casual contact is actually just the tip of the spear." Pig butchering scams — one type of fraud where a scammer establishes an online relationship with someone before asking them to invest or send money — have been on the rise, with revenue from this type of fraud soaring 40% in 2024, according to Chainalysis. Joe Greenfield, the chief forensic examiner at the investigative firm Maryman, strongly urges investors not to take anything at face value. "Assume in today's day and age that everything is a fraud. Everything's a scam until you prove otherwise to yourself," Greenfield said. There's no such thing as a crypto exchange withholding your funds for tax reasons. There's also no such thing as an exchange requiring you to send in a fee in order to withdraw your money. But those are common examples of fraudulent expenses scammers come up with to extort money out of their victims, according to Kyla Curley, a partner at the professional services firm StoneTurn who frequently investigates financial fraud. Curley says she often sees clients who had been unknowingly defrauded for months, due to a scammer repeatedly making small financial asks. In pig butchering schemes, victims can also be roped into fake relationships that involve sending payments for months — or sometimes, years —before victims finally realize they've been scammed, Greenfield adds. "It can drag for some time before people realize, like, oh shoot. One nightmare scenario Greenfield frequently investigates is when investors wake up and realize that their crypto wallets have been emptied overnight. In many cases, the theft was made possible by cybersecurity weaknesses within the person's crypto storage, such as by using a cloud-based wallet, weak passwords, and setting up SMS authentication instead of an app-based verification method. For the strongest security, he recommends using a cold storage wallet, using app-based authentication on sensitive accounts when possible, and following best-practices when it comes to picking a password. Fraud victims, often strung along for months, frequently come to the realization that they've been scammed far too late. But it's most useful if people get help right away. Curley says scam victims will also need the help of an attorney or law enforcement if they hope to recover some of their funds. It's common for attorney and investigator fees to rack up in the thousands, according Powers. He added that his firm typically does not take on fraud victims who have lost less than $100,000 in crypto, which he said was in clients' financial best interests. Curley estimates that around 20% of cases she oversees will end with a client getting at least some money back. Unfortunately, Curley also expects scams to become more sophisticated and damaging over time, due to how rapidly scams evolve.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HashKey Group Chairman and CEO Xiao Feng kicked off the 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Sunday with a keynote address highlighting blockchain technology's transformative impact on global financial infrastructure. Speaking to an early morning crowd at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Xiao described blockchain as “a new generation of financial infrastructure” that fundamentally changes how financial transactions are recorded, settled and governed. “Any industrial revolution must wait for a financial revolution,” Xiao told attendees at the four-day event hosted by his company. Xiao emphasized historical parallels between technological and financial evolution: banking credit supported the British Industrial Revolution, stock markets enabled the electrical revolution in America, and venture capital fueled Silicon Valley's information revolution. The executive highlighted key differences between traditional and blockchain-based finance, including the shift from bank accounts to digital wallets and the move from batch settlement systems to instantaneous transaction completion. Xiao noted the significance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent decision not to classify dollar-backed stablecoins as securities, suggesting this allows more institutions to participate in monetary creation processes. “Traditional exchanges will eventually need to adapt to compete with cryptocurrency markets that have operated 24/7 since day one,” Xiao predicted. While mainland China maintains strict prohibitions on cryptocurrencies, analysts view Hong Kong's supportive stance as a strategic testing ground for the technology's potential. This approach effectively creates a regulatory breathing space where blockchain innovations can develop under controlled conditions, potentially informing future policies across the broader Chinese economy. The Web3 Festival continues through Wednesday with industry panels, demonstrations and networking events, bringing together blockchain developers, investors and technology enthusiasts from around the world.
