            A 17-year-old Palestinian boy died following “likely prolonged malnutrition” in an Israeli prison, according to an autopsy carried out by an Israeli pathologist.
    


            The teenager, Walid Khalid Ahmad, is the first minor to have died in Israeli custody since the conflict between Hamas and Israel started in October 2023, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Society (PPS).
    


            He died in Israel's Megiddo Prison on March 22, according to his family and a joint statement by the PPS and the Palestinian Commission of Detainees' Affairs.
    


            Ahmad was arrested on September 30 last year in his home in Silwad, a Palestinian town northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. His father Khalid said that he was detained based on alleged offenses between 2020 and 2023 that included throwing stones and Molotov cocktails.

            Walid and his family deny the accusations made against him. The PPS told CNN the teenager was not charged, and court hearings were repeatedly delayed.
    


            Five days after Ahmad died, his body was examined at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv, according to a copy of the autopsy report that his family shared with CNN.
    


            The autopsy report described signs of severe weight and muscle loss, including loss of muscle mass at the temples, a sunken appearance at the abdomen and “almost absent muscle mass or subcutaneous fat on trunk and extremities.”
    


            “Autopsy findings suggest that Walid suffered from extreme, likely prolonged malnutrition as observed by his deeply cachectic state and complaints of inadequate food intake since at least December 2024,” it said. “It needs to be noted that malnutrition increases the risk of infectious complications including severe sepsis,” it added.
    


            CNN did not receive an immediate response from the Israel security service or the Israel Defense Forces about why the teenager was arrested last September and whether he had been formally charged. The Justice Ministry referred inquiries back to the Prison Service.
    


            The PPS told CNN that Ahmad is not only the first minor to die in Israeli custody since October 2023, but also since 1967. CNN cannot verify the assertion.
    


            At least 63 Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank have so far died in Israeli detention since the start of the latest conflict, the PPS said, including at least 40 from Gaza.
    


            The Israeli Prison Service told CNN that “upon receiving the initial report on the detainee's condition, a medical team was called to the scene and responded as required.”
    


            “As in any case of the death of a prisoner, an investigative team was appointed to examine the incident. Upon completion of the investigation its findings will be forwarded to the authorized authorities,” it said.
    


            Khalid, Ahmad's father, told CNN that on September 30 last year, Israeli forces “stormed the house” at around 3:30 a.m. and arrested his son.
    


            The family was allowed to attend several court hearings in the case, which were held remotely by video conference calls, he said.
    


            Israeli authorities continue to hold Ahmad's body, Khalid told CNN.
    


            The family was informed of his death on March 24, two days after he died, Khalid said, adding that days later, he received a phone call from the medical team that conducted the autopsy, who told him “the painful truth” behind his son's death.
    


            An avid athlete, Ahmad did not suffer from any known illnesses before his detention, his father said, pointing to his treatment in custody as the cause of his son's death.
    


            “Walid was a young man with great values,” Khalid said. “What happened was unexpected.”
    


            The Commission on Detainees' Affairs and the PPS said Walid's death was “proof of the horrific level of abuse faced by detainees inside Israeli occupation prisons, including hundreds of children.”
    


            Israel has ramped up arrests in the occupied West Bank since the latest war began, PPS said, with some 15,700 arrests so far recorded by its count.

Trinity Rodman enjoyed the perfect return to the US Women's National Team (USWNT) on Saturday, scoring after just five minutes in a 2-0 victory over Brazil, her first international game since last year's Olympic gold medal match.
    


            The 22-year-old had not featured for the USWNT in almost eight months, having aggravated a long-standing back issue during a game for the Washington Spirit in September.
    


            But she looked like she had never been away on Saturday, deftly poking the ball into the bottom right corner from 10 yards out after a good run from Alyssa Thompson, before briefly pretending she had hurt her back again as part of her celebration.
    


            “The medical staff was freaking out, but I felt like I had to do it,” Rodman smiled per AP. “It felt so good to be in this atmosphere again, to be with the team. The stadium was crazy.”
    


            Manager Emma Hayes was, at least in the moment, less impressed with the prank.
    


            “I didn't think she was pretending,” she grimaced afterwards, per AP. “I will have a word with her, because that was like a ‘cry wolf' moment. I turned to the physios and said, ‘Her back's hurting,' instantly. And then I realized she was tricking us.”
    


            Rodman, an Orange County native, clearly relished the opportunity to return to international action in front of 32,303 fans in Los Angeles, in the first ever women's professional sports event held at SoFi Stadium.
    


            So too did fellow Californian Thompson who, having provided the assist for Rodman, forced goalkeeper Lorena into a smart save in the 17th minute. Ally Sentnor went even closer to doubling the advantage four minutes later when she was played in by Thompson, but she too was denied by the onrushing goalkeeper.
    


            Brazil returned for the second half with renewed impetus and hit the bar twice within six minutes of the restart – first through Ludmila, and then through Giovana Queiroz.
    


            But in the 66th minute it was the home team which claimed the decisive second goal, captain Lindsey Heaps emphatically converting from the penalty spot after Lily Yohannes had been brought down in the area by Ludmila.
    


            The 2-0 victory meant a clean sheet for debutant goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who impressed with six saves in the match.
    


            “I think it shows where this group is going,” said Heaps, per AP. “Our group is just getting better and better, and there's not massive gaps between players. These young guns coming in … it's such a cool thing for us to see.”
    


            Having played out one rematch of Paris 2024's gold medal game, both teams meet again on Tuesday, April 8, for the second match of the two-game friendly series.

Follow:


            Military families who are deployed far from their homes will see their process for voting become more complex, risking their possible disenfranchisement, with President Donald Trump's efforts to make certain election policies more stringent.
    


            Trump's new executive order — which aims to boost proof-of-citizenship requirements and to pressure states to make other changes to their election practices — comes as military voters are already caught in the middle of legal battles over Republican efforts to toss overseas ballots. A Friday court ruling, for example, has jeopardized thousands of overseas ballots cast in a North Carolina Supreme Court race last year.
    


            Trump is now seeking to unilaterally revamp election policies to bring them in line with conservative goals, signing the March executive order that tries to implement policies that Republicans have not been able to achieve legislatively or through the courts.
    


            The military vote has long been seen as sacrosanct politically, and 1986 legislation that sought to clear some obstacles service members face passed with broad bipartisan support. However, the unfounded fixation by Trump and his allies on mass election fraud has translated into efforts that could disenfranchise those serving the nation's interests abroad.

            Critics of the Trump order say members of the military stationed away from their home states may not have easy access to the types of documents the order seeks to require for registering to vote. Even if they do, finding a way to securely transmit those documents to election officials could be difficult. Additionally, Trump is targeting states' practice of counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day if properly postmarked — a practice that is extended to military and overseas voters in nearly three-dozen states.
    


            “This order just doesn't take into account our lived experiences and inadvertently creates unnecessary barriers for folks in the military or overseas,” said Sarah Streyder, a military spouse stationed in the United Kingdom and executive directive of the Secure Families Initiative, a military families organization challenging the order in court.
    


            Supporters of Trump's order say the concerns are overblown.
    


            “When you're an American abroad, you don't let your passport out of your sight,” said Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation who is a proponent of such requirements. He argued the Pentagon could also order that the military IDs distributed to service members and their families include citizenship information.
    


            The Defense Department declined to answer CNN's questions about its plans for implementing Trump's order.
    


            The White House did not respond to specific questions about the order, but in a statement, spokesperson Anna Kelly said, “President Trump cares deeply about our active duty servicemembers and their families, and he wants to ensure the right of every eligible citizen to vote while preserving election integrity.”

How we know voting systems are secure



            The key provisions of the Uniformed and Overseas Voting Act, or UOCAVA — the 1986 law that eased the process for military and overseas voters — covers both military members abroad and those stationed domestically who need to vote absentee. Not every unformed service member covered under the law would necessarily have a passport.
    


            Trump is seeking to use federal funding and other tools in his arsenal to push states toward his desired election policies. But it is local and state election officials who determine how voting works in their jurisdictions, and the complexities of that state-by-state process is in part why Congress passed the act. The military community accounted for a little less than half of the 1.2 million Americans who were registered under the law in 2020.
    


            Still, 4 out of 5 overseas Americans who did not return a ballot in 2020 said it was because they couldn't complete the process, according to survey data released by the Defense Department office that helps military families with voting.
    


            “I've never heard a single election official have anything but tremendous concern for challenges that those serving American interests overseas might be facing until recently,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department attorney who now leads the Center for Election Innovation & Research, which advises election administrators of both parties.
    


            With his lack of authority over state election registration rules, Trump's actions to bolster a proof-of-citizenship requirement are aimed at the federal forms that are widely available for Americans to use for voter registration.
    


            Trump directed the Defense Department to add a requirement for documents proving one's citizenship to the registration postcard that military families and overseas civilians can use to register. His order identifies a short list of documents that would meet the requirement but does not explicitly say that a birth certificate would be enough.
    


            Steyder, of the military families organization, says it shouldn't be assumed that military families would have an easy time getting their hands on those records, particularly given how chaotic the moving process can be for deployments. State election officials are required to honor the federal postcard application only for a calendar year, and the postcard also must be resubmitted every time the voter moves, Streyder said.
    


            In 2024, her presidential primary ballot was cast from South Korea, her regular primary ballot was cast stateside as she prepared for another move, and her general election ballot was cast from her husband's current station in the United Kingdom.
    


            “That's three different postcard applications, three different absentee ballots,” Streyder said.
    


            Overseas voters can use the registration procedures of their home states, but the postcard is supposed to serve as failsafe for those having trouble navigating the process. In 2020, 764,000 voters used the postcard to register — with one-third of those being uniformed service members. That represented a major increase in use over past elections.
    


            Even if those documents are easily at hand, how military voters can submit them to election officials presents its own challenges, since computers and scanners might not be readily accessible where they're stationed. Streyder raised concerns about security vulnerabilities for transmitting sensitive personal information — particularly for those in roles making them a target — if an overseas voter didn't have access to a trusted device.
    


            “This can't be done unless security issues are dealt with,” Becker said. “And so, if there's not a secure way to send this, it shouldn't be implemented.”
    


            The most common reason UOCAVA ballots are rejected is that they arrived after a state's deadline to be counted. Of the ballots cast by military members that were rejected in 2020, almost half were thrown out for that reason. That's despite federal law requiring election officials send out overseas absentee ballots at least 45 days before an election.
    


            Though UOCAVA doesn't require it, several states provide overseas and military voters extra time after Election Day for their mail-in ballots to arrive.
    


            The legal challengers to Trump's order accuse him of putting those ballots at risk as well.
    


            The president exempts UOCAVA ballots from his instruction that the US Election Assistance Commission withhold federal funding from states that count mail-in ballots received after Election Day. But no such exemption exists in a separate, ambiguously worded directive that the attorney general “shall take all necessary action to enforce” an Election Day receipt deadline for mail-in ballots to be counted.
    


            Regardless, von Spakovsky argued the 45 days that UOCAVA provides before Election Day is enough time.
    


            But Streyder said that given the lengthy international mail times, even a highly proactive overseas voter who returns their ballot as soon as they receive it may not see that ballot make it back by Election Day.
    


            Given the limited time absentee military voters already have to make sure their mail-in ballots make it back in time, they “do not have as much time to be maximally deliberative and thoughtful and researched,” particularly when developments in the final weeks of the campaign could change their vote.
    


            “And we have the audacity to believe that that's not fair either,” she said.

Follow:


            For weeks, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites, with President Trump vowing to use “overwhelming force” until the US achieves its goal of stopping the Houthis from targeting shipping in the Red Sea.
    


            The Houthis began the campaign in solidarity with Palestinians when Israel went to war in Gaza in October 2023. The group has carried out more than 100 attacks and have sunk two vessels. The result: 70% of merchant shipping that once transited the Red Sea now takes the long route around southern Africa.
    


            The US says the campaign is working. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said that multiple Houthi leaders had been killed.
    


            But every round of strikes provokes more defiance.
    


            The Houthis are what one veteran Yemen-watcher calls the honey badgers of resistance, referring to the belligerent mammal known for its fearless attitude toward predators. Bitten by a cobra, they get up minutes later and attack the snake.

Cost of US military offensive against Houthis nears $1 billion with limited impact



            While as many as 80 Houthi military officers may have been killed, according to analysts, the senior echelon of its military and political leadership appears intact. So are at least some of its missile-launching sites. Since mid-March, the Houthis have launched a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US navy ships. While none caused major damage, the threat remains.
    


            CNN reported on Friday that the total cost of the US military's operation against the Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen is nearing $1 billion in just under three weeks, according to three people briefed on the campaign, but the attacks had so far had limited impact on destroying the group's capabilities.
    


            “We are burning through readiness — munitions, fuel, deployment time,” said one official.



            Far from being cowed, the Houthis have threatened to extend their range of targets to the UAE, which backs the rival government to the Houthis in Yemen's Civil War. Similarly, Saudi officials say the Kingdom's air defenses are on high alert.
    


            “The dozens of airstrikes on Yemen will not deter the Yemeni Armed Forces from fulfilling their religious, moral, and humanitarian duties,” said a Houthi spokesman earlier this week.
    


            There's no doubt that the US campaign has degraded the Houthis' capabilities. Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, says he suspects the Houthis “have lost a lot of drone manufacturing capability, and there does seem to be more effective interdiction of resupply shipments coming via the sea and via Oman. So the Houthis are not comfortable.”

            But history shows that the Houthis have an extraordinarily high tolerance for pain. And the Trump administration's determination to eradicate the threat they pose may ultimately require a ground offensive.
    


            “The Houthis are just inured to being at war with a first world military,” Knights says.“They're ideological, but they're also very tough tribal fighters from northern Yemen.”
    


            The Houthis' ability to survive is helped by an elaborate smuggling network that brings in missile parts and other equipment.  Last year, hidden among cargo on one intercepted ship, air frames and fins for artillery rockets, small turbojet engines and hydrogen fuel cells were discovered, according to an investigation by Conflict Armament Research (CAR).
    


            Such equipment could enable Houthi UAVs to carry larger payloads and to travel for far longer periods. That would “greatly extend the potential threat posed by the Houthis,” CAR reported.
    


            The Houthis survived several offensives during the long presidency of Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, then a Saudi offensive ten years ago, followed by more recent Israeli, UK and US airstrikes.
    


            Ahmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, says Israel and western powers lack a deep understanding of the Houthis. “Their opaque leadership and internal structure have created persistent gaps in intelligence.”
    


            Another Yemen expert, Elisabeth Kendall, questions the endgame of the US campaign. “The Houthis have been bombed tens of thousands of times over the past decade and remain undeterred. So one is left thinking that the bombing is largely performative: let's show the world - we'll do it because we can.”

Dozens reported killed after Trump orders ‘decisive' strikes against Yemen's Houthis



            Coercing the Houthis, Knights told CNN, is “really, really difficult.”
    


            “They are an extremely aggressive movement. The best way to end them permanently is to overthrow them, remove them from the capital, remove them from the Red Sea coast.”
    


            Regional diplomatic sources, as well as analysts, say that ultimately only a ground offensive can dislodge the Houthis, who currently control the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, its major port, Hodeidah, and much of northern Yemen.
    


            Ahmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, says the US is wrong to believe that airstrikes can compel the Houthis to back down. “This approach failed under the Biden administration and is unlikely to succeed under the Trump administration.”
    


            “Their logic is shaped by years of war; they see resilience as a form of strength and are driven to prove they are not easily deterred.”
    


            “The only times I've ever seen the Houthis go to the negotiating table or compromise has been when they've been threatened with the realistic prospect of defeat on the ground: territorial loss, loss of control of populations and loss of access to the Red Sea coastline,” said Knights.
    


            That briefly happened in 2017 when forces backed by the United Arab Emirates threatened Houthi access to the Red Sea, critical for the Houthis' revenue and military supplies.
    


            The Houthis, if anything, may actually be relishing US strikes. They are a “direct answer to the Houthi prayers to have a war with the US,” said Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at Chatham House. The group “wants to drag the US into a larger regional escalation.”
    


            The Houthis are fighting for control of Yemen against the internationally recognized government that controls part of the south and is supported mainly by the UAE. The unanswered question is whether forces loyal to that government can take the fight to the Houthis. “They're already trained and equipped,” says Knights. But there are doubts about their unity.
    


            Analysts do not expect the US to put any troops on the ground, beyond a handful of special forces to help direct airstrikes. The US would perhaps provide [Yemeni forces] “with a bit of logistics, certain key munitions,” Knights says.
    


            The UAE would be “quietly supportive” as it has long supplied the Aden-based government, he adds.
    


            The Saudi perspective is less clear. Knights believes Riyadh is apprehensive about the Houthis retaliating with long-range drones and missiles against its infrastructure. But the US has accelerated deliveries of anti-missile defenses to Saudi Arabia in recent months.
    


            The US will have to say to Riyadh: “We are going to protect you in the same way that we protected Israel in 2024 from the two rounds of Iranian strikes,” says Knights.
    


            Regional diplomatic sources say preparations are underway for a ground operation that would be launched from the south and east, as well as along the coast. A coordinated offensive could also involve Saudi and US naval support in an attempt to retake the port of Hodeidah.
    


            “Whether such an operation is feasible remains unclear, as the past decade has shown mixed outcomes, successes in some areas and failures in others,” Nagi told CNN.
    


            From day one, President Trump and other US officials have linked the campaign against the Houthis to Iran. Trump said he would hold Iran responsible for “every shot” fired by Houthi rebels and it would face “dire” consequences for any attacks by the Yemeni militants.
    


            So far it hasn't, and it's unclear whether Tehran can simply order the Houthis to stop firing. While very much part of Iran's axis of resistance, the Houthis retain considerable autonomy.
    


            Trump continues to warn Iran that it will face a massive bombing campaign if it doesn't do a deal to limit its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. For the administration, the Houthi campaign and the “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran are two sides of the same coin.
    


            The Iranians are treading carefully, offering moral support to their ally in Yemen. Former Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezaee hailed “the barefooted resistance forces of Yemen, who will bring advanced American warships to their knees.”
    


            But the Iranian leadership does not want to be seen providing further military support for the Houthis right now as it tries to work out Trump's mixture of small carrot and large stick.
    


            The US appears ready to expand its campaign. B-2 bombers and KC-135 refuelling planes have arrived on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. That may presage strikes on hardened targets in Yemen but may equally be a signal to Iran.
    


            The next few weeks may be a crucial test of the honey badgers' resilience.

US gamer Ludwig Ahgren tries to find out","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/05/travel/gamer-ludwig-ahgren-travel-japan-no-smartphone-map-intl-hnk/index.html","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 01:02:00 GMT","

            No map. No smartphones. No expressways. Just two motorbikes and some basic Japanese.
    


            These are the rules American game streamer Ludwig Ahgren and his YouTuber buddy Michael Reeves have imposed on themselves as they embark on a journey to traverse Japan on motorbikes.
    


            The friends ditched the smartphones that are a staple of their generation and set off without so much as a guidebook.
    


            That left them no option but to mingle with locals to get directions, sparking encounters that have unlocked a full display of friendliness from Japanese people.
    


            The journey from Cape Sata at the southern tip of Kyushu to Cape Soya, the northernmost point of Hokkaido, is about 2,000 miles – or it would be, if they hadn't gotten lost already.
    


            It took them two weeks to complete the trip, according to a finale video posted Saturday on Ahgren's YouTube channel. A team had been responsible for tracking the pair and uploading videos of the journey since they hit the road two weeks ago, enjoying some of Japan's most unique scenery, culture and cuisine along the way.
    


            It was no easy quest, acknowledged Ahgren, one of the world's most successful game streamers with 6.7 million subscribers on YouTube. “We are doing this the hard way,” he quipped in a video before hopping on his motorbike.
    


            “I've realized I have become addicted to this thing,” he said in the video, referring to his smartphone. “But now, I can't use it to go on Yelp to find the best place to eat, Google Maps to figure out how to get there, Google Translate to figure out what to order when I get there.”
    


            CNN reached out to the pair during their trip but did not hear back – probably a sign they didn't have their smartphone on.
    


            They cruised through the bustling capital Tokyo, the tree-blanketed countryside of Miyazaki, fed crackers to deer in Nara, and caught a glimpse of cherry blossoms in Shizuoka – where they also ate a picnic against the backdrop of Mount Fuji.
    


            Throughout their journey, they sampled an abundance of Japanese food from udon noodles to okonomiyaki, a savory pancake dish from Osaka. When they fell behind schedule, they grabbed quick bites from Japan's ubiquitous convenience stores or cup noodles from vending machines.
    


            But the journey was not without its setbacks.
    


            With no map, they mistook Miyazaki in southeastern Kyushu for Shikoku, Japan's fourth-biggest island, which is linked by bridges to the country's major island. They turned up in the city, only to find they could not be more lost.
    


            The pair also hoped to check out a sumo wrestling match. They decided to park the bikes and travel by public transport but, without a smartphone, it took them three hours to navigate Japan's notoriously headache-triggering train system.
    


            When they eventually arrived at Osaka's Edion Arena, they saw a sign, written in English. “Tickets sold out,” it said.
    


            Ahgren initially relied on instinct to guess what Japanese people were saying, according to his YouTube videos. Locals went out of their way to help, doing everything they could to overcome the language barrier.
    


            “Ichiban” – meaning “number one” or “the best” – became Ahgren's favorite Japanese word when he asked for hotel and restaurant recommendations, and “nan-jikan” – “how many hours?” – when he needed information about his journey.
    


            One man bought the pair coffee at a convenience store before giving them directions with his car. And a woman tried to explain to them that the nearest hotel was next to a sports ground by gesturing a baseball swing.
    


            But by day eight, Ahgren was touting how staff at a restaurant complimented him on his language skills with “nihongo jouzu” – “good Japanese.”
    


            “They freaking said it,” he said proudly in a video.

            Ahgren and Reeves' style of travel strikes a stark contrast to a group of influencers who previously raised eyebrows in the country for their disruptive stunts.
    


            Jeffrey Hall, special lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan, said there has been rising sentiment in the country against misbehaving tourists – including social media influencers – as the number of visitors hit a record high.
    


            “There is a phenomenon of people who come here to make content that is provocative and annoying to other people around them… That particular type of nuisance YouTuber or nuisance influencer have really damaged the image of foreign influencers in general,” he said.
    


            They included American live-streamer Ramsey Khalid Ismael, better known by his online alias “Johnny Somali,” who was arrested in late 2023 for breaking into a construction site in Osaka. He also sparked outrage by posting videos of himself taunting commuters about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

            That year, a railway company also launched a probe against four popular YouTubers over their stunt to evade fares on public transport, according to local media.
    


            But Ahgren and Reeves' trip had spotlighted parts of Japan less well known by international tourists, and their use of simple Japanese would be appreciated by locals, Hall said.
    


            Ahgren, who often points the camera away when talking to people, is different from the “nuisance travelers,” as he shows better understanding of social norms, one of which is not to film people without their permission, he added.
    


            “That's something that a lot of American streamers do without even thinking of the consequences, but in Japan people value their privacy very much,” he said.

Follow:


            A video has emerged showing the final moments of more than a dozen Palestinian emergency workers shot dead by Israeli troops in Gaza last month, casting doubt on Israeli claims that soldiers opened fire on vehicles “advancing suspiciously.”
    


            The video is filmed from the front of a vehicle and shows a convoy of clearly marked ambulances moving along a road at dawn, with headlights and flashing emergency lights on.
    


            The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says the video was found on the phone of one of the 15 ambulance and relief team members killed by the Israeli military.
    


            Their bodies were found in a mass grave more than a week after they were reported as missing. Eight of the 14 bodies recovered from the site in the southern Rafah area were identified as members of the PRCS, five as civil defense, and one as a UN agency employee, PRCS said in a statement.
    


            The deaths sparked international condemnation, and the footage appears to contradict the assertion by the Israeli military that some vehicles were moving suspiciously without lights.

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) asserted last week that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals. IDF troops then opened fire at the suspected vehicles.”
    


            After the video emerged, the IDF repeated that the incident was being investigated – the first results of which were presented internally on Sunday.
    


            “All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation,” it said Saturday.
    


            The video shows the convoy stopping when it comes across another vehicle at the side of the road –  which the PRCS says was an ambulance that had been sent earlier to help injured civilians. Two of the rescuers who get out of the vehicles are wearing uniforms. A fire truck and an ambulance at the scene are marked with the PRCS insignia.
    


            Almost immediately there is intense gunfire, which can be heard hitting the convoy. The video ends, but the audio continues for five minutes.
    


            The paramedic filming, identified by the PRCS as Rifaat Radwan, is heard repeatedly saying the “shahada,” which Muslims recite when facing death. He asks God for forgiveness and says he knows he is going to die.
    


            At one point he says: “Forgive me mom, this is the path I chose – to help people – I swear I didn't choose this path but to help people.”
    


            The voices of others in the convoy can also be heard, as well as those of people shouting commands in Hebrew. It's not clear who they are or what they are saying.
    


            The IDF said the findings of the investigation were presented to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir on Sunday.
    


            The investigation includes information from Israeli aerial surveillance video that has not been made public, an Israeli military official told CNN previously.
    


            Asor began re-investigating the incident after footage emerged contradicting IDF soldiers' description of the vehicles as moving with their lights off, the Israeli military official said. That information came directly from IDF soldiers involved in the attack, who initially testified that the ambulances had their lights off, the official said.
    


            According to the military official, troops from the Golani infantry brigade had set up an ambush along a road in the early hours of March 23. Around 4:30 a.m., they opened fire on a first vehicle, killing two individuals and detaining another who the IDF claims were Hamas internal security officials. Roughly two hours later, at approximately 6 a.m., the ambulance convoy arrived in the area.
    


            Soldiers were told by drone operators that the vehicles were advancing “in a suspicious manner,” the military official said, adding that soldiers involved in the attack claimed to investigators that they opened fire after being surprised by the convoy stopping on the side of the road and by individuals getting out of their vehicles quickly.
    


            After seeing the bodies of more than a dozen uniformed emergency responders on the ground, the troops said they still believed they had successfully carried out the attack following efforts to verify the identities of some of the deceased, the military official said.
    


            The Israeli military has yet to provide any evidence for its claim that nine of the emergency workers killed were militants.
    


            The IDF said on April 1 that “following an initial assessment, it was determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.” The IDF did not offer proof of the identity of the alleged terrorists.
    


            CNN has obtained from the PRCS the names of 14 of those killed; none is identified as Mohammad Shubaki. The PRCS said the name of the fifteenth man killed – an UNRWA employee – was withheld out of respect for his family but was not the name given by the Israeli military.
    


            An Israeli military official told CNN last week that Israeli forces buried the bodies of the workers because they expected it would take time to coordinate their retrieval with the PRCS and the United Nations. Israeli officials have not explained why their emergency vehicles were also buried, citing the ongoing investigation.
    


            Satellite imagery from March 23, first published by Al Jazeera Arabic and analyzed by CNN, shows Israeli army vehicles surrounding a cluster of five ambulances from the PRCS and Civil Defense.
    


            Another satellite image, also published by Al Jazeera and analyzed by CNN, dated March 25, shows an Israeli tank, an excavator, and other military vehicles at the same location.
    


            Where the ambulances once stood, remnants of vehicles protruded from disturbed ground.

This Sunday, Margarita Simonyan, the Editor-in-Chief of RT and Sputnik, celebrated her 45th birthday. Numerous Russian officials extended their best wishes, emphasizing her role in promoting Russia's position amid pressure from the West.

Alexandr Bastrykin, head of the country's Investigative Committee, praised Simonyan's unwavering confidence, principled stance, and high competence, stating, “These qualities enable Margarita Simonyan and her team to strengthen the authority of Russian media on the international stage, earning the trust of millions of viewers and readers around the world.”

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed appreciation for her efforts to bolster Russia's position in the global information space, highlighting her work “aimed at providing impartial coverage of internationally significant events.”

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, also sent a congratulatory message. “As a talented leader, you have managed to create extensive media platforms that impartially cover major events both in our homeland and abroad, helping to communicate Russia's position to the global community and fostering international dialogue amid total ideological pressure on our country,” he said. The Patriarch also awarded Simonyan the Order of Saint Equal-to-the-Apostles Princess Olga. The honor is given to women for their achievements in the areas of church, state, and public service.

Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev praised Simonyan for repelling “external information threats.” The ministry spokeswoman Irina Volk, ‘A Just Russia – For Truth' party leader Sergey Mironov, and the ‘Eurasia' autonomous non-profit organization also sent their congratulations.

Simonyan expressed gratitude for all the well wishes and promised to try to “correspond” to the image painted by the messages.

RT has faced unparalleled levels of scrutiny and limitations imposed by Western nations in recent years. Actions directed against the broadcaster have escalated since 2022. Simonyan and three other senior RT employees were sanctioned by the US in September, while head of the State Department's now-closed Global Engagement Center (GEC), James Rubin, claimed that the “broad scope and reach” of RT was one of the reasons many countries around the world did not support Ukraine.

Referring to aggressive Western attacks on Russian media and RT in particular, Simonyan previously stated that “Russia has a stable position in the international information space. And it is improving despite all their counteractions.”

Iran will not bow to the pressure of foreign nations and is ready to respond to any kind of aggression, Major General Hossein Salami, chief commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has said.

Speaking during a meeting with senior IRGC commanders on Saturday, Salami said that Iran is “absolutely not concerned about a war. We will not initiate a war but are ready for any war.” He added that Iran has developed strategies to overcome any adversary and to repel psychological operations and direct military attacks alike. “However, we will not take a single step back in the face of the enemy,” Salami stressed.

He noted that an Israeli attack on Tehran's consulate in Syria in April 2024, which left several senior Iranian military officers dead, marked the beginning of “a global confrontation” in the Middle East.

According to Salami, the Iranian retaliatory strike, which involved hundreds of missiles and drones, managed to overcome what he called “the most fortified airspace in history.” “Our missiles penetrated their illusions of security,” the general said, referring to Israel.

West Jerusalem, however, said at the time that the raid only resulted in minor damage to some of its military installations.Salami noted that Israel is still vulnerable to Iran's military capabilities. “We have acquired the knowhow and formulas to overcome this enemy and have incorporated them into all elements of our weaponry and equipment,” he remarked.

The general's comments come as the conflict in Gaza rages on and amid continued between the US and Iran. In late March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Washington could “take action” to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. “We have the ability to do that and to go further, perhaps even threaten the regime,” he said.

At the same time, the US urged Iran to renew talks over restoring the 2015 nuclear deal that Washington unilaterally withdrew from three years afterward. Trump claimed in his first administration that it did little to deter Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program serves only peaceful purposes.

Recession fears are mounting, and anxiety is high – but the president remains unmoved by criticism of his trade plans

Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, Americans have grown used to high drama and rapid-fire headlines, as executive orders from the Oval Office have reshaped the US, from stripping back LGBTQ rights to gutting environmental regulations amid a sense that America is slipping into authoritarianism.

But even against that backdrop, last week stood out, as Trump launched a fierce global trade war, imposed tariffs on its trading partners and triggered a global market meltdown, including on Trump's own cherished Wall Street, where hundreds of billions of dollars of stock values evaporated.

Now, with all eyes nervously on Monday's markets amid fears that the calamitous drops will continue, recession fears are mounting in America. JP Morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60% and Americans are bracing for a return of inflation – the thing that above all else likely doomed Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.

But Trump remained unmoved by market drops and the global political condemnation – and even rare criticism from his own Republican party – saying now is a “great time to get rich” and that “China played it wrong – they panicked”.

On the streets of New York too, there was panic among some. In Washington Square Park, two sisters from Detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. Kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made.

“I want to be optimistic, but I live under an umbrella of worry with this administration,” Kathleen said. “I worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan.”

Her sister, Elizabeth, said she'd grown so anxious she'd stepped back from the news. “Our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety over this past week over her investments. She worked hard for those and she lives on them – a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much impacts her day-to-day feeling of security.”

But Leo Ezekiel, 39, had a different perspective. As a financier, he wasn't so worried about the stock markets. “It's mostly that big corporations are deciding to sell off, and that will affect people, but in the long run, if stocks go down, it gives room for them to move up. It's part of the game – and it's always been like that in the United States.”

Trump made his move because he dreams of a return of American manufacturing might, convinced that tariffs will force factories home to the US, even though almost all economists think that is highly unlikely.

Yet, for such a momentous decision which has rattled the entire world economy, Trump reportedly only made up his mind at the last minute. According to the Washington Post, Trump didn't arrive on an exact plan until just three hours before the Rose Garden announcement.

The “liberation day” announcement from the White House was a choreographed event, and his speech drew cheers from audience, largely made up cabinet members and blue-collar workers from manufacturing sectors that have for decades been economically pummeled by foreign competition. He offered up a vision that tariffs would bring back an older American economy, reopening factories and returning prosperity to ordinary workers.

“Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,” Trump complained “But it is not going to happen any more.”

Vice-President JD Vance said: “We've seen closing factories, we've seen rising inflation. We've seen the cost of housing so high that most Americans can't afford to buy a home right now,” Vance said. “President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction.”

America's largest trading partners, Mexico, Canada, China, Germany, and Japan, were less enthusiastic, to say the least. China has announced retaliatory duties of 34%; the Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced a limited set of counter-measures and called the US moves a “tragedy” for 80 years of “free and open exchange of goods and services”, led by the US.

The British PM Keir Starmer said nothing would be “off the table” when it came to the UK's response to the tariffs – the UK imports $76.2bn in US services – but that “just as with defence and security” the world was “entering a new era” in economy and trade.

It is one where answers to even the most basic questions remain unknown. Will Trump's tariffs on US trade partners go down as an act of economic self-sabotage? Or are tariffs merely a negotiating ploy to influence other nations – war by other means? Or is Trump finally getting to express his long-held economic view that the US has been making bad deals for decades?

The next few months may provide some clues. But, in an effort to get ahead of the US tariffs coming into effect next week, some effects were already being felt. The cost of flying goods into the US from China are reported to have risen 40% in four weeks. One car factory in Canada has already shuttered.

On Friday, Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, warned that Trump risked stoking even higher inflation and slower growth. “It is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” he said. “The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.”

As the financial markets continued to convulse on Friday, the Washington Post reported that Trump is unbowed by negative headlines, criticism from foreign leaders, and was determined to listen to a single voice to secure what he views as his political legacy. That voice was of course his own.

“He's at the peak of just not giving a fuck any more,” a White House official with knowledge of Trump's thinking told the newspaper. “Bad news stories? Doesn't give a fuck. He's going to do what he's going to do. He's going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail.”

But even some former Trump economic officials privately expressed doubts that returning the US to an era of manufacturing self-sufficiency was likely impossible.

The author Michael Wolff, who has published four books about Trump in power, says the US president will now be keenly gauging how his interruption into global trade norms is going down, with updates and live-action replays provided by aides. Trump, Wolff says, is likely caught between two opposing instincts.

“It's great for him – he's dominating the news once again. Nobody is talking about anything else except tariffs. Suddenly, tariffs, an arcane piece of trade policy, are the most dramatic thing in the world that he's imbued with reality-show stuff. He'll be really pleased with that.”

But on the other hand, Wolff predicts, Trump will be watching the financial markets. “He'll have the business guys calling up saying: what the fuck are you doing? I'm sure he hasn't come to any conclusion. So on the one hand it's great – he's the world's leading guy again. On the other, it might collapse in on him.”

And that, he adds, is the essence of Trump. “He's fundamentally self-destructive, but that self-destructive impulse is exactly what keeps him at the forefront of the news.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Kevin Hassett claims tariffs will not have a big effect on US consumers and there will be no ‘political coercion' over interest rates

Starmer orders economic reset amid Trump's tariff mayhem

More than 50 countries have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks, the US national economic council director Kevin Hassett has told ABC News' This Week programme. He said:

I got a report from the USTR last night (the office of the US trade representative) that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation.

But they are doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff.

And so I don't think you will see a big effect on the consumer in the US because I do think that the reason why we have a persistent, long run trade deficit is these people have very inelastic supply.

They have been dumping goods into the country in order to create jobs say in China.

Hasset denied that the tariffs were part of a strategy by Trump to crash financial markets to pressure the US federal reserve to cut interest rates, insisting there were would be no “political coercion” of the central bank.

As we have been reporting throughout the day, goods imported from dozens of countries and territories are now going to be taxed at sharply higher rates, and that is expected to drive up the costs of everything from cars to clothes to computers.

These tariffs – which can run as high as 50% - are meant to punish countries for trade barriers that Trump says unfairly limit US exports and cause it to run huge trade deficits.

It is unclear whether the tariffs will be long lasting or if Washington will lower or drop them in response to other countries negotiating to reduce their own tariffs and other trade barriers.

US retail giants predicted that prices were “highly likely” to start rising for US almost immediately after a 25% duty came into effect on exports from Mexico to the US.

Americans have been warned to brace for higher prices more generally too, with households fearing a recession in the future and higher inflation because of tariffs.

Trump's team has said any short term shock to the economy will be worth the net positives of the tariffs, which the US president claims will help bring manufacturing back to the states and boost tax revenues.

In response to whether the market disruption was always part of the plan by Donald Trump's administration, treasury secretary Scott Bessent told NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday:

“Look, the markets are organic animals. And you never know what the reaction is going to be. One thing that I can tell you, as the treasury secretary, what I've been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday.

And everything is working very smoothly so the American people, they can take great comfort in that. And in terms of the market reaction, look, we get these short-term market reactions from time to time. The market consistently underestimates Donald Trump.

I remember that in 2016, the night President Trump won, the market crashed. And it turned out he was going to be the most pro-business president in over a century, maybe in the history of the country. And we went on to very high after-inflation returns for the next four years.”

Donald Trump's 10% tariff on all imports from many countries, including the UK, has come into force after 48 hours of turmoil.

The Guardian's Aneesa Ahmed and Reuters reports:

US customs agents began collecting the unilateral tariff at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses on Saturday, with higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners due to start next week – including from the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate.

Trump's sweeping changes have roiled global markets, with China, hardest hit by the tariffs, announcing a slew of countermeasures, including extra levies of 34% on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earth minerals.

“The market has spoken,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday.

Despite the turmoil, Trump has continued to champion his “liberation day” tariffs.

The European Union is prepared to defend its interests with proportionate countermeasures against US president Donald Trump's tariffs and will work with partners towards this end, Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday after a telephone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer.

Von der Leyen also said the 27-country bloc is committed to working closely with Britain on security and defence and that she was concerned about Russia's stalling of peace efforts in Ukraine.

She will meet Starmer in London on April 24 on the occasion of the International Summit on the Future of Energy Security.

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump will remain “for days and weeks.”

Speaking to CBS News's Face the Nation, Lutnick said:

“There's no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks.”

He also said that some barren islands including the Heard and McDonald Islands which have also been hit by Trump's tariffs and are mosly populated by penguins were also included on the list so countries could not use them as a loophole.

“What happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America, go through those countries to us,” he said.

The EU is prepared to defend its interests with proportionate countermeasures against Trump's tariffs, the bloc's commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday after a telephone call with Keir Starmer, the UK's prime minister.

Here is part of the readout of the call:

The President expressed her deep concern over the tariffs announced by President Trump on 2 April and the harm they pose to all countries—both through their direct and indirect effects, including on the world's poorest nations.

Recognising that the tariffs represent a major turning point for the United States, she reaffirmed the EU's commitment to engaging in negotiations with the US, while making clear that the EU stands ready to defend its interests through proportionate countermeasures if necessary.

At the same time, she emphasised her determination to work with partners in responding to this new reality for the global economy, acknowledging that each trading partner will act in accordance with its own priorities.

Trump last week put the EU into a group of 60 countries subject to higher so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. He is imposing a 20 percent tariff on EU goods coming into the US.

Von der Leyen has said the EU has a “strong plan” to retaliate against the steep levies but would prefer to negotiate.

As my colleague Jennifer Rankin notes in this story, EU officials have not ruled out retaliatory measures on US services, such as suspending intellectual property rights. In theory, retaliation could target US tech companies, banks and financial service providers.

My colleague Edward Helmore has written a story about how recession fears are mounting in America in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement last week. Here is an extract from his piece:

JP Morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60% and Americans are bracing for a return of inflation – the thing that above all else likely doomed Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden…

On the streets of New York there was panic among some. In Washington Square Park, two sisters from Detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. Kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made.

“I want to be optimistic, but I live under an umbrella of worry with this administration,” Kathleen said. “I worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan.”

Her sister, Elizabeth, said she'd grown so anxious she'd stepped back from the news. “Our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety over this past week over her investments. She worked hard for those and she lives on them – a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much impacts her day-to-day feeling of security.”

More than 50 countries have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks, the US national economic council director Kevin Hassett has told ABC News' This Week programme. He said:

I got a report from the USTR last night (the office of the US trade representative) that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation.

But they are doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff.

And so I don't think you will see a big effect on the consumer in the US because I do think that the reason why we have a persistent, long run trade deficit is these people have very inelastic supply.

They have been dumping goods into the country in order to create jobs say in China.

Hasset denied that the tariffs were part of a strategy by Trump to crash financial markets to pressure the US federal reserve to cut interest rates, insisting there were would be no “political coercion” of the central bank.

As we have been reporting throughout the day, goods imported from dozens of countries and territories are now going to be taxed at sharply higher rates, and that is expected to drive up the costs of everything from cars to clothes to computers.

These tariffs – which can run as high as 50% - are meant to punish countries for trade barriers that Trump says unfairly limit US exports and cause it to run huge trade deficits.

It is unclear whether the tariffs will be long lasting or if Washington will lower or drop them in response to other countries negotiating to reduce their own tariffs and other trade barriers.

US retail giants predicted that prices were “highly likely” to start rising for US almost immediately after a 25% duty came into effect on exports from Mexico to the US.

Americans have been warned to brace for higher prices more generally too, with households fearing a recession in the future and higher inflation because of tariffs.

Trump's team has said any short term shock to the economy will be worth the net positives of the tariffs, which the US president claims will help bring manufacturing back to the states and boost tax revenues.

Donald Trump's 10% tariff on all imports from many countries, including the UK, has come into force. It will likely push up prices for consumers around the world. Some countries are facing additional levies on imports.

Some of the highest tariffs will be put on imports from Asian countries, including China, India, South Korea and Japan. EU exports will also have a 20% tariff.

World leaders are mulling over how best to respond to the sweeping tariffs, which risk sparking a global trade war and recession.

Indonesia and Taiwan said on Sunday they won't impose retaliatory tariffs while Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is heading to Washington to meet Trump to try to get the president to lower his levies.

Vietnam's leader has reportedly requested a delay of “at least 45 days” to tariffs due to be imposed on Wednesday (Trump has slapped a 46% duty on Vietnamese goods coming into the US – the sixth-highest rate announced last week).

India also does not plan to retaliate against Trump's 26% tariff on its exports into the US, according to reports.

The EU is likely to approve its first set of targeted countermeasures on up to $28bn (£21.7bn; €25bn) of US imports in the coming days.

In the UK, which has been hit by Trump's 10% “baseline” tariff, Keir Starmer said he's ready to use industrial policy to “shelter British business from the storm”. “Old assumptions can no longer be taken for granted. The world as we knew it has gone. We must rise to meet the moment,” the prime minister said. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the era of globalisation as we knew it has “come to an end” in the wake of the new tariffs.

Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, has warned that his fellow Republicans risk a “bloodbath” in the 2026 midterm elections if Donald Trump's “liberation day” tariffs cause a recession.

Cruz also warned that the president's tariffs, if they stay in place for long and are met by global retaliation on American goods, could trigger a full-blown trade war that “would destroy jobs here at home, and do real damage to the US economy”.

“A hundred years ago, the US economy didn't have the leverage to have the kind of impact we do now. But I worry, there are voices within the administration that want to see these tariffs continue for ever and ever,” he added.

The Texan's comments, made on his Verdict podcast on Friday, were a further sign that the imposition of global “reciprocal” duties on imported goods is causing unease among Republicans.

The Republican US senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa introduced bipartisan legislation on Thursday to grant Congress more power over placing tariffs on US trading nations. The bill, co-sponsored by the Democratic senator Maria Cantwell, would “reaffirm” the role of Congress in setting and approving trade policy.

Crowds of people angry about the way Donald Trump is running the US rallied in scores of American cities on Saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement.

The so-called “Hands Off!” demonstrations were held in more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists.

Demonstrators voiced anger over the administration's moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close social security administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs.

Coming days after Trump's tariff announcement, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in the European capital cities of London, Paris and Berlin, with many protestors there also expressing anger over the president's new trade policies. Here are some pictures of the demonstrations:

India does not plan to retaliate against Donald Trump's 26% tariff on its exports into the US, an Indian government official told Reuters, citing ongoing talks for a deal between the countries.

Narendra Modi's administration has looked into a clause of Trump's tariff order that offers a possible reprieve for trading partners who “take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements”, said the official, who declined to be named as the details of the talks are confidential.

New Delhi sees an advantage in being one of the first nations to have started talks over a trade deal with Washington, and is better placed than Asian peers like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which have been hit by higher US tariffs, a second government official told the news wire, also declining to be named.

While the US appears set to avoid reciprocal tariffs from India, Taiwan and Indonesia the response from the European Union could be very different as it discusses imposing extra duties on US goods this week. China has already imposed 34% retaliatory tariffs.

One of the most wilfully destructive aspects of Donald Trump's shock and awe trade policy is the imposition of punitive tariffs on developing countries across Asia, including rates of 49% for Cambodia, 37% for Bangladesh, 48% for Laos.

For decades Washington had championed economic development through trade. Now, at the same time as slashing overseas aid budgets and retreating from its role in supporting developing nations, it is ripping up that idea entirely.

In its place, Trump intends to impose his will on the US's trading partners. Some are all but powerless to exact concessions, given their small size, and dependence on the mighty American market.

Alice Oyaro, the chief executive at the charity Transform Trade, which works with producers in some of the worst-hit countries, says: “Our biggest concern is that the additional costs are pushed down to those in the supply chain who are least able to pay. Small farmers exporting everything from green beans to cocoa, and women workers in Bangladeshi factories are already finding it hard to make ends meet. They will see their incomes squeezed even more.”

Vietnam's leader has requested a delay of “at least 45 days” to tariffs due to be imposed by the United States on 9 April, according to a copy of a signed letter seen by Agence France-Presse, the wire service reported on Sunday.

The south-east Asian nation is facing 46% US tariffs, one of the highest levels imposed by Donald Trump.

To Lam called on Trump in the letter to assign a representative to work with Vietnam's deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, on resolving the issue, adding that he hoped to meet Trump personally in Washington at the end of May.

Taiwan's president has now said there are no plans for reciprocal trade tariffs against the US.

Reuters reports that the 32% tariffs on Taiwanese goods announced by Donald Trump do not apply to semiconductors, a major export for the country.

Meeting executives from small and medium-sized companies at his residence, the president, Lai Ching-te, said given Taiwan's dependence on trade the economy would inevitably have a hard time dealing with the tariffs, but that he thought the impact could be minimised.

“In the face of the US ‘reciprocal tariffs', Taiwan has no plans to take tariff retaliation, and there will be no change in the investment commitments of enterprises to the United States as long as they are in the national interest,” he said, in comments provided by his office.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, last month announced an additional $100bn investment in the US.

Taiwan will now work to remove trade barriers and have other companies gradually increase their US investments. “In the future, in addition to TSMC's increased investment, other industries, such as electronics, information and communications, petrochemicals, and natural gas will be able to increase investment in the US and deepen Taiwan-US industrial cooperation,” Lai said.

As we mentioned in an earlier post, Taiwan, for whom the US is the island's most important international backer in the face of mounting Chinese pressure over Beijing's sovereignty claims, has not announced any retaliatory tariffs.

But the country's president, Lai Ching-te, said his government will remove trade barriers and Taiwanese companies will gradually increase their domestic investments. We will give you more information on this as we get it.

Taiwan, which faces a new 32% tariff rate from the US, has already announced T$88bn ($2.67bn; £2.1bn) in assistance for affected companies.

Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the US. Taiwanese officials have repeatedly said trade with America has been skewed by strong demand for Taiwanese technology products, such as advanced semiconductors - a sector dominated by the island.

Elon Musk, who heads the so-called department of government efficiency as one of Donald Trump's closest advisers, has said he hopes to see complete freedom of trade between the US and Europe.

The Tesla CEO and owner of X was speaking via video-link at a congress in Florence of Italy's right-wing, co-ruling League Party on Saturday. He was being interviewed by Italy's hard-line deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini.

“At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,” the billionaire said.

“And more freedom for people to move between Europe and North America, if they wish,” Musk said, adding, “that has certainly been my advice to the president”.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Thursday that the US's trade tariffs were a mistake but their impact should not be overestimated and the reaction needed to be carefully considered.

The Bank of Italy said on Friday the euro zone's third largest economy would grow by just 0.5% this year, less than half the government's 1.2% forecast made in September.

High-debt Italy has committed to bringing its deficit below the EU's 3% of gross domestic product ceiling in 2026 from 3.4% in 2024, a task made harder by its faltering economic growth.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Days of heavy rains have led to rapidly swelling waterways and prompted a series of flood emergencies from Texas to Ohio

Another round of torrential rain and flash flooding on Saturday hit parts of the US south and midwest already heavily waterlogged by days of severe storms that also spawned deadly tornadoes. Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days.

Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central US, rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service (NWS) said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach major flood stage, with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.

At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee.

A 57-year-old man died on Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky – a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school, and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said.

Also on Saturday a five-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided.

Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighbourhoods and caused at least seven deaths.

And interstate commerce is affected – the extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, the chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.

The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts – twice that of just a decade ago.

Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg on Saturday said the Ohio River rose 5ft (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days.

“We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,” he said.

Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued across Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix.

In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50ft (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.

In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding.

BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by flood waters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen.

Since Wednesday more than a foot of rain (30.5cm) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8in (20cm) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday.

Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.

At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000ft (7.6km) high, according to the NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The film, combined with The Little Mermaid, created more carbon emissions than some major airports do in a year

At a screening of the new Snow White movie in London last month, influencers walked through an artificial fairytale forest, complete with a full-size thatched cottage filled with models of furry animals. In the US, Disney paraded an actual bunny in a brown knitted jumper down the red carpet at the film's Hollywood premiere.

But the film's theme of being at one with nature seems not to have extended to the real-life environment, with company documents showing the making of Snow White generated more greenhouse gas emissions in the UK than the latest Fast & Furious film, despite the latter's reliance on an array of gas-guzzling cars.

Analysis of more than 250 sets of filings from the Walt Disney Company reveals that the live action remakes of Snow White and another animated classic, The Little Mermaid, created more pollution than any of its other movies made in the UK since 2019, when the environmental reporting requirement was introduced.

It obliges companies to disclose the emissions generated in the UK, so the global total may be higher. The Little Mermaid, for example, was also filmed in Sardinia, while the Fast and Furious film-makers travelled to Italy and the US.

The combined emissions for Snow White and The Little Mermaid are higher than the annual amount produced by Birmingham and Luton airports. Each movie generated higher emissions than the annual total for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and London's O2 Arena, where the Snow White influencer event took place.

Snow White is the latest live-action Disney film and stars West Side Story actor Rachel Zegler in the leading role and Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot as the evil queen. It has been far from a fairy­tale for the company, plagued by controversy about everything from the outspoken politics of the lead actor to the role of the seven dwarves. The film is reportedly on track to make a loss of about $115m (£89m), with total takings of just $145m against a cost of about $260m.

Despite being made by an American studio, both Snow White and The Little Mermaid were filmed at Pinewood Studios, just outside London. Studios filming in the UK get up to 25.5% of their spending reimbursed under government plans to incentivise the industry. As part of this process, accounts must be filed for the ­production company behind each movie, showing the cost of making the movie and the emissions generated in the UK.

These accounts show that by the end of 2023, Disney had received £44.9m in return for making Snow White in the UK and £49.7m for The Little Mermaid.

Emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) and are divided into three categories, known as scopes. The first one covers emissions from fuel directly used to produce the movie, for example by generators powering cameras and heaters. The second scope covers emissions generated by the creation of the electricity used during production. Scope three shows indirect emissions which are generated by suppliers of goods and services.

Scope three emissions are largely outside the control of the companies being measured, so many, including airports, don't list them on their accounts. Scope three for airports includes emissions from the planes that use them, so if this were included they would have a much higher total than films.

In scope one and two Snow White generated 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The Little Mermaid generated 5,127 tonnes, to give a combined total of 8,279.6 tonnes. This compares with 7,829 tonnes for Birmingham airport in 2023-24, 6,243 for Luton in 2023 and 3,351 for East Midlands in 2023-24, according to their latest data.

Major productions are known in the movie industry as “tentpoles”. A source close to Disney said last year that a total of around 2,600 tCO2e “is right in line for what the emissions for a tentpole production should be”. The Little Mermaid is double that (taking into account all three scopes) and Snow White is 62% higher.

The latter was filmed extensively on location, which increases the need for portable generators. Fuel for these accounted for the majority of the energy usage during the making of both movies, though it could have been higher. This is because the movie-makers used battery-powered generators and hybrid ones partly powered by batteries.

They also tapped into mains power when possible and the accounts add that the “electricity supply at Pinewood was switched to a renewable supply via a green tariff in 2020 (reductions from this switch are not included in these calculations)”.

They also state that production staff rented electric cars and “charter flights were only used for full crew moves where they are less carbon intensive than booking hundreds of commercial flights”

The boss's bonus is an annual debating point at Britain's biggest company. But that's not the only issue this year

AstraZeneca is used to facing protests over pay at its annual general meetings, given the position of its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, as the best-paid FTSE 100 chief executive for most of the past five years. But pay is not the only issue overshadowing this year's virtual gathering on Friday.

Britain's biggest listed company, valued at about £170bn, faces investigations in China over import and data breaches, while it ran into controversy when it ditched the planned £450m expansion of its vaccine site in Speke, near Liverpool, in late January, after failing to hammer out a state support package with the UK government.

On top of these problems comes the prospect – so far unrealised – of Donald Trump slapping tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry as part of his continuing attack on global trade practices.

The company's chair, Michel Demaré, will at least be able to reflect on a year that was financially successful. Strong sales of AstraZeneca's cancer, lung and immunology treatments lifted 2024 profits 38% higher to $8.7bn, with revenues up by 21% to $54.1bn.

The group is confidently predicting a jump in revenues to $80bn by 2030, as it is betting on the launch of 20 new medicines.

This impressive financial performance has been clouded by trouble in China, where AstraZeneca is one of the biggest multinational pharma businesses. Its shares have risen by just 9% in the past 12 months, while they are up by nearly 60% in the last five years.

China is the company's second biggest market after the US, and news broke in September that several former and current executives were being investigated over allegations of importing unlicensed cancer medications and patient data breaches.

The head of AstraZeneca's China business, Leon Wang, who led its rapid growth there in recent years, stood down in late October after being detained by the authorities.

AstraZeneca said in early February it could be fined up to $4.5m if it was found liable over suspected unpaid importation taxes of $900,000 relating to its cancer drugs Imfinzi and Imjudo. There is also a separate investigation into alleged medical insurance fraud by AstraZeneca employees in China, which began in 2021.

Then, just over a week ago, the group revealed a $2.5bn investment to establish its sixth international strategic research and development hub, set to be located in Beijing, in a sign that it may avoid severe penalties in China. The Beijing site will be the second in the country, after its existing facility in Shanghai.

Investors will be breathing a sigh of relief if AstraZeneca can put its China troubles behind it, but tariffs are another concern. So far, pharmaceuticals have been spared by the bruising new US tariffs, but if they were included, the cost of medications could rise around the world. The industry relies on long and complicated supply chains that involve many countries.

Both AstraZeneca and the UK's other big drug maker, GSK, have some manufacturing in the US, their No 1 market, which means they can mitigate against any tariffs to an extent. Last autumn, AstraZeneca said it was investing a further $3.5bn in US research and manufacturing.

But its decision not to expand in Speke is a blow to the country, with Tom Keith-Roach, AstraZeneca's UK president, recently describing Britain as “an outlier now as one of the most difficult places in the world” in which to bring new medications to patients.

Added to all this, AstraZeneca is unlikely to escape renewed scrutiny of its remuneration policy.

Soriot, who joined from Roche in 2012, has successfully rebuilt AstraZeneca's drug portfolio since fending off a hostile takeover bid from US rival Pfizer in 2014. The company has rewarded him with ever-higher pay packets, prompting almost 40% of shareholders to vote against, or abstain from voting on, his maximum £18.7m package last year.

He was paid £14.7m in the end, but this year his package could go up to £25m, depending on targets being met and a rise in the share price.

AstraZeneca argues this is needed to attract and retain talent, and that the new pay policy simply brings Soriot's pay more into line with that of global pharma executives.

The investor advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services says: “Questions may be posed as to whether the remuneration committee's response to the significant dissent to remuneration proposals at the last AGM has sufficiently assuaged shareholder concerns raised regarding variable pay.”

However, it adds that “there is evidence of performance targets being made more robust” and there are “no fresh concerns” at this time.

Andrew Speke of the High Pay Centre thinktank says: “While in general, most people would consider the pay of some of the lowest-paid FTSE 100 chief executives to be far too high, Pascal Soriot's pay levels have been viewed somewhat more sympathetically due to AstraZeneca's role in developing vaccines during the Covid pandemic.”

However, he argues that this year's potential pay rise “deserves much greater scrutiny. Such extreme pay levels will only raise greater concerns among critics of big pharma that the companies producing life-saving drugs are primarily focused on enriching their executives and shareholders.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","‘Reflection of culture': large glasses of wine come off the menu for British drinkers","https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/06/large-glasses-wine-trends-alcohol-bars-restaurants-uk","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 16:18:00 GMT","

Servings of 250ml and 175ml are becoming rarer in restaurants and bars as customers opt for smaller tastings

It may be a sign of changing tastes, of a health-conscious nation, or yet another example of the cost of living crisis encroaching on our few simple pleasures – but it seems the large glass of wine may soon be a thing of the past.

While a 250ml option used to be commonplace, it is becoming harder to find on the menus of bars and restaurants up and down the country as venues increasingly favour smaller 125ml servings.

At high-end restaurants, which would have tended to offer diners a choice of small or medium 175ml servings, there is a notable shift. Only one of the 20 top Michelin-starred restaurants now serves a medium: the Ledbury in Notting Hill. At the rest, diners are offered 125ml or a whole bottle at 750ml.

Hannah Crosbie, the Guardian's wine critic, said it was something she had noticed and “found quite interesting”.

“Any time there's a big changing of tides or a notable difference in the way we drink wine, it really is a reflection of the culture and how we're drinking now,” she said. “First of all, I'd say it's reflective of people just drinking less generally.”

Crosbie said it felt “like a more health-conscious decision” but could sometimes be a convenient excuse to have a glass of wine instead of skipping it altogether. “Instead of not getting wine, you get a smaller glass of wine.”

Another reason, Crosbie said, was that consumers were increasingly trying wines they would not have tried in the past.

“The average person – particularly in metropolitan areas, not speaking for the whole of the country – is now more adventurous with their wine choices than they've ever been,” she said. “So instead of perhaps having a bottle and just sticking on one wine for the entire night, they would instead want to try lots of different things and, again, in order to keep on top of what they were drinking, they would just have smaller glasses so they could try as much as they can.”

She cited the rise of bars focusing on natural wines – those that are typically organic and use minimal processing – as these “tend to have much smaller bistro ISO-style glasses [smaller wine glasses for tasting] and that naturally lends itself to a smaller serve.”

Jono Hawthorne, the chef patron at Chef Jono at V&V in Leeds, agreed and added that price was also a huge factor. He still serves large glasses but has noticed a trend towards customers wanting smaller glasses of higher-priced wines.

“The rise of smaller wine bars, especially natural and low-intervention wine, has led to more expensive wines being offered to customers,” said Hawthorne, who worked at Michelin-starred restaurants such as Noma and the Box Tree and competed on MasterChef: The Professionals before running his own kitchen.

Price is something he is conscious about when it comes to his own customers, offering affordable fine-dining options including creative five-course menus priced at £45. “If you put a 250ml glass of wine on a menu, it would be the price of a bottle to some people,” he said.

But the good news for those unsatisfied by smaller servings is that chains such as Wetherspoon's, Pizza Express and All Bar One appear to be resisting the trend.

“A small glass of wine doesn't sound right, does it?” said Sanda Anlezark, over a bottle shared with her friend Jean Collingwood in All Bar One in Manchester city centre. The pair, 20 years retired from careers in advertising sales, were taking advantage of a Thursday deal at the chain where buying two glasses gets the rest of the bottle free – and were surprised to hear that wine sizes appeared to be shrinking.

Collingwood agreed. “The best thing is when you don't have to ask, the person behind the bar goes … [she nods, conspiratorially] … and brings you a large.”

What if you went to a bar that only served small glasses? “It wouldn't bother me,” said Anlezark. “You'd get a bottle.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Death of 15-year-old whose body was found in Beckenham Place Park on Friday is not being treated as suspicious

A 15-year-old boy who died after getting into difficulty in a lake in south-east London has been named by police.

Izaiah Smith, whose body was recovered from the lake on Friday night, was named by the Metropolitan police on Sunday. Officers said that though his death was unexpected, it was not believed to be suspicious.

Officers and paramedics were called to Beckenham Place Park in Lewisham shortly after 3pm on Friday. Specialist diving teams, ambulance crews and firefighters carried out a search for the teenager, stopping when Izaiah was found on Friday night, Scotland Yard said on Saturday.

“A boy was recovered from the lake at around 10.42pm on Friday 4 April,” a Met spokesperson said.

“He was taken to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead. His death is being treated as unexpected but not believed to be suspicious.”

Izaiah's family have been made aware and are being supported, the force said.

On Saturday, the SEDA Football Academy said the teenager was a much-loved under-16s player. In a tribute shared on Instagram, the club said it was “mourning the loss” of a kind and considerate young person.

“Izaiah was such a bright light within our programme,” the post said. “Always present at training, he greeted everyone with the most adorable smile. His huge character and infectious energy will be deeply missed by us all.”

In a statement, Lewisham council, which manages the park, said the space was re-opened on Saturday, though the lake would remain closed with security in place until further notice.

“We are working closely with the police in order that their investigation establishes the full facts of what's happened,” it added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Garment workers in countries such as Cambodia among those who fear they will lose pay cheques if companies move production elsewhere

“This is very messed up. If Trump wants Cambodia to import more American goods: look, we are just a very small country!”

Khun Tharo works to promote human rights in the Cambodian garment sector, which employs about 1 million people – many of them women.

“I think they are very concerned about their jobs, and I think they are very concerned about their monthly pay cheque. And that has significant effects on the livelihoods of their dependent family,” says Tharo, programme manager at the Centre for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights (CENTRAL), a Cambodian workers' rights organisation.

One of the most wilfully destructive aspects of Donald Trump's shock and awe trade policy is the imposition of punitive tariffs on developing countries across Asia, including rates of 49% for Cambodia, 37% for Bangladesh, 48% for Laos.

For decades Washington had championed economic development through trade. Now, at the same time as slashing overseas aid budgets and retreating from its role in supporting developing nations, it is ripping up that idea entirely.

In its place, Trump intends to impose his will on the US's trading partners. Some are all but powerless to exact concessions, given their small size, and dependence on the mighty American market. Cambodia hastily offered to cut tariffs on US goods on Friday, in a bid to propitiate Washington.

Contrary to Trump's bombast about the US being “pillaged”, the tariffs are not in any sense “reciprocal”.

Instead, they relate to the size of the US goods trade deficit with each country, and the value of its exports. (Side note: the 10% paid by the UK has nothing to do with Labour's negotiating flair – it just came out of the fact that Britain buys about as much stuff from the US as it sells the other way).

Ironically, many of the countries in the global south hit by Trump had benefited from preferential schemes offering low or zero tariffs, precisely because building up exporting capacity is an accepted path to development.

Alice Oyaro, the chief executive at the charity Transform Trade, which works with producers in some of the worst-hit countries, says: “Our biggest concern is that the additional costs are pushed down to those in the supply chain who are least able to pay. Small farmers exporting everything from green beans to cocoa, and women workers in Bangladeshi factories are already finding it hard to make ends meet. They will see their incomes squeezed even more.”

Tiny Sri Lanka, which has an economy 0.3% of the size of the US's, faces a 44% tariff despite being bailed out by the International Monetary Fund two years ago and continuing to negotiate debt restructuring deals with its creditors.

“It's a highly vulnerable situation,” says Ajith D Perera, the chair of the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Sri Lanka will lose export income and see a hit to GDP and employment – and that comes at a time when it is just coming out of bankruptcy.”

He fears the scale of the tariffs could compromise Sri Lanka's ability to meet the conditions of the IMF bailout deal. Trade is meant to be a key prop for growth, as it rebuilds its shattered economy.

“I think the fundamentals have been challenged by the US decision,” he says. “25% of Sri Lanka's exports go to the US and 70% of that is garments. I think the government needs to start discussions with the IMF immediately.”

As his warning suggests, there is a risk that a grim side-effect of Trump's trade war will be to exacerbate the debt crises already hitting heavily indebted poorer nations.

Even countries that have escaped the most punitive tariff rates could still be hit hard if the prospect of a global downturn depresses the value of the commodity exports on which many rely.

Keir Starmer and other leaders of the developed world have been preoccupied with their own domestic responses since Wednesday's bombshell briefing in the White House Rose Garden.

But the severity of the probable impact for the global south calls for a concerted approach, too – albeit one that will have to bypassWashington.

Most of the hardest-hit countries can already trade tariff-free with major markets under projects such as the EU's Everything But Arms programme and the UK's Developing Countries Trading Scheme, which are designed to help the poorest nations to develop through trade.

But if Trump's tariffs stick, multinational brands focused on the US are likely to switch production rapidly to countries hit with lower rates. One garment buyer in India told me on Friday she was already hearing of factory owners in Bangladesh being told by US brands that they would now be manufacturing their sweaters in Peru, which has a rate of just 10%.

The social dislocation in some of these hardest-hit economies could be profound, if such rapid shifts result in mass layoffs.

And the case for debt write-offs, already clear, may become all the more pressing, if the resulting the looming global downturn sweeps vulnerable countries over the edge.

The fact that the British government's deep cuts to the aid budget now sit alongside a probable global economic downturn and heavy US penalties for exporters in developing countries makes that decision all the more shameful.

Back in Cambodia, Tharo says: “The industry right now seems to be in a little bit of a hectic situation. The government is also extremely worried because they are not seeing any alternative markets at the moment. And we don't have significant goods to be exported to any other country.

“Trump doesn't care,” he sighs.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Tony Rundle, the premier of Tasmania from March 1996 to September 1998, has died aged 86.

A Liberal, Rundle was sworn in as the premier of the state six weeks before the Port Arthur massacre.

Jeremy Rockliff, Tasmania's current premier, described Rundle as “a kind, intelligent man, and one that I was truly fortunate to count as a mentor”, adding:

As premier, he remodelled Tafe Tasmania and established Service Tasmania, negotiated Australia's first regional forest agreement, got BassLink underway and delivered the state's apology to our Aboriginal community.
  I well recall Tony being a tower of strength and compassion as he led Tasmanians through the shock, grief and trauma of the tragedy at Port Arthur. In unity with prime minister John Howard, he drove critical gun law reform that all Australians benefit from today.

The sun is setting on another day on the campaign trail, and with that it's time to wrap up the blog. Here were today's top stories:

Peter Dutton announced that under the LNP, foreign student intakes would be cut by 80,000, in a plan aimed at reducing demand for housing.

Anthony Albanese formally launched Labor's $2.3bn household battery policy at his first election rally in Queensland.

The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has called for a “full and thorough” investigation into the deaths of 15 humanitarian aid workers, after a new video emerged of the shooting in Gaza.

The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said the Coalition would “impose a charge” on gas exports until domestic gas supply is increased.

The Coalition dumped the Liberal candidate Ben Britton, who was running as the candidate for Whitlam in NSW, after he said women should not serve in ADF combat roles.

Tony Rundle, the former premier of Tasmania, has died aged 86.

A man has been charged after allegedly attempting to open a plane door on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney.

Labor's $2.3bn household battery pledge will “slash power bills”, Smart Energy Council says

Labor's $2.3bn commitment to slash the cost of household batteries by 30% has been welcomed by the Smart Energy Council.

According to the council, there are 77 solar batteries on the Australian market, starting at around $4,000 for a 5kWh battery.

The Smart Energy Council chief executive, John Grimes, described Labor's commitment as “the most important development in consumer energy since Australians first gained access to subsidised solar panels”, adding:

[It] will not only slash power bills for 10 million Australians with solar but also ensure all Australians are at least $1.3bn better off in 2030 through
  reduced wholesale electricity costs …

“Four million Australian homes have solar and this policy will help them store that energy for later when it will be at its cheapest. Ten million Australians are already producing solar power,
  now they can store it …

Less demand on the energy grid means fewer price peaks.

Other experts have said the upfront cost of purchasing a battery has been a barrier to entry for many homeowners. The Clean Energy Council estimates that the average battery costs around $14,000.

Federal and ACT Labor has pledged shared funding of $200m to build a new convention and entertainment centre precinct and aquatic centre in Canberra.

Katy Gallagher, senator for the ACT, said the commonwealth would provide $100m towards the project, matching $100m from the ACT to “get this project going”, describing the need for a “convention centre that's worthy of the nation's capital”.

Andrew Barr, the ACT's chief minister, said previous attempts to develop the precinct had failed to receive federal government support but said $200m joint funding would take the project to “shovel ready” stage, estimating the total construction cost of the precinct would be around $750m:

What we want to see, and we will see now is the new Canberra aquatic facility built well ahead of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics … that then makes way for a site large enough to accommodate the new convention and entertainment centre …

As part of this project, the city also gets an indoor entertainment venue with the capacity of around 8,000 seats.

Ben Britton has been dumped as a Liberal candidate for the New South Wales seat of Whitlam after it was revealed he had expressed a string of controversial views on fringe podcasts before his preselection.

Britton was taken off the Liberal party's website, and sources have told Guardian Australia he was no longer being endorsed, with the party quickly replacing him with Nathaniel Smith.

I'm handing over to my colleague Donna Lu, who will take you through the rest of the day. Thanks for reading.

Australia is pushing for a “full and thorough” investigation into into the deaths of 15 humanitarian aid workers after a new video emerged of the shooting in Gaza.

The mobile phone footage of the last moments of some of the 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers killed by Israeli forces in an incident in Gaza last month appears to contradict the version of events put forward by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).

The almost seven-minute video, which the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said on Saturday was recovered from the phone of Rifat Radwan, one of the men killed, appears to have been filmed from inside a moving vehicle. It shows a red fire engine and clearly marked ambulances driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights.

The vehicle stops beside another that has driven off the road. Two men get out to examine the stopped vehicle, and then gunfire erupts before the screen goes black.

The Israeli military has said its soldiers “did not randomly attack” any ambulances, insisting that troops opened fire on vehicles that had no prior clearance to enter the area and were driving with their lights off.

The IDF said on Saturday that the incident was still under investigation and that “all claims, including the documentation circulated about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation”.

Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said those responsible for the attack must be held to account. She said:

The deaths of humanitarian workers in Gaza are unacceptable. Aid workers must be protected and Australia repeats its call on all parties to abide by international humanitarian law

It is appropriate that there is a thorough and independent investigation. Those responsible must be held accountable … Australia calls on all parties to return to the ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.

Israel says it has announced an investigation into the incident to be undertaken by the Israeli military.

Labor is facing a backlash in some traditionally safe electorates, such as Watson in western Sydney, where Muslim voters are threatening to abandon the party over a perceived failure to call out Israeli war crimes.

Mariam Tomahy, a member of Teachers and School Staff for Palestine, said Senator Wong's calls for an investigation were too little too late, given the earlier silence from the government about the killing, which happened in March.

“It's a very slow response and we expect a lot more from our government,” Tomahy told AAP. “We consider these kinds of statements as lip service, to be honest.”

The pro-Palestine group is holding a rally at Bankstown, in the seat of Watson, on Sunday afternoon to call out a rise in Islamophobia since the start of the war in Gaza.

Tomahy sensed a real backlash coming for sitting Labor frontbencher Tony Burke, saying: “We're seeing an unprecedented reaction from western Sydneysiders.”

Some quite moving comments from the vice-chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Prof Pascale Quester, on the Coalition's announcement today that it would place a cap on international students, which would see the number of international students fall by 80,000.

Quester, who was herself an international student, said she knew firsthand the “vibrancy international students bring to our cities”.

We must stop the attacks on international students. They are not some mythical group of people. They are individuals with dreams, ambitions, and, for some of them, the perfectly legitimate desire to contribute to our national project. These students come to Australia, receive an excellent education and, when they opt in to stay, they go on to build careers, lives and communities here.

Quester also said the continued attacks on international students from both sides of politics “damages Australia's long-term economic and technological future”.

It is depriving our country of its best chance to access the talent we so desperately need to pivot from an economy that just digs things out of the ground to one that is tech-savvy, entrepreneurial and part of the knowledge economy.

The cold hard truth is we do not have enough Australian high school students interested in pursuing Stem at university. Forget about brain drain – our nation is at serious risk of a brain drought. International students, who we know are increasingly wanting to study Stem subjects, are critical to our future as a knowledge economy.

A slightly odd personal story from Peter Dutton to end his campaign event in Tasmania and segue into another spending announcement for the southern state, as the opposition leader tells of how he bought his father a ride in a Porsche around a racetrack for Father's Day that nearly killed him, as he announces $18m to upgrade a local racetrack.

There are some things that you'll remember during these election campaigns, and some of it's just a whirlwind – you're going from one place to the next – but I do remember most of a fast lap that I had not too far from here … around the track at at Symmons Plains raceway.

The fast lap Dutton did reminded him of the Father's Day racetrack gift he bought Dutton Snr a few years ago.

Now, I thought it was a great thing, a good thing to do as a son, and I remember it was about three or four laps, and about halfway through the second or third lap the guy decided to put his foot down and really give Dad the ultimate experience. But instead, what happened is that the car - and I can watch this in my mind as I speak to you in slow motion – started to do 360s and the car started to spin off the track into the sand.

Now, the story ended well, so I've got a good story to tell, ultimately, but I did have this passing thought that out of an active sort of good son interest in thinking about my dad that I'd killed my dad on Father's Day … I did have flashbacks back to that moment when I was out on the track only a week or so ago ...”

And then he segues neatly into a spending announcement:

We've committed $18 million to upgrade that racetrack, and I think that's going to be a phenomenal investment in Tasmania.

What a whirlwind.

Dutton says Plibersek could close down Tasmanian forestry industry ‘overnight'

More from Peter Dutton's rally in Tasmania, where he is warning a crowd about the state's forestry industry that “Tanya Plibersek, equally, along with Bob Brown and others, could close it down overnight.”

The contest in Tasmania will be a close one. The seat of Lyons – and Dutton spends a while in his speech proffering fierce warnings to offer about Rebecca White, who is running as the Labor candidate in that seat – is held by Labor by a margin of just 0.9%. The Labor MP Brian Mitchell is set to retire. So, the contest is on.

Dutton has a raft of Tasmania-focused announcements today, including that the Coalition will invest $40m to establish a new timber manufacturing expansion program, $65m to support Tasmanian industry regarding freight equalisation, and $80m to upgrade a 40km stretch of the Bass Highway work that he says will get under way “very quickly” if the Coalition is elected.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton is also at a campaign rally, in the battleground state of Tasmania.

A key issue in the state has been the future of the salmon industry at Macquarie Harbour and its impact on the Maugean skate, an endangered fish.

During budget week, Labor passed legislation to secure the industry – with support from the Coalition – but Dutton's claiming Labor will “destroy” the salmon industry.

You know the story all too well, Labor was on a pathway to destroy the Tasmanian salmon industry, exactly what they want to do to forestry in this great state as well … we stopped Labor's plan to stop salmon farming here in Tasmania.

Albanese says battery policy helps make voting choice ‘crystal clear'

On the battery policy – which Labor says will benefit Queenslanders more than any other state – Albanese said it helped makes the choice between the two parties “crystal clear”.

Our plan for cheaper home batteries will start on the 1st of July this year. It makes the choice crystal clear: wait until sometime in the 2040s for expensive nuclear energy under the Liberal party, or save money this year and every year afterwards with solar power under Labor.

The $2.3bn plan will slash the cost of household batteries by 30%, as part of a dual cost-of-living and climate action pitch to voters.

Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong told Insiders this morning it would help about 1m households to 2030.

Anthony Albanese has formally launched the battery policy at his first election rally, in Queensland.

The PM was met with a rapturous welcome, addressing adorning crowds of Labor supporters – and plugging his government's tax cuts and investment in Medicare.

He also attacked comments from the opposition leader – who hails from Queensland – that he'd like to live at Kirribilli House in Sydney over the Lodge in the nation's capital.

Albanese celebrated what's been a strong first week of the campaign for Labor.

[We're] building on the strong foundations we have laid over the last three years, focusing on the policies that will make people better off over the next three years.

And while we have been running on our positive plan, the LNP have been running for cover. Running away from questions about their promise to cut wages and increase taxes, and try and run and hide from the cuts they will make to education and health to pay for their $600 billion nuclear reactors.

Labor's home battery plan welcomed as ‘significant' help for lowering bills

The Clean Energy Council (CEC) has welcome the government's rooftop solar battery announcement today that would see users save 30% on a household battery, calling it a “significant and welcome cost-of-living measure” for the 4 million Australians with rooftop solar.

The CEC said the average upfront cost of purchasing a battery was around $14,000, which had been a barrier to entry for many homeowners, with less than 5% of households with rooftop solar investing in battery storage, according to CEC data.

“It's been the missing piece of the energy transition puzzle when it comes to further reducing energy bills for Aussie households,” said the CEC's general manager, Con Hristodoulidis. He added:

The government's proposed discount of $4,000 on a medium-sized (11.5 kWh) battery will see homeowners save around $1,100 per year on their bills…

The more batteries we have in the system, the more power we can store and use for those peak times when energy is more expensive, and taking pressure off the distribution network leads to lower power bills for everyone. Our analysis shows this network saving can be as high as $190m for all energy users.

A national battery scheme will ensure more households will be empowered to turbocharge their energy independence and save on their bills. It's good news for everybody's wallets, and the long-term future of Australia's modern energy system – built on the cheapest form of renewable energy backed by storage.

The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) welcomed the announcement, saying it would “support a faster transition to clean energy and help lower power bills for all” but also called on the government to investment in thermal efficiency, electric appliances and solar for those struggling the most.

“Supporting ongoing investment in renewable energy and energy storage, like home batteries, is critical to addressing the climate crisis and lowering power bills, rather than polluting and expensive gas and nuclear,” said the acting CEO of Acoss, Edwina MacDonald.

However, if parties are serious about providing targeted energy bill relief to people with the least, there must also be further investment in measures like thermal efficiency, electric appliances and solar for low-income housing and renters.

The reality is the home battery subsidy will be taken up by people who own a home and already have solar and lower energy bills. It's the people on the lowest incomes and renters that continue to miss out.

The Greens have issued an excoriating statement blasting Peter Dutton's announcement today that the Coalition would cut the intake of foreign students by 80,000, in a plan aimed at reducing demand for housing.

Under the plan there, at most 115,000 overseas students would be allowed to commence study in Australia at publicly funded universities each year, and a further 125,000 in the vocational education and training (VET), private university and non-university higher education sectors.

The Coalition said this would result in a reduction of more than 80,000 in annual new overseas student commencements compared with 2023 levels and was done in a bid to reduce pressure on housing.

But the Greens have labelled the move “blatantly racist” and “a cynical attempt to scapegoat migrants and international students for a housing crisis they didn't cause”.

Senator Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Australian Greens and spokesperson for higher education, said:

Dutton's plan to slash student numbers and triple visa fees is a cynical ploy to stoke fear and division in the lead-up to an election. It's a smokescreen to cover up the Coalition's own failures and inaction.

Labor must take responsibility for starting this round of punching down on international students with the caps they pushed for last year. We knew this was going to turn ugly and harm so many people of colour living in this country.

The facts are clear, we've seen the evidence: international students are not the cause of skyrocketing rents or unaffordable housing. That responsibility lies squarely with successive governments who have refused to build enough public housing and prioritised lining the pockets of wealthy property investors.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain momentum – key US politics stories from 5 April 


 Crowds of people angry about the way Donald Trump is running the country marched and rallied in scores of American cities on Saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain its momentum after the shock of the US president's first weeks in office.

The so-called “Hands Off!” demonstrations were held in more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists.

Demonstrators voiced anger over the administration's moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close social security administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs.

Here are the key stories at a glance.

People across the US took to the streets on Saturday to oppose what left-leaning organizations called Trump's “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.

Organizers estimated that more than 500,000 people demonstrated in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere.

Demonstrators estimated to be in the tens of thousands gathered in Washington on Saturday in a display of mass dissent against Trump's policies that organizers hoped would snowball into a rolling cycle of protests.

Anger with Trump and his billionaire lieutenant, the SpaceX and Tesla leader Elon Musk, was expressed in a sea of placards and banners on the Washington mall. Multiple messages denounced the two men for shuttering government agencies, cutting jobs and services and – in often graphic terms – for threatening the survival of US democracy.

The Democratic senator Cory Booker took a version of his record-breaking Senate floor speech on the road Saturday to a town hall meeting in a New Jersey gymnasium, calling on people to find out what they can do to push back against Donald Trump's agenda.

Booker took questions at suburban New Jersey's Bergen Community College the same day that more than 1,200 ‘Hands Off' demonstrations took place around the country. The town hall event was punctuated both by celebratory shouts of “Cory, Cory” as well as at least a half-dozen interruptions by protesters.

Washington is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and blocking new arrivals, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Saturday, complaining the African nation is not accepting its nationals expelled from the US.

The state department “is taking actions to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and prevent further issuance to prevent entry”, Rubio said in a statement.

Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student activist who led campus pro-Palestinian rallies and is now resisting the Trump administration's deportation efforts, has accused the university of laying “the groundwork for my abduction” and called on the student body to continue demonstrations and protests.

Khalil, a green-card holder who is in custody in Louisiana as his case moves through the courts, was detained on 8 March. The Trump administration is seeking to deport him under a provision in federal immigration law that permits the state department to deport non-citizens considered to be a threat to US foreign policy.

Trump's presidential administration has acknowledged and apologized after it says it accidentally informed some Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country's invasion by Russia that they needed to leave the US because their legal status was being revoked.

About 240,000 Ukrainians have been settled in the US as part of the Uniting for Ukraine – or U4U – program launched during Joe Biden's presidency. But according to CBS News, some resettled Ukrainians received emails this week telling them that the US Department of Homeland Security would be terminating their legal protections.

Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, has warned that his fellow Republicans risk a “bloodbath” in the 2026 midterm elections if Donald Trump's “liberation day” tariffs cause a recession.

Cruz also warned that the president's tariffs, if they stay in place for long and are met by global retaliation on American goods, could trigger a full-blown trade war that “would destroy jobs here at home, and do real damage to the US economy”.

Energoatom CEO, Petro Kotin, says ‘major problems' need to be overcome before it can safely generate power

It would be unsafe for Russia to restart the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and would take Ukraine up to two years in peacetime if it regained control, the chief executive of the company that runs the vast six-reactor site has said.

Petro Kotin, chief executive of Energoatom, said in an interview there were “major problems” to overcome – including insufficient cooling water, personnel and incoming electricity supply – before it could start generating power again safely.

The future of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear reactor, is a significant aspect of any negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Seized by Russia in spring 2022 and shut down for safety reasons a few months later, it remains on the frontline of the conflict, close to the Dnipro River.

Russia has said it intends to retain the site and switch it back on, without being specific as to when. Alexey Likhachev, head of Russian nuclear operator Rosatom, said in February it would be restarted when “military and political conditions allow”.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump has expressed an interest in taking control of it, though this possibility is considered very remote.

Kotin said Energoatom was prepared to restart the plant but it would require Russian forces to be removed and the site to be de-mined and demilitarised.

He said such a restart by Ukraine would take anywhere “from two months to two years” in an environment “without any threats from militaries”, while a Russian restart during wartime “would be impossible, even for one unit [reactor]”.

Kotin said the six reactors could only be brought online after the completion of 27 safety programmes agreed with Ukraine's nuclear regulator, including testing the nuclear fuel in the reactor cores because it had exceeded a six-year “design term”.

That raises questions about whether Russia could restart the plant after a ceasefire without incurring significant risk. The plant was already unsafe, Kotin said, given that it was being used as “a military base with military vehicles present” and there were “probably some weapons and blasting materials” present as well.

Russia has acknowledged that it has placed mines between the inner and outer perimeters of the plant “to deter potential Ukrainian saboteurs” while inspectors from the IAEA nuclear watchdog have reported that armed troops and military personnel are present at the site.

Last month, the US Department of Energy said the Zaporizhzhia plant was being operated by an “inadequate and insufficently trained cadre of workers”, with staffing levels at less than a third of prewar levels.

The US briefing said Ukrainian reactors, though originally of the Soviet VVER design, had “evolved differently” from their Russian counterparts and “particularly the safety systems”. Russian-trained specialists acting as replacements for Ukrainian staff were “inexperienced” in operating the Ukrainian variants, it said.

Kotin said an attempt to restart the plant by Russia would almost certainly not be accepted or supported by Ukraine. It would require the reconnection of three additional 750kV high-voltage lines to come into the plant, he said.

A nuclear reactor requires a significant amount of power for day-to-day operation, and three of the four high-voltage lines came from territories now under Russian occupation. “They themselves destroyed the lines,” Kotin said, only for Russia to discover engineers could not rebuild them as the war continued, he added.

Only two lines remain to maintain the site in cold shutdown, a 750kV line coming from Ukraine, and a further 330kV line – though on eight separate occasions shelling disrupted their supply of energy, forcing the plant to rely on backup generators.

Experts say a pumping station has to be constructed at the site, because there is insufficient cooling water available. The June 2023 destruction by Russian soldiers of the Nova Kakhova dam downstream eliminated the easy supply of necessary water from the Dnipro river.

Two civilians were reportedly killed by Russian missile attacks on Sunday, including one in a ballistic missile strike in an eastern district of Kyiv; while Russia said it captured a border village near Sumy in north-east Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 1,460 guided aerial bombs, nearly 670 attack drones, and more than 30 missiles over the past week. The Ukrainian president said: “The number of air attacks is increasing.”

US-brokered ceasefire talks have only achieved limited results thus far. Both sides agreed to stop attacking energy targets, though each accuses the other of violations; while a maritime ceasefire agreed to by Ukraine has not been accepted by Russia.

A Russian official involved in the negotiations said on Sunday that diplomatic contacts between Russia and the US could come again as early as next week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            • Trump's tariffs: President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tax on imports is now in effect, with much steeper tariffs for many countries coming this week. Administration officials are urging investors to remain calm as fears of a recession grow, but offered little clarity today on whether Trump's tariffs are open to negotiation.
    


            • Mass protests: ﻿Protesters gathered in all 50 states and globally yesterday for coordinated demonstrations against Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. More rallies are expected at Tesla showrooms today.
    


            • The week ahead: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is flying to the US today ahead of a meeting with Trump at the White House tomorrow, his office said. Also keep an eye on the GOP's effort to advance Trump's multi-trillion-dollar agenda this week, as some conservatives signal a spending fight ahead.
    


            Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell says bipartisan momentum behind her bill requiring congressional approval for new tariffs “shows the anxiety that people have” about President Donald Trump's newly announced trade policies.
    


                    “I'm sure they listen to their constituents. Consumer challenges are already starting to surface, and certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people. So I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them today,” Cantwell said on CBS' “Face the Nation” of the seven Republican senators who have cosponsored the legislation.
                





            The Washington lawmaker, along with GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, introduced a bill Thursday that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would have to approve them within 60 days or they would expire.
    


            Cantwell said lawmakers are hearing from a “big segment of the economy,” including consumer groups and retailers, who are “very anxious” and looking for congressional action.
    


            GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who plans to introduce a companion bill in the House on Monday, said he has “some beginning support” from his colleagues, but acknowledged, “it will be harder to pass this in the House, no doubt.”
    


            The Nebraska Republican said he thinks if the bipartisan bill passes in the Senate, then it will put “pressure” on the House to take up his legislation.
    


            GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska called President Donald Trump's firing of several members of his National Security Council staff a “heartbreaking” decision that hurts the country.
    


            Trump announced the firings after meeting with far-right activist Laura Loomer, who had advocated for their dismissal, CNN previously reported. Despite the timing of the decision, Trump has said Loomer was not involved in the firings.
    


                    “This puts us back. It hurts us. I'm telling you Russia and China are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified,” Bacon said in an interview with CBS' “Face the Nation” today. “It's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without any explanation.”
                





            Among those fired was National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh, who Bacon described as “the absolute best leader in the US military to lead cyber command and the National Security Agency.”
    


            Bacon said that just because Trump had the right to fire them, it does not “make it appropriate or OK.”
    


            Bacon said he has a “responsibility to make clear this was wrong,” especially if the firings are part of a larger plan to put someone of Trump's choosing at the top of the NSA.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says that when he criticizes his party's strategy against Donald Trump in 2024, “I'm criticizing myself.”
    


            “I own this. I'm part of the ticket, and somebody has to come up with a strategy,” the former Democratic vice presidential nominee told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” today.
    


            Walz said his party must now address a “structural problem,” acknowledging that a general election voter base will be more challenging to win over than those who participate in special elections, where Democrats have recently seen encouraging signs.
    


            Months after losing the 2024 election, Walz has embarked on a tour of areas where Democrats lost, including in red states, to reach out to voters.
    


            Meanwhile, former Vice President Kamala Harris has made her most direct comments about Trump's actions in his second term, saying at an event last week they were largely predictable. “I'm not here to say I told you so,” she added, in a moment shared widely on social media.
    


            Walz said he thinks his former running mate was making the point that “it was pretty self-evident that (Trump) was going to do that,” and the challenge that Democrats face now is “a structural problem that's going to take a lot more thinking.”
    


What other Democrats are saying: Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, whose marathon Senate floor speech last week drew plaudits from fellow Democrats, said in an interview today that the party has to correct mistakes it made in the lead-up to the 2024 election.
    


            “The Democratic Party should own up: We partly laid this pathway for this demagogue to come into office,” Booker said on ABC's “This Week.”
    


            Booker said the Democrats' biggest mistake was “not centering people enough,” and called on candidates to center their focus on American voices and people — not politics.
    


            President Donald Trump and top administration officials have offered mixed messaging on whether his sweeping tariffs are permanent or open for negotiation.
    


            On Thursday afternoon, Trump said countries were already coming to him looking to make deals, suggesting he was open to negotiating with foreign leaders. But he struck a different tone Friday, writing in a message to foreign investors on social media that his “policies will never change.”



Top Trump officials haven't offered further clarity in TV appearances today:



White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett: Hassett said “more than 50 countries” have reached out to the US to try and negotiate tariff deals.
    


            Hassett said on ABC's “This Week” that the countries are reaching out “because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff.”
    


Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick: Asked on CBS News' “Face the Nation” about the claim 50 countries have reached out, Lutnick would not say whether the White House is actually open to negotiation.
    


            Lutnick echoed Hassett in saying the outreach from foreign officials shows “these countries know that they've been ripping us off.”
    


            Pressed repeatedly, Lutnick would not say whether Trump's 10% blanket tariffs were permanent. He did indicate Trump will not postpone the additional, steeper tariffs set to go into effect this week.
    


Trade adviser Peter Navarro: In a Fox News interview, Navarro said “this is not a negotiation” — but also that Trump is always “willing to listen” when other countries call.
    


            “It's the non-tariff cheating that matters the most, and when they want to talk to us, come talk to us about that,” Navarro said, alluding to non-trade barriers in the global economy that have drawn Trump's ire.
    


Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins: Pressed repeatedly by CNN's Jake Tapper, Rollins was unable to clearly state whether the tariffs are here to stay or if there is room for negotiation.
    


            “We're two business days into this new American order. So I think we have a lot to be determined,” she said.
    


            A federal district judge has denied the Trump administration's motion to pause an order she issued late last week to return a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month.
    


            On Friday, Judge Paula Xinis of the US District Court in Maryland directed the federal government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday. The Trump administration appealed that ruling.
    


            Xinis responded in a filing Sunday, further laying out her reasoning for the decision and saying her order “remains in full force and effect.”
    


            The Trump administration has also filed an emergency motion in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking to block the order.
    


DOJ lawyer on leave: A government immigration lawyer has been placed on leave after expressing frustration in court with the government over the deportation of Garcia.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi pointed to a memo she issued earlier this year when asked to explain the decision today on “Fox News Sunday.”
    


            “I firmly said on day one, I issued a memo, that you are to vigorously advocate on behalf of the United States. Our client in this matter was Homeland Security, is Homeland Security. He did not argue. He shouldn't have taken the case. He shouldn't have argued it if that's what he was gonna do,” she said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California called images of President Donald Trump golfing in Florida as his trade policy roils the global economy “the most enduring image of the Trump presidency.”
    


            The president's Wednesday tariffs announcement sent markets tumbling, with the Dow closing in correction by Friday, down more than 10% from its record high in December.
    


            The president has spent the days since his announcement at his South Florida golf properties, and in a remarkable statement shared with reporters underscoring the split-screen moment at play, the White House announced yesterday that Trump had won his golf game and will play again today.
    


                    “I think people have seen their retirement savings on fire, and there he is out on the golf course. That may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency — that is the President out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames,” Schiff told NBC's “Meet the Press” today.
                





            Schiff said that if the US enters a recession, it will be known as “the Trump recession … He will completely own it. This is a completely self-destructive economic act that he's engaged in.”
    


            Schiff added that maybe the treasury secretary and the president are not concerned about retirement savings because they're wealthy,  “But what I'm hearing from Californians is those that have just retired, those who are on the eve of retiring, they're terrified of this.”
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed concerns about stock market losses in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.



                    “The markets are organic animals. And you never know what the reaction is going to be. One thing that I can tell you, as the treasury secretary, what I've been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday,” Bessent said on NBC's “Meet the Press” today, referencing the record-breaking number of total shares traded.
                





            The stock market plunged this week as recession fears grow globally.
    


            Pressed on whether Americans will face a recession due to the president's tariff policies, Bessent told NBC's Kristen Welker he rejected that assumption.
    


                    “There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week. What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity that I think the previous administration had put us on the course toward financial calamity,” Bessent said.
                





Some context: The treasury secretary's comments come as many economists across the political spectrum express concerns about the impact of the tariffs. Goldman Sachs analysts said last week that economic growth driven by Trump's fiscal policies would not be able to make up for the damage done by his massive tariff plan.
    


            Bessent's remarks echoed those by top Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro today, who urged investors “not to panic.”
    


            A top Trump trade adviser urged American investors to “sit tight” and “not to panic” after markets spiraled due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies, predicting an eventual “broad-based recovery.”
    


                    “First rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there: You can't lose money unless you sell. And right now the smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in,” Peter Navarro, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, said during an appearance on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
                





            “We are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we've ever seen under the Trump policies,” Navarro said.
    


On negotiating with other countries: CNN has reported that Trump officials are in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about potential bespoke trade deals. But asked about the possibility of striking deals to lift tariffs, Navarro said the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


            “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating,” he said.
    


            While Trump is “willing to listen,” the adviser told other countries, “Don't say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it. … It's the non-tariff cheating that matters the most, and when they want to talk to us, come talk to us about that.”
    


Some context: Navarro's comments reflect the administration's approach to calculating Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs: Rather than matching the taxes placed on US exports to each country, it has aimed to close trade deficits and address non-trade barriers that it deems unfair.
    


            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins heralded President Donald Trump's tariffs as a “new American economic plan” today, downplaying the uncertainty and extreme market volatility caused by the president's trade policy.
    


            In an interview on “State of the Union” with CNN's Jake Tapper, Rollins predicted a “really positive outcome” from the president's tariffs in “short order.”
    


            More than 50 countries, she said, have come to the table “willing and desperate to talk to us.”
    


            But pressed repeatedly by Tapper, Rollins was unable to clearly state whether the tariffs are here to stay or if there is room for negotiation with those countries.
    


            “We're two business days into this new American order. So I think we have a lot to be determined,” she said.
    


            Rollins said markets are still “adjusting,” after major sell-offs Thursday and Friday deepened concerns of a potential global recession.
    


            She also defended the administration's calculation of the tariffs, which have come under fire from conservative think tanks and others.
    


            “I have 100% faith in the formulas that they used and how they came up with these numbers,” she said of Trump and his top economic advisers.
    


            Rollins dismissed serious questions on why the administration placed tariffs on Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, which have zero human inhabitants and no imports or exports.
    


            The agriculture secretary also indicated there could be future support for farmers impacted by the tariffs, saying she'll work with lawmakers to secure funding similar to efforts to offset tariffs during Trump's first administration.
    


            At least a dozen more protests are planned at Tesla showrooms across the United States today as backlash continues against CEO Elon Musk for his Department of Government Efficiency's role in President Donald Trump's sweeping government overhaul.
    


            Some Tesla locations doubled as sites for “Hands Off!” rallies yesterday, the broader movement that saw huge crowds protest the Trump administration across the country and even in cities outside the US.
    


            The mass protests were organized by a pro-democracy movement made up of civil rights organizations, veterans, women's rights groups, labor unions and LGBTQ+ advocates.
    


            Yesterday's demonstrations followed weeks of events organized by the grassroots “Tesla Takedown” movement, which held more than 200 demonstrations at locations belonging to Musk's company last weekend alone.
    


            The Tesla Takedown campaign encourages Tesla drivers to sell their vehicles. It also urges company stakeholders to sell their shares of stock to hurt the world's richest man, whose wealth is mostly tied to the electric vehicle maker.
    


            The Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from Colombia, which is the world's third-largest coffee producer.
    


            CNN recently visited one of Colombia's coffee warehouses, as the new tax on its exports threatens to disrupt the South American nation's economy — and potentially the habits of US coffee drinkers.

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to the United States after a four-day visit to Hungary.
    


                    As he left Budapest, Netanyahu said he was headed to the White House at the invitation of US President Donald Trump to discuss “the hostages, completing the victory in Gaza, and of course the tariff regime that has also been imposed on Israel. I hope I can help with this issue. That is the intention.”
                





            Last week, the Trump administration imposed a 17% tariff regime on imports from Israel.
    


            CNN reported yesterday that Trump had extended the invite for a meeting tomorrow with Netanyahu. The leaders will meet at 1 p.m. ET on Monday, according to an Israeli official.
    


            The Trump meeting will also cover Israel-Turkey relations, Iran, and Israel's battle against the International Criminal Court, according to a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office.
    


            The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, alleging responsibility for war crimes in Gaza.
    


            As he visited the country, Netanyahu said Hungary was “a very close friend of Israel: it defends us in the European Union, it defends us in the United Nations, and no less so — in the corrupt International Criminal Court in The Hague.”
    


            Last week, Hungary withdrew from the ICC.
    


This post has been updated with the timing of Trump and Netanyahu's meeting tomorrow.



Correction: A previous version of this post misstated the length of Netanyahu's visit to Hungary. It was a four-day trip.



            After a whirlwind week dominated by news of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, you may have taken the start of your weekend off from the news.
    


            If you're getting up to speed this morning, we have some good reads to start with.

            Millions of people took part in protests against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk across all 50 states and globally on Saturday, organized by a pro-democracy movement in response to what they call a “hostile takeover” and attack on American rights and freedoms.
    


            Over 1,400 “Hands Off!” mass-action protests were held at state capitols, federal buildings, congressional offices, Social Security's headquarters, parks and city halls throughout the entire country – anywhere “we can make sure they hear us,” organizers said. “Hands Off!” demands “an end to this billionaire power grab.”
    


            “Whether you are mobilized by the attacks on our democracy, the slashing of jobs, the invasion of privacy, or the assault on our services – this moment is for you,” the event flyers state. “We are setting out to build a massive, visible, national rejection of this crisis.”
    


            Nearly 600,000 people had signed up to attend the events, some of which took place in major cities like London and Paris, according to Indivisible, one of the organizations leading the movement in collaboration with a nationwide coalition that includes civil rights organizations, veterans, women's rights groups, labor unions and LGBTQ+ advocates.
    


            Organizers say they have three demands: “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration; an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on; and an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for a statement.
    


            During the Hands Off! protest in Washington, DC, multiple representatives took to the podium to speak about the Trump administration, including Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who said there is no future with a president who has “the politics of Mussolini and the economics of Herbert Hoover.”
    


            “Our founders wrote a Constitution that does not begin with ‘We the dictators,' the preamble says ‘We the people,'” Raskin said in front of a crowd of thousands gathered at the Washington Monument, holding signs condemning the administration. “No moral person wants an economy-crashing dictator who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.”
    


            Rallygoers traveled from across the country in a show of force at the nation's capital over concerns of the administration's policies. Demonstrators on the National Mall chanted, “Hey ho, Trump's gotta go,” while holding signs reading “Protect our Constitution” and “Hands off our rights.”
    


﻿“If you want a country that still believes in due process, we have to fight for it,” said Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar at the Washington protest. “If you believe in a country where we take care of our neighbors, look after the poor and make sure our children have a future they can believe in, we have to fight for it.”
    


            Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost also spoke, urging people to take action by protesting, donating to mutual aid, participating in direction action and focusing on legislative strategies.
    


﻿“Throughout human history, authoritarians, they're never satisfied with the power they have, and so they test the bounds, they push the limits, they break the law, and then they look at the public to see if they're quiet or if they're loud,” said Frost
    


            In Los Angeles, protesters marched along a 1-mile loop toward City Hall, chanting “Power to the People” and wielding signs with messages like “Hands Off Education” and “Resist, Resist.”
    


            Since Trump took office, his administration has been vocal about its efforts to cut federal spending, regardless of who it may harm. Thousands of federal workers have been laid off or issued immediate termination notifications as part of Trump and Musk's plan to downsize the federal government.
    


            And Musk, the world's richest man, has aggressively pushed policies to reduce spending as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, all while repeatedly misleading the public about federal spending.
    


            He has also boasted that he put USAID — an agency that feeds some of the world's poorest, most desperate people and has saved millions of lives — “in the wood chipper.”

            Trump and his team have also taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, aggressively pressuring ICE to pick up the pace of migrant arrests and touting mass deportation plans despite the administration making multiple missteps in recent weeks, including mistakenly deporting a Salvadoran man.
    


            “They tell us that immigrants are stealing our jobs, but they're the ones shipping jobs overseas and hiring corporate lawyers to go and union bust,” said Frost.
    


            “They tell us that trans people are a threat to our children, but they're the ones dismantling public education. They're the ones denying the climate crisis. They're the ones poisoning our planet. They're the ones doing nothing about the national public health emergency of gun violence,” Frost added.
    


            The Trump administration has frequently questioned climate science and said it will roll back major climate policies, including rules that target pollution from vehicles and power plants, in a major blow to America's progress on clean air, clean water and climate action. Trump has also ordered the federal government to re-evaluate its gun policies and all ongoing litigation that could restrict Americans' gun rights.
    


            Frost called the current state of politics in America an “insidious rise of authoritarianism” fueled by “corrupt billionaires and mega corporations” who think they have a right to control all aspects of the lives of their citizens, including freedom of speech.
    


            The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian refugee﻿ whose green card was revoked over his involvement in demonstrations at Columbia University, has raised chilling questions about whether people can truly exercise their constitutionally protected right to free speech.
    


            “Our communities are paying the price while the Trumps and Musks of the world cash in. It's not just about money – it's about power,” Hands Off! organizers wrote. “This administration is targeting everybody who isn't part of the 1% – veterans, kids, seniors, farmers, immigrants, transgender people, and political opponents. All to consolidate power and reward their allies.”
    


            Although protests across the country were largely peaceful, in downtown Lafayette, Indiana, a man took a long gun out of his car and approached the crowd.
    


            Lafayette Police say the man attempted to make a lawful turn at an intersection near the Tippecanoe County Courthouse but was blocked by protesters in the street. The man got out of his truck and, according to the police statement, was headbutted by a protester after tensions escalated between him and the crowd of demonstrators.
    


            The man then returned to the truck and got a gun from his vehicle, which he later described as an act of self-defense, before placing it back in his truck, the statement reads.
    


            Lafayette police officers detained the man after receiving reports that he had pointed the weapon at protesters. However, police said that after investigating the incident, they determined he had not aimed the firearm at anyone and released him.
    


            Two federal employee union presidents spoke out on Saturday against Trump and his policies targeting federal workers at the protest in DC.
    


            “(The) Trump administration is absolutely destroying public services in this country. That's right. They claim to be making government more efficient,” said National Federation of Federal Employees President Randy Erwin. “That is a joke, people. That is a cruel joke. They're doing the exact opposite.”
    


            NFFE and the American Federation of Government Employees are a part of a coalition of unions that filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in San Francisco this week seeking to stop the Trump administration from ending collective bargaining rights for many federal employees.
    


            “They thought we were easy targets. But let me tell you something about union members and veterans. We will not be intimidated. I'm a veteran myself. I'm an Army veteran. We will not be silenced. We will not bow down. We'll stand up and say hands off our union. We'll stand up and say hands off our contract,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said.
    


            Erwin called the move by the Trump administration “the biggest assault on collective bargaining that we have ever seen in this country.”
    


            “AFGE has been in the courts, in the media, in Congress, and here with you on the street. And not only are we in the court, but we are kicking their behind while we're in the court, and we're going to continue to kick their behind,” Kelley said.
    


            Since taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the federal workforce. In one of his earliest moves, he ended remote work for government employees and agencies were provided guidance on how they can override union collective bargaining agreements on telework and remote work.
    


            At least 121,361 workers have been fired from federal agencies so far, as of CNN's latest tally on March 28.

NASHVILLE (AP) — Rivers rose and flooding worsened Sunday across the U.S. South and Midwest, threatening communities already waterlogged and badly damaged by days of heavy rain and wind that killed at least 18 people.

From Texas to Ohio, utilities scrambled to shut off power and gas, while cities closed roads and deployed sandbags to protect homes and businesses. 

In Kentucky, downtown Frankfort, the state's capital, was inundated. 

“As long as I've been alive — and I'm 52 — this is the worst I've ever seen it,” said Wendy Quire, the general manager at the Brown Barrel restaurant.

As the swollen Kentucky River kept rising on Sunday, officials closed roads and turned off power and gas to businesses in the city built around it, Quire said. “The rain just won't stop. It's been nonstop for days and days,” she said.

Forecasters warned that flooding could persist for days, as torrential rains lingered over many states, including Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. Tornadoes are possible in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, forecasters said.

The 18 reported deaths since the start of the storms on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee. A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky was caught up in floodwaters while walking to catch his school bus. A 5-year-old boy in Arkansas died after a tree fell on his family's home and trapped him, police said. A 16-year-old volunteer in Missouri firefighter died in a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.

The National Weather Service said on Sunday dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a “major flood stage,” with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. 




There were 521 domestic and international flights cancelled within the U.S. and more than 6,400 delayed on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday.

The storms come after the Trump administration has cut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.

Officials warned of flash flooding and tornadoes Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. 

In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking River. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.

The NWS said 5.06 inches (nearly 13 centimeters) of rain fell Saturday in Jonesboro, Arkansas — making it the wettest day ever recorded in April in the city, dating back to 1893. 

As of early Sunday, Memphis had received 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain since Wednesday, the NWS said. West Memphis, Arkansas, received 10 inches (25 centimeters).

Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.

In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities.

Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.

“I grabbed all my stuff and came here,” said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: “I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.”

Izaguirre reported from New York. Associated Press writers Bruce Schreiner in Shelbyville, Kentucky, Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, and Sophia Tareen in Chicago, contributed to this report.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Sorry guys, “Phi Slama Jama” is already taken. How 'bout something simple, like “Comeback Kids.” 



“National champs” might be a possibility, too.



Houston's no-room-to-breathe defense wiped away a 14-point deficit over the final eight minutes, erased Cooper Flagg and Duke's title hopes and brought the Cougars within a win of a championship of their own Saturday night with a 70-67 stunner over the Blue Devils.



Led by Joseph Tugler's four blocks and an amoeba-like defense that smothers everything, Houston held Duke to a grand total of one field goal over the last 10 1/2 minutes. The 67 points were Duke's second-lowest output of its now-ended season. 



The Blue Devils' second-to-last attempt during their contest-ending 1-for-9 stretch was a step-back jumper in the paint by Flagg that J'Wan Roberts disrupted. The last was a desperation heave by Tyrese Proctor that caught nothing at the buzzer and sent Flagg and company shuffling off in shock.



“We just had to keep that belief and keep the faith,” said L.J. Cryer, who won a title with Baylor in 2021 and led the Cougars in this one with 26 points. 



This is the program's first trip to the final since 1984 — which marked the official close of the Phi Slama Jama era, a fun-and-gun dunkfest that never won the title despite the efforts of Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, who was at the Alamodome for this one.

Lots has changed since then. One constant: Defense wins championship. 



Houston has allowed the fewest points this season and even against Duke, with Flagg, Kon Knueppel (16 points) and a roster with five or six NBA prospects, it made things impossible down the stretch.



“Got to give them a lot of credit for what they do every single night they play,” Flagg said. “We could have been a little bit more sharp down the stretch executing some things. At the end of the day, you got to give them a lot of credit, as well.”



It was Roberts' two free throws with 19.6 seconds left that gave the Cougars their first lead since 6-5. Cryer made two more to push the advantage to three. That matched Houston's biggest lead of the night.



The Cougars (35-4), who have never won a title, will play Florida on Monday night for the championship.



Florida's 79-73 win over Auburn in the early game was a free-flowing bundle of fun. This one would've looked perfect on a cracked blacktop and a court with chain-link nets. Neither team cracked 40% shooting.



That's just how Houston likes it.

It closed the game on a 9-0 run over the final 33 seconds, and though Flagg, the AP Player of the Year, finished with 27 points, he did it on 8-for-19 shooting and never got a good look after his 3 at the 3:02 mark put the Blue Devils (35-4) up by nine.



“Knowing going into that game that he was the player of the year, that he brought his team to the Final Four, we knew it would be challenging,” Roberts said. 



Trailing 64-55, things looked dire for the Cougars. But they were just getting started.



A team that prides itself on getting three stops in a row — calling the third one the “kill stop” — strung together two stretches like that, broken up only by Flagg's 3. 



Duke settled for a measly three free throws over the final 3 minutes. One came when Tugler got a technical for batting the ball from Sion James' hands as he was trying to throw an inbounds pass.



That didn't make things any better for the Blue Devils.

On the possession following the technical, Tugler rejected Knueppel, then Emanuel Sharp (16 points) made a 3 to cut the deficit to three.



Mylik Wilson stole the next inbounds pass and missed a game-tying 3, but Tugler tipped it in to cut the deficit to one.



Proctor missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 20 seconds left to set the stage for the Roberts free throws.



Duke's slow walk off the court came through a phalanx of Houston fans who waved goodbye to Flagg, who will likely be off to the NBA as the first pick in the draft. 



Houston held Duke to 37.5% shooting in the second half; that was nearly 20% lower than its first four games of the tournament, which included a blowout over the nation's best offense, Alabama, in the Elite Eight.



“We held that team to 67 points,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said, marveling at what his team had done.



The Cougars finished with six steals and six blocked shots, and a bunch more altered by Roberts and Tugler, who might be the best shot blockers to wear that Cougars uniform since Olajuwon himself. 



There are no stats, however, for the heart Houston showed after the country's best player had all but buried them with 8 minutes to go. 



“Cooper was not going to beat us by himself,” Sampson said. “Even when we were down 14, these guys will tell you what I was talking about in the huddle was, ‘Just hang in there, hang in there.'”











The huge comeback also netted a $1 million win for artificial intelligence. An AI disruptor bet a professional gambler that his program could do a better March Madness bracket, and it all came down to the Duke-Houston game. 



Even if the Houston loses in the final, the AI bracket will get more points in the contest and the disruptor, Alan Levy, will pocket the million bucks.

Car-manufacturing town in UK worries about impact of new tariffs announced by Trump

LONDON (AP) — The maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the U.S. as Britain's struggling auto industry begins to respond to the 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by President Donald Trump. 



Jaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain's biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month.



“The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands,” the company said in a statement. “As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.”



Analysts said they expect other British carmakers to follow suit as the increased tariffs heap more pressure on an industry that is already struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles.



“I expect similar stoppages from other producers as firms take stock of what is unfolding,” said David Bailey, an automotive industry expert and professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham.



The number of cars made in the U.K. dropped 13.9% to 779,584 vehicles last year, according to the SMMT. More than 77% of those vehicles were destined for the export market. U.K. factories export cars such as Nissan's Qashqai and Juke, BMW Mini, and Toyota Corolla, as well as Land Rover and Jaguar models.

“The industry is already facing multiple headwinds and this announcement comes at the worst possible time,” Mike Hawes, chief executive of the U.K.'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said last week. “SMMT is in constant contact with government and will be looking for trade discussions to accelerate as we need to secure a way forward that supports jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.”






U.K. carmakers have already taken steps to lessen the immediate impact of the tariffs by building stockpiles in the U.S. before the increase took effect. SMMT figures show that exports to the U.S. jumped 38.5% from a year earlier in December, 12.4% in January and 34.6% in February.



“This was manufacturers like JLR trying to get ahead of the game in terms of getting inventory to the U.S. before the tariffs were implemented,'' Bailey said.



British carmakers shipped 8.3 billion pounds ($10.7 billion) worth of vehicles to the U.S. in the 12 months through September, making cars the single biggest goods export to the U.S., according to government statistics.



But cars make up a relatively small part of overall trade between Britain and the U.S., which is heavily weighted toward services.



Britain exported 179.4 billion pounds ($231.2 billion) of goods and services to the U.S. in the year through September, with services making up 68.2% of that figure.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Not even 24 hours after his party lost a key Wisconsin race and underperformed in Florida, President Donald Trump followed the playbook that has defined his political career: He doubled down.

Trump's move Wednesday to place stiff new tariffs on imports from nearly all U.S. trading partners marks an all-in bet by the Republican that his once-fringe economic vision will pay off for Americans. It was the realization of his four decades of advocacy for a protectionist foreign policy and the belief that free trade was forcing the United States into decline as its economy shifted from manufacturing to services.

The tariff announcement was the latest and perhaps boldest manifestation of Trump's second-term freedom to lead with his instincts after feeling his first turn in the Oval Office was restrained by aides who did not share his worldview. How it shakes out could be a defining judgment on his presidency.

The early reviews have been worrisome.

Financial markets had their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign trade partners retaliated and economists warned that the import taxes may boost inflation and potentially send the U.S. into a recession. It's now Republican lawmakers who are fretting about their party's future while Democrats feel newly buoyant over what they see as Trump's overreach.

Democratic activists participated in rallies across the country Saturday in the largest demonstrations since Trump returned to office in January. “The winds are changing,” said Rahna Epting, who leads MoveOn, one of many organizing groups.




Trump is unbowed. 

He has promised that the taxes on imports will bring about a domestic manufacturing renaissance and help fund an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. He insisted Thursday as the Dow Jones fell by 1,600 points that things were “going very well” and the economy would “boom,” then spent Friday at the golf course as the index plunged 2,200 more points.

The White House stayed the course Saturday. “This past November, America resoundingly rejected the business-as-usual policies coming out of D.C.,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai, adding, “The entire Trump administration is aligned on delivering on President Trump's mandate to reject the status quo.”

In his first term, Trump's tariff threats brought world leaders to his door to cut deals. This time, his actions so far have led to steep retaliation from China and promises from European allies to push back.

Even some Trump supporters are having their doubts.

Frank Amoroso, a 78-year-old resident of Dewitt, Michigan, said he is concerned about short-term rising interest rates and inflation, although he believes the tariffs will be good for the country in the long run.

Amoroso, a retired automotive engineer who voted for Trump, said he would give the president's second-term performance a C-plus or B-minus. “I think he's doing things too fast,” he said. “But hopefully things will get done in a prudent way, and the economy will survive a little downfall.”

Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., in a telephone town hall with constituents Thursday night, expressed reservations about the broad nature of the tariffs.

Hill, who represents a district that includes Little Rock, said he does not back tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He said the administration should instead focus on renegotiating a U.S. trade agreement with its two neighbors.

“I don't support across-the-board tariffs as a general matter, and so I don't support those, and I will be urging changes there because I don't think they will end up raising a bunch of revenue that's been asserted,” Hill said. “I wish I thought they did, but personally I don't think they will. But I do support trade diplomacy.”

Still, much of Trump's “Make America Great Again” coalition remains publicly supportive.

Doug Deason, a prominent Texas-based Republican donor, said he loves the president's tariff plan, even if it causes some economic disruption. 

“He told us during the election there would be pain for every American to get this ship turned around,” Deason said. “It is hard to watch our portfolios deteriorate so much, but we get it. We hope he holds course.”

As Trump struggles with the economy, Democrats are beginning to emerge from the cloud of doom that has consumed their party ever since their election drubbing in November.

They scored a decisive victory in Wisconsin's high-profile state Supreme Court election on Tuesday, even after Elon Musk and his affiliated groups poured more than $20 million into the contest. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker then breathed new life into the Democratic resistance by delivering a record 25-hour-long speech on the Senate floor that centered on a call for his party to find its resolve.

Booker told The Associated Press afterward that a significant political shift has begun even as his party tries to learn from its mistakes in the 2024 presidential election.

“I think you're seeing a lot more energy, a lot more determination, a lot more feeling like we've got to fight,” Booker said. “You can't sit back any more. You can't sit on the sidelines. There's a larger, growing movement.”

Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate, acknowledged he is not ruling out a 2028 run, although he said he is focused on his 2026 Senate reelection for now.

There is broad agreement among Democrats — and even some Republicans, privately at least — that what Trump has unleashed on the global economy could help accelerate the Democratic comeback.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive resistance group known as Indivisible, has been critical of Democratic officials' response in recent weeks to Trump's leadership. But on Friday, he was somewhat giddy about the political consequences for Trump's GOP after the tariffs announcement.

“Raising prices across the board for your constituents is not popular,” Levin said. “It's the kind of thing that can lead to a 1932-style total generational wipe out of a party.”

Crowds of people angry about the way President Donald Trump is running the country marched and rallied in scores of American cities Saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain its momentum after the shock of the Republican's first weeks in office.

So-called Hands Off! demonstrations were organized for more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists. The rallies appeared peaceful, with no immediate reports of arrests.

Thousands of protesters in cities dotting the nation from Midtown Manhattan to Anchorage, Alaska, including at multiple state capitols, assailed Trump and billionaire Elon Musk ‘s actions on government downsizing, the economy, immigration and human rights. On the West Coast, in the shadow of Seattle's iconic Space Needle, protesters held signs with slogans like “Fight the oligarchy.” Protesters chanted as they took to the streets in Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles, where they marched from Pershing Square to City Hall. 

Demonstrators voiced anger over the administration's moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close Social Security Administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs.

Musk, a Trump adviser who runs Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X, has played a key role in the downsizing as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. He says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars.




Asked about the protests, the White House said in a statement that “President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.”

Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign advocacy group, criticized the administration's treatment of the LBGTQ+ community at the rally at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where Democratic members of Congress also took the stage.

“The attacks that we're seeing, they're not just political. They are personal, y'all,” Robinson said. “They're trying to ban our books, they're slashing HIV prevention funding, they're criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives.” 

“We don't want this America, y'all,” Robinson added. “We want the America we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us.”

In Boston, demonstrators brandished signs such as “Hands off our democracy” and “Hands off our Social Security.”

Mayor Michelle Wu said she does not want her children and others' to live in a world in which threats and intimidation are government tactics and values like diversity and equality are under attack.

“I refuse to accept that they could grow up in a world where immigrants like their grandma and grandpa are automatically presumed to be criminals,” Wu said.

Roger Broom, 66, a retiree from Delaware County, Ohio, was one of hundreds who rallied at the Statehouse in Columbus. He said he used to be a Reagan Republican but has been turned off by Trump.

“He's tearing this country apart,” Broom said. “It's just an administration of grievances.”

Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, a few miles from Trump's golf course in Jupiter, where he spent the morning at the club's Senior Club Championship. People lined both sides of PGA Drive, encouraging cars to honk and chanting slogans against Trump.

“They need to keep their hands off of our Social Security,” said Archer Moran of Port St. Lucie, Florida.

“The list of what they need to keep their hands off of is too long,” Moran said. “And it's amazing how soon these protests are happening since he's taken office.”

The president golfed in Florida Saturday and planned to do so again Sunday, the White House said.

Activists have staged nationwide demonstrations against Trump and Musk multiple times since Trump returned to office. But before Saturday the opposition movement had yet to produce a mass mobilization like the Women's March in 2017, which brought thousands of women to Washington after Trump's first inauguration, or the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that erupted in multiple cities after George Floyd's killing by police in Minneapolis in 2020.

In Charlotte, North Carolina, protesters said they were supporting a variety of causes, from Social Security and education to immigration and women's reproductive rights.

“Regardless of your party, regardless of who you voted for, what's going on today, what's happening today is abhorrent,” said Britt Castillo, 35, of Charlotte. “It's disgusting, and as broken as our current system might be, the way that the current administration is going about trying to fix things — it is not the way to do it. They're not listening to the people.”

Among thousands marching through downtown San Jose, California, were Deborah and Douglas Doherty.

Deborah, a graphic designer, is a veteran of the 2017 Women's March and was nervous that fewer people have turned out against Trump this time. “All the cities need to show up,” she said. “Now people are kind of numb to it, which is itself frightening.”

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Two All-Americans, one chance to give their their team a chance to win a national championship.

Florida's NCAA Tournament continues thanks to more magic from guard Walter Clayton Jr. in the Gators' 79-73 victory Saturday night at the Final four. For Auburn and forward Johni Broome, their season ended in tears and frustration wrapped up in missed shots, missed dunks and a sleeve covering a sore right elbow.

As he left the court, Broome heard some quiet words from the greatest player in Auburn history, Charles Barkley.

“He thanked me for what I've done for Auburn. He told me to keep my head high,” Broome said. “Coming from a guy like him … means a lot.”

Florida (35-4) advanced to Monday night's championship game against Houston (35-4), which beat Duke 70-67 in the second semifinal. 

While Clayton was stitching together another tapestry of jaw-dropping scoring, weaving through the lane for layups and popping 3-pointers over smothering defenders as he scored 34 points, Broome's strong start faded badly.

He still had his right elbow wrapped in a sleeve after an injury in the South Region final against Michigan State. Broome is a left-handed shooter and had said this week he didn't have any pain, but he often look uncomfortable, even as he muscled his way to the basket early.

Broome would sometimes clutch the elbow, or keep it at his side when he ran the court. He used his left arm to waive at the Auburn crowd to get loud, not his right. 




But other times, he would grab a rebound with both hands or even scored an on a tough, right-handed layup.

“Here and there it was bothering me a little bit,” Broome said. “But nothing I couldn't deal with.”

Broome started well with 12 points in the first half, but just scored just three more on four shots in the second half. The Southeastern Conference player of the year averaged a double-double this season but finished with just seven rebounds.

His frustration showed late when he lowered his shoulder into Florida's Alex Condon and sent the Gators forward flying. Broome, who had manhandled Condon in the first half, was called for a foul. 

Broome was later denied a dunk, and then missed two free throws with 2:02 to play that would have cut the Gators' lead to 71-70.

When the game ended, Broome bent over with cameras beginning to surround him to capture his reaction. He eventually stood up to shake hands, then walked off the court with his eyes red from crying and pulled up his jersey to wipe his face.

Barkley eventually stepped in with his words of encouragement.

Florida coach Todd Golden said Broome and the Tigers were more physical in the first half, but but then denied Auburn's big man the same shots in the second half.

“We stuck around and were hanging around, but felt like we were getting knocked around a little bit,” Golden said. “But we controlled the second half.”

Clayton and the Gators, meanwhile, move on to the championship game Monday night.

Clayton was virtually unstoppable again, as he scored at least 30 points for the second consecutive game, slicing through the defense for layups or popping 3-pointers even with defenders in his face.

“The guys trust me to take those shots and sometimes they fall,” Clayton said.

Clayton was 11 of 18 from the field, making 5 of 8 3-point attempts. He made all seven free throws. His 3-pointer early in the second half helped spark a 9-0 run that tied the game after Auburn looked ready to run away.

“I haven't really had time to reflect on what I've been doing,” Clayton said. “I've just been focused on winning games.”

Golf influencer Paige Spiranac is not afraid to flaunt what she's got and on Friday she sent a clear message with a shirt she wore while chatting with a friend.

Samantha Marks posted a photo of Spiranac's shirt while the two talked on FaceTime. Marks wrote on X that she just noticed what it said.

Spiranac had, ""Yes they're real,"" emblazoned across her chest.

Spiranac has been clear about working on her fitness goals and clapped back at a critic last week on X who was upset that the golfer was showing off a little more than what was in her golf bag.

""I went from having my back connect to my thighs to this,"" Spiranac wrote on X while contrasting photos of what she looked like at the start of her golf career and what she looks like now. ""It's not the biggest peach now but I've been working harder than I ever have in the gym and also with my diet. 

""Heck yeah I'm going to show it off! I'm proud of my body and how hard I've been working to achieve my fitness goals.""

She's routinely fired back at comments about her golf attire and the way she's dressed. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in September 2023, she explained why she wears what she does.

KORN FERRY GOLFER RYAN MCCORMICK TAPES MOUTH SHUT DURING TOURNAMENT TO HELP WITH ANGER MANAGEMENT

""I was a gymnast before I switched into golf,"" the former All-Mountain West Conference golfer said. ""I was so comfortable wearing spandex and very little of it because that's just what you wear when you're wearing a leotard and you're competing. 

""When I switched into golf, we were struggling a little bit financially and so I didn't have the luxury to go out and buy a whole new golf-appropriate wardrobe. And so, I wore what was in my closet which was workout clothes. That's just how I learned to play the game.""

In July 2023, she called out the ""hypocrisy"" of comments in a video showing two half-naked baseball players on the mound. She noted that the players weren't getting negative comments about what they were doing.

""Interesting how different the reaction is online when men choose to show off their bodies,"" she wrote on X at the time. ""Not one comment on this video calling them attention whores or sluts. Just a ton of women saying baseball is now their favorite sport but those same women harshly judge me. The hypocrisy lol.""

Republican Ohio Rep. Michael Rulli speaks to Fox News Digital about how President Donald Trump's recent tariffs are already revitalizing Rust Belt communities.

President Donald Trump unveiled his latest tariff plan last week on ""Liberation Day,"" which the administration said will restore the American Dream and spark an economic boon for U.S. workers. 

""American steel workers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen,"" Trump said from the White House Rose Garden last Wednesday afternoon in his announcement. ""We have a lot of them here with us today. They really suffered, gravely. They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American dream. We had an American dream that you don't hear so much about. You did four years ago, and you are now. But you don't too often."" 

""Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt,"" he continued. ""And it will all happen very quickly. With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again, greater than ever before. Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.""

The Trump administration's tariff plan leveled a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S., while customized tariffs were set for countries that have higher tariffs in place on American goods. The baseline tariffs of 10% took effect on Saturday, while the other tariffs will take effect on April 9. 

HOW WE GOT TO LIBERATION DAY: A LOOK AT TRUMP'S PAST COMMENTS ON TARIFFS

Trump pointed to the European Union during his announcement, and explained the U.S. will charge the EU a 20% tariff, compared to its 39% tariffs on the U.S. Japan will see 24% tariffs, compared to the 46% the country charges the U.S., while China will be hit with a 34% tariff, compared to the 67% it charges the U.S.

The customized tariffs, Trump explained, would not be full reciprocal tariffs, as his administration was ""very kind"" and leveled tariffs that are roughly half of what a particular nation was charging the U.S. on tariffs. 

""For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,"" Trump said Wednesday. 

HERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT

""And because we are being very kind, we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,"" he said. ""So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. I could have done that. Yes. But it would have been tough for a lot of countries.""

Fox News Digital examined the full tariff list and spoke to experts about who stands to lose the most due to the tariffs, and who will likely benefit and tackle the new tariffs victoriously.

Fox News Digital spoke with Samir Kapadia, a managing principal at the lobbying and advisory firm the Vogel Group, who explained Vietnam will likely lose the most business due to the upcoming tariffs. 

""Vietnam has long been an amicable trade partner with the United States for a variety of sectors, whether that would be textiles and apparel or computers and consumer electronics, but there has been a gross inequity in the bilateral trade relationship. Vietnam simply doesn't have the economy or the resources to import from the United States and to… provide that reciprocity,"" Kapadia explained. 

Vietnam charges the U.S. a 90% tariff on imported goods to the nation. The Trump administration last week announced the Southeast Asian country will face a 46% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. 

Vietnam's industries are also deeply rooted in Chinese business investments, Kapadia said.

""To add insult to injury, they also have been a hot bed for Chinese investment. Since the imposition of the Section 301 tariffs under the first Trump administration, which were these large-scale tariffs on Chinese imports, you had a whole number of Chinese companies across a variety of industries in the consumer product segment basically invest, instead, in factories in Vietnam as a way to circumvent paying tariffs, so the Chinese would keep their market share, but just go and make it in another country,"" he explained.

Trump signed a memo under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in 2018 under his first administration targeting Chinese goods for U.S. tariffs in response to Chinese theft of American intellectual property, Trump said at the time. 

""This was by far the worst day for the Vietnamese government, in the sense, they're realizing that that door has now closed. A 46% tariff – Vietnam is not an attractive country to import from. The numbers won't work,"" Kapadia said of the new rounds of tariffs targeting Vietnam. 

The Asian nation has already felt the pinch, and called on Trump to delay the tariffs from taking effect this weekend.

AFTER TRUMP TARIFFS, JPMORGAN RAISES CHANCE OF RECESSION TO 60%

Vietnam's leader To Lam wrote a letter to Trump on Saturday, the New York Times reported, asking him to delay the imposition of the tariffs for at least 45 days and for the pair of world leaders to meet in Washington, D.C., in May ""to jointly come to an agreement on this important matter, for the benefit of both our peoples and to contribute to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.""

The ""biggest losers"" from Trump's Wednesday announcement are ""without question"" China and Vietnam, Kapadia said. 

China was hit with a 34% tariff as part of Trump's announcement last week, which is in addition to previous tariffs leveled on the nation. Kappadia said the newest upcoming tariff and the ""high-band"" tariffs of 45% on some Chinese goods puts the country's tariff barrier at about 75% to 80%, which Kapadia predicted could grow to 150% by the end of 2025. 

""That's because there's just a lot of ongoing challenges with China that have not begun to kind of roll-out or get resolved, and ultimately the United States is going to have to continue to pressure U.S. companies to invest more in the United States, and the only way to do that is to continue to put pressure on China,"" Kapadia said. 

The trade expert continued that other nations, particularly European export sectors, could also see fallout from the tariff plan in regard to luxury products or household purchases, but that it's too early to predict where the chips will fall with Europe. 

""I think that that might resolve itself over time, depending upon how the Europeans behave. From what we've seen, just early next week, we're going to have some dignitaries and officials from Europe come and visit the president to negotiate on a potential resolution. All in the meanwhile, they are threatening a retaliatory 20% tariff to kind of make this tit-for-tat based on the reciprocal tariff announcement, but we know from the president that all that's going to do is turn the 20% that we put on Europe to 40%,"" he said. 

Kapadia pointed to India and Japan as the two nations that will benefit from Trump's tariff plan last week. 

HERE'S A CLOSER LOOK AT TRUMP'S TARIFF PLAN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DUTIES

""We have seen both the Japanese head of state and the Indian head of state come to Washington and provide the president with opportunities where they would then reduce their own tariff barriers,"" he said. 

""Just a week before this announcement, Prime Minister Modi came out and provided a whole list to the government… that says, 'Here are all the things that I'm going to reduce, in terms of tariffs of U.S. exports to India' And so I think that's going to continue. And I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries,"" he added. 

Trump unveiled a 27% tariff on India on ""Liberation Day"" and a 24% tariff on Japan.

""I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries, whether that's India and the U.S. or Japan and the U.S., and honestly serves to the U.S.' benefit to rectify some of those tariff barriers with India,"" he said. ""It is the largest democratic country in the world, and they are strategic ally for geopolitical reasons and a number of other considerations. And so they're going to be a country that I think we have to watch and really see how they negotiate their way through this new tariff regime."" 

Kapadia pointed to a handful of U.S. companies that operate in India, such as Lego, Apple and Goldman Sachs, and predicted companies that have made large-scale investments in India will likely stay there, while they will likely move other overseas operations in nations facing even higher tariffs, such as Vietnam, to India. 

TRUMP TOUTS RETURN OF ‘AMERICAN DREAM' IN HISTORIC TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT 

""You name it, a whole slew of U.S. companies have made concerted, large-scale investments in India. I think that they're going to stick to them. I think they're going to grow there. And if you look at the difference, just on our arbitrage basis, 46% versus 26% – that's a big Delta. So if you're Apple, and you're making Apple technology, Apple-related products in Vietnam, and you're importing at 46%, or you're making it in India at 26%, you're obviously going to double down on your India effort,"" he said.

Kapadia continued that Trump's latest tariff policies target corporate America, which opens the doors to which industries will move back to U.S. soil to avoid the tariffs. He pointed to ""critical industries"" such as semiconductor manufacturing, critical minerals, aluminum and steel manufacturing delivering large-scale investments in the U.S. both this year and next year, to increase capacity and production ""out of necessity."" He noted that Trump's customized reciprocal tariffs are not stackable with existing tariffs on certain industry imports, such as steel and aluminum.

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP'S 11TH WEEK IN OFFICE

""That's going to be the opportunity for the jobs to be created, for the investment to happen. Whereas on the multilateral kind of, 'Hey, here's our new kind of blended rate for these 60 odd countries,' that's just going to be finding more equity with a foreign direct investment from those countries,"" he said. 

In America's Rust Belt, which stretches from Illinois to upstate New York, critical industries are ramping up production under the second Trump administration and locals are excited after decades of old industrial towns economically suffering, Ohio Republican Rep. Michael Rulli told Fox News Digital in an exclusive Zoom interview.

""They did a study by the Census Bureau in 1949, and they looked at the top 20 most influential cities that were prosperous in the United States. And I want you to think about some of these names on this [list]. They're names like Buffalo, Detroit, Cleveland, Youngstown, Allentown, Pittsburgh. That isn't the case anymore. For the 50 years after that, we saw both political parties celebrate putting jobs across in other countries,"" Rulli said. 

Rulli reflected on 1977's ""Black Monday"" in Youngstown, Ohio, when steel manufacturer Campbell Works of Youngstown Sheet and Tube shuttered its doors and left thousands of workers unemployed in a chilling move that is still felt in the area today. 

TRUMP TARIFFS SPARK 'EXCITING TIME' FOR OHIO STEEL PLANT AS CEO EYES ADDING JOBS, BOOSTING PRODUCTIVITY

""We have Vallourec up in Youngstown, Ohio, that's making all the pipe that you use for fracking. And that's really exciting,"" Rulli said. ""When you put energy first, it ties in with the whole Ohio six. We're gonna start building power plants, cracker plants. We're going to put America back on the map with energy. And it's all happening with this agenda that's going right in front of your eyes. And it starts with tariffs. Remember, we have to have a starting place for 'Art of the Deal.' And the president has put that bar very high. We have every ability to negotiate fair trade deals with these other countries right now.""

DEMOCRAT REP VOWS TO WORK WITH TRUMP ON KEY PART OF TARIFF PLAN: 'HOPING THAT I CAN HELP'

""Two weeks ago, I spent several hours touring the entire steel mill and how incredible it was in Mingo Junction, Ohio, actually the birthplace of my grandma. So it was like sort of a full circle. We're bringing back steel in America. How about that? And they're re-looking at it. They're being very specific. It's almost like a boutique steel making process and they're expanding. It's really a great triumph,"" he said. 

With jobs, Rulli argued, crime and addiction woes that have plagued the nation in recent years will fall, while generations of families that previously worked in the steel industry can carry on the tradition,

""This is Art of the Deal. In the 1950s, America was at its highest point ever. And what we've done since then is pretty much gutted the working-class, blue-collar. And I think the people in my district realized this, you know, when we see some of these tariffs that are put on the United States, that they put 60, 70, 80% tariffs on us, and we send our product to them with no tariffs. I think this is the greatest, basically, reconfiguration of trade that has ever happened in American history. And it's very exciting, especially if you go by the America First agenda,"" he said.

Fox News Digital spoke in New York City to anti-Trump protesters participating in nationwide 'Hands Off' demonstrations against the administration's policies on tariffs, government downsizing and immigration.

NEW YORK– Over 1,200 protests spanning all 50 states took place on Saturday, rallying against President Donald Trump's administration, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), reciprocal tariffs, federal layoffs and immigration reform. 

Fox News Digital spoke with protesters in New York City about why they were demonstrating, what they hoped their protesting would accomplish and if they had been personally affected by DOGE. 

""[I'm] protesting how horrible things have become in our country,"" said May, who lives in Manhattan and held a sign she was reusing from protesting Trump's first term. ""I mean, we've been taken over by a bunch of robber barons who are trying to take away all of our rights, benefits, and liberty.""

May joined thousands of others in New York City's Bryant Park, who also carried signs which opposed budget cuts and Project 2025, while supporting Planned Parenthood and chanting critiques against the administration.

""I am protesting what is happening with this blessed country, the democracy that was advanced democracy now in transition to a dictatorship, and we are almost in a fascist state right now — only because the rule of law is bending right now, and it may break,"" shared Yalena, who is from Ukraine and has lived in the U.S. for over three decades. 

One resident from Ridgewood, Queens, Mary, held a sign that stated ""Stop Republican Chaos.""

""I am outraged,"" Mary said. ""The Republicans in Congress are enabling Trump to do many, many things. Everything he's doing is wrong, and they know it, and they are enabling it. The Republicans must go. They're causing chaos. People have to vote blue for every office, always."" 

When asked what she hoped the protest would accomplish, Marty from Yonkers, who considers herself to be ""a proud higher education ‘diversicrat,'"" said she wanted people to know that everyone is ""ticked off.""

""I mean, this isn't just you sitting at home in your jammies being ticked off. A lot of people are, and it goes back to ‘you don't agonize, organize,'"" she told Fox News Digital.

Last weekend, over 200 ""Tesla Takedown,"" protests were also organized around the U.S. to rally against Trump-appointed DOGE head, Elon Musk, and the department's related budget cuts.

Several protesters, including Josh from Queens, said they hadn't been personally affected by the DOGE budget cuts, but noted that everyone knew someone who had — especially in education and science.

""I have a lot of friends who are teachers [and] the cuts from the Department of Education are pretty scary … I work directly with special needs students, and I'm worried that some of that funding might be cut as well,"" he told Fox News Digital. 

Trump has seen his poll numbers slip in recent weeks, although he has generally seen better numbers thus far than at any point during his first presidency. His administration has moved at a breakneck pace since January on his initiatives, and Trump's team has remained confident that his various moves on issues from trade to immigration to government downsizing will benefit the nation long-term.

Wendy, a professor living in New Jersey, said she was particularly concerned about cuts to higher education and science. 

""I know scientists who have had grants cut, significant grants cut,"" she said. ""Grants that help get women into science, and girls interested in science and grants that help move science and knowledge forward in the United States."" 

On DOGE's ""Agency Efficiency Leaderboard,"" which details which government agencies have saved the most from canceled contracts and other methods to cut costs, the Department of Education ranks in second place. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) ranks in 13th place, as of March 30.

According to DOGE, it claims on its site it has saved Americans $140 billion, or $869.57 per taxpayer, while critics say it's been opaque about its methodology and accounting.

""I haven't been affected, but I used to work at the NIH and a lot of my colleagues have been fired as a result, so scientific research is being halted because of DOGE,"" said one unnamed, masked protester, holding a sign which had the scientific symbol for ""resistor."" 

""Hands Off!"" is a grassroots movement supported by civil rights groups, labor unions and other advocacy organizations and is described on its website as a ""nationwide mobilization to stop the most brazen power grab in modern history."" The protests that took place this weekend are being regarded as the largest nationwide display of opposition since Trump began his second term and occurred just after the Trump administration implemented a baseline duty of 10% on all imports to the U.S.

Vice President JD Vance elaborates on U.S. relations with European nations and more during an exclusive interview on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

Following Vice President JD Vance's warning that Europe was at risk of ‘engaging in civilizational suicide,' the continent has come under the microscope for largely failing to deal with mass migration from mostly Third World countries. Associated with that has been a massive rise in violent crime and a failing economy. 

Freedom of speech is under attack as many complain of a two-tier justice system and, making things even more problematic, Europe's economy is not performing as expected.  

The U.K.'s economy has remained stagnant for the last three years with no growth in per capita income. ""The country has pathetic performance, says Ben Habib, chairman of the Great British Political Action Committee, and former co-deputy leader of Reform UK. ""The U.K. has become even worse than Europe.""

Migration is now a national talking point. Immigration increased to between 1.2 and 1.3 million in 2022 and 2023, up from around 800,000 before the pandemic. It's causing friction.

""National togetherness is now being torn to shreds as unprecedented levels of mass migration transform parts of our country beyond recognition,"" observed Conservative Party Member of Parliament Robert Jenrick in a column for the UK Conservative & Reformer Post. ""We have imported ethnic and religious tensions, meaning that conflicts on the other side of the world play out on Britain's streets.""

Earlier this week, the State Department said it was monitoring the case of a woman in Britain who was put on trial for holding a sign offering counseling to women outside an abortion facility in the United Kingdom. 

Fox News Digital reported the woman said, ""Great Britain is supposed to be a free country, yet I've been dragged through court merely for offering consensual conversation … peaceful expression is a fundamental right—no one should be criminalized for harmless offers to converse.""

Violent assaults have also marred many parts of the U.K., when compared to other members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD.) Scotland topped the list with 1,487 assaults per 100,000 people, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. England and Wales ranked number three on the list with 730 violent assaults per 100,000 residents.

Fox News Digital previously reported that Britain was facing a free speech crisis due to the new left-leaning government, overzealous policing and courts cracking down on freedom of expression. Last August, the government warned its citizens to be mindful of posting content deemed offensive and threatened imprisonment. The Crown Prosecution Service posted a warning to social media platform X, which was amplified by the government's official social media accounts, warning citizens, ""Think before you post!""

France's economy has expanded in each of the last four years, but the rate of growth slowed dramatically. France also has a high debt level that will make it hard for the economy to grow fast, Venetis says.

Migration is a continuing problem in France with an influx of 317, 000 immigrants from outside the EU in 2022, up from 222,000 in 2013.

Right-wing politicians, such as those in the National Rally, are highlighting the friction that the influx of people who don't want to integrate into French society. National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, who up until this week was a leading candidate for the country's 2027 presidential election, was just given a two-year prison sentence by a French court, which found her and other party colleagues guilty of embezzling public funds. Le Pen called the sentence a ‘death sentence,' and said she felt they were ""only interested"" in preventing her from running for president.

Violent assaults in France ranked near the middle of the OECD list with 310 cases per 100,000 in the population.

Germany's economy has been in a recession for the last two years. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate increased to 6.3% in March, from 5.9% last April. That's partly due to soaring energy prices and competition from China.

""People are not happy about the fact that unemployment is picking up,"" says Konstantinos Venetis, an economist at TS Lombard. He also says the statistics mask many workers' reduced paid hours on the job. ""The amount of people on this status has gone up considerably.""

TRUMP CELEBRATES CONSERVATIVE PARTY WIN IN GERMANY

Migration surged to 1.6 million non-EU immigrants in 2022, up from less than half a million in 2021.Germany's right-wing populist AfD party has pushed to deport migrants seeking asylum, and its message gained traction with voters during February's national election, where it came in second with 20.7% of the vote. The winning conservative Christian Democrats party was forced to adopt stronger immigration policies as a result of AfD's success with voters.

The country had a relatively high number of violent assaults, ranking sixth in the OECD list with 630 cases per 100,000 people.

The third-largest economy in the EU has grown every quarter since the end of the pandemic, although, like many countries, the rate of growth has slowed. 

At the same time, the debt level as a percentage of GDP dropped to 135% last year versus 138% in 2022 when Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni took over.

Meloni has been credited with her hard stance on illegal migrants. In 2024, the number of migrants totaled 67,317, down almost 60% from 157,651 the previous year. The drop is at least partly due a deal between Italy and Albania to enhance border controls, creating legal ways to immigrate and deterring illegal entry to the country. 

Violent assaults were low at 110 per 100,000 residents.

EUROPE'S BEST KEPT SECRET: POLAND, THE REGION'S ECONOMIC TIGER

Poland's economy grew by 2.9% last year, slightly more than the estimated 2.8% growth in the U.S., all while beefing up its defense sector and housing an influx of Ukrainians due to the Russian-Ukrainian war.""Poland is a powerhouse and has national pride,"" Habib says. ""It's a phenomenal country.""

The country also has a low level of asylum requests of 9,513 and 17,038 in 2023 and 2024, respectively. That compares to 237,314 in neighboring Germany.

Levels of asylum claims in Poland are likely to remain low as Prime Minister Donald Tusk doubled down on illegal immigration. Late last month (March) he temporarily suspended the rights of immigrants to claim asylum. 

""I believe that it is necessary to strengthen the security of our borders and the security of Poles,"" said Poland's President Andrzej Duda, who signed off on the bill, as reported by Euro News.

Migration from outside Europe has remained low at 57,000 in 2022 versus 45,000 in 2023. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban recently tweeted: ""Don't be afraid to stand alone. When 26 others accepted mass migration, we built a fence and said no. Now, more and more PMs are saying exactly what Hungary said ten years ago—they've realized we were right.""

Violent assaults in Hungary ranked low with 124 cases per 100,000 people.

Heart surgeon Dr. Jeremy London cooks a Greek-inspired chicken salad for dinner and a chia strawberry protein pudding for dessert.

If your day has gotten off track and you find yourself skipping breakfast, lunch or dinner, you've likely heard your stomach grumbling.

Do you eat then or wait until your next proper meal?

Fox News Digital spoke to nutritionists who shared key information about ideal meal timing.

BREAKFAST SHOULD BE YOUR BIGGEST MEAL OF THE DAY, HERE'S THE LATEST INSIGHT ON WHY

Dig right in …

Most Americans consume two or three meals on a given day, while more than 90% of people consume two or three snacks per day, according to research about eating frequency, said Dawn Menning, a California-based registered dietitian with the Nutu app.

More than 90% of Americans eat two or three snacks per day, according to studies. (iStock)

""Meal timing can have a significant impact on overall health due to its influence on the body's circadian rhythm (24-hour cycle), which helps to regulate metabolism, energy levels, weight and even long-term health outcomes, such as the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease,"" Menning told Fox News Digital.

A great deal of research has been done to determine how meal timing impacts our health — and if intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating has more of an impact on overall health and weight compared to calorie restriction, Menning said.

HIGH-PROTEIN FOODS, ALCOHOL-FREE DRINKS TOP LIST OF HEALTH TRENDS

Research suggests that spacing meals appropriately can support stable blood sugar levels, improve digestion and enhance overall metabolic function, said Ro Huntriss, a London-based registered dietitian and chief nutrition officer of the Simple app.

Most individuals can wait four to six hours between meals to support health and weight management, Huntriss said.

Most people can wait four to six hours between meals, a nutritionist told Fox News Digital. But some people need or prefer a shorter time than that. (iStock)

Some people prefer a shorter time between breakfast and lunch and a slightly longer gap between lunch and dinner, she told Fox News Digital.

""Ultimately, it's important to take note of your hunger signals and when it feels appropriate for you to eat,"" she said.

High-meal frequency (eating six or more times per day) has been linked to increased disease risk, likely due to constant fluctuations in blood sugar and insulin levels — while a longer fasting period between meals supports the body's natural processes, Huntriss said. 

The window between meals should be slightly shorter, says one expert. 

""By following a more structured meal pattern with appropriate fasting windows, you not only support better blood sugar regulation, you also foster metabolic flexibility and improved circadian health,"" she said.

Yet Menning believes the window between meals should be slightly shorter. Eating every three to four hours, she said, is ideal for helping with blood sugar regulation, aiding digestion and maintaining energy levels.

Research suggests that healthy individuals should aim for at least a 12-hour time span between dinner and breakfast the next morning, Menning said.

Curbing late evening eating is likely a good move for your health as well.

Eating at night ""can negatively affect glucose metabolism and potentially increase the risk of metabolic disorders,"" Menning said.

Other studies suggest that eating meals earlier and within a shorter time window has more of an effect on weight loss compared to eating meals later and in longer time windows, she said.

Eating at night ""can negatively affect glucose metabolism and potentially increase the risk of metabolic disorders,"" said one dietitian (not pictured). (iStock)

Eating earlier in the day can improve glucose metabolism, lower inflammation and support processes like autophagy (cellular repair) and stress resistance, Huntriss said.

""This aligns with findings that a regular meal pattern, which includes breakfast consumption and a reduced meal frequency, has positive physiological effects, such as improved gut microbiota modulation and reduced disease risk,"" she said.

Private investigator Steve Ridge discusses the latest updates in the case of missing Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit.

Jodi Huisentruit, a 27-year-old Iowa news anchor, vanished nearly 30 years ago. As authorities continue searching for her remains, a private investigator is pushing to unseal case records.

Huisentruit, a native of Long Prairie, Minn., was on her way to work as a morning anchor at KIMT-TV in Mason City, Iowa, when she disappeared in the early morning of June 27, 1995.

Over the years, private investigator Steve Ridge has pushed for the courts to unseal records relating to the case.

On March 27, Senior Judge James M. Drew in Cerro Gordo County ruled to partially unseal a 2017 search warrant connected to Huisentruit's disappearance, while keeping the supporting affidavit under seal to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.

Ridge's attorneys, Nellie O'Mara and Jesse Marzen, sought to unseal records related to GPS tracking devices placed on two vehicles tied to John Vansice. Vansice has long been considered a person of interest in the investigation, but he has never been charged in the case.

The vehicles, a 1999 Honda Civic and a 2013 GMC 1500, were reportedly registered at the Arizona address where Vansice was living in early 2017. The vehicles did not exist at the time Huisentruit's disappeared in 1995.

Judge Drew denied the motion to reopen the court record to support unsealing the search warrant. The court ordered that the affidavit must remain sealed, since the investigation remains active.

The court noted that the affidavit might reveal information only the perpetrator would know, such as specific times, items found or scene details. It added that an unsealed affidavit could help potential suspects ""know what to hide.""

SEARCH FOR MISSING NEWS ANCHOR EXPANDS AFTER AUTHORITIES GET NEW TIP

The judge stressed that, even after 30 years, public curiosity alone does not justify jeopardizing an active investigation.

READ THE ORDER:

Huisentruit's family released a statement on the Jodi's Hope Facebook page, saying they do not support unsealing the documents.

""As a family, we've received a number of inquiries about the legal battle currently playing out in the courts with Jodi's case,"" the family said in a statement. ""Without getting too deep into the weeds, we all agree that if the release of the information would hinder the investigation in any way, then the search warrant should remain sealed.

""We are not onboard with the information being released to the public, especially while the investigation is open and ongoing. We do recognize there are a number of differing opinions on this – we respect that and ask that you respect ours as well. At this time, this is our only public comment to make on this matter.""

Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., discusses the Trump administration acknowledging it mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

The Trump administration has placed a Justice Department (DOJ) lawyer on leave for not ""zealously advocating"" its position in the case involving a Salvadoran man living in Maryland who was mistakenly deported last month. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi's office placed Erez Reuveni, who argued for the government, in Friday's hearing in which a judge ruled Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be returned to the U.S. by Monday, on indefinite paid leave, Fox News has learned. 

""At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States,"" Bondi told the New York Times in a statement. ""Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences."" 

Fox News Digital has reached out to the DOJ for comment. 

JOHN YOO URGES TRUMP ADMIN TO ‘WORK OUT A DEAL' TO RETURN MISTAKENLY DEPORTED INDIVIDUALS

(U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland via AP)

Reuveni on Friday admitted that Garcia's deportation was a mistake, according to the New York Times. 

On Saturday, the Trump administration argued in an emergency appeal that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis can't force the administration to return Garcia to the U.S. 

Xinis on Friday ruled that the government must make arrangements to have Garcia back in the U.S. before Monday at midnight.

The Saturday emergency appeal seeks to temporarily stay Xinis' decision until the government has time to properly appeal the ruling. 

""Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the United States to force El Salvador to send one of its citizens – a member of MS-13, no less – back to the United States by midnight on Monday. If there was ever a case for an emergency stay pending appeal, this would be it,"" the government wrote in the emergency appeal reviewed by Fox News Digital. 

The government also argued that it ""does not have control over"" Garcia now that he is in El Salvador. 

""Nevertheless, the court's injunction commands that Defendants accomplish, somehow, Abrego Garcia's return to the United States in give or take one business day,"" the appeal said, calling it ""indefensible.""

The filing said that the ""lacked the power"" to require the government ""on the clock, to try to force a foreign country to take a discrete action.""

It added, ""Abrego Garcia has been found to be a member of a designated Foreign 3 Terrorist Organization, MS-13. Given that status, he has no legal right or basis to be in the United States at all."" 

VANCE DOUBLES DOWN AFTER TRUMP ADMIN ADMITS ‘ERROR' SENDING MAN TO SALVADORAN PRISON

Xinis on Friday said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's March 15th expulsion of Garcia violated the Administrative Procedures Act, since it occurred without a judicial proceeding.

The Trump administration has acknowledged Garcia's removal was an ""administrative error,"" but has also defended it, alleging that Garcia has ties to MS-13.  

""This individual is an illegal criminal who broke our nation's immigration laws. He is a leader in the brutal MS-13 gang, and he is involved in human trafficking,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing on Tuesday. 

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said all government lawyers are required to ""zealously advocate"" on its behalf.  (REUTERS/Nathan Howard)

""And now MS-13 is a designated foreign terrorist organization. Foreign terrorists have no legal protections in the United States of America. And this administration is going to continue to deport foreign terrorists and illegal criminals from our nation's interior,"" she added. 

An immigration judge five years ago said Garcia, who came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 and asked for asylum, could not be deported to his home country, over concerns he would become a victim of local El Salvador gang members.

His request for asylum was denied, but he was given protection from deportation and ICE didn't appeal the decision. 

Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who is a U.S. citizen, has vigorously campaigned for his return. 

Garcia had been working as a sheet metal apprentice in Maryland and was arrested in an IKEA parking lot on March 12 while his 5-year-old son was in the car.

His lawyers have argued the man had a Department of Homeland Security permit to work in the country, and strongly deny any gang affiliations. They also say that the government has given little evidence to back up its claim. 

There was no indication how the government would comply, since he is incarcerated in an El Salvador prison under that government's custody.

Incoming Deputy Assistant to the President for Minority Outreach Lynne Patton speaks on how she'll serve the Trump administration and opens up about her personal story of perseverance on 'My View with Lara Trump.'

Incoming Deputy Assistant to the President for Minority Outreach Lynne Patton is looking forward to spearheading her new role to ensure President Donald Trump builds upon his promises to support Black, Latino and other traditionally left-leaning communities that showed up to the polls in droves to cast ballots for him last November. 

Sitting down for an exclusive interview that aired during ""My View with Lara Trump"" on Saturday, she outlined what transformations she intends to make upon taking the reins next month, and expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to facilitate change.

""I think when you see him [Donald Trump] announcing Alice Johnson as the pardon czar, I think, when you see him announcing Paula White as [the leader of] the faith-based initiative inside the West Wing, it's clear that you're going to see a lot of collaborating going on,"" she said.

In her downtime, Patton is working with Ja'Ron Smith, the architect of what she called the ""most comprehensive criminal justice reform in over 30 years"" from the first Trump administration.

""I look forward to seeing where we can take that to the Second Step Act,"" she added, referencing the First Step Act, a bipartisan federal prison reform bill passed by Congress and signed into law during Trump's first term in 2018.

Patton's conversation with Lara Trump also ventured into her journey to becoming a Republican after 9/11, contrasting with her Democratic parents and how the Trump family helped her find her way after struggling with substance abuse and addiction.

Last week, nationwide protests targeted Elon Musk for his role in dismantling government agencies and firing federal workers through the White House DOGE Office.

This week, they are targeting the man who gave him that role: President Donald Trump.

In coordinated demonstrations that organizers said took place across all 50 states, the ""Hands Off!"" protest accused Trump and his administration of championing policies that benefit the rich while making life harder for everyone else.

Business Insider sent reporters to protests in different parts of the country to hear from them directly. Many said they were most worried about the economy and their retirement investments, which have dwindled in tandem with Trump's tariff announcements.

Trump says the tariffs will help jump-start US manufacturing, promote US goods, protect jobs and ultimately create more of them. He has urged Americans to wait out the initial market volatility and price increases.

That has, however, so far done little to alleviate fears. Here's what protesters told us and what surprised us the most.

As I rode the train from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, the subway car filled with protesters, their cardboard signs bumping up against umbrellas on a rainy Saturday in New York.

By 1 p.m., the 42nd Street station was even more crowded than usual. Older people clutched slippery canes, and young kids clutched their parents' hands. One man wore a once trendy Harris Walz camo hat. Another waved a small American flag, an unusual display of patriotism at anti-Trump rallies.

The damp horde of protesters shuffled toward Bryant Park, and in some ways, it all felt familiar. There were chants about abortion, signs featuring the face of now-deceased Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a progressive icon, and a steady cacophony of car horns.

But some things were different this time.

For one, the crowd looked older, with middle-aged Americans seeming to outnumber the 20-somethings that dominated rallies during the pandemic. It makes sense since many Americans are watching their retirement savings dwindle in the face of crashing markets and worry that staff cuts to the Social Security Administration could impact the crucial safety net.

While the anti-government protests held during Trump's first term focused on social issues — like abortion and civil rights issues — many of the signs today targeted the economy.

Most of the people I spoke to didn't want to share their last names because they worried about their privacy in the current political environment. Yet they weren't shy about their rage and despair.

Dorothy Auer, 62, told me she wished people would get angrier.

""I've been working for over 40 years, and I looked at my investments yesterday — my retirement plan — and I literally don't think I'll ever be able to retire,"" she said, starting to choke up.

Wiping her eyes with her free hand — the other held a black and white sign bashing Musk — Auer told me it's distressing to see a man of such wealth ""turn around and crap on us.""

Jian, 33, held a sign that read, ""Tariffs are killing my 401(k),"" but he told me he's most upset about what's happening to his retired father.

""My dad just lost about 25% of his savings in the last three days because of the tariffs,"" he said.

It's not just the economy, of course, that brought thousands of people out to Midtown Manhattan.

Penny, 54, said the Trump administration affected virtually every issue she cares about. Even so, we ended up talking about Musk.

""I'm horrified that a person who wasn't born here, wasn't elected, seems to be getting carte blanche to do whatever he wants in our government,"" she said. ""How did he get a security clearance?""

Most of those I talked to as they slowly trudged toward Madison Square Park didn't think the protest would change Trump's mind.

A few said they hoped Congress would pay attention, but more than that, people said they felt they needed to do something.

""Even if it's sort of hopeless right now, at least it's showing people that we're here,"" Pyare, 49, told me. ""And that we don't like it.""

Another week, another protest.

On Saturday, I attended the Hands Off! rally in Novi, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit where 55% of the vote went to Kamala Harris during the election. Thousands of people showed up.

The crowd was emotionally charged and united by the spirit of collective action. Many attendees said they were first-time protesters. The Tesla Takedown protests I attended last weekend seemed somber by comparison. Protesters here got loud.

""Call me Old Lady Army Fighting for Democracy,"" one 66-year-old woman, who didn't want to give her real name, told me. She held up a sign she had made. It was a charcoal drawing of the Statue of Liberty, whose hands covered her eyes in shame.

""I just copied this off of Facebook,"" she said. But to her it symbolized that ""everything that our country stands for is being destroyed, and the world is looking at us.""

Liana Gettel, 58, said she was outraged for several reasons, including the administration's stance on abortion. She said she had an abortion 29 years ago.

""I had lost a child. The child would not come out on its own. So I had to have a procedure. Had I not had that procedure, I wouldn't be here,"" she said. ""And that's what they want to block, is things like that?""

Protesters targeted many different issues, including abortion, trans, and minority rights. One protester holding up a sign for trans rights said, ""Trans people are just the appetizer, but everyone will be on the menu now.""

The line echoed remarks made by human rights advocate Channyn Lynne Parker at the Rally for Trans Visibility in Chicago last weekend.

Unlike protests during Trump's first term, which focused on social issues, however, many people today were also worried about the president's economic policies.

Matt Watts said he was protesting Musk's takeover of Social Security and Trump's tariffs on ""countries that don't deserve it."" After the stock market began to take a hit from all the talk of tariffs, Watts said he took his money out of his 401(k) and invested it into a more stable fund. ""I'm getting ready to retire pretty soon. I've got to count on that savings,"" he said.

Most protesters were middle-aged or older, but they captured some younger activists with their energy.

Yajat Verma, 18, said he hadn't known about the protest but was driving by with a friend when he saw the crowd. He decided to join in and started handing out water bottles to protesters.

""Everyone should be protesting,"" he said.

Protesters crowding together near the San Francisco City Hall had much to be angry about.

On one end of the 150,000 square-foot Civic Center Plaza, a man's voice boomed through the microphone about the dangers of fascism and how it was time for people to go ""on the offensive.""

On the other end was Michelle Gutierrez Vo, president of the California Nurses Association, warning folks about Trump's move to strip federal workers of their union rights.

With so many grievances against the current administration in the air, some protesters resorted to bullet-point lists of the issues on large signs.

That spoke to one of the concerns for Maria, a 67-year-old San Francisco resident who declined to provide her last name.

""My focus has been a lot about the environment,"" Maria told BI, later adding, ""There's so much going on right now, but I know it's important to try and stay focused on one thing and hope other people are focused on the other things.""

Maria's friend chimed in, saying she was worried about her Social Security, which she said she had been paying into for six decades.

For Frida Ruiz, 18, a student at the University of San Francisco who held a sign that read ""Billionaire Cucks,"" Trump's stance on immigration hits close to home as a daughter of Mexican immigrant parents.

For George Chikovani, a 42-year-old SF resident, who came to protest with his wife Lisa Isola, 40, and their three-year-old and 10-months-old children, his most personal issue was the Ukraine war.

""My grandmother is from Ukraine and then I grew up in Georgia, so that cause has felt very personal to me. I still have family and friends there,"" Chikovani said.

At least 7,500 people gathered near city hall on Saturday afternoon, according to an officer with the San Francisco Police Department. 

As my colleague observed in New York, older millennials and seniors made up large swaths of the crowd. Some came out in full costumes, sticking true to SF's colorful character.

Maria, who is also a member of Third Act, a left-leaning political advocacy group focused on mobilizing senior voters, said she was encouraged by people who came out to protest but was ""hoping to see more.""

""We need more younger people to come,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Getting a job is hard. A trade war is only going to make it harder.","https://www.businessinsider.com/tariffs-make-job-market-harder-worse-workers-trump-trade-war-2025-4","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:18:00 GMT","

An expanding tariff fight could push the US job market from meh to miserable.

Michelle Budnick, a documentary filmmaker in New York, worries that her search will get harder. The 47-year-old has been looking for full-time production work for over two years.

Budnick told Business Insider that the uncertainty created by steeper trade barriers — and the attendant specter of weaker consumer spending — will likely further reduce how much companies are willing to spend on production.

""It's like pouring tar on top of syrup. We're just going to drown under this,"" said Budnick, referring to workers like herself in creative fields.

While it's too soon to say precisely what economic contrails might become visible across the job market after President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on April 2, economists told Business Insider that uncertainty will likely push some employers to curtail hiring.

""It's kind of a frozen market,"" Andrew Flowers, chief economist at Appcast, told BI. ""There's going to be even less hiring and maybe an increase in firing.""

For months, the prospect of a trade war has sat like unexploded ordnance alongside some companies' business plans. Now that Trump is moving ahead with tariffs, including a baseline 10% levy, the impact could be profound.

""We're starting to see maybe more feelings that, 'Hey, this wasn't a negotiation tactic, and that these tariffs are likely here to stay,'"" Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told BI.

Flowers said that some of the sluggishness that has afflicted white-collar hiring for years could overtake other parts of the job market.

He said a few areas that had been strong, like healthcare, are likely to remain so. Yet industries that had been relative bright spots, including retail, transportation and warehousing, and some corners of manufacturing — one purported domestic beneficiary of tariffs — could get whacked, Flowers said.

US employers are already bringing on workers at the slowest pace in nearly a decade, Stahle said. On top of that, the number of job postings in the US has declined, he noted.

At the end of December, listings had risen to about 12% above their pre-COVID-19 levels, Stahle said. Then, from early January to the end of March, openings drifted downward to about 8.2% above their pre-pandemic levels.

Flowers said industries like finance, insurance, tech, and professional services, which he said have been experiencing a ""white-collar recession"" for two to three years, might not get hit as hard because they're already somewhat weak and because the impact of tariffs might be indirect.

One bright spot is that overall layoffs remain low, even with broad cuts in the offing for federal workers.

However, Flowers said, the biggest impact on workers could come from lackluster hiring.

""There will be job cuts because of these tariffs, but almost proportionally more impactful is the fact that there won't be hiring because of these tariffs,"" he said.

Flowers said in a worst-case scenario, where tariff retaliation spills into a tit-for-tat global trade war, layoffs would be likely.

""The steepness of the tariff rates have spooked investors and have spooked business leaders,"" Flowers said.

Any impact will be in addition to the job and spending cuts the White House is attempting to make in government agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency advisory group run by Elon Musk.

A White House spokesperson said in a statement to BI that tariffs are a ""critical"" part of the president's economic agenda.

""The administration is also slashing regulations, pushing tax cuts, and unleashing American energy to drive down energy costs — policies that will also usher in economic and job growth as they did during the first Trump presidency,"" the spokesperson said.

Stahle said a greater risk than the hit from tariffs could be the uncertainty they create, especially if that leads businesses to pull back on hiring and spending or pushes consumers to lock away their wallets.

""If people are feeling that it's going to absolutely destroy things, and they act off that expectation, it could end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" he said, referring to the fallout from tariffs.

That precarious atmosphere was increasingly evident Friday. The March jobs report showed greater gains in US hiring than forecast, alongside downward revisions to job growth for the start of the year.

Yet, global markets plunged for a second day, with the benchmark S&P 500 index losing more than 10% in two days.

Many investors are now looking past pre-tariff data points and focusing instead on the prospects for a business environment where global trade might be hemmed in by protectionist tendencies.

""Month-old data increasingly feels like ancient history now,"" Stahle said, referring to the March jobs report.

For Budnick, the filmmaker, a key concern is that tariffs could make business owners less willing to spend on the type of content she produces. Already, she's struggled. Prior to February 2023, Budnick hadn't gone without full-time work for a dozen years.

""You wonder what the future is going to hold,"" she said. ""Where is this going to go if people cannot support their families?""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I moved to Thailand and started a business with my husband. When work slows down, we fully embrace island life.","https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-corporate-careers-moved-thailand-island-life-2025-4","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 09:05:00 GMT","

I'm from Pennsylvania and studied interior design before moving to LA for work. My husband, Justin, is from Chicago and studied architecture before making the same move.

We met in 2010 at Walt Disney Imagineering, a segment of The Walt Disney Company that focuses on theme park design.

Fifteen years later, we're based in Thailand and run our own business. We love the pace of life in Asia.

It was a pivotal moment for us. Not only were we working in a different country, but we could travel all over Asia.

We started to find our love for travel and experiencing different Asian cultures, including visiting Thailand several times. We moved back to LA in 2016 but were eager to find a reason to return to Asia.

I designed interiors for private jets at Gulfstream in New York City, and Justin designed restaurants in Miami before his job took us to Singapore.

We had a lovely life there, especially in terms of safety, efficiency, and cleanliness, but we still hadn't moved on from our US-based corporate lifestyle.

We worked around the clock, barely spending much downtime together because it was all about making money to afford to live the Singapore lifestyle.

Our condo was nice, but we have a Rottweiler named Raja, and sharing common walls was also hard.

We immediately fell in love and began speaking with real estate agents because we wanted to buy a vacation home there.

Then, we started thinking about quality of life and our end goal. Did we want to keep climbing the corporate ladder, or focus on our happiness and creative freedom?

We live where some of the most recent season of ""The White Lotus"" was filmed.

We love the show and were thrilled to hear that season three was being filmed in Koh Samui. Several of our friends were on set as extras.

We can't wait for the finale. It's been exciting to recognize familiar places on the island featured on TV.

Our visa is called a 'Smart Visa.' Our program is designed to attract startup entrepreneurs investing in targeted industries.

Moving our dog was the most important thing. We'd had support with our relocations to Shanghai and Singapore, but we had to do it ourselves for Thailand.

Ever since we decided to move here, we haven't looked back.

House hunting in Koh Samui is very different from LA. There's no centralized database; less than 50% of properties are listed online. Many homes are sold through word of mouth.

Renovations were difficult, too. Coming from an urban environment with much more routine, structure, and predictability, getting used to doing something on an island can be challenging.

The experience made us much more adaptable and flexible. Whereas things in the past may have been frustrating, now we can laugh it off.

We took Mandarin lessons when we lived in China and thought they might help, but they've made it more confusing, as some words are similar but have completely different meanings.

We want to be conversational in Thai, but English is fairly widespread here.

We run a studio called SnobBirds. We work remotely, with most projects based in the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong. We have a truly flexible schedule and are available for clients whenever they need us.

Our work is entirely project-based, so our hours fluctuate. Some weeks are intense (60+ hours), while others are lighter (20 hours). We regularly worked 70-80 hours a week in our corporate jobs.

The biggest difference now is control — we choose projects we're passionate about and pass on those that aren't a good fit. When work slows down, we can fully embrace island life.

We do a lot of road trips and take the ferry to the mainland to drive into Thailand.

Koh Samui is quite diverse. The exposure to the international community is part of what drove us to come to this island because you get a taste of both worlds.

We came here because we wanted to experience a new culture and foods and learn a new language. We didn't want to be comfortable.

You can get great Thai food for under $10; great seafood along the coast is a little more expensive.

The food quality is excellent. However, cheese and imported beer, wine, and spirits are 50% to 75% more expensive. There's also variety, as there's a lot of international food on the island, especially from the expat community.

The community is very tight-knit. We don't know many places where you'll shop at the same grocery store in the morning with a local restaurant owner.

We bought our house in LA, now a rental, for just over $1M in 2017 by taking out a loan and 30-year mortgage. The house in Koh Samui was one-third the cost, and we purchased it outright with cash in 2023.

Our cost of living in Koh Samui is significantly lower since our house is paid off, and we share a car without a car payment.

Since we still have our house in California, if we need to split our time more for our business or family, we can.

Our families have been great about visiting us and love having the excuse to experience more of Asia.

We imagine we'll return home at some point, but there's no end date right now.

Julian Emanuel, the firm's chief equity and quantitative strategist, lowered his year-end forecast on the benchmark equities gauge to 5,600 points, roughly 10% above Friday's closing level of 5,074, after President Donald Trump's sweeping moves on tariffs roiled global financial markets and spooked investors for two trading sessions.

Lawrence Summers warned a ”drop of this magnitude signals that there's likely to be trouble ahead.” 

There's a good chance that markets will see more turbulence ahead similar to what happened on Thursday and Friday, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote in a post on X Sunday. 

“This was the fourth largest two day move since the second World War,” said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV. “The other three were the 1987 crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID pandemic. A drop of this magnitude signals that there's likely to be trouble ahead, and people ought to just be very cautious,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

European Union countries will seek to present a united front in the coming days against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, likely approving a first set of targeted countermeasures on up to $28 billion of U.S. imports from dental floss to diamonds.

Such a move would mean the EU joining China and Canada in imposing retaliatory tariffs on the United States in an early escalation of what some fear will become a global trade war, making goods more expensive for billions of consumers and pushing economies worldwide into recession.

The 27-nation bloc faces 25% import tariffs on cars and steel and aluminium, and ""reciprocal"" tariffs of 20% from Wednesday for almost all other goods.

Trump's tariffs cover some 70% of the EU's exports to the United States — worth in total 532 billion euros ($585 billion) last year — with likely duties on copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and timber still to come.

The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, will propose to members late on Monday a list of U.S. products to hit with extra duties in response to Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs rather than the broader reciprocal levies.

It is set to include U.S. meat, cereals, wine, wood and clothing as well as chewing gum, dental floss, vacuum cleaners and toilet paper.

One product that has received more attention and exposed discord in the bloc is bourbon. The Commission has earmarked a 50% tariff, prompting Trump to threaten a 200% counter-tariff on EU alcoholic drinks if the bloc goes ahead.

Wine exporters France and Italy have both expressed concern. The EU, whose economy is heavily reliant on free trade, is keen to make sure it has broad backing for any response to keep the pressure up on Trump ultimately to enter negotiations.

Luxembourg will earlier on Monday host the first EU-wide political meeting since Trump's announcement of the sweeping tariffs when ministers responsible for trade from the 27 EU members will exchange views on the impact and how best to respond.

EU diplomats said the main aim of the meeting was to emerge with a united message of a desire to negotiate with Washington a removal of tariffs, but a readiness to respond with countermeasures if that failed.

""Our biggest fear after Brexit was bilateral deals and a break of unity, but through three or four years of negotiations that did not happen. Of course, here you have a different story, but everyone can see an interest in a common commercial policy,"" one EU diplomat said.

Among EU members, there is a spectrum of opinion on how to respond. France has said the EU should work on a package going well beyond tariffs and French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested European companies should suspend investments in the United States until ""things are clarified.""

Ireland, almost a third of whose exports go to the United States, has called for a ""considered and measured"" response, while Italy, the EU's third largest exporter to the U.S., has questioned whether the EU should hit back at all.

""It's a difficult balance. Measures cannot be too soft to bring the United States to the table, but not too tough to lead to escalation,"" one EU diplomat said.

Talks with Washington to date have not borne fruit. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic described his two-hour exchange with U.S. counterparts on Friday as ""frank"" as he told them U.S. tariffs were ""damaging, unjustified"".

The initial EU counter-tariffs will be put to a vote on Wednesday and will be approved except in the unlikely event that a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU's population oppose it.

They would enter force in two stages, a smaller part on April 15 and the rest a month later.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will also hold separate discussions on Monday and Tuesday with chief executives from the steel, automotive and pharmaceutical sectors to assess the impact of tariffs and determine what to do next.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday dismissed concerns Americans might be having about a potential impending recession and the status of their retirement plans, saying that President Donald Trump and his administration are ""building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.""

During an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Bessent called it a ""false narrative"" that Americans who are close to retiring may be reticent to do so after their retirement savings may have dropped this week due to the stock market downturn.

""I think that's a false narrative,"" he told moderator Kristen Welker. ""Americans who want to retire right now, the Americans who put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations.""

""In fact, most Americans don't have everything in the market,"" Bessent added. ""People have a long-term view ... the reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day to day, week to week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.""

More from NBC News:

Bessent said he wasn't concerned about the stock market's negative reaction this week to Trump's announcement that he was imposing tariffs as high as 54% on the U.S.' largest trading partners

""The market consistently underestimates Donald Trump,"" Bessent told Welker.

He added later in the interview, ""Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week. What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity and I think the previous administration had put us on the course toward financial calamity.""

In the days following Trump's tariff announcement, the U.S. stock market plunged, with the Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 marking losses that haven't been seen since the start of the Covid pandemic.

On Saturday, in the wake of the market downturn, Trump defended his tariff plan, urging consumers and investors to ""hang tough.""

""We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic,"" the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Asked about how long Americans will have to live with this economic uncertainty and ""hang tough,"" Bessent said that the Trump administration is ""going to hold the course"" to impose the tariffs and bring down inflation but didn't say how long that would take.

""This is an adjustment process,"" he said. ""What we saw with President [Ronald] Reagan when he brought down the great inflation, and we got past the [President Jimmy] Carter malaise, there was some choppiness at that time, but he held the course, and we're going to hold the course.""

Bessent added that the previous ""unsustainable system"" of trade was also to blame for today's economic uncertainties, telling Welker that ""this has been years in the building, years in the making, this unsustainable system.""

""Our trading partners have taken advantage of us. We can see that through the large surpluses. We can see this through the large budget deficits,"" the secretary said.

Pope Francis on Sunday made his first public appearance since being discharged from hospital two weeks ago after treatment for double pneumonia, entering St. Peter's Square at the Vatican in a wheelchair to greet crowds.

Francis, 88, had been out of public view since March 23, when he gave a short greeting before leaving Rome's Gemelli hospital after more than five weeks of treatment in the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy.

Whether to buy cryptocurrency as a long-term holding may be the biggest decision an investor interested in digital assets has to make, but where to store crypto like bitcoin can become the most consequential.

Following the wildfires earlier this year in California, social media posts began to appear with claims of bitcoin losses, with some users showing metal plates intended to protect seed phrases burnt up and illegible or describing the complexity of recovering crypto keys stored in a safety deposit box in a bank impacted by the fires. While impossible to verify individual claims about fires consuming hard drives, laptops and other storage devices containing so-called hard and cold storage crypto wallets and seed phrases, what is certain is that bitcoin self-custody presents a unique set of security issues. And those risks are growing.

Holders of crypto typically use some form of what can be called a ""wallet,"" and there are a few main features – whether that wallet is connected to the internet, and how much control is directly embedded in the wallet for trades and transfers. There is also the underlying issue of whether a crypto investor uses a third party for custody at all, or maintains total custody and trading control over their holdings.

The standard third-party platform ""hot wallet"" – think of an offering from a Coinbase or Blockchain.com – is constantly connected to the internet. Cold storage and ""cold wallets,"" on the other hand, include hardware devices (like a USB stick) that holds private keys offline, or even just a seed phrase (a master recovery code, a collection of 12 to 24 words used to recover access to a crypto wallet) on paper/metal. Hardware wallets or offline backups of seed phrases can be used to access crypto when connected to the internet through another device.

With third-party custodial options, there are steps to help owners remain vigilant against the threat posed by cybercriminals who can gain access to an internet-connected platform, including the use of two-factor authentication, and strong passwords. The U.S. Marshals Service within the Department of Justice, which is responsible for asset forfeiture from U.S. law enforcement, uses Coinbase Prime to provide custody for its seized digital assets.

Many crypto bulls prefer to self-custody digital assets like bitcoin for some of the same reasons they are interested in cryptocurrencies to begin with: lack of faith in some forms of institutional control. Custodial wallets from crypto brokers trade convenience for the risk of exchange hacks, shutdowns, or fraud, as in the case of the high-profile implosion of FTX. And the wildfires are just one example in a recent string of global events that raise more questions about shifts in the crypto custody debate. There is the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine war, which has led crypto bulls from overseas to re-think their approach to self-custody.

Nick Neuman, co-founder and CEO of self-custody company Casa, said physical risks in the world like a natural disaster are an opportunity to revisit how bitcoin security works, and the common security lapses folded into most peoples' practices. ""Most people secure their bitcoin with one private key. If that key is on a single device or written down on paper as a seed phrase, it's a single point of failure. If you lose that key, your bitcoin is gone,"" he said.

It should be obvious that keeping seed phrases on paper offers the lowest level of protection against fire, yet it is common practice, Neuman said. Slipping these pieces of paper into fireproof bags or safes offer some protection, but not much, and even going the extra steps to have the seed phrases on ""indestructible"" metal storage plates presents a few failure points. For one, they might prove to be not so indestructible, and second, they may be impossible to locate amid the rubble. 

""Logically, given the location of the fires in California and the stories being shared on X, it's highly likely bitcoin was lost,"" said Neuman. ""Some of them are pretty convincing,"" he said.

Casa performs annual stress tests on seed phrase backups.

Some self-custody services, like Casa, offer multi-signature setups that reduce the risks of single-point failure. A multi-key crypto ""vault"" can include mobile phone keys, multiple hardware keys, and a recovery key that a company likes Casa holds on an owner's behalf.

The multi-sig custody approach allows an owner to hold a majority of keys while a trusted partner holds a minority of keys. John Haar, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, says that in such a setup, the owner would need to lose all the physical devices and all copies of the seed phrases at the same time. As long as the owner can access at least one device or one seed phrase, they would be able to recover their bitcoin. This approach should significantly limit the potential for all of the devices to be lost in an event like a natural disaster, Haar said.

""You can spread these keys across multiple regions or even countries, and you need any three of the five keys to approve a bitcoin transaction,"" Neuman said of Casa's five-key approach.

Jordan Baltazor, chief administrative officer at Fortress Trust, a regulated crypto custodian, says best practices that we use in other areas of personal life should apply to cryptocurrency. For one, diversification of storage approach and weighing of risks. Digital assets are no different, he says, when it comes to backing up personal and sensitive data on the cloud to ensure data against loss or corruption.

Companies including Coinbase and Jack Dorsey's Block offer products that try to merge some of these ideas, creating a more secure version of a crypto wallet that remains convenient to use. There is Coinbase Vault, which includes enhanced security steps before a user can access crypto holdings for trading. And there is Coinbase Wallet and Block's Bitkey, which have mobile apps that work like a traditional wallet making moving bitcoin around easy, but with the ability to pair with hardware wallets and added security more commonly associated with cold storage.

Bitkey hardware requires multiple authorizations for transactions for added security, similar to ""multi-sig wallets."" Bitkey also offers recovery tools so one of the biggest risks of self-custody — losing codes or phrases needed to recover a cold wallet — is less of an issue.

Solutions like Dorsey's may help to solve the tension between convenience and security; at minimum, they underline that this tension exists and will likely be something of a roadblock to more widespread crypto adoption. Beyond the risks out there in the form of wildfires, all kinds of natural disasters, and wars, bitcoin self-custody can be vulnerable to the biggest personal risk of all: unexpected death of the bitcoin owner. There is arguably nothing more complicated than inheritance when it comes to unlocking the crypto chain of custody.

Coinbase requires probate court documents and specific will designations before releasing funds from custody, while physical wallets offer little to no support, potentially leaving all that digital value stuck on a private key. Bitkey rolled out its inheritance solution in February for what a Bitkey executive called, ""kind of a multibillion-dollar problem waiting to happen.""

""People who have a material investment in bitcoin absolutely need to be thinking differently about how to protect it,"" Neuman said. He says that after disasters like the California wildfires, or when exchanges go bust like FTX, the industry does see more crypto holders taking action to move to more secure storage setups. ""I suppose it's human nature to wait until 'bad things happen' to spur action to improve your own personal situation,"" he said. ""But I think people would be better off if they were more proactive. Otherwise, they risk having that 'bad thing' happen to them, and then it's too late,"" he said.

While there are still differing perspectives on how long it will be until certain types of quantum computing hit commercial viability, experts from big tech companies like Google and IBM as well as smaller organizations like D-Wave Quantum and TreQ generally agree on quantum's most mature, promising industry applications, which range from medical insights to last-mile delivery optimization. Yet, in a space teeming with unknowns, there's still a lot to learn about the potential fate of a world in quantum's hands.

Unlike classical computing, which processes information through bits that can exist in either zeros or ones, quantum computing is an evolving field where quantum bits (or qubits) can occupy both zero and one in a single unit. These qubits can then basically communicate with each other to further increase the speed and complexity of information processing in a calculation.

Within the field of quantum computing, there are two types of technologies. What most people refer to when they talk about it is universal gate-based models. The second model is called annealing quantum. ""It's a different technology,"" explained Mandy Birch, CEO and founder of TreQ, a quantum systems engineering company focused on manufacturing applications.

Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and IBM are aggressively pursuing gate-model quantum computing, each with different qubit technologies and strategies. D-Wave is largely working with annealing technology, which primarily serves companies that want to optimize their operations. Annealing models still have a ways to go, but unlike gate models that researchers are still developing, annealing is able to deliver commercial value today.

""It's more of a heuristic than it is an absolute solution,"" Birch said about annealing technology. Still, these systems can generally help companies improve operational efficiency compared to what they can achieve with classical computing systems.

""Quantum computers are capable of solving problems that are impossible for AI or supercomputers even in the best case,"" said Charina Chou, chief operating officer at Google Quantum AI, maker of the quantum computing processor Willow chip at the recent SXSW conference.

Here, Chou is referring to a concept called quantum supremacy, where quantum technology completes complex calculations no classical computer could realistically complete (for example, a five-minute quantum calculation might take 10 septillion years on a binary supercomputer). Alternatively, some quantum systems may achieve quantum advantage, where they simply do better than classical computing.

Scientists at D-Wave as well as institutions like Vancouver's Quantum Matter Institute published a breakthrough report in March announcing that its annealing quantum technology achieved ""the world's first and only demonstration of quantum computational supremacy on a useful, real-world problem."" 

The company performed magnetic materials simulation in minutes with a level of accuracy that would take nearly one million years using a classical supercomputer. In an interview, D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz explained that this capability can advance technologies like smartphones and sensors.

""We use sensors in MRIs, brain scanners, heart scanners. These sensors are magnetic material,"" he said. ""The benefit that comes from this is the ability to see things in the human body that we still can't see for better understanding, better diagnosis.""

Barataz also told CNBC back in January that D-Wave is ""commercial today,"" and companies including Mastercard and Japan's NTT Docomo are using its quantum computers in production to benefit their business operations. ""Not 30 years from now, not 20 years from now, not 15 years from now,"" Baratz said. It is also used by Patterson Food Group to optimize workforce scheduling. 

D-Wave's revenue is still low, with the most recent quarterly sales reported at $1.9 million.

Chou also pointed to the importance of quantum's advancements in the medical space. ""Twenty-one years ago, my husband [...] was facing a very tough cancer diagnosis,"" she said. He went through chemo and radiation, neither of which worked, but he was fortunate enough to get on a clinical trial that saved him. Today, Chou's husband is an oncologist. Using quantum computing for ""calculating fundamentally what is happening inside these molecules themselves"" could increase our ability to solve these problems, Chou said.

On the gate-model side of the quantum equation, Birch is confident that any place a high-performance computer is important today is going to be majorly changed by quantum in the future. But she added, ""I don't know if that means in five years, 10 years or 20 years.""

She foresees the financial industry making use of quantum optimization, but she's particularly excited about the impact on the pharmaceutical industry, which is inherently quantum mechanical because of its use of organic compounds (actually, all matter and energy is quantum mechanical by nature).

Referring to pharmaceutical work, Birch said, ""Right now, the molecular dynamics are so complex that the math quickly gets out of hand. ... But just imagine, in a drug discovery process, instead of having to do all the wet chemistry one experiment at a time, to be able to run through millions of simulations on a computer at a molecular dynamics level before you ever get into the wet chemistry and the trial."" 

This, she said, would give scientists a much higher probability of finding solutions, and that would also inform industries including aerospace and defense. Some worry about potential negative impact given how powerful the tech could be, but Birch said, ""Technology is always neutral. It's when you put it into human hands that it does good or bad.""

""Then there's more boring and ubiquitous things like optimization,"" Birch said. ""If you can save 1% on your fuel bill if you're FedEx, UPS, that's really important."" 

Port logistics optimization is already in action today.

One thing that any quantum solution will likely do is perform computations using hybrid solutions that partner with supercomputers and AI computers. Some work can be done natively on quantum alone, but with all of the infrastructure that is already in place, it makes sense to use what's out there.

President Trump's new tariff regime, formally triggered by his invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, is no longer theoretical. On Saturday, a baseline 10% tariff was first applied to nearly all imports. On April 9, that will escalate to higher, individualized rates on countries with the largest trade deficits with the United States. What's being framed as a bold reassertion of U.S. economic sovereignty is a high-stakes test of the federal government's implementation capacity — one that we are plainly unprepared to pass.

The administration's expansive use of IEEPA — meant for more traditional types of national emergencies — now serves as the foundation for remaking the entire U.S. trade regime. The fact sheet accompanying the order is wide-ranging: a policy aimed at correcting global imbalances, restoring manufacturing, reshoring supply chains, confronting non-market economies, and ensuring the defense industrial base is no longer dependent on foreign adversaries.

It's a real grab bag of the greatest hits from a long list of well-known Trump grievances. But one thing the fact sheet does not offer is a coherent implementation plan. The policy goals far surpass the capacity of the current federal government to effectively and timely implement the tariffs. To impose variable tariffs across all trading partners — with hard to follow and sundry carveouts, retaliatory triggers, national security exemptions, and modification authorities — requires more than presidential intent. It demands a well-resourced bureaucracy, a clearly articulated process, and interagency coordination at a scale not seen in recent memory. And none of that is currently in place.

Agencies such as USTR, Commerce, and Treasury will be central players in standing up this structure. But it is Customs and Border Protection (CBP) — already stretched thin — that will be responsible for frontline enforcement. CBP is underfunded, understaffed, and ill-equipped to absorb this kind of policy shock. They will be asked to manage a flood of product classification disputes, origin verification challenges, and tariff compliance actions with no significant augmentation of manpower, increased systems and technological capacity, or time to prepare for execution.

CBP's own budget documents and independent oversight reports make this clear. The agency's FY2024 budget prioritized border security and fentanyl interdiction, leaving little for commercial enforcement at our ports. A 2023 GAO report highlighted long-standing staffing shortages at ports of entry, delays in processing, and inconsistent enforcement of trade rules. In effect, the agency tasked with executing the centerpiece of the administration's economic strategy is being asked to do much more, much faster, with far less than will be required.

The bureaucratic bottleneck will hit importers first, with the return of what was seen during the supply chain snarls of Covid, scores of container ships floating just off the U.S. coast as they await the clearing of backlogs at the ports. But importers won't be the only ones to suffer. U.S. businesses, retailers, manufacturers, and supply chain operators that rely on predictable flows of intermediate goods could face sudden delays, confusion, paperwork surges, and inventory gaps. That uncertainty will ultimately impact prices that consumers pay at the register.

In short order, global exporters may recognize that the U.S. enforcement architecture is ill-prepared and many may be tempted to game the system or find other tactical workarounds by transshipping through countries with lower ""reciprocal"" rates wherever possible — causing further delays and losses in projected revenue. That is important. The administration claims the tariffs will raise hundreds of billions of dollars and help offset tax cuts it plans to pass, but if CBP cannot consistently implement the new regime, the revenue projections will miss the mark. Worse, they could be offset by administrative costs, economic distortions, and retaliatory tariffs that hurt U.S. exporters.

Even seemingly simple questions — like whether a vehicle assembled in Mexico with Chinese parts qualifies for a blanket or component-based tariff — become minefields in the absence of clearly defined rules. And that's before retaliation starts or exemptions begin to flow in.

Some inside the administration do recognize the problem, but are reluctant to speak candidly about the challenge. Ambassador Jamieson Greer at USTR appears to be one of the few officials quietly working to bring order to this increasingly chaotic pace and structure. His background and experience from Trump's first term gives him a modicum of credibility, and his current lowkey efforts to reintroduce process discipline and clarity into the frenetic tariff policy whiplash deserves recognition. But Greer is attempting to systematize a policy environment that is being by driven by fiat and decree, the whims of the man at the top. Greer's work may be thoughtful, but the policy process of this administration, its decision making and implementation architecture is not built to function the way that it has in the past.

What's more troubling is the lack of a formal rulemaking process. No discernable public comment period was offered. It is true that IEEPA does not require one, but sound policy, particularly policy with this level of impact, could have used one. There is no visible administrative legal framework beyond citing the provisions of IEEPA that ""allow"" a president to take ""decisive"" action, no apparent mechanism for coordinating across the agencies tasked with implementing the details. What we are left with is a policy reliant on signaling over processes and structure, Truth Social post that serve as instructions to those responsible for implementation, and the brute force application of raw power and perceived leverage over realistic and achievable goals and outcomes. Uncertainty itself as the tool may serve the short-term negotiation tactical interests of President Trump, but it's a dangerous foundation for long-term trade policy and its effective implementation.

While the executive branch expands its authority, Congress continues to recede into the background. There are, to be fair, rare moments of resistance. Last week, the Senate — with the help of four Republicans (Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski) — voted to terminate Trump's previous national emergency declaration on fentanyl trafficking, the legal pretext for imposing a 25% tariff on Canadian imports. That narrow vote was a rare attempt at congressional oversight, an effort to claw back authority that many now realize has been misused or stretched way too far.

On Thursday, U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), senior members of the Senate Finance Committee, introduced legislation to reaffirm the key role of Congress in U.S. trade policy.

But that was the Senate. In the House of Representatives, no such courage has emerged among the Republican leadership. A few congressional members have introduced legislation to rein in the president's power to use a 1930 trade law as the basis for unilateral trade authority. But Speaker Mike Johnson and others in the Republican Party appear unwilling to challenge the executive's expanding use of trade authorities granted to it by Congress, even as the scope and complexity of these tariffs risk spiraling far beyond the federal government's ability to execute on them.

The consequences of that passivity are real, in the form of the coming delays at ports, lawsuits by importers, arbitrary or uneven enforcement, and disrupted supply chains — economic dislocation not just for foreign producers, but for the very American manufacturers and workers the policy claims to support.

The first real tariffs stress test is now underway. If implementation falters, the economic impact may be less about tariffs themselves and more about the confusion, instability, and the credibility losses that follow. Policy by proclamation is no substitute for execution, and execution, especially at this scale, requires more than belief — it requires institutions that work, systems that are ready, and oversight that functions. Right now, we have neither the capacity nor the clarity to pull this off. Congress has the tools to fix that. But time is running out.

—By Dewardric McNeal, Managing Director and Senior Policy Analyst at Longview Global, and a CNBC contributer

Franchise owners of restaurant brands Johnny Rockets, Fatburger, Round Table Pizza, Great American Cookies, and other FAT Brands entities can now pay franchisee royalty payments in Bitcoin. 

The publicly traded FAT Brands (Nasdaq: FAT), which boasts 18 different franchise concepts and more than 2,300 locations worldwide, said the move “underscores its commitment to financial and technological innovation.” 

“Over the years, Bitcoin has transformed into a mainstream asset and, as a company, we see great value in expanding our forms of payments for our franchisees,” said FAT Brands COO Thayer Wiederhorn in a statement. He said that international franchisees in particular, which operate over 20% of its restaurants, may especially benefit from the shift.

“We look forward to utilizing Bitcoin as an efficient tool for streamlining and simplifying the payment process,” Wiederhorn added.

Franchisees, or those that own one of FAT Brands' quick-service, casual dining locations, can pay franchise and development fees, as well as their royalty payments by sending Bitcoin to a “crypto wallet business account,” a FAT Brands representative told Decrypt. At that point, FAT Brands can decide whether or not it wishes to sell the Bitcoin for USD, or hold it. 

As for adding other payment options like Ethereum or Solana, it could “possibly” happen “in the future,” a representative for FAT Brands told Decrypt, “but we're starting with Bitcoin.”

What about paying for a Fatburger or milkshake from Johnny Rockets with Bitcoin? 

“Potentially, but not today,” they replied.

The overlap of cryptocurrency and restaurants has grown in recent years. In 2024, on-chain dining rewards platform Blackbird helped bring crypto payments to some of New York's most acclaimed restaurants. Plus, fast food chains McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut have all run collaborations in Web3.

Furthermore, there's a growing trend of publicly traded companies embracing Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, popularized by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its outspoken chairman Michael Saylor. His firm now holds some $44 billion worth of Bitcoin, and the firm's model has inspired dozens of followers.

Bitcoin just notched its worst first quarter in a decade, falling 11.7% as markets struggled to understand the new administration's economic agenda. 

The performance ranked 12th out of the past 15 first quarters, according to NYDIG Research's data.

The drawdown invites a familiar question in crypto circles: is the cycle over? The last time bitcoin started the year this poorly was in 2015, during a prolonged slump following the 2013 peak and after the collapse of Mt. Gox, according to NYDIG. Back then, prices recovered modestly over the rest of the year before surging in 2016.

In the first quarter of 2020, amid a market sell-off tied to fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, BTC saw a 9.4% drawdown but then recovered to end the year up over 300%. In other years with negative Q1 returns—like 2014, 2018 and 2022—bitcoin ended the year down sharply, coinciding with the tail ends of previous bull cycles, the research note said. 

This time around, the backdrop is murky. Cryptocurrency prices surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November after running a pro-crypto campaign. While under the Trump administration, the sector has been gaining greater regulatory clarity, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed off a number of lawsuits against crypto firms, it isn't all bullish.

Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs against nearly every country in the world last week, leading to a massive $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days. This led to the S&P 500 index's lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100's entry into bear market territory. While bitcoin has outperformed so far, what will happen after Monday's opening bell is unclear.

Historically, a weak Q1 doesn't always spell doom for BTC, NYDIG's data shows. The asset has bounced back in half of the years when it started in the red. The recent macroeconomic backdrop has seen analysts raise recession odds, which could test BTC's role as a “U.S. isolation hedge.”Read more: Chart of The Week: Will April Bring Good Luck or Fool's Hope for Bitcoin?

In the last two months, Bitcoin price has plunged by over 23% in a prolonged market correction. Significant portions of this decline have been attributed to a series of new US tariffs announced in February, March, and most recently April. 

Despite the short-term bearish effects of this macroeconomic development on the crypto market, popular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher theorizes that BTC could substantially benefit from the long-term effects of these policy decisions.


In a recent X post, Deutscher states that Bitcoin is on course for a new all-time high despite current market uncertainty. The analyst explains that while recent trade and economic policy changes by the administration of US President Donald Trump may be exerting a negative market effect, the ensuing sequence of events from these decisions can prove bullish. 

Firstly, Deutscher states that recent economic decisions by the US government show intentions to induce short-term pain that could weaken the dollar and interest rates which should be beneficial for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. 

However, the new import tariffs are likely going to discourage the purchase of US Treasury Bills forcing a reliance on domestic buyers which triggers liquidity tightening. As Bitcoin is sensitive to liquidity, the contraction of global liquidity will cause further price falls as investors move their funds to safer assets. 

Eventually, the crypto market is expected to bottom out pricing in recession fears. By the time an official recession is announced, the market could be stable and anticipate an economic response by the Federal Reserve.

At this junction,  the US Apex Bank is likely to announce a rate cut clearing the way for quantitative easing (QE). However, while this QE may not occur until 2026, Bitcoin will experience a dollar liquidity boost from other economic tools including repurchase agreements,  Bank Term Funding Program, and Treasury bill purchases. 

Following this development, Bitcoin is expected to embark on an upward trajectory. The “top quality” altcoins will potentially follow the market leader while other tokens with little to no utility shrink. Once Bitcoin nears or hits a peak price, the altseason will kick in. 

Deutscher explains it is currently difficult to predict the crypto market and US policies in the short term i.e. 1-12 weeks. However, his forecast is likely to roll out in the coming months placing Bitcoin in a strong position for a new all-time high between Q3 2025 and Q1 2026.


At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $83,313 following a 0.90% gain in the past week. However, the asset's daily trading volume is down by 68.68% and is valued at $14.25 billion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","President Trump May Trigger Decorrelation Between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, According to Macro Guru Luke Gromen","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/04/06/president-trump-may-trigger-decorrelation-between-bitcoin-and-the-nasdaq-according-to-macro-guru-luke-gromen/","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:46:04 GMT","

Macro investor Luke Gromen says that the White House may have caused a massive change in the way that Bitcoin (BTC) trades.

In a new interview with Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast, Gromen calls attention to the America First Investment Policy, a memo released by the Trump Administration in February that aims to make the US foreign investment policies more cautious and conscious of national security.

Gromen, the founder of the macroeconomic research firm Forest for the Trees (FFTT), says that the memo essentially directs China to “take your money and go home, we don't want it here anymore.”

With all of the foreign capital invested in US markets, Gromen says the Nasdaq index will likely suffer capital outflows while Bitcoin – as a neutral global asset essentially exempt from tariffs or political agendas – will shine, breaking the correlation between the two assets.

“That, I think will ultimately be a catalyst to the separation of Bitcoin and Nasdaq, and that, I think, is starting to drive Nasdaq down – it has a long way to go because multiples are high – and in the short run, traders control the flows… 

Bitcoin is levered Nasdaq, I get it; it's a high-beta Nasdaq, in the short run. If you back up to a five-year or ten-year chart, you can see very clearly these periods where Bitcoin has massively outperformed Nasdaq, but they still tend to go directionally similarly, when Bitcoin's up Nasdaq's up and vice versa…

The America First Investment Policy memo, I think, will start to break that correlation because I think right now in the short run, that correlation is holding, [but] at some point I think capital flow is going to see Bitcoin for what it is which is a neutral reserve asset linked to energy, uncontrollable by any govenment and I think it'll start siphoning some flows off from Nasdaq as America continues to say, ‘Listen, you want to invest in some factories here? Great, otherwise, get out.' 

And that's a lot of capital that's got to get out, and we're seeing gold benefit already. I think what we're seeing in gold is a precursor to what we'll see in Bitcoin.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $83,233.

Ethereum is trading below the $1,900 level as selling pressure continues to mount, raising concerns that the recent downtrend could extend further. After losing the critical $2,500 support in late February, bulls have struggled to regain control. What began as a minor pullback has turned into a broader correction, disappointing investors who had anticipated a bullish 2025 for ETH.

The failure to reclaim key levels has eroded market confidence, and price action remains weak across both short and mid-term timeframes. Ethereum's inability to sustain even brief recoveries has only reinforced the bearish sentiment that has gripped the crypto space in recent weeks.

Adding to the negative outlook, new data from Santiment reveals that whales have sold approximately 500,000 ETH over the past 48 hours. This massive distribution by large holders highlights a clear lack of confidence among some of the most influential players in the market — a trend that could weigh heavily on Ethereum's near-term performance.

As ETH hovers below $1,900, all eyes are on whether bulls can defend remaining support levels, or if continued selling from whales and broader market uncertainty will drive the price further down in the days ahead.

Ethereum is down 55% from its December high, with price action continuing to reflect the broader market's weakness. The selloff has been sharp and consistent, fueled by growing macroeconomic uncertainty and global instability. The latest wave of volatility was triggered by US President Donald Trump's renewed tariff threats and unpredictable policy direction, which have spooked financial markets and driven capital away from high-risk assets.

As a result, Ethereum — a key altcoin with deep ties to speculative sentiment — has become one of the hardest-hit major cryptocurrencies. Bulls are struggling to hold support near the $1,800 level, and every attempt to rally has been met with renewed selling pressure. Without a clear shift in trend, ETH remains vulnerable to further downside in the near term.

Adding to the bearish sentiment, top analyst Ali Martinez shared data showing that whales sold 500,000 ETH over the last 48 hours. This massive distribution from large wallets suggests that even experienced market participants are growing increasingly cautious. Such activity tends to precede deeper corrections, particularly when accompanied by weak technicals and broader risk-off sentiment.

Unless Ethereum can reclaim key resistance levels and show signs of accumulation, the current trend may continue to favor sellers. As markets digest macro developments, ETH holders are watching closely for any indication that the worst is over — but for now, the pressure remains firmly to the downside.

Ethereum is trading at $1,810 after repeated failed attempts to reclaim the $1,900 level. The price continues to face strong resistance, and bullish momentum has significantly weakened in recent weeks. Bulls are now in a critical position, with $1,800 emerging as the most important support level in the current cycle. A decisive breakdown below this mark could trigger a deeper correction, potentially sending ETH as low as $1,550 — a zone not seen since mid-2023.

The broader crypto market remains under pressure, and Ethereum's price action reflects that. Sentiment has been weighed down by macroeconomic headwinds and aggressive selling from whales, adding to the difficulty for bulls to regain control. Still, hope remains if ETH can stabilize and push higher in the coming sessions.

A breakout above the $2,000 level would mark a significant shift in momentum and could spark a strong recovery rally. That level remains the psychological and technical threshold for a potential trend reversal. Until then, Ethereum continues to walk a tightrope between consolidation and further downside, with bulls needing to hold $1,800 at all costs to avoid cascading losses. The next few days will be crucial in determining ETH's short-term direction.

Ethereum and Bitcoin went through very different trajectories in the first quarter of 2025, and the divergence could not be more obvious. According to data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, Ethereum underperformed significantly, dropping nearly 50% in value over the past three months. 

Bitcoin, though also correcting, saw a smaller decline below 15%. This reflects a broader trend in the crypto market where inflows and interest went toward Bitcoin and a few altcoins, leaving Ethereum struggling to regain momentum.

Ethereum's Underperformance Vs. Bitcoin In Q1

Bitcoin began Q1 on a notably bullish trajectory due to increasing institutional interest and strong inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a combination which pushed the price to a new all-time high of $108,786 on January 20. This price marked the peak of a steady upward movement that has placed Bitcoin firmly in the spotlight since October 2023. 

However, a pronounced downtrend followed this peak, particularly in March, when the Bitcoin price dipped below $80,000 for the first time since November 2024. An already struggling Ethereum price fared much worse and broke below a strong support of $1,900.

Bitcoin has shown resilience since this break, bouncing back above $83,000 and even recently touching $87,000. On the other hand, Ethereum continues to trade below $1,900 and is now at risk of losing $1,800 and breaking below. 

According to data from Cryptorank, Ethereum closed Q1 2025 with a 45.3% decrease from its quarterly open. This marks the second-worst Q1 performance for Ethereum, behind a 47.5% decline in Q1 2018. Bitcoin, on the other hand, ended Q1 2025 with an 11.7% decrease from its opening price.

Ethereum Price Direction: $1,800 On Crosshairs With Cautious Bullishness

Ethereum's decline has been amplified by a visible drop in trading interest and inflows even in Spot Ethereum ETFs. Most of the attention has been on Bitcoin, with Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP taking the most significant share of interest in the altcoin market. 

Nonetheless, many crypto analysts are still bullish on Ethereum and are on the outlook of a bounce as it is now nearing a bottom around $1,800. According to a crypto analyst (@CryptoELlTES ) on social media platform X, Ethereum at $1,800 is the bottom. 

This outlook is based on this level, which acted as resistance in the 2022 bear market and is expected to flip to become support. Another analyst (Crypto Fella) noted that a reversal at this point “would be very good for alts,” suggesting a possible broader market recovery for altcoins if Ethereum finds solid footing here.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,803, down by $0.18% and 1.9% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

Dogecoin could set a new all-time high (ATH) record if it matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum. 

The ongoing bearish trend in the crypto market has negatively impacted DOGE's price action. Recall that DOGE ranked among the early gainers in the post-election relief rally, which saw its price rise to a high of $0.4835 on December 8. 

However, DOGE has lost these gains, as it currently sits around the level it traded at before the election. At the current price of $0.1693, DOGE is down 64.98% from its December 8 peak of $0.4835. 

DOGE is also down 2.86% in the past seven days, 19.3% in 30 days, and 57% in three months. Despite the massive dip, DOGE investors have remained confident about the asset's prospects. 

Consequently, some wonder what would happen if DOGE resumes its post-election rally and potentially matches the market cap of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP). 

Like DOGE, XRP and ETH have experienced massive declines, losing most of their post-election gains. Nonetheless, both coins still rank among the top three non-stablecoin crypto by market cap. 

While ETH sits in the second position with a market cap of $218.63 billion, XRP's valuation of $124.39 billion puts it in the third spot. However, DOGE is far in the ranking, currently ranked as the sixth non-stablecoin crypto in the market. It has a market cap of $25.17 billion. 

Therefore, Dogecoin must soar 394.19% from its current valuation of $25.17 billion to match XRP's market cap of $124.39 billion. Similarly, DOGE requires a greater surge of 768.61% to equal Ethereum's $218.63 billion market cap. 

As mentioned earlier, matching ETH or XRP's market cap requires DOGE to rise 768.61% or 394.19% from its current valuation. 

Notably, if DOGE rises 394.19% and matches XRP's market cap, its price would increase to $0.8366. This estimate assumes Dogecoin's circulating supply remains fairly stable at 148.72 billion tokens. In the same vein, DOGE's price would spike to $1.47 per token if it surges by 768.61% to equal ETH's market cap. 

Both prices–$0.8366 and $1.47–are 13.42% and 99.29% above Dogecoin's all-time high of $0.7376, respectively. Recall that DOGE hit its previous ATH on May 8, 2021. It has remained far from this level ever since. 

DOGE's current price of $0.1693 represents a decline of 77.04% from its previous ATH. However, hitting the $0.8366 or $1.47 targets would potentially mark new ATHs for DOGE. 

Several analysts have predicted Dogecoin's potential surge to the $0.8 and $1.4 price range. However, not everyone attached a timeline for when these predictions would materialize. 

Last month, popular TradingView analyst ‘Cobra Vanguard' identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Dogecoin's chart to predict a potential rally to the $0.8 price mark. In addition, popular chatbot service ChatGPT predicted that DOGE could soar to around $1.4 if it becomes the default payment method across Elon Musk's ecosystem. 

Meanwhile, Changelly set possible timelines for Dogecoin's potential surge to $0.8366 and $1.47, respectively. While the exchange expects DOGE to hit $0.8366 by June 2030, it projects that the $1.47 target would materialize the following year, specifically in August 2031. 

It remains to be seen whether these predictions will play out. Factors such as increased adoption, ETF approval, and celebrity influence could pave the way for a hefty rally to lofty targets like $0.8366 or $1.47.

Crypto World News

April 6, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

It's been a rough few months for ETH, as the latest Ethereum price prediction makes clear. But while Ethereum struggles with declining user activity, the GambleFi protocol Rollblock is sprinting into the spotlight with unstoppable momentum. 

Ethereum and Rollblock are both built on solid tech, but only one is setting new records with investor inflows every single week. With analysts predicting Rollblock could soar up to 100x this year, smart money is already making the switch.

Rollblock (RBLK) has been on a tear lately, with April kicking off just as hot as March ended. The viral Web3 GameFi platform has now seen more than $11.1 million in presale inflows, with month-on-month growth in signups, deposits, and wagered bids all hitting fresh highs.

Rollblock is a next generation gaming platform and supports instant fiat onboarding via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, lowering the barrier to entry for everyday gamers.

Over 8000 immersive, AI-powered games are now live and generating profit on the Rollblock platform, including blackjack, poker, slots, and exclusive new titles like Cash Compass. Players can also compete in a real-time sports prediction league where they place bids across thousands of daily fixtures in soccer, Formula 1 racing, golf, and more. 

Every bid and payout is securely recorded on the Ethereum chain, providing gamers with the ability to instantly verify that their transactions have been recorded faithfully and have not been manipulated.

Rollblock's performance in March was explosive, as a recent tweet made clear: $1,941,655 in total bets (up nearly 50%), deposits up 110%, registrations up 5%, and Gross Gaming Revenue up by an astonishing 50%. Clearly, Rollblock is in a period of heavy growth across all conceivable metrics. 

See what makes Freddie Finance so bullish in his recent video review: https://youtu.be/qztj3p8uy_c?si=U1TVQ94C6Anvi6Vp

Rollblock (RBLK) operates on a tight, deflationary supply model with a hard cap of 1 billion tokens that can never be inflated. Every week, 30% of Rollblock's revenue is used to buy back RBLK on decentralized exchanges.

Of these tokens, 60% are burned to massively reduce the supply, while the other 40% are distributed to loyal stakers in the Rollblock community, offering up to 30% APY in lucrative passive income.

Stage 10 tokens are over 54% sold at $0.063, with prices expected to rise soon as demand is hotter than ever. The Rollblock model has been designed to deliver real value to early investors while maintaining long-term sustainability. A model that will pay dividends as the project scales this year.

Ethereum is trading at $1,815 today after sliding more than 6% over the past week. Despite its dominance as the most used smart contract platform, Ethereum is currently facing a notable slowdown in adoption.

0xKren broke it down clearly: “Low network activity is the main factor behind the ongoing decline in ETH price. The number of active addresses has been steadily declining since the beginning of the year, and average transaction and block fees have reached record lows.” 

It's not all doom and gloom for Ethereum. The chain still powers a vast chunk of DeFi infrastructure, and some believe the current lull is only temporary. 

But there's no denying that low activity, high inflationary pressure, and an underwhelming Q1 performance are weighing on Ethereum's price chart right now. Ethereum could well fall further to support at $1,500 before it finds its feet.

Ethereum is still a titan of the DeFi world, but Rollblock is clearly where the real buzz is in 2025. With surging inflows, high staking rewards, and explosive growth metrics, Rollblock is hands down the altcoin with the most potential to rise up the rankings in 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altseason Dead On Arrival? Data Shows Bitcoin Outperforming All Categories","https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-outperforming-altcoins-categories-cycle/","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:30:08 GMT","

The first quarter of 2025 was dominated by talks of the altcoin season, as is usually the case when the bull cycle is ending. In past cycles, capital tends to rotate from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies as investors look for maximum gain before the arrival of the bear market.

However, the story has been very different for the cryptocurrency market so far this year, with most large-cap assets failing to enjoy the same capital rotation seen in past cycles. The latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin has continued to dominate the crypto market, outperforming all categories of altcoins.

In an April 5 post on the X platform, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost shared an interesting on-chain insight into the performance of all altcoin categories relative to the world's largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the altcoins are underperforming compared to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization growth.

In their post, Darkfost compared the market cap growth of Bitcoin, large-cap altcoins (the top 20 largest altcoins), and mid-to-small cap altcoins by calculating the difference between their 365-day and the 30-day moving average (MAs). According to the analyst, the variation between the 365-day MA and the 30-day MA serves as an indicator of growth momentum.

Typically, when the short-term moving average (30-day MA) rises faster than the long-term moving average (365-day MA), it implies rapid market cap growth. On the flip side, a reduced growth momentum is indicated by a lagging 30-day moving average.



As observed in the chart above, Bitcoin is outpacing the large-cap and mid-to-small-cap altcoins in terms of their market cap growth. Darkfost noted that this difference in the growth ratio has reached a level last seen in October 2023, a period correlated with a brief altcoin rally and subsequently BTC's dominance.

The analyst further highlighted that when this growth ratio turns negative, it often signals that a strong correction has occurred. Historically, a negative ratio might present a potential buying opportunity for investors looking to get into the market.

As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $83,500, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the ETH token is valued at around $1,805, with no change in the past day.

While the premier cryptocurrency dropped by about 15% in the first quarter of 2025, Ethereum lost almost double its value in the same period. This gap in performance underscores how woeful the “king of altcoins” has been in the past few months.

As Bitcoin strengthens its dominant position in the markets, the Kaiko Research report disrupts expectations for 2025: forget the widespread altseason of the past, only a few carefully selected altcoins will thrive this year.

Cryptocurrency investors may need to adjust their strategies in 2025. According to a report published in March 2025 by Kaiko Research in collaboration with Blockhead Research, the era of widespread altcoin surges is fading in favor of a more selective approach.

This significant change can be explained by the evolution of liquidity trends, the intensification of regulatory pressures, and the expansion of Bitcoin's institutional footprint.

The concentration of the altcoin market has reached historic highs. The data reveals that the top 10 altcoins now represent 64% of the total trading volume, compared to only 32% at the end of 2021.

This centralization has accelerated since the last US elections, creating an environment where some large caps like Solana (SOL) and XRP are progressing, while small and mid-cap tokens are down more than 30% since the beginning of the year.

The Altcoin Season Index from blockchaincenter.net confirms this trend with a score of 20, far from the threshold of 75 needed to declare a true altcoin season.

In concrete terms, this means that only 10 cryptocurrencies among the top 50 have outperformed Bitcoin in the last three months.

The global economic context further complicates the situation for altcoins. The rise in interest rates and the reduction of liquidity by central banks have significantly dampened appetite for risky assets.

This climate contrasts sharply with the accommodative monetary policies that fueled the 2021 boom.

Bitcoin, for its part, has benefited from the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, attracting over a billion dollars in trading volume on the first day.

This institutional legitimization has strengthened its dominant position, to the detriment of altcoins that face increased competition for capital.

The American political uncertainty index, now at record levels since the Covid-19 pandemic, has also pushed investors towards Bitcoin's perceived stability.

This search for a safe haven partly explains the low activity on altcoin networks, a phenomenon already highlighted in our previous article: Crypto: Why is the altseason delayed?

The Kaiko Research report concludes that the traditional period of uniform altcoin rises could be replaced by a phase of “strategic selection.” 

In this new paradigm, the success of an altcoin will depend essentially on three key factors:

This evolution marks a decisive turning point for crypto investors, who will now need to prioritize precision in the composition of their portfolios rather than broad diversification.

Fragile or truly useless projects risk being sidelined in favor of stronger alternatives that are better positioned to attract institutional investments. The recent collapse of 99% of memecoins on pump.fun perfectly illustrates this new market selectivity.

Crypto is in a unique spot right now. The traditional finance world is in tatters due to trade war escalations between the United States and China – but crypto prices are holding strong. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the wider altcoin market are all steady this weekend.

As crypto begins to outpace TradFi, analysts are tipping altcoins to undergo a strong run in the months ahead. CryptoGoos notes that the total crypto market cap is trading on a key trendline support level and anticipates an explosive rally to follow.

With that in mind, let's explore the best cryptocurrencies to buy ahead of Altcoin season.

BTC Bull Token is a new meme coin and the first cryptocurrency to pay its holders real Bitcoin rewards. The project is currently undergoing a presale and has raised $4.4 million so far.

It plans to run $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops at key milestones on Bitcoin's journey to $1 million, starting when it hits $100K.

Not only does this allow community members to benefit from Bitcoin's growth, but it also incentivizes long-term holding. Put differently, it minimizes selling pressure and allows new demand to better impact the $BTCBULL price.

There are also staking and burning mechanisms which further enhance the project's supply and demand dynamics.

And at the face of all of this is a viral bull mascott who sports Bitcoin attire and waves an American flag. It's the perfect combination of light hearted memetics and serious innovation. For $BTCULL presale investors, this might just result in big gains.

As altcoin prices rally, Cosmos could prove one of the smartest bets. That's because it's a “layer 0” blockchain that provides the building blockchains and infrastructure for developers to launch interconnected layer 1s.

Its goal is to bolster blockchain interoperability and negate fragmentation, an issue that causes complex user experiences, inefficient use of liquidity, and inconveniences for developers.

The Cosmos ecosystem is home to countless well-known projects including Celestia, Akash Network, Osmosis, Injective Protocol, Band Protocol, and many more.

As the prices of these cryptos rise, it could have a positive impact on Cosmos and allow its price to rise as well. $ATOM is essentially a diversified bet over a widespread ecosystem.

Cosmos has also proved one of the best-performing cryptos this week with a 8.3% pump. This is particularly impressive considering it comes as a time when traditional financial markets are tumbling.

Raydium is the leading decentralized exchange on Solana, one of the top blockchains. Traditionally, Raydium was a place where users could buy and sell new and well-established cryptocurrencies, but it has started to evolve.

After meme coin launchpad Pump.fun announced it will soon launch its own DEX, thereby squashing its former relationship with Raydium, the Raydium team has clapped back by creating its own meme coin launchpad called LaunchLab.

The new launchpad will build on Pump.fun's offerings with features such as distributing swap fees to token issuers, multi-token support, and linear, exponential, and logarithmic bonding curves.

And according to the team, this is just the first step in a new push for Raydium. It says there is a “broader suite of tools” in the pipeline.

Raydium is transforming from a traditional decentralized exchange to a comprehensive Solana-based ecosystem. It's a setup that could draw huge gains, especially as altcoin prices rise.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Here's all the advice 3 blockchain detectives have on how to protect yourself from crypto scammers","https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-scams-fraud-hack-cybersecurity-fake-coin-investing-wallet-blockchain-2025-4","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:15:00 GMT","

Crypto scams are booming. 

Luckily, there are crypto detectives and blockchain sleuths who track down stolen funds and help those who suspect they've been defrauded. 

The business of these investigators has flourished in recent years, three of them told Business Insider, in part because scams in the crypto sphere are becoming more sophisticated and even harder for even intelligent, computer-savvy people to avoid. 

Cryptocurrency crime has skyrocketed in recent years. Losses stemming from crypto investment frauds, the most common type of crypto scam, ballooned to $3.96 billion in 2023, according to data from the FBI, up 335% in two years. 

Scam activity has grown an average of 24% year-over-year since the pandemic, with bad actors likely pulling in a record $12.4 billion in revenue last year, according to estimates from the analytics firm Chainalysis.

Here are investigators' top tips on how you can protect yourself from crypto scammers. 

First things first: be aware that talking to strangers on the internet isn't exactly safe to begin with.

The vast majority of fraud takes place online — a digital jungle where it's hard, even for intelligent, experienced investors to tell what's a hoax and what's the real deal, according to John Powers, the president of the financial investigations firm Hudson Intelligence.

Powers, who worked as a PI for years prior to doing investigative work on the blockchain, thinks scams are becoming so good they're defining a new era of con-artistry.

""We've moved beyond the Nigerian 419 scams where the prince was contacting you by email,"" Powers told BI in an interview. ""We're in a much different and more subtle and sophisticated place now. And it turns out that chatting online with random strangers is not necessarily a low-risk activity, especially if that seeming casual contact is actually just the tip of the spear.""

He recommends people maintain healthy skepticism, particularly when talking to people or making investments online.

The risk is evident in the numbers. Pig butchering scams — one type of fraud where a scammer establishes an online relationship with someone before asking them to invest or send money — have been on the rise, with revenue from this type of fraud soaring 40% in 2024, according to Chainalysis.

Joe Greenfield, the chief forensic examiner at the investigative firm Maryman, strongly urges investors not to take anything at face value. Before sending over any info or money on the blockchain, you should check out everything you can about the situation, like researching the investment, calling the person directly, or even showing the exchange to another person in your life to get another pair of eyes on the situation.

""Assume in today's day and age that everything is a fraud. Everything's a scam until you prove otherwise to yourself,"" Greenfield said.

There's no such thing as a crypto exchange withholding your funds for tax reasons. There's also no such thing as an exchange requiring you to send in a fee in order to withdraw your money. 

But those are common examples of fraudulent expenses scammers come up with to extort money out of their victims, according to Kyla Curley, a partner at the professional services firm StoneTurn who frequently investigates financial fraud.

Curley says she often sees clients who had been unknowingly defrauded for months, due to a scammer repeatedly making small financial asks.

In pig butchering schemes, victims can also be roped into fake relationships that involve sending payments for months — or sometimes, years —before victims finally realize they've been scammed, Greenfield adds.

""It can drag for some time before people realize, like, oh shoot. They're asking me for more money again. Maybe this isn't right.""

One nightmare scenario Greenfield frequently investigates is when investors wake up and realize that their crypto wallets have been emptied overnight.

In many cases, the theft was made possible by cybersecurity weaknesses within the person's crypto storage, such as by using a cloud-based wallet, weak passwords, and setting up SMS authentication instead of an app-based verification method.

For the strongest security, he recommends using a cold storage wallet, using app-based authentication on sensitive accounts when possible, and following best-practices when it comes to picking a password.

""We've seen hundreds of millions of dollars stolen that way,"" he said of cases stemming from cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Fraud victims, often strung along for months, frequently come to the realization that they've been scammed far too late. Sometimes, they choose to remain silent and not get help due to embarrassment or shame, Powers said.

But it's most useful if people get help right away. 

""The sooner, the better, the faster that we can try to work with the client, try to work with the online provider if they've got one for these online wallets and their legal counsel,"" Greenfield said.

Curley says scam victims will also need the help of an attorney or law enforcement if they hope to recover some of their funds. Once an investigation finds a wallet on an exchange with the stolen funds, the exchange needs a subpoena order to release private information about who owns the wallet.

Be aware of how costly help could be. It's common for attorney and investigator fees to rack up in the thousands, according Powers. He added that his firm typically does not take on fraud victims who have lost less than $100,000 in crypto, which he said was in clients' financial best interests.

Curley estimates that around 20% of cases she oversees will end with a client getting at least some money back.

Unfortunately, Curley also expects scams to become more sophisticated and damaging over time, due to how rapidly scams evolve.

""It's really, really hard for probably 90% of the population to identify or even be in tune with,"" she said of the sophistication of some scams out there. ""I think, again, with AI, we all know that's just going to get much much worse.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Georgia House Proposes Blockchain Education in K-12 Schools","https://www.cryptoninjas.net/news/georgia-house-proposes-blockchain-education-in-k-12-schools/","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 15:45:57 GMT","

By Emily Harper

Key Takeaways:

The Georgia House of Representatives has taken an important step to modernize education by voting to urge its Department of Education to launch a public awareness campaign about blockchain, crypto, and Web3 technologies. The proposal, titled House Resolution 905, aims to incorporate this content across areas such as the K-12 curriculum and school events throughout the year.

The resolution, which doesn't require any changes to the curriculum but does signal increasing support for teaching future generations about decentralized technologies that are already disrupting industries from finance to digital art, was led by a cohort of Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Park Cannon, (District 58).

Supporters of the resolution say tech literacy is essential, as blockchain is reshaping how people interact and transact. With Bitcoin already used in mainstream commerce, they argue students should understand these tools early. Learning about blockchain could inspire careers in fintech, cybersecurity, or Web3, preparing students for a fast-changing digital economy—not just for tech elites.

The resolution also highlights Web3, the decentralized internet infrastructure, as the next generation of online engagement. Unlike today, where the internet is dominated by platforms, Web3 seeks to give users back control, through blockchain-based identities and apps. Web3 also opens up new models of ownership, where users can benefit directly from the platforms they engage with.

The Georgia House notes that Web3 is already impacting how businesses operate and that it provides a more secure, transparent, and efficient way to store and share data. Uniswap is one such example of a decentralized crypto exchange that leverages smart contracts for full functionality without centralized oversight.

Even the art world hasn't been left untouched. The emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — the unique digital assets stored in blockchains — has fundamentally changed how creators transact with (and monetize) their work. It references the rise of digitized art marketplaces, like OpenSea, where artists can receive a royalty payment every time their work changes hands. Beyond art, NFTs are being explored in music, gaming, and even real estate as tools for authentication and ownership.

The resolution stands out for encouraging K–12 students to engage with blockchain early—not just as consumers, but as innovators. Early exposure could help them use the technology more effectively later in life, with schools potentially adopting hands-on projects and simulations. Integrating blockchain into the classroom could also encourage critical thinking and problem-solving through real-world scenarios. Teachers in other states are closely watching. Public-private partnerships could play a key role in helping schools access the resources and expertise needed to implement blockchain education. Though Georgia's resolution is non-binding, its potential impact is big. States like Florida and Texas have tried similar endeavors; some high schools are piloting crypto and coding clubs. New York and California are also experimenting with a different type of ID — the blockchain-based student ID, which enhances data privacy.

Doubters of early blockchain education fear it could glamorize speculative investment or take away from core subjects. But Georgia's lawmakers say they're not out to teach kids the finer points of crypto investing — that they simply want to teach them the technology behind it and how it works in real life.



The Georgia House's move mirrors a broader national shift. Across the United States, policymakers are struggling with how to prepare the next generation for the Web3 future. HR 905 establishes Georgia as a leader in blockchain education, and places the importance of digital innovation on par with Math and Science. Georgia aims to bridge the digital divide and empower students to become creators in the digital world, not just users. Tech advocates say this move is long overdue, as ignoring blockchain today is like ignoring the internet in the '90s.

HashKey Group Chairman and CEO Xiao Feng kicked off the 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Sunday with a keynote address highlighting blockchain technology's transformative impact on global financial infrastructure.

Speaking to an early morning crowd at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Xiao described blockchain as “a new generation of financial infrastructure” that fundamentally changes how financial transactions are recorded, settled and governed.

“Any industrial revolution must wait for a financial revolution,” Xiao told attendees at the four-day event hosted by his company.

Xiao emphasized historical parallels between technological and financial evolution: banking credit supported the British Industrial Revolution, stock markets enabled the electrical revolution in America, and venture capital fueled Silicon Valley's information revolution.

“Cryptocurrency finance will become the core financial innovation supporting the fourth industrial revolution.”

The executive highlighted key differences between traditional and blockchain-based finance, including the shift from bank accounts to digital wallets and the move from batch settlement systems to instantaneous transaction completion.

Xiao noted the significance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent decision not to classify dollar-backed stablecoins as securities, suggesting this allows more institutions to participate in monetary creation processes.

He also pointed to major stock exchanges moving toward 23-hour trading cycles, compared to blockchain markets that operate continuously.

“Traditional exchanges will eventually need to adapt to compete with cryptocurrency markets that have operated 24/7 since day one,” Xiao predicted.

The event features several high-profile regulators, including Paul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Government; Joseph H. L. Chan, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury; Christina Choi, Executive Director of Investment Products at the Securities and Futures Commission; and George Chou, Chief Fintech Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

While mainland China maintains strict prohibitions on cryptocurrencies, analysts view Hong Kong's supportive stance as a strategic testing ground for the technology's potential. This approach effectively creates a regulatory breathing space where blockchain innovations can develop under controlled conditions, potentially informing future policies across the broader Chinese economy.

The Web3 Festival continues through Wednesday with industry panels, demonstrations and networking events, bringing together blockchain developers, investors and technology enthusiasts from around the world.

As the crypto market prepares for turbulence amid the tariff wars, the NFT market seems to be in a worse position. 

Trading volumes are declining and marketplaces shutting down.

The once-hyped world of non-fungible tokens, which analysts once boldly projected could balloon to over $264 billion by 2032, now seems to be limping along. Weekly trading volumes have been falling like dominoes for weeks, scaring off capital and dragging the market back to levels not seen since its explosive 2020 debut.

Blockchain analytics firm DappRadar shows that trading volumes in 2021 were riding high, hitting nearly $3 billion. 

Fast-forward to the first quarter of 2025. That figure has nosedived 93% to just $23.8 million as “active traders have vanished,” blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas noted.

“This rapid growth coincided with global shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating the adoption of digital platforms and pushing artists to explore innovative methods of engaging with their audiences. However, three years later, the hype around Art NFTs has significantly decreased.”

Sara Gherghelas

The data backs her up. In 2024, trading volume dropped nearly 20% from the year prior, while total sales declined 18%. As Gherghelas put it in her 2025 research, it was “one of the worst-performing years since 2020.”

In an interview with crypto.news, OutsetPR's legal officer Alice Frei implied that regulation is still a mess as “governments are still undecided on how to classify NFTs.” 

In the U.S., they're often treated like securities, meaning platforms must walk a legal tightrope. In the U.K., they're seen more like collectibles under intellectual property law.

“These are examples of leading countries with clear cryptocurrency regulations; in many other countries, the situation is even more uncertain. This lack of regulatory clarity creates an environment that is ripe for fraud and erodes investor confidence. Until there is more consistency, NFT adoption will remain stagnant.”

Alice Frei

Frei also highlighted a deeper issue: beyond the worlds of cryptocurrency and gaming, NFTs are still “trying to prove that they offer real value.”

“In theory, they could revolutionize several industries — think concert tickets that prevent scalping, digital IDs for online verification, or property deeds stored on the blockchain. But in practice, most NFTs are still largely speculative assets.”

Alice Frei

Speaking of gaming, where NFTs have the most potential for mainstream use, their adoption is also struggling, Frei pointed out, recalling that Ubisoft's Project Quartz, an attempt to integrate NFTs into AAA games, was met with “resistance from players, forcing the company to shut it down.” 

Frei notes that gamers are “hesitant about digital assets that feel more like currency than a genuine addition to their experience.”

If the data wasn't already bleak, March brought more bad news: a string of marketplace shutdowns added fuel to the fire. Among them, South Korean tech giant LG shut down its LG Art Lab, which was launched just three years ago at the height of the NFT mania. The company didn't share detailed reasons, only saying that “it is the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities.”

Just a week later, X2Y2 — a former OpenSea rival that once boasted $5.6 billion in lifetime volume — also ceased its operations, citing a “90% shrinkage of NFT trading volume from its peak in 2021” and struggles to remain competitive in the space.

Then came Bybit. The crypto exchange, still reeling from a $1.46 billion theft linked to North Korea-affiliated hackers, quietly closed its platform. 

Emily Bao, head of web3 at Bybit, said the decision would allow the company to “enhance the overall user experience while concentrating on the next generation of blockchain-powered solutions.” 

Amid the wave of closures, Frei says the NFT market now “feels like a revolving door.”

“Take Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example – once the pinnacle of NFT status, its prices have dramatically dropped. At the peak, a single Bored Ape sold for $400,000, but now some are barely fetching $50,000. The problem lies in the fact that many NFT projects rely on hype rather than actual utility. If people cannot see long-term value, they are unlikely to return.”

Alice Frei

Coinbase, too, seems to be pulling back. While it hasn't officially shut down its NFT platform, all signs suggest it's shifting focus. During an earnings call in early 2023, President and COO Emilie Choi indicated that the company sees “medium and long-term opportunities” in NFTs. But its real focus seems to be behind Base, its layer-2 blockchain network.

Coinbase declined to comment on its position as NFT activity continues to decline, despite multiple requests from crypto.news.

The OutsetPR legal officer thinks that with the market's current trajectory, smaller platforms are unlikely to weather the storm. “Smaller platforms will continue to shut down, leaving only a few dominant players like OpenSea and Blur,” she said.

She explained that the shift is being driven by two major forces. First, tighter regulations are on the horizon, which will likely bring an end to the “Wild West days of NFTs.” Second, the gaming sector may offer NFTs a lifeline—but it's still a narrow one. As Frei puts it, gaming may be NFTs' “last hope,” though developers will still need to avoid “pay-to-win mechanics that could turn players away.”

“The hype is over. If NFTs are to survive, they will need to prove that they offer more than just expensive pictures on the blockchain,” Frei concluded.

A recent study by Atmos positioned the United States as a worldwide frontrunner among nations for digital asset support and integration. The nation's commitment to blockchain technology sets a precedent for tokenization/digital payment integration of the global financial sector with a progressive regulatory approach, according to a study by BoxBet. 

Indeed, many large US banks such as J.P. Morgan, Citibank and other large banks such as UBS, Société Générale, the Swiss Banking Association, Banque de France, UK Regulated Liability Network, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Barclays, Lloyds, DZ Bank, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Unicredit, SBI Holdings, Hitachi, SHIZUOKA BANK, TIS, NSD, Fujitsu, KDDI, MUFG Bank, Higo Bank, Kagoshima Bank, GMO Financial Holdings have launched digital asset services departments fueling the tokenization trend of the financial sector.

Adopting new digital technologies enables financial institutions to considerably reduce operating costs, enhance transparency, and offer innovative services. Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize, states:

“Tokenized deposits will be the largest unlock for liquidity movement within banks. While stablecoins were the first instance of mass product-market fit for the blockchain ecosystem, stablecoins are not capital efficient. Tokenizing deposits (which could be IOUs or earn interest) allows for more capital-efficient movement. We are already seeing that with SAB 121 being repealed, the desire for banks to hold tokenized assets is increasing. We think the default choice—the safest, most secure blockchain ecosystem to hold tokenized assets—is within the Ethereum economy.”

Tokenized deposits are a token representation of the traditional commercial deposits that have been converted into digital tokens on a blockchain network, where each token is backed by a retail or institutional deposit. It involves the conversion of traditional financial assets such as a certificate of deposit, or a savings account into a digital token that offers investors potential benefits like faster 24/7 round the clock transactions with smart contracts used to automate interest rates, increased liquidity, fractional ownership, transparency—eliminating any possibility of fraud or manipulation.

Instead of holding physical cash or keeping money in a bank account, investors can hold digital tokens representing their certificate of deposit or savings account amount on a secure and decentralized ledger by empowering them to participate in the digital asset ecosystem, ultimately leading to cost savings.

For example, a tokenized certificate of deposit is a digital representation of a traditional CD, which is a fixed-term cash investment with a guaranteed interest rate of return, adapted into a token that the investor can freely trade on various digital asset exchanges or platforms similar to other digital assets that are regulated under the same framework as traditional bank deposits, focusing on ensuring the underlying bank's stability and compliance with existing regulations. This gives investors more flexibility and liquidity than a certificate of deposit, which often has an early redemption penalty.

Last year, after running over a dozen proofs of concept, or PoC, with multiple global banks, technology companies, and intergovernmental organizations, UDPN  launched two digital asset management systems for commercial use, designed to reshape the landscape of digital payments and assets in the financial sector:

Operating a digital asset system involves complex lifecycle management. These new digital asset systems—tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system and digital asset tokenization system—easily integrate into core banking systems and can be installed in a bank or a stablecoin operator's on-premises or cloud environment to ensure compliance and security in a regulated environment. 

UDPN's solutions efficiently link to legacy systems via APIs, ensuring seamless interoperability with traditional banking infrastructures and other digital asset systems within regulated frameworks, granting institutions full data sovereignty and the flexibility to choose their underlying infrastructure and deploy digital assets and tokens on any public or private blockchain. Both solutions allow the optional ability to interoperate with other regulated digital currency systems through UDPN's infrastructure. This feature promotes seamless collaboration and integration within the digital asset ecosystem. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies around stablecoins and digital assets globally, UDPN's platforms offer a robust and compliant framework tailored for operation within regulated financial environments.

Tim Bailey, VP of Global Business and Operations, Red Date Technology, explained: 

“Financial institutions and banks are embracing innovation to stay ahead by utilizing UDPN's cutting-edge tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system and digital asset tokenization system to forge the future of tokenized banking. This chart [above] is a general comparison between different types of digital currencies, such as tokenized deposits vs. stablecoins vs. retail and wholesale CDCs, not necessarily the capabilities of UDNP's tokenized deposit/stablecoin management system.”

As Cosmos (ATOM) surges in price, the spotlight is also shining on its staking program and security issues that could pose risks to its future growth. Despite Cosmos (ATOM)'s recent 14% surge, Coldware (COLD) remains positioned as the more innovative option, especially as it continues to showcase its advanced Web3 capabilities. Let's explore how Cosmos (ATOM) is navigating its staking program while Coldware (COLD) shows promising potential with cutting-edge blockchain technology.



In contrast, Coldware (COLD) is leveraging Web3 technology to position itself as a leader in financial inclusion. The Coldware (COLD) platform's ability to offer both decentralized finance and traditional finance solutions gives it an edge over Cosmos (ATOM), whose focus remains on blockchain interoperability. By providing a seamless bridge between these two worlds, Coldware is attracting interest from whales and institutional investors who see its potential to reshape the future of finance.

Cosmos (ATOM) has made significant strides in its staking program, with numerous users locking up their assets in exchange for rewards. However, recent security concerns have brought the effectiveness and sustainability of this program into question. As Cosmos (ATOM) continues to face these challenges, it may struggle to maintain investor confidence in its staking platform. The upcoming months will be crucial for Cosmos (ATOM) as it attempts to address these concerns and reassert its dominance in the blockchain space.



While Cosmos (ATOM) has built a staking program that aims to enhance network security and incentivize long-term commitment, Coldware (COLD) takes a different approach by focusing on Web3 innovations and offering solutions that are more scalable and secure. Coldware's commitment to financial inclusion and accessibility is set to challenge Cosmos (ATOM)'s model, as it tackles not just staking but the entire financial ecosystem.

Despite the bullish trends surrounding Cosmos (ATOM), Coldware (COLD) is building a more sustainable ecosystem that aligns with the increasing demand for secure and scalable blockchain applications. With Coldware's advanced Web3 features, it is setting itself up as a dominant force in the crypto space, one that could easily overtake Cosmos (ATOM) as it continues to innovate and gain investor confidence.



The rise of Coldware (COLD), with its financial inclusion and Web3 focus, could pose a significant challenge to Cosmos (ATOM), which remains tied to a traditional staking and DeFi framework. If Coldware can maintain its momentum and continue to address the need for scalability and security, it is poised to outperform Cosmos (ATOM) in 2025. Investors and whales alike are closely watching Coldware as it accelerates its presale success and looks to dominate the market.



As Cosmos (ATOM) pushes forward with its staking program amidst security concerns, Coldware (COLD) is quietly positioning itself to take the lead in the blockchain space. Coldware's integration of Web3 technology and focus on financial inclusion presents a compelling alternative to the traditional blockchain models employed by Cosmos (ATOM). With growing support from whales and a mission that aligns with the future of decentralized finance, Coldware could soon eclipse Cosmos (ATOM) as the go-to blockchain platform in 2025

HashKey Group Chairman and CEO Xiao Feng kicked off the 2025 Hong Kong Web3 Festival on Sunday with a keynote address highlighting blockchain technology's transformative impact on global financial infrastructure.

Speaking to an early morning crowd at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Xiao described blockchain as “a new generation of financial infrastructure” that fundamentally changes how financial transactions are recorded, settled and governed.

“Any industrial revolution must wait for a financial revolution,” Xiao told attendees at the four-day event hosted by his company.

Xiao emphasized historical parallels between technological and financial evolution: banking credit supported the British Industrial Revolution, stock markets enabled the electrical revolution in America, and venture capital fueled Silicon Valley's information revolution.

“Cryptocurrency finance will become the core financial innovation supporting the fourth industrial revolution.”

The executive highlighted key differences between traditional and blockchain-based finance, including the shift from bank accounts to digital wallets and the move from batch settlement systems to instantaneous transaction completion.

Xiao noted the significance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent decision not to classify dollar-backed stablecoins as securities, suggesting this allows more institutions to participate in monetary creation processes.

He also pointed to major stock exchanges moving toward 23-hour trading cycles, compared to blockchain markets that operate continuously.

“Traditional exchanges will eventually need to adapt to compete with cryptocurrency markets that have operated 24/7 since day one,” Xiao predicted.

The event features several high-profile regulators, including Paul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Government; Joseph H. L. Chan, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury; Christina Choi, Executive Director of Investment Products at the Securities and Futures Commission; and George Chou, Chief Fintech Officer of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

While mainland China maintains strict prohibitions on cryptocurrencies, analysts view Hong Kong's supportive stance as a strategic testing ground for the technology's potential. This approach effectively creates a regulatory breathing space where blockchain innovations can develop under controlled conditions, potentially informing future policies across the broader Chinese economy.

The Web3 Festival continues through Wednesday with industry panels, demonstrations and networking events, bringing together blockchain developers, investors and technology enthusiasts from around the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin's Price Stability at Risk From Potential 'Basis Trade Blowup' That Catalyzed the COVID Crash","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/06/bitcoin-s-strength-amid-nasdaq-drop-is-impressive-but-the-risk-of-a-basis-trade-blowup-that-spurred-the-covid-crash-looms","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 08:46:31 GMT","

Bitcoin's (BTC) recent stability amid Nasdaq turmoil driven by tariffs has generated excitement among market participants regarding the cryptocurrency's potential as a haven asset. 

Still, the bulls might want to keep an eye on the bond market, where dynamics that characterized the COVID crash of March 2020 may be emerging.

Nasdaq, Wall Street's tech-heavy index known to be positively correlated to bitcoin, has dropped 11% since President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced reciprocal tariffs on 180 nations, escalating trade tensions and drawing retaliatory levies from China. 

Other U.S. indices and global markets have also taken a beating alongside sharp losses in the risk currencies like the Australian dollar and a pullback in gold.

BTC has largely remained stable, continuing to trade above $80,000, and its resilience is being viewed as a sign of its evolution into a macro hedge.

""The S&P 500 is down roughly 5% this week as investors brace for trade-driven earnings headwinds. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has shown impressive resilience,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in an email. ""After briefly dipping below $82,000, it rebounded quickly, reinforcing its status as a macro hedge in times of macroeconomic stress. Its relative strength could continue to attract institutional inflows if broad market volatility persists."" 

The perception of stability could quickly transform into a self-fulfilling prophecy, solidifying BTC's position as a haven asset for years to come, as MacroScope noted on X. 

However, sharp downside volatility in the short term cannot be ruled out, especially as the ""Treasury market basis trade"" faces risks due to heightened turbulence in bond prices.

The basis trade involves highly leveraged hedge funds, reportedly operating at leverage ratios of 50-to-1, exploiting minor price discrepancies between Treasury futures and securities. This trade blew up in mid-March 2020 as coronavirus threatened to derail the global economy, leading to a ""dash for cash"" that saw investors sell almost every asset for dollar liquidity. On March 12, 2020, BTC fell by nearly 40%.

""When market volatility spikes - as it is now - it unearths highly leveraged carry trades vulnerable to big market moves. The blowup in the US Treasury market in March 2020, which disrupted basis carry trades, is a recent example. Risk of leveraged carry trade blowups is high...,"" Robin Brooks, managing director and chief economist at the International Institute of Finance,"" said on X. 

The risk is real because, the size of the basis trade as of March end was $1 trillion, double the tally in March 2020. The positioning is such that a one basis point move in Treasury yields (which move opposite to prices) would lead to a $600 million shift in the value of their bets, according to ZeroHedge.

So, increased volatility in the Treasury yields could cause a COVID-like blowup, leading to a widespread selling of all assets, including bitcoin, to obtain cash.

On Friday, the MOVE index, which represents the options-based implied or expected 30-day volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, jumped 12% to 125.70, the highest since Nov. 4, according to data source TradingView.

The gravity of the situation is underscored by a recent Brookings Institution paper, which advises the Federal Reserve to consider targeted interventions in the U.S. Treasury market, specifically supporting hedge funds engaged in basis trading during times of severe market stress.

Let's see how things unfold in the week ahead.

Credit spreads are widening and have reached their highest levels since August 2024 — a period that coincided with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 33% during the yen carry trade unwind.

One way to track this is through the ratio of the iShares 3–7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEI) to the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG). This IEI/HYG ratio, highlighted by analyst Caleb Franzen, serves as a proxy for credit spreads and is now showing its sharpest spike since the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March 2023 — a moment that marked a local bottom in bitcoin just below $20,000.

Historically, bitcoin and other risk assets tend to fall during sharp credit spread expansions. 

The key question now is whether this surge has peaked or if more downside lies ahead. If spreads continue to rise, it could reflect mounting stress in financial markets — and spell further trouble for risk-on positioning.

A credit spread represents the yield difference between safe government bonds and riskier corporate bonds. When spreads widen, it signals growing risk aversion and tightening financial conditions. 

However, Friday's market action seems to indicate that bitcoin is starting to decouple from the traditional markets, outperforming equities. One analyst event called it the new ""U.S. isolation hedge,"" indicating that BTC might be starting to act more like a safe haven or digital gold for TradFi investors.

Bitcoin just notched its worst first quarter in a decade, falling 11.7% as markets struggled to understand the new administration's economic agenda. 

The performance ranked 12th out of the past 15 first quarters, according to NYDIG Research's data.

The drawdown invites a familiar question in crypto circles: is the cycle over? The last time bitcoin started the year this poorly was in 2015, during a prolonged slump following the 2013 peak and after the collapse of Mt. Gox, according to NYDIG. Back then, prices recovered modestly over the rest of the year before surging in 2016.

In the first quarter of 2020, amid a market sell-off tied to fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, BTC saw a 9.4% drawdown but then recovered to end the year up over 300%. In other years with negative Q1 returns—like 2014, 2018 and 2022—bitcoin ended the year down sharply, coinciding with the tail ends of previous bull cycles, the research note said. 

This time around, the backdrop is murky. Cryptocurrency prices surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November after running a pro-crypto campaign. While under the Trump administration, the sector has been gaining greater regulatory clarity, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed off a number of lawsuits against crypto firms, it isn't all bullish.

Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs against nearly every country in the world last week, leading to a massive $5.4 trillion U.S. equities market wipeout in just two days. This led to the S&P 500 index's lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100's entry into bear market territory. While bitcoin has outperformed so far, what will happen after Monday's opening bell is unclear.

Historically, a weak Q1 doesn't always spell doom for BTC, NYDIG's data shows. The asset has bounced back in half of the years when it started in the red. The recent macroeconomic backdrop has seen analysts raise recession odds, which could test BTC's role as a “U.S. isolation hedge.”Read more: Chart of The Week: Will April Bring Good Luck or Fool's Hope for Bitcoin?

 Automating crypto trades with Grok 3 might seem promising, but issues like data loss and inaccurate signals can hurt your performance in a fast-paced market. 

Grok 3 adjusts its predictions based on evolving market trends by analyzing real-time data patterns.

Combining technical analysis with sentiment data improves accuracy; Grok 3 effectively identifies potential trade opportunities.

Backtesting strategies before live trading is crucial; testing Grok 3's prompts using historical data helps refine conditions and improve performance.

While Grok 3 can automate trades, human oversight remains critical in adapting to unexpected market conditions.

Crypto trading is complex. Prices can swing wildly, and even experienced traders struggle to keep up. That's why automation tools are gaining attention, with many now exploring Grok 3, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model from xAI (founded by Elon Musk).

Grok 3 wasn't built specifically for trading, but its ability to analyze data, spot patterns and interpret trends has encouraged traders to test it for automated strategies. The idea is simple: Let Grok 3 make data-driven decisions, removing the emotional guesswork that often leads to poor trades.

But does it actually work? Some traders report impressive results, while others find it unpredictable, especially in volatile markets.

This article digs into what happens when you automate crypto trades with Grok 3. From successful strategies to unexpected risks, you'll get a clear picture of what to expect, plus actionable tips to improve your results.

Grok 3 is an AI model designed by xAI, an artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk. While its primary focus is natural language processing, some traders are now testing Grok 3 as a potential tool for improving crypto trading strategies. Unlike traditional trading bots operating on rigid rules, Grok 3's flexible design allows it to analyze diverse data sources and uncover patterns that might be overlooked.

Grok 3's appeal lies in its ability to handle complex data, a crucial advantage in crypto markets, where price moves are often triggered by unexpected events or sentiment shifts.

Here's where traders say Grok 3 has potential:

Identifying market sentiment trends: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by emotions like FOMO (fear of missing out) and FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Grok 3 can analyze social media, news headlines and community discussions to assess changing sentiment, a key factor in crypto volatility.

Recognizing hidden patterns: Grok 3's machine learning capabilities allow it to detect subtle correlations between indicators that traditional bots may overlook. For instance, Grok 3 may link an increase in social sentiment with rising whale activity to predict bullish momentum.

Flexible analysis based on prompts: Rather than following static rules like “Buy when RSI falls below 30,” Grok 3 enables traders to design more complex strategies using natural language instructions.

Grok 3 isn't your typical crypto trading bot. It doesn't place trades directly or integrate with exchanges on its own. But it can help traders build smarter, faster and more flexible automation systems. From writing trade logic to analyzing market sentiment, Grok 3 is already being used in the real world to streamline how crypto strategies are created and tested.

Instead of manually scripting every piece of logic, traders are now using Grok 3 to generate working code for bots. For example, a user asked Grok 3 to write token buy/sell logic with parameters like slippage, take-profit and gas priority fees. It generated a script that can be plugged into DeFi tools or expanded with 0x and Uniswap APIs.

Some traders use Grok 3 to build end-to-end bots tailored to niche tokens or specific strategies. In another example, Grok 3 was used to create an automated system that scans price action and triggers trades under strict conditions. It doesn't just stop at buy/sell logic. Grok also writes portfolio rebalancing scripts and can simulate how positions would perform under different volatility conditions.

Here is an example of a prompt fed into Grok 3, along with the output received.

Below is a structured outline for a high-frequency trading bot framework designed for Solana (SOL), focusing on one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. This outline provides a modular structure with placeholders for key components, avoiding specific implementation details as requested.

Purpose: Define global settings and constants for the bot.

Components:

Solana network endpoint (e.g., mainnet RPC URL)

Wallet configuration (private key or keypair for trading)

Trading pair (e.g., SOL/USDC)

Timeframe (one-minute candlestick data)

Trade size ($100 per position)

Max trades (10 concurrent or sequential positions)

Profit target ($50 total)

Max loss per trade ($20)

Purpose: Fetch and process real-time SOL price data.

Components:

WebSocket connection to Solana blockchain or exchange API (e.g., Serum, Raydium, or centralized exchange like Binance)

1-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data stream

Data buffer for storing recent price history

Error handling for connection drops or latency

Purpose: Assess SOL's price volatility to inform trade decisions.

Components:

Placeholder: Calculate short-term volatility (e.g., standard deviation or ATR over one-minute candles)

Placeholder: Define volatility thresholds (e.g., high/low volatility states)

Output: Volatility score or signal to adjust trade frequency/size

Purpose: Generate buy/sell signals based on price fluctuations.

Components:

Placeholder: Simple momentum strategy (e.g., price crossing a short-term moving average)

Placeholder: Filter signals using volatility analysis

Signal validation (e.g., avoid over-trading within one-minute window)

Output: Buy/sell signal with timestamp

Purpose: Enforce risk controls and position limits.

Components:

Position size calculator (fixed at $100 per trade)

Max loss check ($20 per trade stop-loss)

Total profit/loss tracker (halt at $50 profit or after 10 trades)

Concurrent trade limiter (cap at 10 active positions)

Emergency stop (pause bot on extreme volatility or connectivity loss)

Purpose: Execute trades on the Solana blockchain or exchange.

Components:

Placeholder: Build Solana transaction (e.g., swap SOL for USDC via a DEX like Raydium)

Order type (market order for speed in one-minute timeframe)

Slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.5% max slippage)

Transaction signing and submission

Confirmation listener (await transaction finality)

Error handling (e.g., retry on failed execution)

Purpose: Track and log bot performance in real time.

Components:

Trade log (entry price, exit price, profit/loss, timestamp)

Running total profit/loss calculator

Performance metrics (e.g., win rate, average trade duration)

Alert system (notify on profit target, max loss, or errors)

Purpose: Orchestrate bot operations in a continuous cycle.

Components:

Initialize bot (load config, connect to data feed)

Loop:

Fetch one-minute price data

Analyze volatility

Generate trade signal

Apply risk management checks

Execute trade if conditions met

Update performance metrics

Exit conditions (profit target hit, max trades reached, or manual stop)

Purpose: Safely terminate the bot and finalize operations.

Components:

Close open WebSocket connections

Finalize pending transactions

Save trade log and performance summary

Release resources (e.g., memory, wallet connections)

Notes

This framework assumes integration with Solana's ecosystem (e.g., using a DEX or liquidity pool). Adjust the execution module if targeting a centralized exchange.

Volatility analysis and signal generation are left as placeholders for customization (e.g., technical indicators or machine learning models).

Risk management is strict to align with the $50 profit goal and $20 max loss per trade, ensuring the bot operates within defined boundaries.

Caution! The above is a tailored outline shaped by the user's prompt, targeting one-minute price fluctuations, risk management and trade execution. Its output varies with prompt detail, as specificity sharpens results. Moreover, placeholders like volatility analysis await user customization, reflecting Grok 3's adaptive learning. It's a conceptual guide, not code, and success hinges on implementation and market conditions. For deeper refinement, such as Solana-specific tweaks, users can provide more context. Grok 3 adjusts using their input and its latest insights.

Let's learn the general steps required to set up Grok 3 for automated crypto trading.

Setting up Grok 3 for AI-powered crypto trading automation isn't as straightforward as installing a typical trading bot. Since Grok 3 wasn't built for direct trading, it requires thoughtful setup, integration and customization. Below is a practical guide to setting up Grok 3 effectively for automated crypto trading with AI (artificial intelligence).

Since Grok 3 doesn't connect directly to crypto exchanges, it requires integration with third-party platforms that support API automation. Platforms like:

3Commas: Ideal for executing trades via automated strategies.

TradingView: Used for generating trade signals using Pine Script.

CryptoHopper: Offers custom strategy-building tools with API integration.

Ensure that the chosen platform offers robust API support for managing trade execution, setting risk controls and tracking performance.

Grok 3 doesn't connect directly to crypto exchanges; integration requires creative workarounds:

API integration via automation tools: Platforms like Zapier or Make.com can connect Grok 3's analysis to trading platforms.

Custom Python scripts: For tech-savvy traders, Grok 3's insights can be processed through Python scripts that execute trades based on Grok 3's recommendations.

No-code automation tools: Services like IFTTT can trigger basic trading actions based on Grok 3's sentiment analysis.

Grok 3's success hinges on well-defined strategies. Unlike traditional bots that rely solely on technical signals, Grok 3 crypto trading bot can combine multiple factors, including:

Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.

Sentiment analysis: Social media trends, influencer opinions and news headlines

Onchain data: Whale activity, exchange inflows/outflows and large wallet movement.

Before deploying Grok 3's strategy in live markets, backtesting is essential to evaluate its performance. Backtesting can reveal:

Accuracy of trade signals: Identify how often Grok 3's suggested trades align with profitable outcomes.

False signal detection: Ensure Grok 3 isn't generating excessive buy/sell recommendations in volatile or stagnant markets

Refinement opportunities: Fine-tune conditions such as RSI thresholds, sentiment scores or trade exit conditions

Examples of tools for backtesting include TradingView and CryptoQuant.

Even with solid insights, crypto markets are unpredictable. Adding risk controls minimizes potential losses:

Stop-loss orders: Automatically exits trades if prices move beyond a set threshold.

Position limits: Restricts trade size to reduce exposure in uncertain markets.

Trailing stops: Locks in profits during upward trends while minimizing downside risk.

Example of risk control prompt: “Write a code to handle buying and selling a token with the given parameters, including priority fees, slippage, and a take-profit mechanism.”

Please note that the output shown above is not complete and is provided for illustration purposes only.

Grok 3's strength lies in its adaptability, but it requires ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal results. Regularly review:

Performance data: Assess win rates, profit margins and signal accuracy.

Market conditions: Adjust strategy if major shifts (e.g., regulatory changes or macroeconomic factors) impact sentiment or momentum.

Pro tip: Revisiting Grok 3's prompts regularly can refine strategy outcomes and improve long-term performance.

Despite its strengths, Grok 3 has limitations that traders must consider. 

Data loss: Crypto trading thrives on accurate and real-time data. However, crypto trading automation with Grok 3 has been reported to lose chunks of data, miscount words and provide incorrect time references, which can be detrimental in a fast-moving market and result in inaccurate signal detection, delayed responses to market events and flawed strategy execution.

No direct exchange integration: Unlike purpose-built trading bots, Grok 3 doesn't connect directly to crypto exchanges. Traders must rely on third-party platforms to execute trades.

Forgetfulness: One of the biggest frustrations highlighted by some users is Grok 3's “retrograde amnesia,” when it forgets everything from previous sessions. For crypto traders, this is a nightmare. Imagine building a trading strategy and needing Grok 3 to remember past trends and conversations, only for it to start fresh each session.

Bias: Grok 3 may deliver biased responses, potentially relying on incomplete or skewed sources. For traders who depend on unbiased sentiment analysis to gauge market mood, this shift could lead to misleading insights and poor decision-making.

Slower execution speed: Since Grok 3 processes information based on detailed prompts, its trade signals may lag behind fast-moving price changes.

Prompt dependence: Grok 3's accuracy depends heavily on well-structured prompts. Vague or incomplete instructions often produce unreliable results.

While Grok-3 and other AI systems offer powerful tools for automating crypto trades, caution is essential. Their performance depends heavily on the quality of data and the strategies they're programmed with, meaning unexpected market shifts or flawed inputs can lead to significant losses. 

Remember, AI lacks human intuition and may struggle with unprecedented events, so relying solely on it without oversight is risky. Always test strategies with small amounts first and get help from experts before making large investments.","{'href': 'https://cointelegraph.com', 'title': 'Cointelegraph'}","cryptocurrency"

 Bill Ackman, who backed the crypto industry in the wake of the FTX collapse, is now forecasting that Trump may postpone the tariffs to give himself room to ""make deals."" 

Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman is considering the possibility that US President Donald Trump may pause the implementation of his controversial proposed tariffs on April 7.

“One would have to imagine that President Donald Trump's phone has been ringing off the hook. The practical reality is that there is insufficient time for him to make deals before the tariffs are scheduled to take effect,” Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, said in an April 5 X post.

“I would, therefore, not be surprised to wake up Monday with an announcement from the President that he was postponing the implementation of the tariffs to give him time to make deals,” Ackman added.

On April 2, Trump signed an executive order establishing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries, which took effect on April 5. Harsher reciprocal tariffs on trading partners with which the US has the largest trade deficits are scheduled to kick in on April 9.

Ackman — who famously said “crypto is here to stay” after the FTX collapse in November 2022 — said Trump captured the attention of the world and US trading partners, backing the tariffs as necessary after what he called an “unfair tariff regime” that hurt US workers and economy “over many decades.” 

Following Trump's announcement on April 2, the US stock market shed more value during the April 4 trading session than the entire crypto market is currently worth. The fact that crypto held up better than the US stock market caught the attention of both crypto industry supporters and skeptics.

Prominent crypto voices such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss also recently showed their support for Trump's tariffs.

Ackman said a pause would be a logical move by Trump — not just to allow time for closing potential deals but also to give companies of all sizes ""time to prepare for changes."" He added:

Ackman said April 7 will be “one of the more interesting days” in US economic history.

 “In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,” Michaël van de Poppe told Cointelegraph 

Cryptocurrency markets could be on track for recovery as investor sentiment begins to stabilize following US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcement — what some analysts are calling the peak of recent market uncertainty.

Trump announced his reciprocal import tariffs on April 2, which sent tremors across global markets. The S&P 500 lost more than $5 trillion, its largest drop on record, surpassing the pandemic-induced crash in March 2020, according to Reuters.

Still, some analysts see a silver lining to the tariff announcement.

“In my opinion, the tariffs are the representation of the uncertainty in the markets,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph. “Liberation Day is basically the peak of that period, the climax of uncertainty. Now it's out in the open. Everybody knows the new playing field.”

Van de Poppe added that he believes Trump is using tariffs as a strategic move to stimulate domestic growth and reduce yields. “Tariffs are literally the only way to do that,” he said. “I wouldn't be surprised if they're reversed within the next six to 12 months.”

President Trump's plan imposes a 10% baseline tariff on all US imports from April 5 and a higher “reciprocal tariff” of up to 54% on select countries with larger trade deficits from April 9.

Still, the end of the uncertainty could bring renewed investment into crypto markets, leading to a recovery, Van de Poppe said:

He noted that the economic impact of the tariffs may ultimately lead the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and begin a new round of quantitative easing (QE), a monetary policy that involves the Fed buying bonds to inject liquidity into the economy.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, has predicted Bitcoin could climb to $250,000 if the Fed formally enters a QE cycle.

On the downside, the tariff-related uncertainty may continue pressuring risk asset appetite for weeks, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter.

“We can count on President Trump changing his mind a few times within the first couple of weeks,” Acheson told Cointelegraph. She added:

“For crypto, BTC continues to act like a risk asset short-term while its analog counterpart gold breaks through one all-time high after another,” a development that may impact crypto investor sentiment in the short term, Acheson said.

Meanwhile, crypto intelligence firm Nansen estimated a 70% probability that the market could bottom by June, depending on how the tariff negotiations evolve.

 Social media giant Meta didn't hold back in claiming that its new Llama 4 models “outperform” the competition. 

The White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks says Meta's release of its latest AI model, Llama 4, has pushed the United States into the lead in the global artificial intelligence race.

“For the US to win the AI race, we have to win in open source too, and Llama 4 puts us back in the lead,” Sacks said in an April 5 X post, as speculation continues to mount over the US and China competing for the top spot in the global AI race. 

Sacks has been vocal about the AI race since taking on his role following US President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Just over a week into the job, Sacks said he is “confident in the US, but we can't be complacent.”

Sack's latest comment came after Meta's AI division said in an X post on the same day that it is introducing the fourth generation of its Llama models, Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick.

“Our most advanced models yet and the best in their class for multimodality,” Meta said.

Meta said its Llama 4 Scout model has 17 billion active parameters and uses 16 experts. 

The company claims it outperforms rival large language models — Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-lite, and Mistral 3.1 — “across a broad range of widely accepted benchmarks.” 

Meanwhile, Llama 4 Maverick also has 17 billion active parameters but is configured with 128 experts. Meta claimed the Maverick model can outperform GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash “across a broad range of widely accepted benchmarks.”

At the time, Meta said it was “blown away” by the demand, receiving over 100,000 requests for access.

 Decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid continue cutting into the market share of their centralized rivals. 

Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) continue to challenge the dominance of centralized platforms, even as a recent $6.2 million exploit on Hyperliquid highlights risks in DEX infrastructure.

A cryptocurrency whale made at least $6.26 million profit on the Jelly my Jelly (JELLY) memecoin by exploiting the liquidation parameters on Hyperliquid, Cointelegraph reported on March 27. 

The exploit was the second major incident on the platform in March, noted CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong.

“$JELLYJELLY was the more notable attack where we saw Binance and OKX listing perps, drawing accusations of coordinating an attack against Hyperliquid,” Ong said in an April 3 X post, adding:

Hyperliquid is the eighth-largest perpetual futures exchange by volume across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This puts it “ahead of some notable OGs such as HTX, Kraken and BitMEX,” Ong noted, citing an April 4 research report.

Hyperliquid is the 12th-largest derivatives exchange, with an over $3 billion 24-hour open interest — though it still trails Binance's $19.5 billion by a wide margin, CoinGecko data shows.

According to Bitget Research analyst Ryan Lee, the incident may harm user confidence in emerging decentralized platforms, especially if actions taken post-exploit appear overly centralized.

“Hyperliquid's intervention — criticized as centralized despite its decentralized ethos — may make investors wary of similar platforms,” Lee said.

The unknown Hyperliquid whale managed to exploit Hyperliquid's liquidation parameters by deploying millions of dollars worth of trading positions.

The whale opened two long positions of $2.15 million and $1.9 million and a $4.1 million short position that effectively offset the longs, according to a postmortem by blockchain analytics firm Arkham.

When the price of JELLY rose by 400%, the $4 million short position wasn't immediately liquidated due to its size. Instead, it was absorbed into the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP), which is designed to liquidate large positions.

As of March 27, the unknown whale still held 10% of the memecoin's total supply, worth nearly $2 million, despite Hyperliquid freezing and delisting the memecoin, citing “evidence of suspicious market activity” involving trading instruments.

The Hyperliquid exploit occurred two weeks after a Wolf of Wall Street-inspired memecoin — launched by the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and Libra (LIBRA) token co-creator Hayden Davis — crashed over 99% after launching with an 80% insider supply.

Roughly 392,000 FTX creditors have failed to complete or at least take the first steps of the mandatory Know Your Customer verification, according to an April 2 court filing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

FTX users originally had until March 3 to begin the verification process to collect their claims.

“If a holder of a claim listed on Schedule 1 attached thereto did not commence the KYC submission process with respect to such claim on or prior to March 3, 2025, at 4:00 pm (ET) (the “KYC Commencing Deadline”), 2 such claim shall be disallowed and expunged in its entirety,” the filing states.

The KYC deadline has been extended to June 1, 2025, giving users another chance to verify their identity and claim eligibility. Those who fail to meet the new deadline may have their claims permanently disqualified.

According to the court documents, claims under $50,000 could account for roughly $655 million in disallowed repayments, while claims over $50,000 could amount to $1.9 billion — bringing the total at-risk funds to more than $2.5 billion.

The next round of FTX creditor repayments is set for May 30, 2025, with over $11 billion expected to be repaid to creditors with claims of over $50,000.

Under FTX's recovery plan, 98% of creditors are expected to receive at least 118% of their original claim value in cash.

Many FTX users have reported problems with the KYC process.

However, users who were unable to submit their KYC documentation can resubmit their application and restart the verification process, according to an April 5 X post from Sunil, FTX creditor and Customer Ad-Hoc Committee member.

Impacted users should email FTX support (support@ftx.com) to receive a ticket number, then log in to the support portal, create an account, and re-upload the necessary KYC documents.

FTX's Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets, processed the first round of repayments in February, distributing $1.2 billion to creditors.

The crypto industry is still recovering from the collapse of FTX and more than 130 subsidiaries launched a series of insolvencies that led to the industry's longest-ever crypto winter, which saw Bitcoin's (BTC) price bottom out at around $16,000.

While not a “market-moving catalyst” in itself, the beginning of the FTX repayments is a positive sign for the maturation of the crypto industry, which may see a “significant portion” reinvested into cryptocurrencies, Alvin Kan, chief operating officer at Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph.

Dennis Gaitsgory, Who Proved Part of Math's Grand Unified Theory, Wins Breakthrough Prize

By solving part of the Langlands program, a mathematical proof that was long thought to be unachievable, Dennis Gaitsgory snags a prestigious Breakthrough Prize

By Manon Bischoff edited by Jeanna Bryner

Dennis Gaitsgory, of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, has won the Breakthrough Prize in mathematics for numerous breakthrough contributions to the geometric Langlands program.

The Langlands program has been described by mathematician Edward Frankel as the “grand unified theory of mathematics.” Conceived by Robert Langlands in 1967, the program includes numerous conjectures that were intended to connect disparate mathematical realms: number theory and harmonic analysis. In the 1990s, a similar connection between geometry and harmonic analysis was noticed, and the geometric Langlands program was born. Decades later, in 2024, Dennis Gaitsgory of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and eight of his colleagues achieved a breakthrough. In five scientific preprint papers, consisting of nearly 1,000 pages, they proved that a large class of geometric objects is related to quantities from calculus. Gaitsgory has now been awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, which includes a $3-million award, for this outstanding achievement.

Scientific American's German-language sister publication Spektrum der Wissenschaft spoke to Gaitsgory about his math career, the Langlands achievement and the prestigious Breakthrough Prize.

You've been working on the geometric Langlands program for 30 years. When was the moment that you realized you'd be able to prove it? 

There was a very crucial step that was always a mystery. This got solved by a former graduate student of mine, [mathematician] Sam Raskin, and his graduate students in the winter of 2022. They proved that something is nonzero. After this, it was clear that we would be able to work out a proof.

How did you feel when you realized that it could really be done?

I've always perceived it as some kind of long-term project for self-entertainment. So I obviously felt happy, but it was not like a very strong emotion or anything. It wasn't a eureka moment.

The conjecture that we proved is one particular case of something much, much bigger. It has received a lot of attention because it's one well-formulated thing. But it's just one step. I was happy that this step had been done, but there's much more to do.

So there was no champagne popping? You just sat down and continued working?

There was no champagne but something similar. When [Raskin] said that he could prove this crucial part, we made a bet: if he could really do it, I promised him a bottle of scotch.

The proof is huge, almost 1,000 pages. Did you oversee everything in it?

I wrote 95 percent of it. [That was] not for a good reason but because I had an injury from skiing, and I was just lying in bed. So what else was there to do? I was watching Star Wars with my son and writing this thing.

Do you mean you did both at the same time?

Initially, some sections in our papers were named after Star Wars episodes, but at the end, we deleted [that element], mostly out of copyright concerns. But one paper still has a quote from Star Wars: “Fear will keep the local systems in line.” It was a really good fit, because in this paper, we had to control the moduli space of local systems.

It's one thing to understand something but another to write everything down in detail. Did any problems pop up?

Of course. We had a road map, but there were still a lot of blanks to fill, many theories to be developed.

But I don't think there was a moment of actual panic. Sometimes I was not sure if one thing would require three more pages, 20 more pages or 50 more pages. There was just an uncertainty of how much more work had to be done.

Did you do all of this from your bed?

No, actually it was a cooperative process. The proof has nine co-authors: Every day I was writing to this guy and to that guy. They all have different perspectives and a slightly different kind of expertise. In some sense, it was as if I was lying in bed, and my colleagues were visiting me, so I didn't get bored. It really held my spirits up that I could talk to them by e-mail.

There are some people who go to a bar to drink; we instead just talk about math. They talk about soccer; we talk about math. It's the same thing; it's human interaction.

Speaking of human interaction, do you talk about your work with your friends and family?

No. They're not mathematicians. They can't technically understand. My wife was close by my side and knows the story and the development of the topic. She knows how these things look from the outside, but I can't describe the content [to her].

A lot of people would say that the Langlands program is one of the most complex research topics in the world. Would you agree?

The question is: What do you mean by complex? Yes, one cannot come from the street and just study this. But the same applies to what other mathematicians, such as Peter Scholze [who studies arithmetic geometry at the University of Bonn in Germany and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics], are doing. I don't have the background to just come to a talk he is giving and understand what he says because there are lots of technical details.

It's the same here. One has to invest some effort to understand how things work, and then one should be able to understand. But that doesn't say that whatever we're doing is intrinsically more complex. I think all frontier math is equally complicated. We're all trying to push a boundary at different points.

How many people can understand the technical parts of your work?

Now the community is growing because people are studying our proof. But up until last year, apart from [my] eight co-authors, there may have been five or six people who would have the capacity to understand the technical details.

Do you wish that more people were involved in this type of research?

Yes, definitely. So far it has been a very small community: The people who pushed the boundaries were basically my former students plus Dima Arinkin [a math professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison], who is my age. He was a close friend and collaborator for many years. So some ideas get recycled. It would be just nice to have an influx of people from the outside. They could bring in something totally new. I would be very excited to see new ideas.

What could be done to get more people interested in the geometric Langlands problem?

More lectures and workshops on that topic, I guess. There will be a master class in Copenhagen, for example, in August. And there will be a conference in Berkeley, Calif. But now our research gets more attention because our proof is out. I regularly receive e-mails, mostly from younger people.

[At the time of my interview], for example, [I am set to give] a talk to a big audience of graduate students in Graz, Austria. I will talk about the foundations of derived algebraic geometry. So the graduate students want to study these foundations, and hopefully some of them will proceed to study the geometric Langlands program. But they need derived algebraic geometry to understand this. [Editor's Note: This talk was scheduled for April 2.]

So you hope to catch the interest of young students by teaching them derived algebraic geometry. How did you become interested in the Langlands program in the first place?

It was back in the 1990s, when [Alexander] Sasha Beilinson [a mathematician now at the University of Chicago] came to Tel Aviv [University], where I was a graduate student. Beilinson gave two talks; he was at the very beginning of his own work on the subject. And I was completely captivated. I had learned about the classical Langlands program..., but before his talk, I had no idea that it could be related to geometry. It was the first time I heard about it. The objects he talked about seemed so appealing to me. It was exactly the type of mathematical object that I wanted to study. And they all came together miraculously in this. And I was like, “Wow.” I had to work on that.

Does the same fascination still drive your research?

Of course things evolved. It's one thing when you're 20, another thing when you're 50. I don't know what drives me now. It's like an actual desire. It's like appetite. I want to do math. And if I can't, if I'm prevented from doing math, such as when I'm on a family vacation for a week with my kids, and I can't do math, I suffer.

Really? That happens after one week?

One week is maybe still okay. But after two weeks, I become a terrible human being.

Well, it's wonderful to find such a passion in life.

It's not really passion.

Is it maybe more like some kind of addiction?

Yes, maybe. It's more like: man needs to eat, and man needs to do math.

What are you working on now? Did you plunge into an abyss?

I am trying to generalize our work. I have several projects at different stages. There's a lot of theory to be developed, but at least we now have a program. We know what we want.

You have a new road map?

Let's say that we have the road map of desires but not a roadmap of methods like the one I [described] in 2013 [and published in 2015]. Back then, I knew exactly what needed to be proved. Now I know what I want, but I don't know how to get there.

Maybe you will get new ideas from new researchers.

That would be very nice. But I think, in some sense, it's like a Darwinian process: If the math is valuable, it will get studied. And more people will understand and get attracted. And if the math is boring, then too bad. Time will show.

Nestled between Hawaii and the western coast of Mexico lies the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5 million-kilometer-square area of abyssal plain bordered by the Clarion and Clipperton Fracture Zones. Although this stretch of sea is a vibrant ecosystem filled with marine life, the CCZ is known best for its immense collection of potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. 

These rocks, of which there are potentially trillions, are filled with rich deposits of nickel, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt. Those particular metals are vital for the batteries needed to power a green energy future, leading some mining companies to refer to nodules as a “battery in a rock.”

However, a study reports that these nodules might be much more than simply a collection of valuable materials for electric cars—they also produce oxygen 4,000 meters below the surface where sunlight can't reach. 

This unexpected source of “dark oxygen,” as it's called, redefines the role these nodules play in the CZZ. The rocks could also rewrite the script on not only how life began on this planet, but also its potential to take hold on other worlds within our Solar System, such as Enceladus or Europa. The results of this study were published in the journal Nature Geoscience. 

“For aerobic life to begin on the planet,” Andrew Sweetman, deep-sea ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science and lead author of the study said in a press statement, “there had to be oxygen and our understanding has been that Earth's oxygen supply began with photosynthetic organisms. But we now know that there is oxygen produced in the deep sea, where there is no light. I think we therefore need to revisit questions like: where could aerobic life have begun?”

The journey toward this discovery began more than a decade ago when Sweetman began analyzing how oxygen levels decreased further into the depths of the ocean. So it came as a surprise in 2013 when sensors returned increased levels of oxygen in the CCZ. At the time, Sweetman dismissed the data as the result of faulty sensors, but future studies showed that this abyssal plain somehow produced oxygen. Taking note of the nodule's “battery in a rock” tagline, Sweetman wondered if the minerals found in these nodules were somehow acting as a kind of “geobattery” by separating hydrogen and oxygen via seawater electrolysis. 

A 2023 study showed that various bacteria and archaea can create “dark oxygen,” so Sweetman and his team recreated the conditions of the CCZ in a laboratory and killed off any microorganisms with mercury chloride—surprisingly, oxygen levels continued rising. According to Scientific American, Sweetman found a voltage of roughly 0.95 volts on the surface of these nodules, likely charging up as they grow with different deposits growing irregularly throughout, and this natural charge is enough to split the seawater. 

This discovery adds more fuel to the already-fiery debate over what to do with these nodules. Mining outfits like the Metals Company, the CEO of which coined the phrase “battery in a rock,” sees these nodules as the answer to our energy problems. However, 25 countries want the governing body—the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council—to implement a moratorium, or at the very least a precautionary pause, so more research can be conducted to see how mining these nodules could affect the ocean. This is especially vital considering that the world's seas are already facing a litany of climate challenges, including acidification, deoxygenation, and pollution. 

In response to this discovery, Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Lisa Levin, who wasn't involved with the study, highlighted why such a moratorium is so important for protecting these deep-sea nodules in a comment to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition: 

The ISA is still negotiating with key players on deep-sea mining regulations. 

So while the future of the world's oceans is approaching a critical moment of conservation or exploitation, science has proven once again that disrupting these ecosystems could have consequences we can't even imagine.

Metrics details

The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses challenges for manual knowledge curation and synthesis. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs—GPT and LLaMA representatives—on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with the traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here, we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero- or few-shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open-source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps. We find issues like missing information and hallucinations in LLM outputs. These results offer practical insights for applying LLMs in BioNLP.

Biomedical literature presents direct obstacles to curation, interpretation, and knowledge discovery due to its vast volume and domain-specific challenges. PubMed alone sees an increase of approximately 5000 articles every day, totaling over 36 million as of March 20241. In specialized fields such as COVID-19, roughly 10,000 dedicated articles are added each month, bringing the total to over 0.4 million as of March 20242. In addition to volume, the biomedical domain also poses challenges with ambiguous language. For example, a single entity such as Long COVID can be referred to using 763 different terms3. Additionally, the same term can describe different entities, as seen with the term AP2, which can refer to a gene, a chemical, or a cell line4. Beyond entities, identifying novel biomedical relations and capturing semantics in biomedical literature present further challenges5,6.

To overcome these challenges, biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) techniques are used to assist with manual curation, interpretation, and knowledge discovery. Biomedical language models are considered as the backbone of BioNLP methods; they leverage massive amounts of biomedical literature and capture biomedical semantic representations in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner. Early biomedical language models are non-contextual embeddings (e.g., word2vec and fastText) that use fully connected neural networks such as BioWordVec and BioSentVec4,7,8. Since the inception of transformers, biomedical language models have adopted their architecture, and can be categorized into (1) encoder-based, masked language models using the encoder from the transformer architecture such as the biomedical bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) family including BioBERT and PubMedBERT9,10,11, (2) decoder-based, generative language models using the decoder from the transformer architecture such as the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) family including BioGPT and BioMedLM12,13, and (3) encoder-decoder-based, using both encoders and decoders such as BioBART and Scifive14,15. BioNLP studies fine-tuned those language models and demonstrated that they achieved the SOTA performance in various BioNLP applications10,16, and those models have been successfully employed in PubMed-scale downstream applications such as biomedical sentence search17 and COVID-19 literature mining2.

Recently, the latest closed-source GPT models, including GPT-3 and, more notably, GPT-4, have made significant strides and garnered considerable attention from society. A key characteristic of these models is the exponential growth of their parameters. For instance, GPT-3 has ~175 billion parameters, which is hundreds larger than GPT-2. Models of this magnitude are commonly referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs)18. Moreover, the enhancement of LLMs is achieved through reinforcement learning with human feedback, thereby aligning text generation with human preferences19. For instance, GPT-3.5 builds upon the foundation of GPT-3 using reinforcement learning techniques, resulting in significantly improved performance in natural language understanding20. The launch of ChatGPT—a chatbot using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4—has marked a milestone in generative artificial intelligence. It has demonstrated strong capabilities in the tasks that its predecessors fail to do; for instance, GPT-4 passed over 20 academic and professional exams, including the Uniform Bar Exam, SAT Evidence-Based Reading & Writing, and Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program21. The remarkable advancements have sparked extensive discussions among society, with excitement and concerns alike. In addition to closed-source LLMs, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA22 and Mixtral23 have been widely adopted in downstream applications and also used as the basis for continuous pretraining domain-specific resources. In the biomedical domain, PMC LLaMA (7B and 13B) is one of the first biomedical domain-specific LLMs that continuously pre-trained LLaMA on 4.8 M biomedical papers and 30 K medical textbooks24. Meditron (7B and 70B), a more recent biomedical domain-specific LLM, employed a similar continuous pretraining strategy on LLaMA 2.

Pioneering studies have conducted early experiments on LLMs in the biomedical domain and reported encouraging results. For instance, Bubeck et al. studied the ability of GPT-4 in a wide spectrum, such as coding, mathematics, and interactions with humans. This early study reported biomedical-related results, indicating that GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% in the US Medical Licensing Exam (Step 1, 2, and 3), along with an example of using GPT-4 to verify claims in a medical note. Lee et al. also demonstrated use cases of GPT-4 for answering medical questions, generating summaries from patient reports, assisting clinical decision-making, and creating educational materials24. Wong et al. conducted a study on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for end-to-end clinical trial matching, handling complex eligibility criteria, and extracting complex matching logic25. Liu et al. explored the performance of GPT-4 on radiology domain-specific use cases26. Nori et al. further found that general-domain LLMs with advanced prompt engineering can achieve the highest accuracy in medical question answering without fine-tuning27. Recent reviews also summarize related studies in detail28,29,30.

These results demonstrate the potential of using LLMs in BioNLP applications, particularly when minimal manually curated gold standard data is available and fine-tuning or retraining for every new task is not required. In the biomedical domain, a primary challenge is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which have a significantly lower scale than those in the general domain (e.g., a biomedical sentence similarity dataset only has 100 labeled instances in total31)32,33. This challenges the fine-tuning approach because (1) models fine-tuned on limited labeled datasets may not be generalizable, and (2) it becomes more challenging to fine-tune the models with a larger size.

Motivated by the early experiments, it is important to systematically assess the effectiveness of LLMs in BioNLP tasks and comprehend their impact on BioNLP method development and downstream users. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of representative studies in this context. While our primary focus is on the biomedical domain, specifically the evaluation of LLMs using biomedical literature, we have also included two representative studies in the clinical domain (evaluating LLMs using clinical records) for reference. There are several primary limitations. First, most evaluation studies primarily assessed GPT-3 or GPT-3.5, which may not provide a full spectrum of representative LLMs from different categories. For instance, few studies evaluated more advanced closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, LLM representatives from the general domain such as LLaMA22, and biomedical domain-specific LLMs such as PMC-LLaMA34. Second, the existing studies mostly assessed extraction tasks where the gold standard is fixed. Few of these studies evaluated generative tasks such as text summarization and text simplification where the gold standard is free-text. Arguably, existing transformer models have demonstrated satisfactory performance in extractive tasks, while generative tasks remain a challenge in terms of achieving similar levels of proficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to assess how effective LLMs are in the context of generative tasks in BioNLP, examining whether they can complement existing models. Third, most existing studies only reported quantitative assessments such as the F1-score, with limited emphasis on qualitative evaluations. However, conducting qualitative evaluations (e.g., assessing the quality of LLM-generated text and categorizing inconsistent or hallucinated responses) to understand of the errors and impacts of LLMs on downstream applications in the biomedical domain are arguably more critical than mere quantitative metrics. For instance, studies on LLMs found a relatively low correlation between human judgments and automatic measures, such as ROUGE-L, commonly applied to text summarization tasks in the clinical domain35. Finally, it is worth noting that several studies did not provide public access to their associated data or codes. For example, few studies have made the prompts or selected examples for few-shot learning available. This hinders reproducibility and also presents challenges in evaluating new LLMs using the same setting for a fair comparison.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in BioNLP applications to examine their great potentials as well as their limitations and errors. Our study has three main contributions.

First, we performed comprehensive evaluations on four representative LLMs: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (representatives from closed-source LLMs), LLaMA 2 (a representative from open-sourced LLMs), and PMC LLaMA (a representative from biomedical domain-specific LLMs). We evaluated them on 12 BioNLP datasets across six applications: (1) named entity recognition, which extracts biological entities of interest from free-text, (2) relation extraction, which identifies relations among entities, (3) multi-label document classification, which categorizes documents into broad categories, (4) question answering, which provides answers to medical questions, (5) text summarization, which produces a coherent summary of an input text, and (6) text simplification, which generates understandable content of an input text. The models were evaluated under four settings: zero-shot, static few-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning where applicable. We compared these models against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches that use fine-tuned, domain-specific BERT or BART models. Both BERT and BART models are well-established in BioNLP research.

Our results suggest that SOTA fine-tuning approaches outperformed zero- and few-shot LLMs in most of the BioNLP tasks. These approaches achieved a macro-average approximately 15% higher than the best zero- and few-shot LLM performance across 12 benchmarks (0.65 vs. 0.51) and over 40% higher in information extraction tasks, such as relation extraction (0.79 vs. 0.33). However, closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated better zero- and few-shot performance in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering, where they outperformed the SOTA fine-tuning approaches. In addition, they exhibited lower-than-SOTA but reasonable performance in generation-related tasks such as text summarization and simplification, showing competitive accuracy and readability, as well as showing potential in semantic understanding tasks such as document-level classification. Among the LLMs, GPT-4 showed the overall highest performance, especially due to its remarkable reasoning capability. However, it comes with a trade-off, being 60 to 100 times more expensive than GPT-3.5. In contrast, open-sourced LLMs such as LLaMA 2 did not demonstrate robust zero- and few-shot performance – they still require fine-tuning to bridge the performance gap for BioNLP applications.

Second, we conducted a thorough manual validation on collectively over hundreds of thousands of sample outputs from the LLMs. For extraction and classification tasks where the gold standard is fixed (e.g., relation extraction and multi-label document classification), we examined (1) missing output, when LLMs fail to provide the requested output, (2) inconsistent output, when LLMs produce different outputs for similar instances, and (3) hallucinated output, when LLMs fail to address the user input and may contain repetitions and misinformation in the output36. For text summarization tasks, two healthcare professionals performed manual evaluations assessing Accuracy, Completeness, and Readability. The results revealed prevalent cases of missing, inconsistent, and hallucinated outputs, especially for LLaMA 2 under the zero-shot setting. For instance, it had over 102 hallucinated cases (32% of the total testing instances) and 69 inconsistent cases (22%) for a multi-label document classification dataset.

Finally, we provided recommendations for downstream users on the best practice to use LLMs in BioNLP applications. We also noted two open problems. First, the current data and evaluation paradigms in BioNLP are tailored to supervised methods and may not be fair to LLMs. For instance, the results showed that automatic metrics for text summarization may not align with manual evaluations. Also, the datasets that specifically target tasks where LLMs excel, such as reasoning, are limited in the biomedical domain. Revisiting data and evaluation paradigms in BioNLP are key to maximizing the benefits of LLMs in BioNLP applications. Second, addressing errors, missing information, and inconsistencies is crucial to minimize the risks associated with LLMs in biomedical and clinical applications. We strongly encourage a community effort to find better solutions to mitigate these issues.

We believe that the findings of this study will be beneficial for BioNLP downstream users and will also contribute to further enhancing the performance of LLMs in BioNLP applications. The established benchmarks and baseline performance could serve as the basis for evaluating new LLMs in the biomedical domain. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate benchmarking, we have made the relevant data, models, and results publicly accessible through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1402550037.

Table 2 illustrates the primary evaluation metric results and their macro-averages of the LLMs under zero/few-shot (static one- and five-shot) and fine-tuning settings over the 12 datasets. The results on specific datasets were consistent with those independently reported by other studies, such as an accuracy of 0.4462 and 0.7471 on MedQA for GPT-3.5 zero-shot and GPT-4 zero-shot, respectively (0.4988 and 0.7156 in our study, respectively)38. Similarly, a micro-F1 of 0.6224 and 0.6720 on HoC and LitCovid for GPT-3.5 zero-shot was reported, respectively (0.6605 and 0.6707 in our study, respectively)39. An accuracy of 0.7790 on PubMedQA was also reported for the fine-tuned PMC LLaMA 13B (combined multiple question answering datasets for fine-tuning)34; our study also reported a similar accuracy of 0.7680 using the PubMedQA training set only. We further summarized detailed results in Supplementary Information S2 Quantitative evaluation results, including secondary metric results in S2.2, performance mean, variance, and confidence intervals in S2.3, statistical test results in S2.4, and dynamic K-nearest few-shot results in S2.5.

SOTA vs. LLMs. The results of SOTA fine-tuning approaches for comparison are provided in Table 2. Recall that the SOTA approaches utilized fine-tuned (domain-specific) language models. For the extractive and classification tasks, the SOTA approaches fine-tuned biomedical domain-specific BERT models such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. For text summarization and simplification tasks, the SOTA approaches fine-tuned BART models.

As demonstrated in Table 2, the SOTA fine-tuning approaches had a macro-average of 0.6536 across the 12 datasets, whereas the best LLM counterparts were 0.4561, 0.4750, 0.4862, and 0.5131 under zero-shot, one-shot, five-shot, and fine-tuning settings, respectively. It outperformed the zero- and few-shot of LLMs in 10 out of the 12 datasets. It had much higher performance especially in information extraction tasks. For instance, for NCBI Disease, the SOTA approach achieved an entity-level F1-score of 0.9090, whereas the best results of LLMs (GPT-4) under zero- and one-shot settings were 30% lower (0.5988). The performance of LLMs is closer under the fine-tuning setting, with LLaMA 2 13B achieving an entity-level F1-score of 0.8682, but it is still lower. Notably, the SOTA fine-tuning approaches are very strong baselines – they were much more sophisticated than simple fine-tuning over a foundation model. Continuing with the example of NCBI Disease, the SOTA fine-tuning approach generated large-scale weak labeled examples and used contrastive learning to learn a general representation.

In contrast, the LLMs outperformed the SOTA fine-tuning approaches in question answering. For MedQA, the SOTA approach had an accuracy of 0.4195. GPT-4 under the zero-shot setting had almost 30% higher accuracy in absolute difference (0.7156), and GPT-3.5 also had approximately 8% higher accuracy (0.4988) under the zero-shot setting. For PubMedQA, the SOTA approach had an accuracy of 0.7340. GPT-4 under the one-shot setting had a similar accuracy (0.7100) and showed higher accuracy with more shots (0.7580 under the five-shot setting), as we will show later. Both LLaMA 2 13B and PMC LLaMA 13B also had higher accuracy under the fine-tuning setting (0.8040 and 0.7680, respectively). In this case, GPT-3.5 did not achieve higher accuracy over the SOTA approach, but it already had a competitive accuracy (0.6950) under the five-shot setting.

Comparisons among the LLMs. Comparing among the LLMs, under zero/few-shot settings, the results demonstrate that GPT-4 consistently had the highest performance. Under the zero-shot setting, the macro-average of GPT-4 was 0.4561, which is approximately 7% higher than GPT-3.5 (0.3814) and almost double than LLaMA 2 13B (0.2362). It achieved the highest performance in nine out of the 12 datasets, and its performance was also within 3% of the best result for the remaining three datasets. The one-shot and five-shot settings showed very similar patterns.

In addition, LLaMA2 13B exhibited substantially lower performance than GPT-3.5 (15% lower and 10% lower) and GPT-4 (22% lower and 17% lower) under zero- and one-shot settings. It had up to six times lower performance in specific datasets compared to the best LLM results; for example, 0.1286 vs. 0.7109 for HoC under the zero-shot setting. These results suggest that LLaMA2 13B still requires fine-tuning to achieve similar performance and bridge the performance gap. Fine-tuning improved LLaMA 2 13B's macro-average from 0.2837 to 0.5131. Notably, its performance under the fine-tuning setting is slightly higher than the zero- and few-shot performance of GPT-4. Fine-tuning LLaMA 2 13B generally improved its performance in all tasks except text summarization and text simplification. A key reason for its performance limitation is that the datasets have much longer input context than its allowed input tokens (4096) such that fine-tuning did not help in this case. This observation also motivates further research efforts on extending LLMs' context window40,41.

Under the fine-tuning setting, the results also indicate that PMC LLaMA 13B, as a continuously pretrained biomedical domain-specific LLM, did not achieve an overall higher performance than LLaMA 2 13B. Fine-tuned LLaMA 2 13B had better performance than that of PMC LLaMA 13B in 10 out of the 12 datasets. As mentioned, we reproduced similar results reported in PMC LLaMA study34. For instance, it reported an accuracy of 0.7790 on PubMedQA with fine-tuning multiple question answering datasets together. We got a very similar accuracy of 0.7680 when fine-tuning PMC LLaMA 13B on the PubMedQA dataset only. However, we also found that directly fine-tuning of LLaMA 2 13B using the exact same setting resulted in better or at least similar performance.

Figure 1 further illustrates the performance of the dynamic K-nearest few-shot and the associated cost with the increasing number of shots. The detailed results are also provided in Supplementary Information S2. Dynamic K-nearest few-shot was conducted for K values of one, two, and five. For comparison, we also provided the zero-shot and static one-shot performance in the figure. The results suggest that dynamic K-nearest few-shot is most effective for multi-label document classification and question answering. For instance, for the LitCovid dataset, GPT-4 had a macro-F1 of 0.5901 under the static one-shot setting; in contrast, its macro-F1 under dynamic one-nearest shot was 0.6500 and further increased to 0.7055 with five-nearest shots. Similarly, GPT-3.5 exhibited improvements, with its macro-F1 under the static one-shot setting at 0.6009, compared to 0.6364 and 0.6484 for dynamic one-shot and five-shot, respectively. For question answering, the improvement was not as high as for multi-label document classification, but the overall trend showed a steady increase, especially considering that GPT-4 already had similar or higher performance than SOTA approaches with zero-shot. For instance, its accuracy on PubMedQA was 0.71 with a static one-shot; the accuracy increased to 0.72 and 0.75 under dynamic one-shot and five-shot, respectively.

The input and output types for each benchmark are displayed at the bottom of each subplot. Detailed methods for the few-shot and cost analysis are summarized in the Data and Methods section. Dynamic K-nearest few-shot involves selecting the K closest training instances as examples for each testing instance. Additionally, the performance of static one-shot (using the same one-shot example for each testing instance) is shown as a dashed horizontal line for comparison. Detailed performance in digits is also provided in Supplementary Information S2.

In contrast, the results show that dynamic K-nearest few-shot was less effective for other tasks. For instance, the dynamic one-shot performance is lower than the static one-shot performance for both GPT models on the two named entity recognition datasets, and by increasing the number of dynamic shots does not help either. Similar findings are also observed in relation extraction. For text summarization and text simplification tasks, the dynamic K-nearest few-shot performance was slightly higher in two datasets, but in general, it was very similar to the static one-shot performance. In addition, the results also suggest that increasing the number of shots does not necessarily improve the performance. For instance, GPT-4 with dynamic five-shot did not have the highest performance in eight out of the 12 datasets. Similar findings were reported in other studies, where the performance of GPT-3.5 with five-shot learning was lower than that of zero-shot learning for natural language inference tasks39.

Figure 1 further compares the costs per 100 instances of using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The cost is calculated based on the number of input and output tokens with unit price. We used gpt-4-0613 for extractive tasks and gpt-4-32k-0613 for generative tasks because the input and output context are much longer especially with more shots. GPT-4 generally exhibited the highest performance, as shown in both Table 2 and Fig. 1; however, the cost analysis results also demonstrate a clear trade-off, with GPT-4 being 60 to 100 times more expensive. For extractive and classification tasks, the actual cost per 100 instances of GPT-4 for five-shots ranges from approximately $2 for sentence-level inputs to around $10 for abstract-level inputs. This cost is 60 to 70 times higher than that of GPT-3.5, which costs approximately $0.03 for sentence-level inputs and around $0.16 for abstract-level inputs with five-shots. For generative tasks, the cost difference is even more pronounced, scaling to 100 times or more expensive. One reason is that GPT-4 32 K has a higher unit price, and tasks like text summarization involve much longer input and output tokens. Taking the PubMed Text Summarization dataset as an example, GPT-4 cost $84.02 per 100 instances with five-shots, amounting to approximately $5600 to inference the entire testing set. In comparison, GPT-3 only cost $0.71 per 100 instances for five-shots, totaling around $48 for the entire testing set.

Based on both performance and cost results, it indicates that the cost difference does not necessarily scale to the performance difference, except for question answering tasks. GPT-4 exhibited 20% to 30% higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 in question-answering tasks, and higher than the SOTA approaches; for other tasks, the performance difference is much smaller with a significantly higher cost. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 on both text simplification tasks was within 2% of that of GPT-3.5, but the actual cost was more than 100 times higher.

Figure 2A further shows an error analysis on the named entity recognition benchmark NCBI Disease, where the performance of LLMs under zero- and few-shot settings was substantially lower than SOTA results (e.g., the LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot performance is almost 70% lower). Recall that named entity recognition extracts entities from free text, and the benchmarks evaluate the accuracy of these extracted entities. We examined all the predictions on full test sets and categorized into four types: (1) correct entities, where the predicted entities are correct with both text spans and entity types, (2) wrong entities, where the predicted entities are incorrect, (3) missing entities, where the true entities are not predicted, and (4) boundary issues, where the predicted entities are correct but with different text spans than the gold standard, as shown in Fig. 2A. The results reveal that the LLMs can predict up to 512 entities correctly out of 960 in total, explaining the low F1-score. As the SOTA model is not publicly available, we used an alternate fine-tuned BioBERT model on NCBI Disease from an independent study (https://huggingface.co/ugaray96/biobert_ncbi_disease_ner), which had an entity-level F1-score of 0.8920 for comparison. It predicted 863 entities out of 960 correctly. The wrong entities, missing entities, and boundary issues were 111, 97, and 269, respectively.

A Error analysis on the named entity recognition benchmark NCBI Disease. Correct entities: the predicted entities are correct with both text spans and entity types; Wrong entities: the predicted entities are incorrect; Missing entities: true entities are not predicted; and Boundary issues: the predicted entities are correct but with different text spans than the gold standard. B–D Qualitative evaluation on ChemProt, HoC, and MedQA where the gold standard is a fixed classification type or multiple-choice option. Inconsistent responses: the responses are in different formats; Missingness: the responses are missing; and Hallucinations, where LLMs fail to address the prompt and may contain repetitions and misinformation in the output.

In addition, Fig. 2A also shows that GPT-4 had the lowest number of wrong entities, whereas other categories have a similar prevalence to GPT-3.5, which explains its higher F1-score overall. Furthermore, providing one shot did not alter the errors for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 compared to their zero-shot settings, but it dramatically changed the results for LLaMA 2 13B. Under one-shot, LLaMA 2 13B had 449 correctly predicted entities, compared to 148 under zero-shot. Additionally, its missing entities also reduced from 812 to 511 with one-shot, but it also had a trade-off of more boundary issues and wrong entities.

Figure 2B–D present the qualitative evaluation results on ChemProt, HoC, and MedQA, respectively. Recall that we categorized inconsistencies, missing information, and hallucinations on the tasks where the gold standard is a fixed classification type or a multiple-choice option. Table 3 also provides detailed examples. The findings show prevalent inconsistent, missing, or hallucinated responses, particularly in LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot responses. For instance, it exhibited 506 hallucinated responses (~3% out of the total 16,943 instances) and 2376 inconsistent responses (14%) for ChemProt. In the case of HoC, there were 102 (32%) hallucinated responses and 69 (22%) inconsistent responses. Similarly, for MedQA, there were 402 (32%) inconsistent responses. In comparison, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exhibited substantially fewer cases. GPT-3.5 showed a small number of inconsistent responses for ChemProt and HoC, and a few missing responses for MedQA. On the other hand, GPT-4 did not exhibit any such cases for ChemProt and HoC, while displaying a few missing responses for MedQA.

It is worth noting that inconsistent responses do not necessarily imply that they fail to address the prompts; rather, the responses answer the prompt but in different formats. In contrast, hallucinated cases do not address the prompts and may repeat the prompts or contain irrelevant information. All such instances pose challenges for automatic extraction or postprocessing and may require manual review. As a potential solution, we observed that adding just one shot could significantly reduce such cases, especially for LLaMA 2 13B, which exhibited prevalent instances in zero-shot. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, LLaMA 2 13B one-shot dramatically reduced these cases in ChemProt and MedQA. Similarly, its hallucinated responses decreased from 102 to 0, and inconsistent cases decreased from 69 to 23 in HoC with one-shot. Another solution is fine-tuning, which we did not find any such cases during the manual examination, albeit with a trade-off of computational resources.

Figure 3 presents the qualitative evaluation results on the PubMed Text Summarization dataset. In Fig. 3A, the overall results in accuracy, completeness, and readability for the four models on 50 random samples are depicted. The evaluation results in digits are further demonstrated in Table 4 for complementary. Detailed results with statistical analysis and examples are available in Supplementary Information S3. The fine-tuned BART model used in the SOTA approach42, serving as the baseline, achieved an accuracy of 4.76 (out of 5), a completeness of 4.02, and a readability of 4.05. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated similar and slightly higher accuracy (4.79 and 4.83, respectively) and statistically significantly higher readability than the fine-tuned BART model (4.66 and 4.73), but statistically significantly lower completeness (3.61 and 3.57) under the zero-shot setting. The LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot performance is substantially lower in all three aspects.

A The overall results of the fine-tuned BART, GPT-3.5 zero-shot, GPT-4 zero-shot, and LLaMA 2 zero-shot models on a scale of 1 to 5, based on random 50 testing instances from the PubMed Text Summarization dataset. B and C display the number of winning, tying, and losing cases when comparing GPT-4 zero-shot to GPT-3.5 zero-shot and GPT-4 zero-shot to the fine-tuned BART model, respectively. Table 4 shows the results in digits for complementary. Detailed results, including statistical tests and examples, are provided in Supplementary Information S3.

Figure 3B further compares GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 and the fine-tuned BART model in detail. In the comparison between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, GPT-4 had a slightly higher number of winning cases in the three aspects (4 winning cases vs. 1 losing case for accuracy, 17 vs. 13 for completeness, and 13 vs. 6 for readability). Most of the cases resulted in a tie. When comparing GPT-4 to the fine-tuned BART model, GPT-4 had significantly more winning cases for readability (34 vs. 1) with much fewer winning cases for completeness (9 vs. 22).

First, the SOTA fine-tuning approaches outperformed zero- and few-shot performance of LLMs in most of BioNLP applications. As demonstrated in Table 2, it had the best performance in 10 out of the 12 benchmarks. In particular, it outperformed zero- and few-shot LLMs by a large margin in information extraction and classification tasks such as named entity recognition and relation extraction, which is consistent to the existing studies43,44. In contrast to, other tasks such as medical question answering, named entity recognition, and relation extraction require limited reasoning and extract information directly from inputs at the sentence-level. Zero- and few-shot learning may not be appropriate or sufficient for these conditions. For those tasks, arguably, fine-tuned biomedical domain-specific language models are still the first choice and have already set a high bar, according to the literature32.

In addition, closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrated reasonable zero- and few-shot capabilities for three BioNLP tasks. The most promising task that outperformed the SOTA fine-tuning approaches is medical question answering, which involves reasoning45. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1, GPT-4 already outperformed previous fine-tuned SOTA approaches in MedQA and PubMedQA with zero- or few-shot learning. This is also supported by the existing studies on medical question answering38,46. The second potential use case is text summarization and simplification. As shown in Table 2, those tasks are still less favored by the automatic evaluation measures; however, manual evaluation results show both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had higher readability and competitive accuracy compared to the SOTA fine-tuning approaches. Other studies reported similar findings regarding the low correlation between automatic and manual evaluations35,47. The third possible use case – though still underperformed by previous fine-tuned SOTA approaches – document-level classification, which involves semantic understanding. As shown in Fig. 1, GPT-4 achieved over a 0.7 F1-score with dynamic K-nearest shot for both multi-label document-level classification benchmarks.

In addition to closed-source LLMs, open-source LLMs such as LLaMA 2 do not demonstrate strong zero- and few-shot capabilities. While there are other open-source LLMs available, LLaMA 2 remains as a strong representative48. Results in Table 1 suggest that its overall zero-shot performance is 15% and 22% lower than that of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively, and up to 60% lower in specific BioNLP tasks. Not only does it exhibit suboptimal performance, but the results in Fig. 2 also demonstrate that its zero-shot responses frequently contain inconsistencies, missing elements, and hallucinations, accounting for up to 30% of the full testing set instances. Therefore, fine-tuning open-source LLMs for BioNLP tasks is still necessary to bridge the gap. Only through fine-tuning LLaMA 2, its overall performance is slightly higher than the one-shot GPT-4 (4%). However, it is worth noting that the model sizes of LLaMA 2 and PMC LLaMA are significantly smaller than those of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, making it challenging to evaluate them on the same level. Additionally, open-source LLMs have the advantage of continued development and local deployment.

Another primary finding on open-source LLMs is that the results do not indicate significant performance improvement from continuously biomedical pre-trained LLMs (PMC LLaMA 13B vs. LLaMA 2 13B). As mentioned, our study reproduced similar results reported in PMC LLaMA 13B; however, we also found that directly fine-tuning LLaMA 2 yielded better or at least similar performance—and this is consistent across all 12 benchmarks. In the biomedical domain, representative foundation LLMs such as PMC LLaMA used 32 A100 GPUs34, and Meditron used 128 A100 GPUs to continuously pretrain from LLaMA or LLaMA 249. Our evaluation did not find significant performance improvement for PMC LLaMA; the Meditron study also only reported ~3% improvement itself and only evaluated on question answering datasets. At a minimum, the results suggest the need for a more effective and sustainable approach to developing biomedical domain-specific LLMs.

The automatic metrics for text summarization and simplification tasks may not align with manual evaluations. As the quantitative results on text summarization and generation demonstrated, commonly used automatic evaluations such as Rouge, BERT, and BART scores consistently favored the fine-tuned BART's generated text, while manual evaluations show different results, indicating that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had competitive accuracy and much higher readability even under the zero-shot setting. Existing studies also reported that the automatic measures on LLM-generated text may not correlate to human preference35,47. The MS^2 benchmark used in the study also discussed the limitation of automatic measures, specifically for text summarization50. Additionally, the results highlight that completeness is a primary limitation when adapting GPT models to biomedical text generation tasks despite its competitive accuracy and readability scores.

Last, our evaluation on both performance and cost demonstrates a clear trade-off when using LLMs in practice. GPT-4 had the overall best performance in the 12 benchmarks, with an 8% improvement over GPT-3.5 but also at a higher cost (60 to 100 times higher than GPT-3.5). Notably, GPT-4 showed significantly higher performance, particularly in question-answering tasks that involve reasoning, such as over 20% improvement in MedQA compared to GPT-3.5. This observation is consistent with findings from other studies27,38. Note that newer versions of GPT-4, such as GPT-4 Turbo, may further reduce the cost of using GPT-4.

These findings lead to recommendations for downstream users to apply LLMs in BioNLP applications, summarized in Fig. 4. It provides suggestions on which BioNLP applications are recommended (or not) for LLMs, categorized by conditions (e.g., the zero/few-shot setting when computational resources are limited) and additional tips (e.g., when advanced prompt engineering is more effective).

It presents specific task-based recommendations across different settings and offers general guidance on effectively applying LLMs in BioNLP.

We also recognize the following two open problems and encourage a community effort for better usage of LLMs in BioNLP applications.

Adapting both data and evaluation paradigms is essential to maximize the benefits of LLMs in BioNLP applications. Arguably, the current datasets and evaluation settings in BioNLP are tailored to supervised (fine-tuning) methods and is not fair for LLMs. Those issues challenge the direct comparison between the fine-tuned biomedical domain-specific language models and zero/few shot of LLMs. The datasets for the tasks where LLMs excel are also limited in the biomedical domain. Further, the manual measures on biomedical text summarization also showed different results than that of all three automatic measures. These collectively suggest the current BioNLP evaluation frameworks have limitations when they are applied to LLMs35,51. They may not be able to accurately assess the full benefits of LLMs in biomedical applications, calling for the development of new evaluation datasets and methods for LLMs in bioNLP tasks.

Addressing inconsistencies, missingness, and hallucinations produced by LLMs is critical. The prevalence of inconsistencies, missingness, and hallucinations generated by LLMs is of concern, and we argue that they must be addressed for deployment. Our results demonstrate that providing just one shot could significantly reduce the occurrence of such issues, offering a simple solution. However, thorough examination in real-world scenario validations is still necessary. Additionally, more advanced approaches for validating LLMs' responses are expected for further improvement of their reliability and usability47.

This study also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. While this study examined strong LLM representatives from each category (closed-source, open-source, and biomedical domain-specific), it is important to note that there are other LLMs, such as BARD52 and Mistral53, that have demonstrated strong performance in the literature. Additionally, while we investigated zero-shot, one-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning techniques, each of them has variations, and there are also new approaches54. Given the rapidly growing nature of this area, our study cannot cover all of them. Instead, our aim is to establish baseline performance on the main BioNLP applications using commonly used LLMs and methods as representatives, and to make the datasets, methods, codes, and results publicly available. This enables downstream users to understand when and how to apply LLMs in their own use cases and to compare new LLMs and associated methods on the same benchmarks. In the future, we also plan to assess LLMs in real-world scenarios in the biomedical domain to further broaden the scope of the study.

Table 5 presents a summary of the evaluation tasks, datasets, and metrics. We benchmarked the models on the full testing sets of the twelve datasets from six BioNLP applications, which are BC5CDR-chemical and NCBI-disease for Named Entity Recognition, ChemProt and DDI2013 for relation extraction, HoC and LitCovid for multi-label document classification, and MedQA and PubMedQA for question answering, PubMed Text Summarization and MS^2 for text summarization, and Cochrane PLS and PLOS Text Simplification for text simplification. These datasets have been widely used in benchmarking biomedical text mining challenges55,56,57 and evaluating biomedical language models9,10,11,16. The datasets are also available in the repository. We evaluated the datasets using the official evaluation metrics provided by the original dataset description papers, as well as commonly used metrics for method development or applications with the datasets, as documented in Table 5. Note that it is challenging to have a single one-size-fits-all metric, and some datasets and related studies used multiple evaluation metrics. Therefore, we also adopted secondary metrics for additional evaluations. A detailed description is below.

Named entity recognition. Named entity recognition is a task that involves identifying entities of interest from free text. The biomedical entities can be described in various ways, and resolving the ambiguities is crucial58. Named entity recognition is typically a sequence labeling task, where each token is classified into a specific entity type. BC5CDR-chemical59 and NCBI-disease60 are manually annotated named entity recognition datasets for chemicals and diseases mentioned in biomedical literature, respectively. The exact match (that is, the predicted tokens must have the same text spans as the gold standard) F1-score was used to quantify the model performance.

Relation extraction. Relation extraction involves identifying the relationships between entities, which is important for drug repurposing and knowledge discovery61. Relation extraction is typically a multi-class classification problem, where a sentence or passage is given with identified entities and the goal is to classify the relation type between them. ChemProt55 and DDI201362 are manually curated relation extraction datasets for protein-protein interactions and drug-drug interactions from biomedical literature, respectively. Macro and micro F1-scores were used to quantify the model performance.

Multi-label document classification. Multi-label document classification identifies semantic categories at the document-level. The semantic categories are effective for grasping the main topics and searching for relevant literature in the biomedical domain63. Unlike multi-class classification, which assigns only one label to an instance, multi-label classification can assign up to N labels to an instance. HoC64 and LitCovid56 are manually annotated multi-label document classification datasets for hallmarks of cancer (10 labels) and COVID-19 topics (7 labels), respectively. Macro and Micro F1 scores were used as the primary and secondary evaluation metrics, respectively.

Question answering. Question answering evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of a system in answering a given biomedical question with or without associated contexts45. Biomedical QA datasets such as MedQA and PubMedQA have been widely used in the evaluation of language models65. The MedQA dataset is collected from questions in the United States Medical License Examination (USMLE), where each instance contains a question (usually a patient description) and five answer choices (e.g., five potential diagnoses)66. The PubMedQA dataset includes biomedical research questions from PubMed, and the task is to use yes, no, or maybe to answer these questions with the corresponding abstracts67. Accuracy and macro F1-score are used as the primary and secondary evaluation metrics, respectively.

Text summarization. Text summarization produces a concise and coherent summary of a longer documents or multiple documents while preserving its essential content. We used two primary biomedical text summarization datasets: the PubMed text summarization benchmark68 and MS^250. The PubMed text summarization benchmark focuses on single document summarization where the input is a full PubMed article, and the gold standard output is its abstract. M2^2 in contrast, focuses on multi-document summarization where the input is a collection of PubMed articles, and the gold standard output is the abstract of a systematic review study that cites those articles. Both benchmarks used the ROUGE-L score as the primary evaluation metric; BERT score and BART score were used as secondary evaluation metrics.

Text simplification. Text simplification rephrases complex texts into simpler language while maintaining the original meaning, making the information more accessible to a broader audience. We used two primary biomedical text simplification datasets: Cochrane PLS69 and the PLOS text simplification benchmark70. Cochrane PLS consists of the medical documents from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the corresponding plain-language summary (PLS) written by the authors. The PLOS text simplification benchmark consists of articles from PLOS journals and the corresponding technical summary and PLS written by the authors. The ROUGE-L score was used as the primary evaluation metric. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Dale-Chall Readability Score (DCRS), two commonly used evaluation metrics on readability71 were used as the secondary evaluation metrics.

For each dataset, we reported the reported SOTA fine-tuning result before the rise of LLMs as the baseline. The SOTA approaches involved fine-tuning (domain-specific) language models such as PubMedBERT16, BioBERT9, or BART72 as the backbone. The fine-tuning still requires scalable manually labeled instances, which is challenging in the biomedical domain32. In contrast, LLMs may have the advantage when minimal manually labeled instances are available, and they do not require fine-tuning or retraining for every new task through zero/few-shot learning. Therefore, we used the existing SOTA results achieved by the fine-tuning approaches to quantify the benefits and challenges of LLMs in BioNLP applications.

Representative LLMs and their versions. Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have been regularly updated. For reproducibility, we used the snapshots gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 and gpt-4-0613 for extractive tasks, and gpt-4-32k-0613 for generative tasks, considering their input and output token sizes. Regarding LLaMA 2, it is available in 7B, 13B, and 70B versions. We evaluated LLaMA 2 13B based on the computational resources required for fine-tuning, which is arguably the most common scenario applicable to BioNLP downstream applications. For PMC LLaMA, both 7B and 13B versions are available. Similarly, we used PMC LLaMA 13B, specifically evaluating it under the fine-tuning setting – the same setting used in its original study34. In the original study, PMC LLaMA was only evaluated on medical question answering tasks, combining multiple question answering datasets for fine-tuning. In our case, we fine-tuned each dataset separately and reported the results individually.

Prompts. To date, prompt design remains an open research problem73,74,75. We developed a prompt template that can be used across different tasks based on existing literature74,75,76,77. An annotated prompt example is provided in Supplementary Information S1 Prompt engineering, and we have made all the prompts publicly available in the repository. The prompt template contains (1) task descriptions (e.g., classifying relations), (2) input specifications (e.g., a sentence with labeled entities), (3) output specifications (e.g., the relation type), (4) task guidance (e.g., detailed descriptions or documentations on relation types), and (5) example demonstrations if examples from training sets are provided. This approach aligns with previous studies in the biomedical domain, which have demonstrated that incorporating task guidance into the prompt leads to improved performance74,76 and was also employed and evaluated in our previous study, specifically focusing on named entity recognition77. We also adapted the SOTA example selection approach in the biomedical domain described below27.

Zero-shot and static few-shot. We comparatively evaluated the zero-shot, one-shot, and five-shot learning performances. Only a few studies have made the selected examples available. For reproducibility and benchmarking, we first randomly selected the required number of examples in training sets, used the same selected examples for few-shot learning, and made the selected examples publicly available.

Dynamic K-nearest few-shot. In addition to zero- or static few-shot learning where fixed instructions are used for each instance, we further evaluated the LLMs under a dynamic few-shot learning setting. The dynamic few-shot learning is based on the MedPrompt approach, the SOTA method that demonstrated robust performance in medical question answering tasks without fine-tuning27. The essence is to use K training instances that are most similar to the test instance as the selected examples. We denote this setting as dynamic K-nearest few-shot, as the prompts for different test instances differ. Specifically, for each dataset, we used the SOTA text embedding model text-embedding-ada-00254 to encode the instances and used cosine similarity as the metric for finding similar training instances to a testing instance. We tested dynamic K-nearest few-shot prompts with K equals to one, two, and five.

Parameters for prompt engineering. For zero-, one-, and few-shot approaches, we used a temperature parameter of 0 to minimize variance for both GPT and LLaMA-based models. Additionally, for LLaMA models, we maintained other parameters unchanged, set the maximum number of generated tokens per task, and truncated the instances due to the input length limit for the five-shot setting. Further details are provided in Supplementary Information S1 Prompt engineering, and the related codes are available in the repository.

Fine-tuning. We further conducted instruction fine-tuning on LLaMA 2 13B and PMC-LLaMA 13B. For each dataset, we fine-tuned LLaMA 2 13B and PMC- LLaMA 13B using its training set. The goal of instruction fine-tuning is defined by the objective function: \({\arg }{\max }_{\theta }{\sum}_{\left({x}^{i},{y}^{i}\right)\epsilon (X,Y)}{logp}({y}^{i}|{x}^{i};\theta )\), where \({x}^{i}\) represents the input instruction, \({y}^{i}\) is the ground truth response, and \(\theta\) is the parameter set of the model. This function aims to maximize the likelihood of accurately predicting responses based on the given instructions. The fine-tuning is performed on eight H100 80G GPUs, over three epochs with a learning rate of 1e−5, a weight decay of 1e−5, a warmup ratio of 0.01, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-effective tuning78.

Output parsing. For extractive and classification tasks, we extracted the targeted predictions (e.g., classification types or multiple-choice options) from the raw outputs of LLMs with a combination of manual and automatic processing. We manually reviewed the processed outputs. Manual review showed that LLMs provided answers in inconsistent formats in some cases. For example, when presenting multiple-choice option C, the raw output examples included variations such as: “Based on the information provided, the most likely … is C. The thyroid gland is a common site for metastasis, and …”, “Great! Let's go through the options. A. … B. …Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C.”, and “I'm happy to help! Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, … Therefore, option A is incorrect. …, so option D is incorrect. The correct answer is option C.” (adapted from real responses with unnecessary details omitted). In such cases, automatic processing might overlook the answer, potentially lowering LLM accuracy. Thus, we manually extracted outputs in these instances to ensure fair credit. Additionally, we qualitatively evaluated the prevalence of such cases (providing responses in inconsistent formats), which will be introduced below.

Quantitative evaluations. We summarized the evaluation metrics in Table 5 under zero-shot, static few-shot, dynamic K-nearest few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. The metrics are applicable to the entire testing sets of 12 datasets. We further conducted bootstrapping using a subsample size of 30 and repeated 100 times at a 95% confidence interval to report performance variance and performed a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test using SciPy79. Further details are provided in Supplementary Information S2 Quantitative evaluation results (S2.1. Result reporting).

Qualitative evaluations on inconsistency, missing information, and hallucinations. For the tasks where the gold standard is fixed, e.g., a classification type or multiple-choice option, we conducted qualitative evaluations on collectively hundreds of thousands of raw outputs of the LLMs (the raw outputs from three LLMs under zero- and one-shot conditions across three benchmarks) to categorize errors beyond inaccurate predictions. Specifically, we examined (1) inconsistent responses, where the responses are in different formats, (2) missingness, where the responses are missing, and (3) hallucinations, where LLMs fail to address the prompt and may contain repetitions and misinformation in the output36. We evaluated and reported the results in selected datasets: ChemProt, HoC, and MedQA.

Qualitative evaluations on accuracy, completeness, and readability. For the tasks with free-text gold standards, such as summaries, we conducted qualitative evaluations on the quality of generated text. Specifically, one senior resident and one junior resident evaluated four models: the fine-tuned BART model reported in the SOTA approach, GPT-3.5 zero-shot, GPT-4 zero-shot, and LLaMA 2 13B zero-shot on 50 random samples from the PubMed Text Summarization benchmark. Each annotator was provided with 600 annotations. To mitigate potential bias, the model outputs were all lowercased, their orders were randomly shuffled, and the annotators were unaware of the models being evaluated. They assessed three dimensions on a scale of 1—5: (1) accuracy, does the generated text contain correct information from the original input, (2) completeness, does the generated text capture the key information from the original input, and (3) readability, is the generated text easy to read. The detailed evaluation guideline is provided in Supplementary Information S3 Qualitative evaluation on the PubMed Text Summarization Benchmark.

We further conducted a cost analysis to quantify the trade-off between cost and accuracy when using GPT models. The cost of GPT models is determined by the number of input and output tokens. We tracked the tokens in the input prompts and output completions using the official model tokenizers provided by OpenAI (https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) and used the pricing table (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) to compute the overall cost.

Metrics details

The UniProt database is a valuable resource for biocatalyst discovery, yet predicting enzymatic functions remains challenging, especially for low-similarity sequences. Identifying superior enzymes with enhanced catalytic properties is even harder. To overcome these challenges, we develop ESM-Ezy, an enzyme mining strategy leveraging the ESM-1b protein language model and similarity calculations in semantic space. Using ESM-Ezy, we identify novel multicopper oxidases (MCOs) with superior catalytic properties, achieving a 44% success rate in outperforming query enzymes (QEs) in at least one property, including catalytic efficiency, heat and organic solvent tolerance, and pH stability. Notably, 51% of the MCOs excel in environmental remediation applications, and some exhibited unique structural motifs and unique active centers enhancing their functions. Beyond MCOs, 40% of L-asparaginases identified show higher specific activity and catalytic efficiency than QEs. ESM-Ezy thus provides a promising approach for discovering high-performance biocatalysts with low sequence similarity, accelerating enzyme discovery for industrial applications.

Enzymes are increasingly playing pivotal roles across diverse industries, including food, agriculture, chemical, and pharmaceutical sectors. Despite the successful use of various enzymes, their catalytic properties often do not meet the stringent demands of diverse industrial applications. Directed evolution has been effectively employed to enhance enzymatic catalytic properties. However, the lack of high-throughput screening methods makes the process labor-intensive and costly in many cases. Thanks to advances in next-generation sequencing, the UniProtKB now encompasses over 227 million protein sequences, including more than 214 million entries complemented by AlphaFold-predicted structures1. Therefore, discovering advanced enzymes from UniProtKB could offer advanced biocatalysts ready for direct applications or serve as prime candidates for subsequent directed evolution, potentially streamlining the follow-up extensive engineering processes.

Strategies for enzyme mining based solely on protein sequence information often led to inaccuracies in function annotations despite extensive sequence data collections from a wide array of organisms. Traditional bioinformatic tools excel at identifying protein domains and assigning gene ontology terms but face challenges in accurately predicting functions for enzymes with low sequence similarity to the characterized ones2,3. Consequently, these enzymes remain underexplored, highlighting the need for a convenient strategy to accurately identify enzymes with low sequence similarities and investigate the likelihood of discovering novel enzymes with enhanced properties from this pool.

Deep learning presents a promising avenue for establishing connections between protein sequences and their functions, particularly for proteins exhibiting low sequence similarities to the previously characterized entities. By leveraging the structural similarities between protein sequences and natural language, the development of protein language models (PLMs) has emerged as a powerful approach to addressing the challenges in predicting protein structure and function4,5,6. One such model, evolutionary scale modeling (ESM-1b), is designed to learn an embedding space from extensive protein sequence databases, enabling the Euclidean distance within this space to reflect functional similarities7,8. These embeddings, numerical vectors derived from diverse amino acid sequences by PLMs, encapsulate critical protein properties9,10. Recently, ESMs have been successfully utilized in protein engineering11,12,13, enzyme function classification14, and remote homology prediction4. However, strategies for discovering enzymes with improved catalytic properties compared to existing ones are rarely developed15,16. Since low sequence similarity can indicate structural and functional novelty, potentially leading to breakthroughs in properties, we aimed to develop a sequence-based, highly accurate sequence-based in silico tool for discovering enzymes with enhanced catalytic properties from collections with low sequence similarity.

Multicopper oxidases (MCOs) are key biocatalysts widely used in food and chemical industries. In this study, we developed ESM-Ezy, a deep learning strategy assisted by ESM-1b, to explore novel MCOs with low sequence similarity for improved catalytic properties at a high success rate. By fine-tuning ESM-1b with a small but high-quality dataset and selecting candidates based on shorter Euclidean distances to the query enzymes (QEs), we successfully identified new MCOs with low sequence similarity, mostly below 35%, exhibiting superior catalytic properties. Almost 89% of the tested MCOs catalyzed 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) oxidation successfully, with 44% of them showing enhancements in at least one catalytic property compared to the QEs, including higher catalytic efficiency, improved heat and organic solvents tolerance, and a broader pH range. We identified Sulfur as one of the most heat-resistant MCOs reported so far17,18, with a remarkable half-life of 156.9 min at 80 °C, and characterized Bfre with a unique Cu-Mn heteroatom center for the first time. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of newly discovered MCOs in mediator-free bioremediation applications. 53% of the MCOs decolorized Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) more efficiently than the QEs17. Talbi degraded Chloramphenicol (CAP) at room temperature and outperformed the previous fungal systems19. Additionally, Bcece demonstrated a capacity to degrade 39.4% of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) after 48 h of incubation, exhibiting superior mediator-free degradation efficacy in comparison to other bacterial MCOs under mild conditions20. In addition to MCOs, 40% of l-Asparaginase enzymes discovered by ESM-Ezy outperformed their QE in terms of specific activity and catalytic efficiency. Overall, ESM-Ezy assisted us in enriching the libraries of MCOs with both improved catalytic activities and structural diversities, facilitating their application in various industrial settings.

In this study, a two-stage strategy named ESM-Ezy was developed, involving fine-tuning and searching, to discover novel MCOs from an extensive sequence database (Fig. 1a). Initially, sequence embeddings were extracted from the transformer layers of ESM-1b, and a binary classification layer was incorporated to distinguish MCOs from other sequences in the database. The fine-tuning stage utilized a high-quality positive dataset of 147 characterized MCOs from literature, along with a large negative dataset of 550,000 non-MCO sequences from Swiss-Prot. This process swiftly reached optimal accuracy and demonstrated significant robustness based on our analysis of five-fold cross-validation (Fig. S1, Tables S4 and  S5). Additionally, dimensionality reduction employing the UMAP algorithm21 effectively displayed distinct clustering of MCOs, confirming the model's efficacy (Fig. 1b).

a In the fine-tuning stage, the ESM-1b model was fine-tuned through binary classification on positive and negative data sets. In the searching phase, the Fine-tuned ESM-1b Backbone was used to generate query embeddings and candidate embeddings, and Euclidean distance in the embedding space was employed to identify the closest sequences for further validation. In the searching stage, the Binary Classification Head was omitted, and the ESM-1b Backbone from the fine-tuning stage was retained as the Fine-tuned ESM-1b Backbone. b After fine-tuning, the MCOs cluster (positive) became distinctly separated from the non-MCOs cluster (negative). c The embeddings of the selected sequences generated by the fine-tuned model clustered closely with the QEs. d The sequence and structure similarity matrix of the MCOs and QEs. The newly discovered enzymes exhibit low sequence similarity but are structurally conserved. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Subsequently, to identify novel MCOs with enhanced catalytic properties in the searching stage, three representative MCOs, specifically Eclac from Escherichia coli K12 (UniProt: P36649)22, HR03 from Bacillus sp. HR03 (UniProt: B9W2C5)23 and DSM13 from Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 (UniProt: Q65MU7)24 were selected as QEs. These QEs, along with all sequences from UniRef50, were embedded into the fine-tuned ESM-1b backbone. Euclidean distances were calculated between the UniRef50 sequences and the QEs, leading to the selection of 18 neighboring sequences with similarity in protein semantic space for further analysis (Tables S2 and S3). It is important to note that the primary goal of the fine-tuned classification task in the first step is to learn a representation space for sequences, rather than merely predicting whether a sequence is positive or negative. Given that the UniRef50 database is extremely large, even applying stringent criteria to filter positive candidates yields thousands of sequences, which is impractical for wet lab experiments. To address this issue, we employed QEs to identify the nearest sequences within the fine-tuned representation space for wet lab experimentation. After fine-tuning, the selected candidates are much more closely positioned around the QEs compared to those in the pretrained and random ESM-1b model, which indicates the necessity of the fine-tuning step (Fig. 1c, Fig. S2).

The majority of the selected MCOs showed low sequence similarities both to the QEs and among themselves, ranging from 25% to 35% (Fig. 1d). Despite low sequence similarities, high structure similarity (TM-score > 0.8) was observed (Fig. 1d). Enzymes with low sequence similarity but conserved structures are often considered to possess evolutionary novelty, and the selected enzymes and their mutants in this study have not been reported previously. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the selected MCOs are distributed across various bacterial MCO groups and do not cluster closely with their respective QEs (Fig. S3). This suggests that MCOs with shorter Euclidean distances may not be closely related evolutionarily. Additionally, analysis of sequence similarity networks (SSN) within UniRef50 indicated that MCOs with close evolutionary relationships do not consistently exhibit short Euclidean distances (Fig. S4). Finally, AlphaFold2 structures of the selected MCOs and the QEs were used for analyzing their structural relationships. A taxonomic tree (Fig. S5a) categorized the MCOs into six clades, with over half located in categories separate from those of the QEs.

To determine if this strategy could yield new MCOs with enhanced catalytic properties compared to the QEs, all selected MCOs were successfully expressed and purified using E. coli (BL21). We conducted a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the catalytic properties of these MCOs using the standard ABTS oxidation reaction. Almost all MCOs effectively oxidized ABTS, with approximately 40% of MCOs in each series demonstrating superior catalytic efficiency or increased thermal stability relative to their QEs (Fig. 2a, Table. S6). Notably, several candidates stood out in this study: Sulfur, Bcece, Tocean, and Bfre. As shown in Fig. 2a, Scla exhibited a 3.0-fold longer half-life at 80 °C compared to DMS13 while maintaining a higher kcat and specific activity value. Additionally, Tocean and Bfre demonstrated catalytic efficiencies 5.8 and 95.2 times higher than that of HR03, respectively, while maintaining comparable thermostability. Remarkably, Sulfur was found to be 32.9 times more active than Eclac and stands out as one of the most heat-tolerant MCOs reported to date20, with a half-life of 156.9 ± 9.0 min at 80 °C.

Given that MCOs are often utilized in industrial settings with harsh conditions, we evaluated the optimal operating temperatures and pH, as well as the organic solvent tolerance of both newly discovered MCOs and their corresponding QEs. Like QEs, Sulfur, Bcece, Tocean, and Bfre showed optimal activity at temperatures between 80 and 90 °C. Notably, Sulfur also maintained relatively high activity at lower temperatures, ranging from 30 to 50 °C (Fig. 2b). Bacterial MCOs typically catalyze ABTS oxidation under acidic conditions and lose activity as the pH increases. However, in our study, Sulfur and Mint achieved optimal activity at a pH of 5.0 and remained active even when the pH levels were as high as 8 (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, Sulfur, Tocean, Slac, and Bfre demonstrated exceptional resistance to organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetone. After a 2-day incubation, they retained at least approximately 80% of their initial activity in 50 v/v% tested organic solvents, surpassing the performance of both QEs. The broader operational temperature and pH range, as well as enhanced organic solvent tolerance, highlight the potential of these enzymes for robust industrial applications.

Overall, Sulfur, Tocean, Bfre, Bcece, and Scla outperform both the QEs and most reported MCOs, excelling in at least two factors among catalytic efficiency, heat and pH tolerance, and organic solvent resistance. Among them, Sulfur significantly outperforms all QEs across all catalytic properties.

We resolved the crystal structure of Bfre (PDB:8Z5B) and Sulfur (PDB: 8Z59) due to their exceptional catalytic properties. The arguments for X-ray diffraction and structural refinement are listed in Tables S9 and S10. As illustrated in Fig. 3, both Bfre and Sulfur have Greek key β-barrel domains interconnected by α-helices and extensive coiled sections. They also have a highly conserved mononuclear copper ion center (T1 Cu) essential for substrate oxidation and a Cu-Cys-His pathway facilitating electron transfer. While these structural features are typical for MCOs from E. coli and Bacillus species25,26, Bfre and Sulfur possess unique characteristics that warrant further investigation.

The conventional active center of MCO comprises four copper ions, including a T1 Cu and a trinuclear Cu cluster27. The trinuclear Cu cluster consists of one T2 Cu ion and two T3 Cu ions, which bind and reduce molecular oxygen to water28. Differently, Bfre's active center contains only three metal ions: one T1 Cu and a unique diatomic center composed of one Cu ion and one Mn ion. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that the MCO from Trametes hirsuta LG-9 contains copper and manganese, but it could not pinpoint the exact location of these metals29. Meanwhile, the PDB database has not yet included any MCOs with heteronuclear active centers. Therefore, this unique configuration distinguishes it from all previously documented MCO active centers30(Fig. 3a and Figs. S6 and S9).

Sulfur is structurally similar to Eclac, with a TM-score of 0.92, despite a low sequence similarity of 28.49% (Fig. 3a). A detailed structural comparison between Sulfur and Eclac reveals a significant difference in a loop region, where Eclac contains an additional 36 amino acid residues compared to Sulfur. Molecular dynamic simulations were conducted on both enzymes further to investigate the impact of this region on their properties. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis indicated notable instability within the D333–A384 loop region of Eclac (0.07 < RMSF < 0.34), whereas the shorter I335-V340 loop in Sulfur exhibited greater stability (0.10 < RMSF < 0.18) (Fig. S8). Additionally, the B-factor of the I335–V340 loop in Sulfur is lower than that of the D333–A384 loop in Eclac (Fig. 3b), indicating reduced mobility in Sulfur's corresponding region. The contribution of shorter loops to enhanced thermal stability in MCOs has not been addressed in other studies. Furthermore, Sulfur also features 1.6 times more salt bridges than Eclac (Table S11), underscoring its exceptional thermostability31.

To assess the efficacy of this strategy in identifying more efficient enzymes for potential industrial use, we selected enzymes from each group and assessed their catalytic performance in key bioremediation applications: organic dye decolorization, antibiotic, and toxin degradation. Specifically, we evaluated remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR), chloramphenicol (CAP), and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) as representatives for each category. In contrast to the traditional methods, we performed bioremediation tests without a mediator to reduce unnecessary pollution. Our findings showed that multiple MCOs in each series outperformed the corresponding QSs in removing these environmentally harmful compounds (Fig. 4).

RBBR, an anthraquinone dye commonly used in the textile industry, harms aquatic and vegetative life. In a two-hour test, all MCOs from three series catalyzed rapid decolorization within the first 10 min (Fig. 4A), outperforming some reported bacterial and fungal MCOs32,33,34. Each series featured multiple new enzymes that catalyzed faster decolorization rates and higher decolorization percentages than Eclac, DSM13, and HR03. Notably, in the DSM13 series, three out of five MCOs showed superior performance despite DSM13 itself exhibiting minimal activity. Sulfur decolorized 46.7% of RBBR within 10 min, marking it the most efficient MCO reported to date for mediator-free RBBR decolorization22,34,35.

Furthermore, CAP is known for its stability even at elevated temperatures18. All tested MCOs degraded CAP at room temperature. In the HR03 series, four out of five MCOs performed better than the QEs, with Talbi achieving the highest degradation percentage of approximately 24.3% within 48 h (Fig. 4b), surpassing the performance of fungal MCO-catalyzed systems in the presence of mediators19.

We also evaluated the degradation efficiency of AFB1, a major agricultural toxin. In the Eclac series, Psoli, Mint, and Faest outperformed the query, degrading nearly 33.5% AFB1 after 48 h of treatment. In the DSM13 series, all candidates showed better degradation capacity than the query, with Bcece showing the highest capacity at 39.4% (Fig. 4c). To assess the cytotoxicity of AFB1 and its degradation products, we incubated HepG2 cells with media supplemented with 10 mM and 50 mM AFB1 treated with and without Bcece, respectively. After a 48-h incubation period, there was an observed increase in the viability of HepG2 cells, with the survival rate rising from 116.1 ± 5.6% to 126.4 ± 6.1% and from 27.6 ± 3.4% to 65.3 ± 8.5% (Fig. 4d, e). This increase indicates a reduction in the cytotoxic effects associated with the degradation products of AFB135.

Researchers often randomly select enzymatic candidates from clusters identified through SSN analysis. However, this trial-and-error approach is generally inefficient and can prolong the discovery process. In addition, although PLMs have recently been successfully utilized to guide protein engineering12, antibody design11, enzyme functional assessment (such as CLEAN36 and TM-Vec14), and remote homology detection (like PLMSearch)4,14, they have not been used to explore the catalytic properties of enzymes in low sequence homology regions. ESM-Ezy addressed these previously unmet challenges.

In this study, ESM-Ezy utilizes a fine-tuned ESM-1b model and calculations of similarity in protein semantic space to efficiently discover novel MCOs with enhanced catalytic properties with a high success rate. Compared to the QEs, 44% of the selected MCOs outperformed the QEs and surpassed most previously reported MCOs in at least one property, including catalytic efficiency, heat and organic solvent tolerance, and pH stability. Notably, the enzyme Sulfur significantly outperformed all QEs across all evaluated catalytic properties. For bioremediation applications, approximately 44% of the MCOs decolorized RBBR more efficiently, while 22% and 33% MCOs demonstrated superior CAP and AFB1 degradation capabilities, respectively. For comparison, five sequences located in the same SSN cluster with Eclac but with a remote Euclidean distance based on ESM-Ezy analysis were tested, and activity was not detected (Fig. S4, Table S7). This indicates that ESM-Ezy improves the likelihood of identifying candidates with enhanced catalytic properties compared to conventional SSN-based strategies.

We found that MCOs representations from randomly initialized, pretrained, and finetuned models increasingly clustered with QEs. This indicates that in well-trained models, Euclidean distance in the model space reflects more semantic information related to MCOs (Fig. S2). These results are consistent with findings from other studies14,37 and suggest that Euclidean distance could serve as a unique metric for assessing enzyme functionality, distinct from methods based on structural and sequence similarities alone. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the majority of MCOs with improved catalytic properties shared only 25–35% sequence similarity with the QEs. For example, Sulfur (TM-score: 0.91, identity: 0.26), Scla (TM-score: 0.82, identity: 0.32), Bfre (TM-score: 0.96, identity: 0.39), Tocean (TM-score: 0.85, identity: 0.36), and Bcece (TM-score: 0.57, identity: 0.27) demonstrate low sequence similarity to their corresponding QEs. This suggests that enzymes with breakthrough properties might be often found in regions characterized by low sequence similarity but high structural conservation.

To evaluate the general applicability of the ESM-Ezy method in our study, we applied it to l-Asparaginase (l-asparagine amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-asparagine into ammonia and l-aspartic acid38. This enzyme has shown significant therapeutic potential, particularly in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia39. As described above, we finetuned the ESM-1b to search l-asparaginases (Table S12). We selected an l-asparaginase (UniProt: O34482) from Bacillus subtilis 168 as the QE and identified five candidate enzymes. Compared to QE, A0A3N5F6J4, and H1D2G7 exhibited approximately 2.0-fold and 4.1-fold higher specific activity and 2.0-fold and 3.0-fold higher kcat, respectively (Table S13). These results suggest that ESM-Ezy can successfully identify enzymes beyond oxidoreductases with superior catalytic performance.

In conclusion, our ESM-Ezy integrates ESM-1b with experimental validation to study enzymes with low sequence similarities, leading to the successful identification of novel and high-performing MCOs and l-Asparaginases. This approach suggests that utilizing PLMs along with the calculation of Euclidean distance to explore low sequence similarity space is a promising strategy for discovering high-performance enzymes and uncovering new enzymes with distinctive structural features. This technique has the potential to be extended to other enzyme families, speeding up the discovery of innovative biocatalysts with superior properties.

No. A506636) were obtained from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, Cat. No. A109612) and Remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR, Cat. No. R169089) were obtained from Aladdin Biotech (Shanghai, China). Chloramphenicol (Cat. No. A600118) and Aflatoxin B1 (Cat. No. A832707) were obtained in HPLC grade from Solarbio (Beijing, China) and Innochem (Beijing, China), respectively. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, GibcoTM), fetal bovine serum (FBS, GibcoTM), and Penicillin–Streptomycin (GibcoTM) were purchased from Thermo Fisher (USA).

In our ESM-Ezy strategy, the objective of the fine-tuning stage differs slightly from other methods, as it focuses on learning a representation space for sequences rather than simply predicting whether a sequence is positive or negative. Given the vast size of the Uniref50 dataset, even with stringent criteria to filter positives, the number of resulting candidates remains in the thousands, rendering wet lab experiments impractical due to the sheer volume. To mitigate this challenge, during the searching stage, we employed QEs to identify the nearest sequences within the fine-tuned representation space from the previous stage, thereby obtaining a manageable number of sequences for wet-lab experimentation.

The positive dataset of MCOs consisted of 147 sequences reported in the literature. This dataset was randomly divided into training and test subsets, consisting of 117 sequences (~80%) and 30 sequences (~20%), respectively. The negative dataset of MCOs was sampled from the Swiss-Prot database (Release 2022_02), based on the assumption that unlabeled databases are likely to be negatives, a premise supported by findings in both the recommendation40,41 and natural language processing area42. The sequences in Swiss-Prot have been scientifically verified; thus, sequences without MCO labels and with low sequence similarities compared to MCOs are very likely to be negative. Sequences labeled as MCOs and those with sequence identities exceeding 40% relative to the positive set were excluded, resulting in a total of 567,235 sequences. From this adjusted negative set, 1000 sequences were randomly selected to form the test negative set, with the remaining 566,235 sequences designated as the training negative set.

We conducted a fivefold cross-validation to validate the robustness of our pipeline. The positive datasets were divided fivefold while keeping the negative datasets for training and test unchanged. In each experiment, onefold of the positive dataset was set aside as the test set, and the remaining folds were used as the training set. We then measured the ROC-AUC score, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score based on this setup (Table S5). The high average ROC–AUC of 0.9838 and F1-score of 0.9787 indicate the strong robustness.

The UniRef50 database was utilized as our candidate pool. We used the fine-tuned binary classification model to sift through the database and identify predicted positive sequences. Subsequently, we used their representations to calculate the Euclidean distances within the high-dimensional semantic space, facilitating the comparison between QEs and the candidate sequences. This method allowed for the efficient identification of potential biocatalysts by assessing their proximity in a semantic landscape shaped by protein function and structure.

To balance the large volume of negative data against the smaller positive sample set, a dynamic negative sampling strategy43 was adopted. Specifically, for each epoch, we sampled a number of negative samples equal to the positive samples (117 for training) from the negative sample pool of adjusted training Swiss-Prot database (566,235 sequences). These were then shuffled with the positive samples for training. This approach ensures that the model is exposed to new negative samples for each training epoch rather than a fixed negative set, thus addressing data imbalance and enhancing the robustness of the training process. By applying dynamic negative sampling, even if there were a few unknown positive samples in the negative sample pool, the likelihood of these being sampled during training would be extremely low due to their rarity. During the training process, the learning rate was set at \(1\times {10}^{-5}\) and the Adam optimizer was utilized44.

We utilized the TM-score to quantify structural similarity and sequence identity to measure sequence similarity. For the calculation of the TM-score, we employ a tool known as TM-align45, a structural alignment program designed to compare two proteins with potentially differing sequences. For sequence identity calculation, Bio.pairwise246 module was employed and the sequence identity between all sequence pairs were calculated.

Plasmids and strains are listed in Table S1. Synthetic genes were inserted into the BamH I–Hind III sites of plasmids pET-28a or pET-28a-sumo. Kanamycin (50 μg/mL) was added to the growth media when necessary. E. coli BL21(DE3) cultures transformed with expression plasmids were grown overnight, then inoculated into LB medium supplemented with 1 mM CuCl2 and incubated at 37 °C with continuous shaking (250 rpm) until late logarithmic phase. Induction of target protein expression was initiated by adding IPTG (final concentration 0.1 mM), followed by further incubation at 16 °C for 16 h. After centrifugation at 8000×g for 10 min at 4 °C, cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) and subjected to sonication. The resulting crude extract was clarified by additional centrifugation steps to remove cell debris.

All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The crude enzymes were purified with an IMAC column (HisTrapTMHP, 5 mL, Cytiva) using an FPLC system (ÄKTATM Pure, Cytiva). After washing with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.6), the target enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.6). The purified enzymes were concentrated and desalted by ultrafiltration with an exchange buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme concentration was determined by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit47.

The specific activity of MCOs was evaluated at 37 °C using ABTS as the substrate. The assay solution comprised 40 mM ABTS in citrate-NaOH buffer (pH 4.0, 50 mM). The increase in absorbance resulting from the oxidation of ABTS at 420 nm per minute (ε420 = 36,000 M−1 cm−1) was recorded after the addition 0.1–1 μM enzymes, ensuring a linear increase in absorbance. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the oxidation of 1 μmol of substrate per minute. Specific activity was calculated as units per milligram of protein. Enzyme activity was determined by analyzing the initial linear phase of the reaction curve. The kinetic parameters, including the Km and kcat of the recombinant enzyme, were determined by assessing the enzymatic activity under a gradient of with concentrations of 0.1–5 mM ABTS substrate concentrations. The Lineweaver–Burk plot was employed to fit the experimental data and calculate the Km and kcat parameters.

The optimal pH for MCO activity was determined at 37 °C using 50 mM citrate–phosphate buffer spanning a pH range of 3.0–8.0. The change in absorbance at 420 nm per minute was measured to determine enzyme activity. We set the highest activity as 100% for calculating the relative activity at each pH value. The optimum temperature for enzymatic activity of each enzyme was monitored across a temperature range from 40 °C to 90 °C. The maximum activity of each enzyme was set as 100% in order to calculate the relative activity at each temperature point.

Half-life of enzymes was assessed by incubating the purified enzyme (1 mg/ml) in 80 °C water bath with sampling at regular intervals. Residual activity (ΔA420/min/mg protein) was measured, and the activity ratio was calculated. Thermostability was evaluated at 80 °C. The experimental data was fitted to the inactivation equation:

where, Y is the percentage of the residual activity, X is time and kd is inactivation rate constant.

Then, half-life (t1/2) was calculated as:

The impact of various chemicals on enzyme activity was evaluated by preincubating the enzyme (1 mg/ml) with 50% concentrations of organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, and DMSO) for 48 h at room temperature. Enzyme tolerance to organic solvents was assessed as the relative residual activity ratio between treated and untreated samples.

For crystallization, enzymes were purified using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system equipped with an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (HisTrap™ HP) and a size exclusion column (Superdex™). The purified enzymes were subjected to crystallization trials using commercial crystal screening kits (PEGRx and Proplex). In each well of a 96-well plate (SWISSCI 3drop), equal volumes (150 nL) of enzyme solution and reservoir solution were mixed using the vapor-diffusion sitting-drop method at 16 °C. Initial crystallization hits were observed in several conditions after 7–10 days. Following several rounds of optimization, the best quality single protein crystals were harvested under varying conditions. For example, crystals of Sulfur were obtained from conditions containing 1% w/v Tryptone, 0.001 M sodium azide, 0.05 M HEPES sodium pH 7.0, and 12% w/v Polyethylene glycol 3350, while crystals of Bfre were grown in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 20% v/v Ethanol.

For X-ray diffraction data collection, crystals of Bfre and Sulfur were briefly soaked in their respective reservoir solutions supplemented with 25% glycerol to enhance cryoprotection. The crystals were then mounted on loops and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for preservation. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed using HKL2000 software48. The data-collection statistics are detailed in Supplementary Tables S8–S10. The closest homologous structure (PDB entry 6SYY49) to Sulfur, exhibited 43.9% sequence identity and 89.8% coverage. For Bfre, the closest structure (PDB entry 2FQG) showed 38.4% sequence identity and 77.5% coverage. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the Phenix software suite50, utilizing models 6SYY and 2FQG. Initial phases were refined using rigid body refinement, followed by manual model rebuilding in COOT51. Subsequent rounds of refinement were conducted using the Phenix suite. The final coordinates and structure factors for Bfre and Sulfur have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accessible under the accession codes 8Z5B and 8Z59, respectively.

Due to the absence of certain segments in the Eclac crystal structure (1KV7, 2FQD, 5YS1), the three-dimensional configuration of Eclac was determined by AlphaFold52,53. The AlphaFold model exhibited strong alignment with the available crystal structures, with a low RMSD value further validating the model's accuracy (Fig. S7). So, MD simulations were carried out for Eclac (AlphaFold: AF-P36649-F1-model_v4) and Sulfur (PDB: 8Z59) using Gromacs 2022.354,55,56. Each structure was placed in a box with a 0.8 nm margin and filled with tip3p water molecules57 and underwent 2000 steepest descent energy minimization steps. Then the systems were equilibrated and run for 50 ns with a 2 fs time step using the NPT ensemble at a temperature of 310.15 K, under the Amber ff14SB force field58, and each simulation was replicated 3 times. The trajectory was analyzed with Gromacs built-in tools. Graphical displays of the structures were visualized by PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (www.pymol.org).

A solution of RBBR (10 mM in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0) was prepared. For the experiments, RBBR solution was added to each well (7 μL/well, resulting in a final concentration of 100 μM), followed by the addition of the MCO solution (693 μL/well, 1 μM in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer). Each MCO candidate was tested in four wells, with supernatants sampled at intervals of 10, 30, 60, and 120 min. The reactions were conducted in deep-well 96-well plates incubated in an 85 °C water bath. All experiments were performed in triplicate. RBBR dye decolorization was measured using a UV–vis plate reader (Bio-Tek H1). To determine the maximal absorbance wavelength of RBBR dye, a solution of the dye (200 μL/well, 100 μM in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer) was transferred to 96-microwell plates, and the final spectral scanning was confirmed at an absorbance of 594 nm.

To assess the degradation of chloramphenicol by MCOs, a reaction mixture was prepared by adding 677.4 μL of MCO solution (1 μM in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0) to a 2 mL crimp vial, followed by the addition of 22.6 μL of chloramphenicol stock solution (1 mg/mL in ethanol). The vial was then agitated at 250 rpm at room temperature for 48 h. To terminate the reaction, each sample was heated at 95 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was filtered through a 0.22 μm PES membrane to remove the denatured enzyme. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The degradation of chloramphenicol was analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu LC-20AT). The analysis included samples from both the control (untreated with MCOs) and those treated with MCOs. The mobile phase consisted of water, methanol, and acetic acid in a ratio of 55:45:0.1 (v/v/v). Chromatographic separation was achieved using an analytical reverse-phase C18 column (ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18, 95 Å, 3.0 × 150 mm, 5 µm) equipped with a guard column (ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18, 95 Å, 4.6 × 12.5 mm, 5 µm). The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the analysis was performed with an injection volume of 10 μL, a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and detection at a wavelength of 278 nm.

MCOs solution (697.8 μL, 1 μM in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0) and aflatoxin B1 stock solution (2.2 μL, 1 mg/mL in DMSO) were added to 2 mL crimp vial, and the vial was shaken at 250 rpm at room temperature for 48 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Following incubation, the control (un-MCOs treated) and MCOs treated samples were analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu LC-20AT) using acetonitrile: methanol: water (1: 1: 2, v/v/v) as mobile phase, an analytical reverse phase C18 column (ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18, 95 Å, 3.0 × 150 mm, 5 µm) with a guard column (ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18, 95 Å, 4.6 × 12.5 mm, 5 µm) served as stationary phase. The experiment was performed at room temperature with the column oven in 30 °C, 10 μL of injection volume at 0.5 mL/min flow rate, and the analyte was detected at wavelength 365 nm.

To further verify the degradation effect of the MCOs treatment, experiments with AFB1 samples at concentrations of 10 and 50 µM were repeated. Following MCOs treatment, the samples were extracted with an equal volume of chloroform, then dried under nitrogen gas, and redissolved in DMSO at one-tenth of the original chloroform volume. The samples were thoroughly vortexed to ensure complete dissolution for further analysis.

The cytotoxicity of AFB1 was tested via HepG2 (HB-8065), the human hepatocarcinoma cell line obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA)59,60. The cell was cultured in culture flakes by DMEM, which contained 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and placed into a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. When proliferating up to 90% of culture flakes, HepG2 cells were harvested by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinization, resuspended, and diluted in DMEM (1:3 ratio). Cells were passed every week until they were stable enough for testing.

For the cell viability test, the extracts of different concentrations of AFB1 with MCOs Bcece treatment were mixed with culture media to get a final concentration of 1% DMSO and used as experimental groups. Cell viability was tested by cell counting kits (CCK-8, Beijing Lablead Biotech), which could count live cell numbers with formazan produced by dehydrogenase in the mitochondria. The cells were incubated with corresponding media for 24 h, and cell viability was detected according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Fluorescence imaging analysis was evaluated using a standard AM/PI assay kit (Beijing Lablead Biotech) with Calcein AM to identify cells with metabolic activity and PI to assess the cell membrane integrity. After incubated with Calcein AM and PI solution, samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Keyence BZ-X810) at 490 ± 10 nm. The living and dead cells were stained green and red by Calcein AM and PI, respectively.

All experiments were conducted at least three times, and error bars in the figures represent the standard errors. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a one-tailed t-test.

Apple desktop computers are elegant machines that can serve a family or drive a powerful home office workstation. But between the different models and chipsets, it can be a struggle to find the best Mac for your needs. Whether you're a creative professional looking for a machine that can handle graphic design tasks or a student in need of a reliable PC to get work done, Apple has a wide range of options. From the stylish and easy-to-use iMac to the powerful Mac Studio, we break down Apple's offerings to help you find the Mac best suited for your everyday tasks.

What Is the Latest M-Series Chip?

Apple first started designing its in-house chips back in 2020, which are dispersed throughout different Macs, MacBooks, and iPads. As of now, the company has released a total of 14 M-series chips. As new versions come out, machines with older chips are discontinued at Apple and tougher to find at third-party retailers.

The M4 series is the current generation of silicon from Apple. There's a choice between an M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Each chip is built on a second-generation 3-nanometer process, which fits more transistors into a smaller space to enhance speed and efficiency. Both the M4 Pro and M4 Max come with mesh shading and ray tracing too, which Apple says is twice as fast as on the M3 chip.

The M4 (with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU) is the entry-level option and best for basic tasks. The M4 Pro (with a 14-core CPU and an up to 20-core GPU) is the better option for those who need a bit more power for tasks like heavy-duty video or photo editing. The M4 Max (with a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU) is the most powerful chip you can get in a MacBook but the second-most-powerful chip available in a Mac desktop.

The latest M3 Ultra holds that title. Even though the M3 series was introduced in 2023, Apple announced this one in 2025. It comes with an up to 32-core CPU (with 24 performance cores) and a GPU with up to 80 cores. You'll also get 96 GB of unified memory, with the option to upgrade up to 512 GB, and storage can be increased to 16 TB. Apple claims it's up to 2.5 times faster than the M1 Ultra. It's only available in the 2025 Mac Studio.

It's worth noting that even if the M4 processor sounds newer and better than, say, an M3 Pro, the latter is actually the faster processor. You need to compare the tiers to one another, meaning an M4 is better than an M3, and the M4 Pro is better than the M3 Pro. Still, it's a good idea to hunt for older models with these Pro, Max, or Ultra chips if you're looking for the best bargain and a lot of power.

You can find a full breakdown of each chip in our guide to the Best MacBooks.

Which Macs Support Apple Intelligence?

Apple Intelligence—the company's suite of artificial intelligence features—arrived in macOS Sequoia 15.1. It enables features like Smart Replies, Mail Summaries, Clean up in Photos, Writing Tools, and the redesigned Siri. But Apple Intelligence doesn't work with all Macs. You'll need one with an M-series chip. This includes:

Add AppleCare+ to Protect Your Hardware

Apple's desktops are expensive, as are its replacement parts. You're less likely to accidentally drop a Mac Studio than a MacBook, but accidents happen. Each Mac comes with one year of hardware repair coverage and up to 90 days of technical support at no cost. But I suggest snagging Apple's AppleCare+, which extends your coverage. You'll have to buy it within 60 days of purchasing your Mac.

You can pick between monthly or yearly payments, both of which include unlimited accidental damage protection and 24/7 telephone support. Screen damage or external enclosure damage are subject to a $99 service fee, while other accidental damage will cost $299. The fee depends on the specific Mac you buy:

Take Advantage of Apple's Education Discounts

Apple offers discounts on hardware for students and teachers when you purchase through Apple's Education Store. All you have to do is pick the Mac you want and add it to your cart. You'll then see the discount at checkout. Apple doesn't ask for any proof that you're a student or a teacher, but the company may email you later on for verification. Don't use the discount unless you're actually in school.

What About Older Macs?

I do not recommend buying an Apple desktop computer with an Intel processor. They will not perform as well, and many of them are no longer supported (some are). Within the M-series, try to stick close to the current generation of chipsets. It might not make sense to snag an M1-powered iMac unless it's shockingly cheap.

Is Now a Good Time to Buy?

Yes. Apple released the M4-powered iMac and Mac Mini at the end of 2024. In March of 2025, the company launched the Mac Studio with the new M3 Ultra chip in addition to the M4 Max. If you're eyeing the Mac Pro, you may want to hold off, as Apple hasn't released a new version since 2023, and it's due for a refresh.

You just want a computer. You don't want to figure out what peripherals to buy or parse through specs. If that sounds like you, then get the Apple iMac. The 24-inch all-in-one computer (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is easy to set up and comes with all the accessories you need, including a built-in webcam, speakers, USB-C Magic Keyboard, and Magic Mouse. (You can swap the latter for the superior Magic Trackpad at checkout.) It's the only desktop from Apple that comes in fun colors, like pink, green, orange, and purple.

The 24-inch, 4.5K-resolution LCD is sharp, and the 12-megapixel webcam above supports Center Stage, meaning the camera will try to keep your face in the frame. There are two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the base model (pricier versions come with four, along with a Gigabit Ethernet port), a six-speaker sound system, and three studio-quality mics. For an extra $200 on higher configurations, you can add nano-texture glass to the display. I recommend it if you're planning on using the iMac near a window, as it helps limit glare.

Inside is Apple's latest M4 chipset. It had the highest CPU benchmarks we've seen on an all-in-one computer in our tests and the best GPU scores among machines with integrated graphics. It starts at $1,299 and comes with 16 GB of RAM, which should be enough for most people. Though if you tend to have a ton of browser tabs open, or do a little more than surfing the web, you may want to add more unified memory and storage. The most expensive model costs $3,000, but hey, you don't have to buy extra accessories.

If you're picky about your peripherals, the Mac Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great starting point for your home computer station. All you have to do is plug it into a power source and connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse of your choosing. It's the most affordable PC from Apple, not to mention the smallest. You can even travel with it if you want and use it at the office or in a hotel room.

The base model starts at $599 and comes with an M4 chip, complete with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. That's plenty powerful to drive basic tasks like sending emails, web browsing, writing, and video calls. It handles multiple tabs and windows without any hiccups. This version also comes with two USB-C ports (that support USB 3.0) and a 3.5-mm headphone jack on the front. On the back are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI, an Ethernet connection, and a power port.

You can upgrade to the M4 Pro if you need more power. That includes anyone planning on using it for creative apps like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, though you may want to bump up the unified memory as well. It comes with three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports in this configuration for faster data transfer speeds.

This is the step up from the Mac Mini. The Mac Studio (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the most powerful and compact Apple desktop, thanks to the M3 Ultra chip inside. It's also far more affordable than the Mac Pro. Comprised of two M3 Max chips, the chipset has up to a 32-core CPU (with 24 performance cores) and a GPU with up to 80 cores. The more cores you add, the more powerful your machine, but if you don't need that much power, you can pair the Mac Studio with an M4 Max, which has an up to 16-core CPU and an up to 40-core GPU.

The Mac Studio isn't as tiny as the Mac Mini, but it's still a small machine and will fit easily on your desk (it fits perfectly under Apple's Studio Display too). It has more ports, including two USB-C ports and an SD card slot on the front. On the back are four Thunderbolt USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and HDMI, a 10-gigabit Ethernet port, and headphone jack, and a headphone jack. Apple upgraded the USB-C to the Thunderbolt 5 standard for faster data transfer speeds. There's support for multiple displays, depending on the chip. The M4 Max can connect up to five displays, while the M3 Ultra goes up to six. The built-in speaker system is solid, but if sound quality is critical, you're better off buying a pair of computer speakers (or using headphones).

Stuck between this model and the Mac Mini? The deciding factor should be based on your workflow. Most people looking for a bit more power than what a basic PC offers will probably be satisfied with the M4 Pro on the Mini. But if the bulk of your work is dependent on intensive tasks, like photo and video editing or creating 3D models in apps like Blender, the M3 Ultra or M4 Max in the Mac Studio are better choices.

Anyone can buy a Mac Pro from Apple, but this expensive machine is designed for a very niche audience. Typically that's creative professionals who need a machine for demanding workloads, people who need the modularity and internal expansion, since it comes with seven PCI Express expansion slots and far more ports than any other Apple desktop: eight Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, two USB-A ports (up to 5 Gb/s), two HDMI ports, and two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Seriously, you'll know if you need a Mac Pro.

The Mac Pro comes in two M2 Ultra configurations. The base model comes with a 24-core CPU and a 60-core GPU. For an extra $1,000, you can upgrade to a 76-core GPU. It also comes with up to 192 GB of unified memory and up to 8 TB of storage. The more you upgrade, the pricier it gets. The most expensive model costs a whopping $11,799. The main thing to know is that the Mac Pro launched in 2023 alongside a Mac Studio. Considering that Apple just introduced a new Mac Studio in 2025, there's a chance we'll see a new Mac Pro later this year.

Yes, this is a MacBook in an Apple desktop computer guide. The 16-inch MacBook Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is the most unwieldy of Apple's laptops, but it makes for a great desktop alternative. You can build around it, pairing the large 16-inch laptop screen with up to two external monitors (with the lid closed) and other peripherals. Plus, you get the benefit of being able to take it wherever you go, even if it is a weighty machine.

This is the most powerful MacBook you can buy. It can be configured with the latest M4 Pro or M4 Max chipset. The M4 Pro chip delivered outstanding performance in our tests. But for extra oomph, you can opt for the more powerful M4 Max. It also has a bunch of noteworthy perks, like the lovely mini-LED screen, 1080p webcam, six-speaker sound system, and a 120-Hz refresh rate. Apple also added Thunderbolt 5 (120 Gbps/sec) for faster data transfer speeds, a new 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage (to keep you in-frame during video calls), and the option to upgrade to nano-texture glass for an additional $150 (which I highly recommend if you want to reduce glare). Read our Best MacBooks guide for more.

The fun part about a desktop computer is that you can outfit it with all of your favorite accessories, and there are many great options out there. Here are a few recommendations, and you can find more in our Best MacBook Accessories guide.

Satechi Mac Mini M4 Hub for $130: The latest Mac Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great, compact desktop PC. However, Apple made a questionable decision by moving the power button from the back of the device to the bottom, which means you have to pick it up every time you want to turn it on or off. Satechi's hub solves that problem—with a dedicated opening on the back that makes it easy to access the button without having to lift it. It comes with extra ports too. You'll get three USB-A ports (up to 10 Gbps) and a built-in SD card reader. The upgraded SSD also comes with support for up to 4 TB of NVMe storage.

Apple Studio Display for $1,499: The Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is expensive, but the 27-inch screen is a terrific companion for the Mac Mini or Mac Studio. It has a stunningly sharp 5K-resolution display, a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers. For an extra cost, you can also upgrade to the model with nano-texture glass.

Asus 24-Inch Full HD Monitor for $104: If you're looking for a less expensive monitor, this one from Asus has a sharp 1080-pixel resolution (colors can look slightly oversaturated, but you can tweak this via the display settings). It also comes with a tilt-adjustable stand and supports the VESA mounting standard if you want to use an arm mount.

Satechi M1 Mouse for $30: This is currently my favorite mouse—I've been using it with the MacBook Pro (2024). The ergonomic design is comfortable against my palm, the buttons are super responsive, and the scroll wheel is smooth. It has a Type-C port on the front too, so you can still use it while it's charging.

Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID for $179: It's tough to beat Apple's accessories. The Magic Keyboard (with USB-C) comes with the same function row keys you'd find on an M-series MacBook, including playback buttons, a dedicated Do Not Disturb key, and a Mission Control key. It also comes with Touch ID, so you don't have to type in your password every time to log in.

Apple Magic Trackpad 2 for $130: If you're already accustomed to using a trackpad on a laptop, you can recreate it with your desktop using the Magic Trackpad 2. It has the same Force Touch and Multi-Touch gestures, so it'll feel exactly like the MacBook. It also pairs automatically with your machine. The battery lasts about a month, and you can recharge it via a USB-C to USB-C cable.

Grovemade Wool Felt Desk Pad for $70: A desk mat isn't necessary for your workspace, but it adds a nice decorative touch. This one from Grovemade is a great option. It's sleek and easy to clean (I wiped up coffee spills with ease). It also comes in fun colors like light green, blue, and dark orange.

A MagSafe phone grip can make all the difference in today's world of extra-large smartphones. They can offer a more comfortable grip while doomscrolling through social media and a way to potentially prevent a fumble. These little accessories can double as kickstands, making it easy to prop your phone up during video calls or while streaming content.

Phone grips have been around for a while, popularized by PopSockets, but the ones in this guide attach via magnets instead of an adhesive or a clamp. Leveraging Apple's MagSafe technology on iPhones, they're easy to take on and off and don't interfere with features like wireless charging. Android phone owners can take advantage as well if they have a magnetic phone case. I've been testing several over the past few months—these are the best MagSafe phone grips worth your time.

What Is MagSafe?

MagSafe is Apple's magnetic technology built into the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 lineup (the iPhone SE and iPhone 16e are excluded). It consists of a ring of magnets on the back of the phone designed for a faster, more precise wireless charging system. But these magnets also opened up the ability to attach different kinds of accessories to the back of the device, like wallets and external batteries. It even makes docking an iPhone to a car mount easier.

If you use a case on your iPhone, make sure it comes with MagSafe support (you'll see a ring of magnets on the inside). That way, the MagSafe accessories will have a proper connection. Otherwise, if you use a non-MagSafe case, the accessories will likely slide off due to a weak connection.

If you need a recommendation for a great MagSafe case, we have plenty in our guides:

If you want a magnetic grip, make sure it supports MagSafe or at least mentions magnets on the product page. All the recommendations here are MagSafe grips.

Can Android Phones Use MagSafe Grips?

Most Android phones are incompatible with MagSafe grips. But there are magnetic cases available for top Android phone models enabling MagSafe-like functionality. You can find WIRED-tested magnetic cases for select Android phones here.

Over the coming years, thanks to the new Qi2 wireless charging standard that incorporates the Magnetic Power Profile, you'll start seeing more high-end Android phones embed magnets inside the device, just like on Apple's iPhones. That will allow greater compatibility with MagSafe accessories with or without a magnetic case. The road is bumpy, though. Samsung's latest Galaxy S25 range, for example, are “Qi2 Ready,” meaning you can only access Qi2 charging speeds and features with a magnet case. Hopefully, manufacturers will add native magnet support soon.

The Different Types of Phone Grips

MagSafe grips are hardly the only type of phone grips available. In fact, there are four main other types of grips you can buy.

Cases with attached grips. These are cases with a grip attached to the back. You get a strong and durable grip that will never fall off, but the trade-off is a thicker phone, and these cases typically are incompatible with wireless charging and may not work with other MagSafe accessories.

Clamp-style grips. Also called universal phone grips, these clamp to a phone so you can easily take them on and off, and they're not limited to a particular kind of phone. The downside is they're not the fastest to take on and off, and they can sometimes slide up and down the phone.

Adhesive grips. You can stick a phone grip to the back of your phone or case, and while this will typically give you a well-attached grip that likely won't fall off your phone, the downsides are similar to cases with attached grips. It may block features like wireless charging and restrict you from using other accessories.

MagSafe grips. These grips are all about convenience. You can easily take them on and off, but they only work with devices or cases with built-in magnets. While you can dangle a phone from a MagSafe grip without issue, any additional force could cause the magnets to separate and fling your phone to the ground.

How We Test MagSafe Grips

Each MagSafe grip in this guide is one I used as my primary phone grip for weeks or months at a time. I make sure they snap to my iPhone or MagSafe case securely, and I also ensure they allow for a comfortable hold for long periods and are durable enough to survive drops or heavy use. I use my phone as I normally would—scrolling through social media, FaceTiming with friends, and sending texts and emails—and evaluate the grip to see if it gets in the way or makes life easier.

Anker's MagGo 610 strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and durability. If I weren't in love with the look of my PopSocket grip (see below), I'd reach for this one all the time. It's comfortable to grasp, lightweight enough that it doesn't weigh my phone down, and it looks sleek. The ring is sturdy enough to use as a kickstand in landscape mode, though it won't work in portrait orientation. It doesn't hurt that it's the cheapest MagSafe grip in this guide too.

I'm a bit of a PopSockets loyalist. I've been using them for years and bought one for my iPhone and another for my Kindle. I find it the most comfortable out of all the grips, though that could just be because I've used them for so many years. The MagSafe PopSockets are my favorite because I can pop them on and off whenever I'm using a wireless charger or when I just don't need them.

But what makes PopSockets' grips stand out is the sheer variety of designs and shapes they come in. I recommend buying through PopSockets' website directly, since you have more options to sift through. The one pictured here is the Dichroic Heart.

This is one of the most unique grips I've tested so far. The ring is more rectangular than circular, which took me a while to get used to. But ESR thought of all the details. The inner portion of the ring has a smooth, rubber lining that makes it much more comfortable to hold for longer periods. It also has a dual-joint design with two rings connected. The first acts as a grip and stand for landscape mode, but you can pull the second out to use as a portrait-mode kickstand. That ladder-like design comes in handy for FaceTime calls, especially while on the couch or at my kitchen counter. I also use it to keep my phone propped up on my desk throughout the day.

If you're not used to MagSafe grips, they can feel a little awkward, specifically when finding a secure hold. This one from Benks comes with both a ring and a grip. The ring acts as a kickstand, rotating 360 degrees, so you can switch between portrait and landscape orientation. Pop out the grip in the center, and you'll find a loop to put your finger through, allowing you to hold your phone more comfortably with one hand. The grip comes in a variety of colors and prints, complete with the option to buy a matching phone case.

MagSafe power banks are great for charging on the go wirelessly, but they can also feel unwieldy. This one comes with a grip that makes it easier to hold your phone while it's charging. It also rotates 360 degrees, so you can prop it up in portrait or landscape orientation. The magnets on the power bank are strong, so it has a durable hold too. The power bank itself has a 5,000-mAh battery and is Qi2-certified. That means it supports the latest wireless charging standard and can dish out faster wireless charging speeds. It can supply 15 watts wirelessly and 20 watts wired (via a USB-C cable). LEDs on the side show how much battery is left.

Unlike other metal grips I've tested, Casely's MagRing is made of soft silicone. I find that more comfortable on my fingers. It also has a 360-degree swivel, so you can position the grip at virtually any angle. But unlike the Anker, this one is strictly a grip, so you can't use it as a kickstand. My only gripe is that, since the grip doesn't fold in, your phone won't lie fully flat on a surface.

I also tested the MagRing+ ($30), which comes with a ring clip you can attach your keys to. That comes in handy for quick trips to the grocery store or when I go to the gym and need a place to put my car keys and key fob. But I prefer the standard MagRing, since I typically carry my keys in my pocket or my bag.

The Nissan Leaf was once the number-one selling EV in the world. Unveiled in 2009, it hit the road in 2010, beating Tesla to market as the first mass-produced EV and topping sales charts for a decade. It was a bold move, and one that should have cemented the company as one of the world's premier EV players. So what happened?

Some 15 years later, in the United States, the automaker has floundered. It didn't predict the rise of hybrids, and it's still dealing with the PR aftermath of a very public failed merger with Honda. Add in years of mismanagement and an outright neglect of its EV portfolio, and the former king of EV sales has been scrambling to find its footing. A chaotic market reeling from threats of tariffs really isn't helping.

Still, Nissan is at least attempting to claw its way back to its former glory. It has a new CEO, upcoming EVs and a hybrid for the US market, and the self-awareness to know it needs to adapt how it does business. Nissan is ready for change. Oh, and those talks with Honda aren't over yet.

“This is the heart of Nissan,” the automaker's former chief planning officer and shiny new CEO, Ivan Espinosa, tells media gathered at the Nissan Technical Center, located just outside of Yokohama in Atsugi, Japan. Notably absent from this event is outgoing CEO Makoto Uchida. This is the introduction to Espinosa as the boss—but more importantly, the automaker wants to share its plans for the future.

We're seated in a large design studio with a screen that fills an entire wall; executives address the crowd with a mix of renewed focus and humility. In an industry full of bravado, Nissan is refreshingly forthcoming about its issues.

Chief performance officer Guillaume Cartier begins the two-day event by expressing that the company would be an open book, and be honest about the external and internal issues that have plagued the brand in recent years. The Nissan/Honda merger fell apart largely due to the Nissan leadership's unwillingness to concede that in the automotive world, Nissan and Honda are not equals. This time round, there's a promise for better transparency.

The news Nissan wants everyone to now focus on is the unveiling of the third-generation Leaf. Gone is the hatchback—the Leaf has morphed into a sporty but handsome crossover. And after all, the US market loves a crossover.

Powered by Nissan's 400-volt CMF-EV platform, the Leaf will rest on the same architecture as the Ariya. Outside of smart design and repeated insistence that the team focused on efficiency, the automaker shared no information about range, battery capacity, or price. The vehicle will be available first in the United States and Canada beginning in 2025.

The new Nissan Leaf.

For Europe, the automaker unveiled a new all-electric Micra, an urban runabout that senior vice president of global design Alfonso Albaisa refers to as “charming.” The wide eyes of the Micra have returned and are now powered by electrons instead of petroleum. It's built on the CMF-B EV platform that also underpins the Renault 5 E-Tech. Like the Leaf, Nissan was silent on details about range, price, and battery capacity, but we do know that Europe will get both the Micra and Leaf in 2025.

The new Nissan Micra.

In a move that will attempt to fix its previous huge market oversight, Nissan will begin production of an all-new hybrid Rogue in 2026, while a PHEV is also in the works. The automaker's midsize SUV competes directly with the wildly popular Honda CR-V and Toyota Rav4, both of which have hybrid powertrain options.

The Rogue will use the third generation of Nissan's e-Power series hybrid technology. Unlike typical hybrids, an e-Power's wheels are only powered by the electric motor, while a specially tuned gas engine acts as a generator. The second generation of the technology is currently in use in the Nissan Qashqai, but this upcoming version combines the powerplants, gearbox, and inverter into a single 5-in-1 unit, using the same electric motor and other components found in Nissan's EV. A clever way to lower costs.

Nissan says that this system delivers the attributes of an EV—increased lower-end torque, smoother acceleration, real-time motor-based torque vectoring (Nissan calls this e-4orce), and a quieter ride. At Nissan's Granddrive test track in Yokosuka, Japan, I was able to test the second and upcoming third-generation e-Power system, and I found it compelling, and, in many cases, superior to traditional hybrid systems. Although the small 1.8-kWh-capacity battery pack means drivers will still have to endure the rumble of an engine on a regular basis, even if it is quieter.

After a keynote, Nissan led us into a courtyard to look at (but not photograph) a series of vehicles in various states of development. The most intriguing was a rugged electric SUV that oozed X-Terra vibes. The light-offroader will begin production in Nissan's Canton, Mississippi, plant in 2027, deftly escaping the latest tariffs announced by President Trump.

Nissan sees the vehicle as a way to differentiate itself from competitors. “You saw an outdoorsy EV, which is not what you see today. The reason to do that is to be different, because the market will get very crowded very fast. We want to come in with an offer that is more unique,” Espinosa says.

Sometimes, however, there is good reason why a certain category of EV “is not what you see today,” and while trying to be different is certainly laudable, it is not always advisable. We'll see soon enough if Espinosa's strategy pans out. Regardless, this Canton-built rugged electric SUV will beat Scout's offerings to market, and will go head-to-head with Rivian's R2. That is, if everything goes according to plan for both automakers.

Nissan has big plans and an intriguing upcoming lineup that, on paper, seems to give it the automotive firepower to be a true competitor in the electrified vehicle market. Bringing those proposals to fruition requires leadership willing to aggressively move forward while taking a long, hard look at the current situation and making drastic changes.

There's a tinge of frustration in Espinosa's voice as the new Nissan CEO explains the current situation with Honda. “The fact that the integration talks stopped is in no way meaning that we are not collaborating with them,” Espinosa said.

“The future of the industry is going to be very challenging, and it's clear that the name of the game is how you build efficient partnerships that add value to your company,” Espinosa told reporters during a roundtable event. For automakers, sharing a platform reduces both parties' financial commitment. Parts procurement also benefits. Suppliers will always prioritize the customer who places the largest order. If a part is used in multiple vehicles across multiple brands, it's built sooner and at a lower cost.

It's the economies of scale in action. The issue? Nissan's scale has dropped dramatically. In 2018, the automaker was producing 5.8 million units a year. Currently, that number has dropped to 3.5 million units. Its US factories are currently underutilized, and its lineup, while slowly undergoing a refresh over the past few years, in some cases still lags behind competitors. Recent moves to rectify the situation have come with their own issues.

The Ariya was a fine reboot of the automaker's electric vehicle strategy, but the vehicle itself hasn't taken off like EV offerings from other automakers. Ponz Pandikuthira, Nissan's chief planning officer for North America tells WIRED how timing hurt the vehicle's launch. As it was introduced, Tesla began cutting prices to ward off new competitors in the market, and suddenly, the Ariya was 20 percent more expensive than a similarly equipped Tesla.

The Ariya also isn't eligible for the $7,500 EV tax credit unless the vehicle is leased. Then, add in manufacturing delays of eight to ten months, and the result is a vehicle hitting the market after any hype that had been generated died down.

Pandikuthira also explains the reason behind Nissan's lack of a hybrid in the coveted midsize SUV segment. With the vehicle price increases during the Covid lockdowns, Nissan (and other automakers) believed that this was the new normal. A rise in overall vehicle value would make EVs seem more affordable at the price points an automaker would need to sell an electric vehicle at to make a profit.

Like many manufacturers, Nissan had bold plans to introduce a fleet of EVs, and at the time, to add a hybrid to its lineup would mean making one less EV. So the automaker gambled on an inflated marketplace. Suddenly, the prices of vehicles came back down to earth, and Nissan's future lineup wouldn't generate much-needed profits. It's tough to be nimble without capital.

According to Espinosa, Nissan has 1 trillion yen ($6.65 billion) in cash. The issue is that the company has $1.5 billion in debt due this year, and ​​$5.6 billion in debt due in 2026. “We're not in the situation in which we have an urgent need for cash,” Espinosa said. “What we have to work on is the free cash-flow generation, which is different. So we have to accelerate revenue generation. We have to get our sales pace in better shape, and we need to work on cost.”

A big part of that is its work to reduce development time from 55 months to 37 months. Then 30 months on each vehicle iteration based on the platform. “We need to show what we're capable of doing,” the new CEO says.

At the multiday event in Japan, Auto Pacific president and chief analyst Ed Kim tells WIRED, “One of the big takeaways I got from all this was that I don't think even Nissan knows how they're going to get there.” However, Nissan's willingness to partner with others, the introduction of a hybrid to compete with the Rav4 and CR-V, and its upcoming lineup are all good moves, Kim says. “Oftentimes, when an automaker has their backs against the wall, sometimes they pull out some of their best design work,” he adds.

But all of this meticulous planning and good intention could quickly be derailed by the chaotic financial situation in the US market. Nissan needs to win big in the United States, and the Trump administration's tariff chaos isn't helping.

“We are working on multiple scenarios to be ready when some clarity comes. It's changing every other day,” Espinosa tells WIRED. Of course, Espinosa said this mere hours before Trump announced the 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles and parts, and an even more recent 24 percent reciprocal tariff on other goods from Japan. Whether Nissan was planning for that kind of clarity is unclear.

WIRED reached out to Nissan for an update. The automaker wouldn't comment directly, but pointed us to a comment from Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a trade association that represents international automakers. “At a time when cost is the number one concern for American car buyers, US automakers are working to provide a range of affordable vehicles for consumers,” she says. “The tariffs will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.”

Sam Abuelsamid, automotive analyst and vice president of market research for Telemetry, believes these costs could hit Nissan hardest. “Of the three largest Japanese automakers operating in the US, Nissan will likely face some of the biggest challenges with the tariffs,” he says. “They only have two plants in the US and import a significant percentage of their products from either Mexico or Japan.”

Like many automakers, Nissan may spread the cost of the tariffs across its entire lineup of vehicles to keep the vehicles that are imported to the US from being prohibitively expensive—although each vehicle will soon undoubtedly cost more.

For Espinosa, in the face of such economic turmoil, the inconvenient truth is that Nissan could do everything right and still struggle because of forces beyond its control. “From a product perspective, they're definitely headed in the right direction. But the big question mark is really on the business side,” Kim says. Indeed, it's the big question for every automaker right now. Except, for Nissan, the results could be catastrophic.

Microsoft has released a browser-based, playable level of the classic video game Quake II. This functions as a tech demo for the gaming capabilities of Microsoft's Copilot AI platform — though by the company's own admission, the experience isn't quite the same as playing a well-made game.

You can try it out for yourself, using your keyboard to navigate a single level of Quake II for a couple minutes before you hit the time limit.

In a blog post describing their work, Microsoft researchers said their Muse family of AI models for video games allows users to “interact with the model through keyboard/controller actions and see the effects of your actions immediately, essentially allowing you to play inside the model.”

To show off these capabilities, the researchers trained their model on a Quake II level (which Microsoft owns through its acquisition of ZeniMax).

“Much to our initial delight we were able to play inside the world that the model was simulating,” they wrote. “We could wander around, move the camera, jump, crouch, shoot, and even blow-up barrels similar to the original game.”

At the same time, the researchers emphasized that this is meant to be “a research exploration” and should be thought of as “playing the model as opposed to playing the game.”

More specifically, they acknowledged “limitations and shortcomings,” like the fact that enemies are fuzzy, the damage and health counters can be inaccurate, and most strikingly, the model struggles with object permanence, forgetting about things that are out of view for 0.9 seconds or longer.

In the researchers' view, this can “also be a source of fun, whereby you can defeat or spawn enemies by looking at the floor for a second and then looking back up,” or even “teleport around the map by looking up at the sky and then back down.”

Writer and game designer Austin Walker was less impressed by this approach, posting a gameplay video in which he spent most of his time trapped in a dark room. (This also happened to me both times I tried to play the demo, though I'll admit I'm extremely bad at first-person shooters.)

Referring to a Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's recent statements that AI models could help with game preservation by making classic games “portable to any platform,” Walker argued this reveals “a fundamental misunderstanding of not only this tech but how games WORK.”

“The internal workings of games like Quake — code, design, 3d art, audio — produce specific cases of play, including surprising edge cases,” Walker wrote. “That is a big part of what makes games good. If you aren't actually able to rebuild the key inner workings, then you lose access to those unpredictable edge cases.”

Wouldn't this cause gravitational force to fall off with distance using something other than an inverse-square law? I think this explanation would be a better fit for the weak force than gravity for this reason. Thoughts?More broadly: inverse-square behavior (Gravity, EM etc) strikes me as an intrinsic property of 3D geometry; more so of a tell of dimensionality than the magnitude of the force. (I believe the article is inferring higher dimensionality from relative magnitude, vice distance falloff)

Think that you live on a line, and you see projections of a 2d object doing circles on top of you. You would see the shade moving and changing sizes in a non-explainable manner to you.

More anomalies: simply being near a large gravitational field alters the flow of time. Frame dragging around black holes (spacetime itself twists into a rotating spiral). The final parsec problem (co-orbiting black holes bleeding energy as gravitational waves). And don't forget the gravitational singularity of a black hole.But perhaps the most important thing to know is that we've only just gained the ability to examine gravitational waves. Once we build more detectors (especially LISA), we'll probably discover a lot more is wrong with our understanding of gravity.

> Dark radiation acts like an invisible form of light that can carry and transport energyThat is precisely what it is. It is the same phenomenon as the fact that anti-particles don't appear in our dimension of the universe, except under unusual high-energy experiments (and maybe other natural, but rare, phenomena, but IDK).Each of the six dimensions (remember that our physical dimension is but one of the six) has its own configuration of matter and energy and, while we all inhabit the same 3-space, they are effectively distinct in almost all respects, making them effectively noninteractive. Our soul, however, does interact with our physical body, where a kind of magnetic field generated by our body's energy while we are conscious keeps the soul trapped in our body's 3-space; it is released to explore the universe while we are unconscious (though most people can't do this consciously, due to their spiritual level).Except for gravity. Gravity somehow takes into consideration the sum-total of all the 6-spaces' contents, even though we basically can't see or interact with the other five. Our scientific interactions are only possible by using our instruments and energy, which are only of our dimension, and can therefore mostly only interact with its fellow components. This is why our estimations of the matter required for the inertial rotation of galaxies is that we can only account for 1/6th of the matter in the universe. That is because we can't ""see"" (or feel) the other dimensions that co-inhabit this same 3-space, but gravity does in its physical computational manifestation.

That is precisely what it is. It is the same phenomenon as the fact that anti-particles don't appear in our dimension of the universe, except under unusual high-energy experiments (and maybe other natural, but rare, phenomena, but IDK).Each of the six dimensions (remember that our physical dimension is but one of the six) has its own configuration of matter and energy and, while we all inhabit the same 3-space, they are effectively distinct in almost all respects, making them effectively noninteractive. Our soul, however, does interact with our physical body, where a kind of magnetic field generated by our body's energy while we are conscious keeps the soul trapped in our body's 3-space; it is released to explore the universe while we are unconscious (though most people can't do this consciously, due to their spiritual level).Except for gravity.

I don't know.. A hydration error is 100% an application logic error. It's not some ""slightly worse UX"". It means you are actually doing something incorrectly. I would even compare it to C++ UB.

I first saw the Aurzen Zip and I immediately said, “I want one.” It's a projector and it is small enough to fit into your back pocket, letting you turn any nearby wall into a second screen. No wires or WiFi needed. The company hails it as the “world's first tri-fold projector”. Unfortunately as cool as it looks and much as I applaud what Aurzen was going for with this minuscule projector, I think I enjoyed the idea of it more than actually using it.

The Zip's most striking feature is its tri-fold design, which is the only reason you'd consider buying it. When folded into a teeny square, it measures 3.3 x 3 x 1 inches (half the size of an iPhone) and weighs just over .6 lbs. When opened, it almost resembles a cousin of the Pixar lamp, ready to beam all your favorite YouTube videos to a surface near you. You can always keep it in a bag or jacket pocket if you ever need an impromptu screen to watch YouTube, perhaps at a campsite or inside a plane. Not that I camp, nor would I ever want to annoy other passengers by projecting game trailers onto the flight cabin, but I want to be able to.

Aurzen Zip 

The Aurzen Zip has the portability you've always wanted in a mini-projector, however it's dim brightness and cost make it hard to recommend. 

Pros

Cons

It's easy to set up. Once you connect the device to your computer or phone's screen mirroring list, you simply need to follow the onscreen directions. Mirroring content from your phone has little to no latency. I could watch Mets spring training games on the wall near my desk, to the dismay of all the Yankee fans in our office. A more relatable use was having my toddler watch a few Ms. Rachel videos projected onto the ceiling before bedtime, which was a hit until it ran out of battery.

There was a bit of latency when I attempted to use it as a second screen for the iMac and PC. It's more noticeable when you see someone speak in a video that you can see that it's slightly out of sync by a few milliseconds.

Aside from YouTube and Twitch, many streaming apps like Max and Netflix do not support screen mirroring on phones and computers. It's not the Zip's fault; many streaming platforms have draconian DRM restrictions regarding specific external displays. You'd have the same problem if you tried using Apple AirPlay from your iPhone onto a smart TV. So, if that is a deal breaker, consider a mini-projector with built-in Google TV, like the Nebula Capsule Air. It won't fit in your backpack, but it's still small enough to travel with.

See at Amazon

The Zip is 100 lumens, which is incredibly dim for a projector, no matter the size. So you'll need more or less complete darkness to watch anything comfortably. You can see the difference in picture quality below when the lights are on and off in our studio. If there is too much light, the image is washed out, and you can hardly see anything.

Two to four feet from the wall is the sweet spot for this projector. That gives about 30-40 inches of screen size. At around five or six feet, you can project around 70 inches. The only problem is the further you get, the more you're sacrificing screen clarity and brightness.

After using it for over a couple of weeks, I still can't believe how loud this thing is for something so small. Almost immediately after you turn it on, the tiny fans inside the Zip start working overtime, tending to overpower the pair of underpowered 1W built-in speakers. Even at its highest volume setting, you can always hear the fans.

The battery life isn't great either; even at 100 lumens, you're getting just around 45 minutes of battery life under Turbo mode and just over an hour on Eco mode. The only difference I've seen between the two modes is that the Eco mode dims the screen even more to conserve battery. So if you're stuck in a blackout it could theoretically be handy but for anything else its a novelty more than useful.

Really what the Aurzen Zip has going for it is that its tiny and portable. It is by far the most portable projector I've used. I appreciate the novel design and its incredibly easy use. It's just that the lackluster battery, poor sound, and low brightness make it hard to justify the high asking price.

See at Amazon

The Aurzen Zip will launch in April for $400, but you can pre-order it now for $250.

Forget chalky freeze-dried ice cream or some individually packaged mashed potatoes. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station have now proved that delectable fermented delicacies like the Japanese soybean paste known as miso can be prepared in space.

This might sound like a big deal only to ISS residents who are craving some better meals, but it could have major implications for more ambitious space missions. One of the major issues with planning such voyages, which could include future trips to Mars, is the problem of keeping astronauts fed for extended periods of time. Being able to ferment their own ingredients could not only help with nutrition—it could also provide some much-needed joy and comfort in the form of delicious meals.

The road to this culinary breakthrough started in March 2020, when an international team of food scientists sent a package containing a mixture of soybeans, rice kōji, and salt up to the ISS. Once it arrived, the astronauts aboard were tasked with running an experiment to see if the mixture would ferment, producing the tasty paste we know and love.

We Finally Saw That Missing Space Tomato and Wish We Hadn't

The researchers who created the mixture described their reasons for picking miso in the journal iScience. Miso is experiencing a surge of interest within the food science community due to the “the diversity and uniqueness of miso microbial communities,” the researchers wrote. Other reasons were based more on practicality, as the paste's “firm, solid structure” reduced the chances of leaks (a major concern in the sensitive ISS environment), and the timeframe to ferment miso fit into the 30 days they had to run the experiment. Miso was also ideal thanks to its strong taste and high nutritional value.

After 30 days, the now-fermented miso was returned to Earth, where its chemical and microbial composition was analyzed. The miso was also checked for potentially harmful microbes, and, of course, for taste.

There were some doubts as to whether the experiment would succeed. After all, the environment on the ISS has some key differences from Earth. There's the microgravity, but also the presence of increased levels of radiation. Both could have interfered with the fermentation process.

Those fears, thankfully, were unfounded. However, despite the successful fermentation, when the researchers compared the space-made miso to samples created on Earth, they did find some differences. The ratios of various kinds of microbes were different, though they did conclude that the ISS miso was still, in fact, a miso.

“There are some features of the space environment in low Earth orbit—in particular microgravity and increased radiation—that could have impacts on how microbes grow and metabolize and thus how fermentation works,” said Joshua D. Evans, senior researcher and group leader at Technical University of Denmark's Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, in a press release. “We wanted to explore the effects of these conditions.”

Astronauts Need a Better Diet, Scientists Say

Now, for what you really want to know: How did the space miso taste?

“The ISS miso exhibits some clear sensory differences compared with the Earth misos,” the scientists admitted in the paper, namely boasting a higher level of “roasted” and “nutty” aromas that affected the flavor.

The findings are the latest example of how far space food has come since John Glenn became the first human to eat in space in 1962 (he partially consumed a tube of applesauce). In recent years, produce such as lettuce has been grown (and eaten) aboard the ISS. NASA has even made developing new food technologies into a competition.

While missions to Mars and beyond are still years away from feasibility, figuring out how to keep astronauts fed without filling the entire spacecraft with snacks remains a logistical issue to be solved. This little bit of fermented, nutty miso could go a long way—literally.

Will this cable unlock high refresh 8K gaming?

The Shenzhen 8K UHD Video Industry Cooperation Alliance, a group made up of more than 50 Chinese companies, just released a new wired media communication standard called the General Purpose Media Interface or GPMI. This standard was developed to support 8K and reduce the number of cables required to stream data and power from one device to another. According to HKEPC, the GPMI cable comes in two flavors — a Type-B that seems to have a proprietary connector and a Type-C that is compatible with the USB-C standard.

Because 8K has four times the number of pixels of 4K and 16 times more pixels than 1080p resolution, it means that GPMI is built to carry a lot more data than other current standards. There are other variables that can impact required bandwidth, of course, such as color depth and refresh rate. The GPMI Type-C connector is set to have a maximum bandwidth of 96 Gbps and deliver 240 watts of power. This is more than double the 40 Gbps data limit of USB4 and Thunderbolt 4, allowing you to transmit more data on the cable. However, it has the same power limit as that of the latest USB Type-C connector using the Extended Power Range (EPR) standard.

GPMI Type-B beats all other cables, though, with its maximum bandwidth of 192 Gbps and power delivery of up to 480 watts. While still not a level where you can use it to power your RTX 5090 gaming PC through your 8K monitor, it's still more than enough for many gaming laptops with a high-end discrete graphics. This will simplify the desk setup of people who prefer a portable gaming computer, since you can use one cable for both power and data. Aside from that, the standard also supports a universal control standard like HDMI-CEC, meaning you can use one remote control for all appliances that connect via GPMI and use this feature.

The only widely used video transmission standards that also deliver power right now are USB Type-C (Alt DP/Alt HDMI) and Thunderbolt connections. However, this is mostly limited to monitors, with many TVs still using HDMI. If GPMI becomes widely available, we'll soon be able to use just one cable to build our TV and streaming setup, making things much simpler.

FOSS unites Red and Green.

In a surprising turn of events, an Nvidia engineer pushed a fix to the Linux kernel, resolving a performance regression seen on AMD integrated and dedicated GPU hardware (via Phoronix). Turns out, the same engineer inadvertently introduced the problem in the first place with a set of changes to the kernel last week, attempting to increase the PCI BAR space to more than 10TiB. This ended up incorrectly flagging the GPU as limited and hampering performance, but thankfully it was quickly picked up and fixed.

In the open-source paradigm, it's an unwritten rule to fix what you break. The Linux kernel is open-source and accepts contributions from everyone, which are then reviewed. Responsible contributors are expected to help fix issues that arise from their changes. So, despite their rivalry in the GPU market, FOSS (Free Open Source Software) is an avenue that bridges the chasm between AMD and Nvidia.



The regression was caused by a commit that was intended to increase the PCI BAR space beyond 10TiB, likely for systems with large memory spaces. This indirectly reduced a factor called KASLR entropy on consumer x86 devices, which determines the randomness of where the kernel's data is loaded into memory on each boot for security purposes. At the same time, this also artificially inflated the range of the kernel's accessible memory (direct_map_physmem_end), typically to 64TiB.

In Linux, memory is divided into different zones, one of which is the zone device that can be associated with a GPU. The problem here is that when the kernel would initialize zone device memory for Radeon GPUs, an associated variable (max_pfn) that represents the total addressable RAM by the kernel would artificially increase to 64TiB.

Since the GPU likely cannot access the entire 64TiB range, it would flag dma_addressing_limited() as True. This variable essentially restricts the GPU to use the DMA32 zone, which offers only 4GB of memory and explains the performance regressions.

The good news is that this fix should be implemented as soon as the pull request lands, right before the Linux 6.15-rc1 merge window closes today. With a general six to eight week cadence before new Linux kernels, we can expect the stable 6.15 release to be available around late May or early June.

Melting occurs despite Corsair's first-party 600W 12VHPWR cable being used.

Another Blackwell GPU bites the dust, as the meltdown reaper has reportedly struck a Redditor's MSI GeForce RTX 5090 Gaming Trio OC, with the impact tragically extending to the power supply as well. Ironically, the user avoided third-party cables and specifically used the original power connector, the one that was supplied with the PSU, yet both sides of the connector melted anyway.

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs face an inherent design flaw where all six 12V pins are internally tied together. The GPU has no way of knowing if all cables are seated properly, preventing it from balancing the power load. In the worst-case scenario, five of the six pins may lose contact, resulting in almost 500W (41A) being drawn from a single pin. Given that PCI-SIG originally rated these pins for a maximum of 9.5A, this is a textbook fire/meltdown risk.

The GPU we're looking at today is the MSI RTX 5090 Gaming Trio OC, which, on purchase, set the Redditor back a hefty $2,900. That's still a lot better than the average price of an RTX 5090 from sites like eBay, currently sitting around $4,000. Despite using Corsair's first-party 600W 12VHPWR cable, the user was left with a melted GPU-side connector, a fate which extended to the PSU.

The damage, in the form of a charred contact point, is quite visible and clearly looks as if excess current was drawn from one specific pin, corresponding to the same design flaw mentioned above. The user is weighing an RMA for their GPU and PSU, but a GPU replacement is quite unpredictable due to persistent RTX 50 series shortages. Sadly, these incidents are still rampant despite Nvidia's assurances before launch.

With the onset of enablement drivers (R570) for Blackwell, both RTX 50 and RTX 40 series GPUs began suffering from instability and crashes. Despite multiple patches from Nvidia, RTX 40 series owners haven't seen a resolution and are still reliant on reverting to older 560-series drivers. Moreover, Nvidia's decision to discontinue 32-bit OpenCL and PhysX support with RTX 50 series GPUs has left the fate of many legacy applications and games in limbo.

As of now, the only foolproof method to secure your RTX 50 series GPU is to ensure optimal current draw through each pin. You might want to consider Asus' ROG Astral GPUs as they can provide per-pin current readings, a feature that's absent in reference RTX 5090 models. Alternatively, if feeling adventurous, maybe develop your own power connector with built-in safety measures and per-pen sensing capabilities?

AMD processors were instrumental in achieving a new world record during a recent Ansys Fluent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation run on the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). According to a press release by Ansys, it ran a 2.2-billion-cell axial turbine simulation for Baker Hughes, an energy technology company, testing its next-generation gas turbines aimed at increasing efficiency. The simulation previously took 38.5 hours to complete on 3,700 CPU cores. By using 1,024 AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators paired with AMD EPYC CPUs in Frontier, the simulation time was slashed to 1.5 hours. This is more than 25 times faster, allowing the company to see the impact of the changes it makes on designs much more quickly.

A new supercomputing record has been set!Ansys, @bakerhughesco, and @ORNL have run the largest-ever commercial #CFD simulation using 2.2 billion cells and 1,024 @AMD Instinct GPUs on the world's first exascale supercomputer. The result? A 96% reduction in simulation run…April 4, 2025

Frontier was once the fastest supercomputer in the world, and it was also the first one to break into exascale performance. It replaced the Summit supercomputer, which was decommissioned in November 2024. However, the El Capitan supercomputer, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, broke Frontier's record at around the same time. Both Frontier and El Capitan are powered by AMD GPUs, with the former boasting 9,408 AMD EPYC processors and 37,632 AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators. On the other hand, the latter uses 44,544 AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators.

Given those numbers, the Ansys Fluent CFD simulator apparently only used a fraction of the power available on Frontier. That means it has the potential to run even faster if it can utilize all the available accelerators on the supercomputer. It also shows that, despite Nvidia's market dominance in AI GPUs, AMD remains a formidable competitor, with its CPUs and GPUs serving as the brains of some of the fastest supercomputers on Earth.

“By scaling high-fidelity CFD simulation software to unprecedented levels with the power of AMD Instinct GPUs, this collaboration demonstrates how cutting-edge supercomputing can solve some of the toughest engineering challenges, enabling breakthroughs in efficiency, sustainability, and innovation,” said Brad McCredie, AMD Senior Vice President for Data Center Engineering.

Even though AMD can deliver top-tier performance at a much cheaper price than Nvidia, many AI data centers prefer Team Green because of software issues with AMD's hardware.

One high-profile example was Tiny Corp's TinyBox system, which had problems with instability with its AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards. The problem was so bad that Dr. Lisa Su had to step in to fix the issues. And even though it was purportedly fixed, the company still released two versions of the TinyBox AI accelerator — one powered by AMD and the other by Nvidia. Tiny Corp also recommended the more expensive Team Green version, with its six RTX 4090 GPUs, because of its driver quality.

If Team Red can fix the software support on its great hardware, then it could likely get more customers for its chips and get a more even footing with Nvidia in the AI GPU market.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (April 5, 2025) -- The U.S. Women's National Team defeated Brazil 2-0 as Trinity Rodman scored early and team captain Lindsey Heaps clinched the game with a second half penalty kick. Rodman was playing her first USWNT match since the 2024 Paris Olympics and picked up right where she left off, scoring in the sixth minute off a precise assist from fellow forward Alyssa Thompson.

Backed by some excellent U.S. defending and a debut shutout for goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Heaps effectively clinched the match with a goal in the 66th from the penalty spot. Midfielder Lily Yohannes, who came on in the 61st minute, drew the foul in the penalty box just minutes after substituting for Ally Sentnor.

The Americans were aggressive on the attack from the very start. In the first half, they tested Brazilian goalkeeper Lorena with five shots on goal and seven attempts. The Americans finished with 12 shots on goal.

The two Olympic finalists brought a competitive energy and bite to the match which saw six yellow cards shown, four to Brazil and two to the Americans.

The match was played in front of 32,303 fans at SoFi Stadium and marked the first-ever women's professional sporting event at the world-class stadium, which featured a grass system that was being tested for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It was the second largest crowd in the Los Angeles area for the U.S. Women's National Team, not counting the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl.

The 28-year-old Tullis-Joyce had a sparkling debut, becoming the 10th goalkeeper in U.S. history to earn a shutout. She becomes the 16th player to earn a first cap under head coach Emma Hayes. Defender Avery Patterson came on at the end of the match and became the 17th. Tullis-Joyce is the 274th player to earn a cap for the USWNT, now in its 40th year of existence, and Patterson became the 275th.

Next up, the USWNT faces Brazil in the second of the two-match series, meeting at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. on Tuesday, April 8, 2025 (7:30 p.m. PT / 10:30 p.m. ET on TBS, Max, Universo and Peacock).

USA — Trinity Rodman (Alyssa Thompson), 6th minute - After a nifty move to beat the defender cutting in from the left side, Thompson found a cutting Rodman in the penalty box with a perfect pass. Rodman then calmly finished into the lower right corner with her fight foot from 10 yards out. USA 1, BRA 0

USA — Lindsey Heaps (Penalty Kick), 67th minute - Lily Yohannes was chopped down near the top of the penalty box and referee Katia Gacia immediately pointed to the spot. The veteran then blasted her shot into the left corner of the net despite Brazilian ‘keeper Lorena guessing correctly. USA 2, BRA 0

Former Bolles School midfielder Avery Patterson made her first career appearance for the U.S. women's national soccer team in Saturday's 2-0 victory over Brazil.

Patterson, in her second year of professional competition with the Houston Dash of the National Women's Soccer League, entered the game as an 88th-minute substitute replacing Emily Fox at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif.

In high school, she helped Bolles to Florida High School Athletic Association championships in 2018, 2019 and 2020, earning All-First Coast recognition.

Patterson played college soccer at the University of North Carolina, scoring twice in the 2022 NCAA final against UCLA. Houston selected her at No. 13 overall in the 2024 NWSL Draft.

This year, she has appeared three times for the NWSL club, lining up more frequently as a wingback on the outside rather than in her more attacking Bolles role.

NWSL

Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang is investing an additional $25 million in U.S. Soccer for the development and research of women's soccer via the federation's Soccer Forward Foundation.

This marks Kang's second financial pledge to the federation in five months. The founder and CEO of Kynisca, a women's sports organization based in London that aims to advance research and development of women's soccer, shared the announcement alongside U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson on Friday at the SheBelieves Summit in Los Angeles. The move is part of a larger initiative to integrate the current operations of Kynisca Innovation Hub into Soccer Forward.

Kang's latest investment builds on a $30 million pledge made last November to be used by the federation over the next five years. As the largest donation toward women's and girls' programs in U.S. Soccer's 111-year history, it is intended to grow competitive opportunities for youth soccer players, improve talent identification mechanisms and champion the professional development of female players, coaches and referees.

In the last three years, Kang has made increasingly splashy moves as a major investor in women's soccer in the U.S. and Europe. She became the majority owner of the Washington Spirit in 2022, expanding her club portfolio to the London City Lionesses in December 2023 and the eight-time Champions League winners Olympique Lyonnais Feminin in February 2024 to build the first multi-club model in women's soccer.

“This integration represents a major step forward in advancing research and setting new standards for women's sports,” Kang said. “By working together, we are ensuring that players at all levels benefit from innovative insights and best practices. Women's soccer is experiencing historic growth, but there's still work to be done to break down systemic barriers and secure the investment needed for female athletes.”

According to the release, the new partnership will run through two major channels of focus: research and solutions-oriented initiatives toward positive health outcomes in women's sports and the implementation of best practice standards to guide women's soccer performances and grow the game globally.

U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone said that by “integrating Kynisca Innovation Hub talent into Soccer Forward, we can drive real change through research-backed standards that support players at every level.”

USA defender Trinity Rodman (2) celebrates scoring her team's first goal during a friendly against Brazil at Sofi Stadium on Saturday, April 5, 2025, in Inglewood, California.

LOS ANGELES (TNS)— Saturday's women's soccer friendly between the U.S. and Brazil was billed as a rematch of last summer's Olympic final. That was a bit of a misnomer since two-thirds of the women on the 23-player U.S. roster weren't in Paris last August.

Even the uniforms weren't the same.

The U.S. Women's National Team secured a 2-0 win in the first of two friendlies against Brazil on Saturday.

The last time the two sides met, the U.S. took gold after winning 1-0 in the 2024 Olympic final. This rematch also marked the first time a professional women's sports event was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., drawing a crowd of 32,303.

The starting lineup consisted of Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the net, and Emily Fox, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett, and Crystal Dunn holding the backline. Ally Sentnor, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Heaps took the midfield with Rodman and Alyssa Thompson playing further up, and Catarina Macario taking the striker role.

Goalkeeper Tullis-Joyce and defender Avery Patterson both earned their first caps for the national team.

The U.S started off well with Rodman slotting in a goal at the 5th minute. Alyssa Thompson gave the assist after running down the midfield and dropping her defender, then sending the ball down the middle to meet Rodman's run into the box.

“I'm excited to get more towards the goal and to have those explosive runs, to have quick finishes rather than having to create by myself every time,” Rodman said after the match, which also marked her return to the national team since the Olympic final.

Thompson was a standout throughout the game, creating chances, dropping defenders, and getting several shots on goal.

Though the Brazilian team's attacking plays and early pressure tested the U.S. midfield and defense, which seemed disjointed at times, the Americans won 55.5% of duels. Both teams showed their physicality, with the U.S. drawing 15 fouls and Brazil drawing 18.

Shortly after subbing in at the second half, Lily Yohannes drew a penalty at the 64th minute. Heaps converted the penalty, doubling the USWNT's lead.

Tullis-Joyce was visibly excited following the game. The Manchester United keeper made six saves and earned her first clean sheet in her debut.

“I'm really lucky to have such an incredible team, like it's the U.S. Women's National Team,” she said. “It's crazy that I'm wearing this crest right now.”

Head Coach Emma Hayes said the team needs to work on keeping possession, as well as figuring out whether they should be quick in the final third or recycle the ball.

“We're not afraid to back press, we're not afraid to go player-for-player in situations, but we need to be a little more decisive in the decision-making and execution of things,” she said.

Hayes has emphasized these games and upcoming camps will focus on experimentation and developing the less experienced players. She will need to drip-feed the younger players into the games as to not set them up for failure, she said Friday. 

The U.S. will play Brazil again on Tuesday, April 8 in San Jose, Calif.

The United States women's national team improved to 34 wins, 3 losses, and 5 draws all-time against Brazil in a 2024 Paris Olympics Gold Medal rematch at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Trinity Rodman and Lindsay Heaps led the way with two goals in a tight and physical match-up. 

The headline-grabbing performance. The pink braids. The social media-primed goal celebration. The dogged defensive work. The radiant charisma. Trinity Rodman is officially back in the spotlight after an eight-month layoff from the USWNT due to a nagging back injury. Rodman wasted no time in delighting the rapturous crowd of over 32,303 fans in her former Southern California stomping grounds as she tucked away a tidy goal in just the fifth minute of action. It was Rodman's first goal for either club or country in over six months as she is still being carefully incorporated back into her Washington Spirit side. Before the game, Emma Hayes stated she “missed [her] as a person first and foremost” and praised the 22-year-old for bringing a sense of lightness and energy to the squad. It's safe to say Rodman will see her name in lights once again.

During the match commentary, Julie Foudy likened the USWNT's goalkeeping position to an open audition. Tullis-Joyce certainly merits a call back off based on her debut appearance. The Manchester United goalkeeper secured a clean sheet with six saves in a remarkably jitter-free performance. She appeared calm and composed, while also being appropriately reactive to a variety of shots from a vigorous Brazil side. Several candidates (including Jane Campbell, Mandy McGlynn, and Angelina Anderson) are in the running to fill the goalkeeping vacuum left by long-time servant Alyssa Naeher. Tullis-Joyce made a positive first impression.   

Crystal Dunn earned her first National Team cap at left-back in March 2013 and has had the position on lock since. Dunn is a famously versatile player and former forward who has since been a mainstay on the U.S. backline. The 32-year-old started every match at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and the 2024 Paris Olympics. Jenna Nighswonger is the only other player to have started at left-back in the Hayes era and was not called into this camp. Dunn had a tenacious defensive display Saturday afternoon and also combined harmoniously with Alyssa Thompson in the attack. Might Dunn make a run of four consecutive major international tournaments? 

With just under 27 months until the kickoff of the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup, Emma Hayes' favored lineup and system are still under construction. She has the luxury of time. It is the inverse of her introduction to the job, in which she helped steer her side to an Olympic gold medal after just 10 matches. Several USWNT stalwarts are absent from these two friendlies due to either injury (Tierna Davidson), maternity leave (Sophia Wilson), or personal reasons (Mallory Swanson). Several players who were not involved in the 2024 Paris Olympics now find themselves with a chance to make a lasting impression on Hayes.

Alyssa Thompson continues to be in outstanding form for both club and country. She started in a slightly deeper role on Saturday and impacted the match as a playmaker with her zippy runs and quick combinations from the left flank. Thompson assisted Rodman's goal with a terrific pass after an incisive run. Ally Sentnor also found herself in a deeper role as a number 10, perhaps due in part to her propensity for outside-the-box shots. Sentnor is still trying to find her feet as a starter for the Utah Royals and senior USWNT. Center-back Tara McKeown managed some nervy moments against Brazil's pacey forwards with coolness. Teenage sensation Lilly Yohannes made a quick impact off the bench with her perfectly calibrated slipped balls and prophetic vision. She also craftily won her side a penalty kick. Second-half substitutes Michelle Cooper and Yazmeen Ryan looked bright and generated goal-scoring opportunities. Wing-back Avery Patterson earned her maiden cap in the 87th minute.

Hayes has promised experimentation, and we will certainly see further tinkering when these two teams reunite on Tuesday night in San Jose, Calif.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (April 5, 2025) -- The U.S. Women's National Team defeated Brazil 2-0 as Trinity Rodman scored early and team captain Lindsey Heaps clinched the game with a second half penalty kick. Rodman was playing her first USWNT match since the 2024 Paris Olympics and picked up right where she left off, scoring in the sixth minute off a precise assist from fellow forward Alyssa Thompson.

Backed by some excellent U.S. defending and a debut shutout for goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Heaps effectively clinched the match with a goal in the 66th from the penalty spot. Midfielder Lily Yohannes, who came on in the 61st minute, drew the foul in the penalty box just minutes after substituting for Ally Sentnor.

The Americans were aggressive on the attack from the very start. In the first half, they tested Brazilian goalkeeper Lorena with five shots on goal and seven attempts. The Americans finished with 12 shots on goal.

The two Olympic finalists brought a competitive energy and bite to the match which saw six yellow cards shown, four to Brazil and two to the Americans.

The match was played in front of 32,303 fans at SoFi Stadium and marked the first-ever women's professional sporting event at the world-class stadium, which featured a grass system that was being tested for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It was the second largest crowd in the Los Angeles area for the U.S. Women's National Team, not counting the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl.

The 28-year-old Tullis-Joyce had a sparkling debut, becoming the 10th goalkeeper in U.S. history to earn a shutout. She becomes the 16th player to earn a first cap under head coach Emma Hayes. Defender Avery Patterson came on at the end of the match and became the 17th. Tullis-Joyce is the 274th player to earn a cap for the USWNT, now in its 40th year of existence, and Patterson became the 275th.

Next up, the USWNT faces Brazil in the second of the two-match series, meeting at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. on Tuesday, April 8, 2025 (7:30 p.m. PT / 10:30 p.m. ET on TBS, Max, Universo and Peacock).

USA — Trinity Rodman (Alyssa Thompson), 6th minute - After a nifty move to beat the defender cutting in from the left side, Thompson found a cutting Rodman in the penalty box with a perfect pass. Rodman then calmly finished into the lower right corner with her fight foot from 10 yards out. USA 1, BRA 0

USA — Lindsey Heaps (Penalty Kick), 67th minute - Lily Yohannes was chopped down near the top of the penalty box and referee Katia Gacia immediately pointed to the spot. The veteran then blasted her shot into the left corner of the net despite Brazilian ‘keeper Lorena guessing correctly. USA 2, BRA 0

Keep the change, ya filthy animal!

FIFA's inaugural attempt at the Club World Cup has been met with derision and skepticism at every turn. Following the thought process of the Nations League, FIFA decided to convert the boring preseason friendlies into competitive matches. FIFA engaged big clubs like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Manchester City to headline the event hosted by the United States.

Knowing no other alternative strategies, FIFA chose to incentivize the participating clubs with the obvious solution: Greed.

“There's a lot of money at stake,” said Bayern legend Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. “We've had quite big contract extensions recently. If you have the chance to earn a lot of money at a tournament, you should take the chance.”

Rummenigge was famously sold by Bayern to Inter Milan in 1984 for an unprecedented €5.7M transfer fee. Rummenigge never won another trophy but Bayern used the funds to reinvigorate the squad and win five of the next six Bundesliga titles plus a DFB-Pokal trophy.

It is fair to assume that Rummenigge believes he would have shared in that success if money, or lack thereof, was not an issue for Bayern at the time. 

Looking for more thoughts on Bayern Munich's ongoing situation with Thomas Müller? Then check out the latest edition of Bavarian Podcast Works! The beloved veteran is apparently OUT despite wanting to return next season...why might that be? Oh, and Hiroki Itō is injured too and could be out for the season. The vibes are bad. Can the Bavarians rally or will it become a distraction? We talk about all that and more...tune in below!

Manchester City will go into this summer's FIFA Club World Cup still as one of the favourites despite a disappointing season by their ridiculously high standards. 

Pep Guardiola's men can still boast of being Premier League champions for four consecutive seasons, and they are still the current holders of the Club World Cup, having won the competition in 2023. 

DAZN  is the only place to watch every match of the Club World Cup live and for free - download the free app now for smart TV's, smartphones, streaming devices and games consoles to start watching.

DAZN News   has everything you need to know about Manchester City. 

One of the big two in Manchester, City and neighbours United split the famous city.

Since their big-money takeover, the blue half have gone from being ‘noisy neighbours' to being the region's dominant force.

Members of St. Mark's Church of England, West Gorton, Manchester, founded the football club that would become known as Manchester City for largely humanitarian purposes.

Two churchwardens sought to curb local gang violence and alcoholism by instituting new activities for local men, whilst high unemployment plagued East Manchester.

They became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and finally Manchester City in 1894.

Manchester City's Premier League win in 2024 made them the first side in English football history to ever win four league championships in a row, cementing their dominace of English football that started with the takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008. 

Their investment moved Manchester City onto the elite table of clubs in England and has seen them go on to win eight league titles since 2012, as well as nine domestic cups and their Champions League win in 2023 - one third of a historic treble. 

They are also the current holders of the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The likes of Colin Bell and Franny Lee were City heroes of the '60s and '70s, but the modern stars and their achievements have eclipsed that era as legends of the club. 

City's struggles haven't stopped the striking Viking, as has broken the thirty-goal barrier in all competitions for a third season in a row. 

2025 may not have been Pep's year, but football is still Pep's playground. 

No manager has revolutionised the game like the Spaniard, and he'll be heading into this year's FIFA Club World Cup looking to win the competition for a FOURTH time. 

Manchester CIty are one of twelve European teams competing in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and qualify as one of the last three winners of the UEFA Champions League.

The Citiziens were victorious in the 2023 showpiece, where they earned a 1-0 victory over Inter Milan thanks to a goal from Rodri in Istanbul, Turkey.

Manchester City have been drawn into Group G, alongside Juventus, Al Ain and Wydad.

Brentford boss Thomas Frank insists he will take zero interest in the Club World Cup in the summer. The Dane labelled the tournament “ridiculous” after his side drew with Chelsea, who will take part in the competition.

Chelsea and Manchester City are the Premier League teams taking part in the expanded Club World Cup. Thirty-two teams are travelling to the United States in the summer to compete in a similar format to the international World Cup. Its previous incarnation saw seven teams compete in a much shorter tournament each December. The new Club World Cup will take place every four years and see teams share a lucrative £774million prize pot.

However, there have been criticisms of the tournament. The main argument is that it provides yet another event in an already packed schedule for players. Brentford head coach Frank is not convinced by its merits and says he will snub it. The 51-year-old pointedly suggested that he will instead ""enjoy summer"".

Frank called the Club World Cup “ridiculous” before adding: ""Who wants it? I won't watch it, I will enjoy summer, no chance.""

According to the Guardian, the BBC and ITV have declined to bid for the right to broadcast the Club World Cup. Both will show the Women's European Championship, with the Club World Cup starting two days before the quarter-finals. Sky Sports and TNT Sports, the main subscription channels for sport in the UK, showed no interest. It has reportedly left FIFA 'increasingly concerned' about the visibility of its new tournament in a key market.

Streaming platform Dazn agreed to pay £787m ($1billion) for global Club World Cup rights in a deal which involved the company pledging to make all 63 matches available free-to-air on its app. DAZN have also agreed to sublicense the tournament to bigger broadcasters in key territories.

Frank's comments came on a day when Frank's Brentford faced a Chelsea starting 11 which did not feature Cole Palmer. Enzo Maresca made five changes and blamed his decision on the scheduling of the match, which came less than 72 hours after the Blues beat Tottenham on Thursday night.

The Italian said: ""You know, we said many times that when it's a transition game, it's demanding, physicality demanding. So Tottenham was more transition than compared to today, for instance. But at this stage I think 24 hours make the difference.""

If Palmer plays in each of Chelsea's seven remaining Premier League games and the west Londoners reach the World World Cup final, the 22-year-old will have played in 51 matches for club and country this season.

KANSAS CITY, Kan. (KCTV) - With 431 days remaining until the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off, Kansas City took center stage at Children's Mercy Park Saturday night —   
 not just for a soccer showdown between Sporting KC and St. Louis City SC, but for a major unveiling that highlights the city's upcoming role as a World Cup host.

More than 100 local designers contributed their talents to a project that will help define Kansas City's identity during the global tournament.

At halftime, fans in the Cauldron supporters' section raised a massive version of the final design, revealing the winning artwork titled “Woven Together”, created by Columbia, Missouri native and Kansas City transplant Jadie Arnett.

“My cheeks are sore from smiling so much,” Arnett said.

Her artwork pays homage to the unique duality of the city that straddles two states—Kansas and Missouri.

The halftime reveal was followed by a 2-0 victory for Sporting KC, their first win of the season, perhaps a hopeful sign for what the city might achieve as a World Cup host.

Arnett, who has embraced Kansas City as her own, infused the poster with cultural nods intended to welcome the world and share what makes the metro special.

“My personal little favorite Easter egg is the barbecue sauce bottle because I will fight to the death that Kansas City has best barbecue,” Arnett said. “I'm so excited for people to come try it when they come see, you know, the FIFA games here.”

Soccer fans eager to own a piece of Kansas City's World Cup legacy can find more information and purchase the poster through the official website.

France football great Marcel Desailly does not feel that visa issues relating to entering the United States will have any impact on the 2026 FIFA World Cup as ""sport is above all these"". The 2026 World Cup is being co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19. The United States will host 78 matches, while Canada and Mexico will each stage 13 games in the 48-team tournament. There has been fear that the long visa appointment wait time combined with harsher regulations implemented by new president Donald Trump could make it more difficult for football fans to make it to the US for the World Cup.

But Desailly, a member of France's 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2000 Euro winnings teams, said previous editions of the showpiece had succeeded despite having ""bigger problems than a few visa issues."" ""Honestly, no,"" said Desailly when asked if Trump's policies on tariffs and visas could affect the next World Cup.

""Sport is above that. We've had World Cups in places with bigger problems than a few visa issues,"" he said during a virtual interaction ahead of Laureus World Sports Awards to be held in Madrid on April 21.

""Look at Qatar (2022)! So much criticism before the tournament. People said 'It won't work'. But it worked. It was a fantastic tournament. The organisation, the safety, the atmosphere — all top level."" Desailly, a Laureus World Sports Academy member, is banking on the unifying power of sport in a diverse world.

""Football unites people. I believe the next World Cup, even with politics in the background, will still be a celebration. That's what sport does."" The 56-year-old Desailly, who last played for France in 2004, said winning the 1998 World Cup changed his life and united his country.

""Everything... it changed my life. When we won, France became one country. Not Black France, not White France - just France. People were in the streets, hugging, crying, celebrating together. For once, football showed us our power to unite.

""And that legacy? It led to the Women's World Cup getting more attention. It inspired kids. It proved that football could lead social change."" He also won the UEFA Champions League title with French side Marseille and Italian club AC Milan.

Asked which team is the favourite to win the Champions League this year, Desailly said, ""Bayern Munich always has the tools to surprise you. But me, I think Barcelona look strong. They're back to their DNA - youth, flair, passing, belief.

""And honestly, I love when it's not always the same clubs. Let's see different teams winning. It keeps football alive. Competition is good. And when clubs from different countries reach the top, it inspires others."" On the significance of Laureus World Sports Awards, he said, ""It's more than just an awards show. It's not about who scored the most goals or lifted the biggest trophy last year. It's about what sport can do beyond the pitch.

""Most of us are retired. We've had our moment. But Laureus gives us another role - to give back. We go into communities, we work with kids who are struggling, and we use sport to help them find direction.

""They might not all become champions, but they learn discipline, teamwork, confidence. That's what Laureus is about. And it brings us together, even across different sports. Boxing, athletics, tennis, football - we're one family again.""

USA defender Trinity Rodman (2) celebrates scoring her team's first goal during a friendly against Brazil at Sofi Stadium on Saturday, April 5, 2025, in Inglewood, California.

LOS ANGELES (TNS)— Saturday's women's soccer friendly between the U.S. and Brazil was billed as a rematch of last summer's Olympic final. That was a bit of a misnomer since two-thirds of the women on the 23-player U.S. roster weren't in Paris last August.

Even the uniforms weren't the same.

        The FIFA Men's World Cup is fast approaching, and Toronto's downtown stadium, which will host six tournament matches, is undergoing a nearly $150 million upgrade.

The City of Toronto has announced plans to expand BMO Field – a city-owned venue operated by Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment (MLSE) – to transform it into a world-class facility ready to welcome the globe's biggest football event. The city will invest $123 million, while MLSE will contribute an additional $23 million.

The stadium's capacity will be increased from around 30,000 to 45,000 seats with the addition of 17,000 temporary seats on the north and south sides, in order to meet FIFA's hosting standards. Permanent upgrades include the installation of four new video boards, modernized locker rooms, lighting, sound and broadcast systems, as well as improved stadium Wi-Fi. A rooftop terrace and new VIP boxes for 1,000 fans will be built on the north side, while a new club lounge will be located on the west side, along the midfield line. The pitch itself will also be upgraded to meet elite international standards.

Construction has been divided into two phases: the first is already underway and scheduled to be completed by August this year. The second will begin in December and finish by March 2026, ensuring everything is ready for the first match in June 2026. Regular events at the stadium, such as Toronto FC and Argonauts games, will continue during the upgrades, though some temporary restrictions may apply.

Hosting the tournament in Toronto is now estimated to cost $380 million, far exceeding initial 2018 projections of $30–45 million. The federal and Ontario provincial governments have each pledged roughly $100 million in support. The city expects the tournament to boost local GDP by around $400 million, although FIFA's December 2024 report suggests the impact could reach as high as $520 million. FIFA also estimates the event will generate $340 million in wages and $25 million in tax revenue.

Mayor Olivia Chow has repeatedly highlighted that the World Cup will bring the city nearly $1 billion in economic benefit and create thousands of jobs. In June 2026, Toronto will be one of 16 host cities. The tournament will kick off on June 11 in Mexico, and on June 12, Toronto will host the first-ever men's World Cup match played on Canadian soil. The city will share hosting duties with Vancouver – each city will host five group stage matches and one knockout round game, with Vancouver also set to stage a round-of-16 match.

Barcelona extended their lead at the top of the La Liga standings to four points despite only picking up a point in their latest match against Real Betis this weekend. Barca's comfort at the top came about due to Real Madrid's shocking defeat against Valencia earlier on Saturday.

Knowing that their rival lost ground in the La Liga battle, the Blaugrana were keen on extending their lead further. That plan seems to be working well as the home side got themselves in front after just seven minutes of play through Gavi.

However, that lead lasted for only 10 minutes as Betis managed to draw level following a goal from Natan. Despite both teams' strong efforts in the second half, neither was able to snatch that all-important winning goal as the match ended in a draw.

Although failing to pick up all three points, it was still a positive result for Barcelona as they did go four points ahead of Los Blancos in the standings.

Earlier, Los Blancos saw their title challenge get tougher as they suffered a disappointing 2-1 defeat against Los Che. Playing in front of their home crowd, Madrid immediately took the attacking initiative as they searched for early goals.

However, it was Valencia that got in front, thanks to Mouctar Diakhaby's goal after just 15 minutes of play. Madrid finally managed to get back on level terms early in the second half, following a close-range finish by Vinicius Junior.

Carlo Ancelotti's men spent the remainder of the game searching for that all-important winning goal but poor finishing simply cost them. Madrid's failure to convert their chances eventually led to their downfall as Valencia managed to snatch the winning goal through Hugo Duro's goal in injury time.

That result means now Los Blancos are four points behind Barcelona in the standings but fortunately, there's still plenty of games left for Ancelotti's side to turn things around.

La Liga Saturday Fixture Results

Rayo Vallecano 0-4 Espanyol; Girona 0-1 Alaves; Mallorca 1-2 Celta Vigo; Real Madrid 1-2 Valencia; Barcelona 1-1 Real Betis.

The Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, the first clay court Masters of the season, is here and promises high-octane tennis. Three first-round matches are scheduled on Day 1, featuring the former semifinalist, Richard Gasquet, who will play here for the final time. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Jan-Lennard Struff had a horrible first three months of the season, and the European clay season couldn't have come sooner for the German player. Struff has played some great tennis at the Monte-Carlo Masters in the last two editions and will look to replicate it again. He desperately needs match wins as he is on the verge of dropping outside the top 50 for the first time since 2023. He will face the local wild card, Valentin Vacherot, who has never won a tour-level match outside of the Davis Cup. Vahcrot will have the crowd support, and with Struff's recent form, this match could get close. However, I still expect Struff to find a way to win.

Prediction: Struff in 3

Head-to-Head: Perricard 0-3 Thompson

Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard won his first tour-level title on clay and would be extremely excited to make his debut at the Monte-Carlo Masters. However, his form is not great this season, and he will face a tough opponent in the first round. The Frenchman's last match was against Jordan Thompson in Miami, where he lost to the Australian in straight sets. Thompson has a great record against Perricard and knows how to win key points. But this is the first time these two will meet on clay, which is Thompson's worst surface. Perricard's serve will still be impactful, and he will have extra time from baseline.

Prediction: Perricard in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Richard Gasquet first played at this historic event back in 2002 as a 15-year-old boy. 23 years later, he will play here for the final time. The French legend's retirement is close, but he is still capable of delivering amazing tennis, as he demonstrated last week in Bucharest against Botic van de Zandschulp. He also took a set from Flavio Cobolli, who is currently in the final of the Bucharest Open. Matteo Arnaldi is a solid clay courter but he is playing his first clay match this season, and maybe it will take him some time to find his feet. I can see Gasquet starting strong but the Italian should win once he finds his rhythm.

Prediction: Arnaldi in 3

The 24-year-old staved off match point as he produced a 7-6(5), 3-6, 7-6(6) win over fellow American Paul, ranked 13th in the world.

Brooksby has made a habit of saving match points in this tournament; he did so in the first round of qualifying and then fought off three match points in the second round of the main draw.

The match was blighted by several lengthy rain delays and concluded seven and a half hours after it began when Brooksby's backhand return winner secured the tie-break win in the third.

""I've been able to recall a lot of those (match point) moments this tournament and I think I've gotten stronger as each of those have gone on,"" said Brooksby who is ranked 50th in the world.

""I'm just really pleased with how I've kept my mental composure here the whole week so far,"" he said.

Brooksby will face second-seeded fellow American Francis Tiafoe in Sunday's final.

An unlikely appearance at the 2002 Monte-Carlo Masters turned into a memorable ATP debut for Richard Gasquet.

Born in the southern French city of Beziers, Gasquet was introduced to tennis by his parents, both of whom were biology teachers.

Mum Maryse and dad Francis were coaches at their local club in Serignan, where Richard became a student.

Their young prodigy first picked up a racquet at the age of three and it didn't take long for his potential quality to shine through on court.

Having started playing with his father, Gasquet was discovered by the seven-time title winner and former ATP star Pierre Barthes.

The then retired Frenchman, who also won the US Open doubles with Nikola Pilic in 1970, ran the tennis camp in Cap d'Agde close by.

Gasquet continued his growth and at nine-years-old, he became the cover star of the February 1996 edition of Tennis Magazine.

'The champion that France is waiting for?' it read on the front, one that has also donned Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

French media hype continued when Gasquet was dubbed as the 'little Mozart of tennis' when was 15, the age in which his career took off.

After reaching the Australian Open boys' singles semi-finals in 2002 he made his ATP Tour debut at the Monte-Carlo Masters.

Gasquet entered qualifying as a wildcard, beating Nikolay Davydenko and Adrian Voinea to reach the main draw of the tournament.

In doing so, he became the youngest ever qualifier in a Masters Series event at Monte-Carlo before making more history in the first round.

A 7-6 [7-5] 3-6 7-5 win against Franco Squillari, who was world no.54, made him the youngest ATP-level match winner in 14 years.

Gasquet won when aged just 15 years and ten months, after Tommy Ho and his 1988 Rye Brook Open win at 15 years and two months.

The teenager was beaten in the second round by Marat Safin but just a few months later, he impressed on his senior Grand Slam debut.

Shortly before he turned 16, Gasquet faced world no.20 Albert Costa in the French Open first round and won the first set before defeat.

An ATP record awaited him at the end of his breakout 2002 when he became the youngest ever player to finish in the year-end top 200.

Consistent Grand Slam appearances followed, including two semi-final outings at Wimbledon and one at the US Open.

But Gasquet also made regular visits to where it all began in Monte-Carlo and reached the quarter-finals in 2005 as a qualifier.

Standing between him and the last four was world no.1 Federer, who was unable to overcome the latest rising star in tennis.

Gasquet beat the Swiss legend 6-7 [1-7] 6-2 7-6 [10-8] and met Nadal in the semi-finals but couldn't capitalise on his first set win.

Another three quarter-final outings came his way in 2007, 2013 and 2018 at the Monte Carlo Country Club, with 2025 his final year.

He announced in October that he will retire and make his final ever appearance at the French Open next month.

A final bow at the Monte-Carlo Masters comes before though and the 38-year-old made an excellent start in the first round.

Gasquet beat Matteo Arnaldi 6-3 4-6 6-4 and will now face either world no.19 Felix Auger-Aliassime or qualifier Daniel Altmaier.

Fabio Fognini, Stan Wawrinka and Valentin Vacherot have joined him as wildcard entries.

As the clay season hits full swing, the bigger names – and a few outsiders – are building towards the next grand slam

Jannik Sinner Still serving his three-month doping ban, Sinner maintains his spot as the world No 1 after his rivals' faltering performances in Indian Wells and Miami. He will return to competitive tennis in Rome, aiming to capture his home ATP 1000 title for the first time after missing the 2024 edition due to a hip injury before the French Open. The ban limits his preparation, but he will be rested and eager to impress.

Alexander Zverev The German's form has been concerning, with unexpected losses to Arthur Fils at the Miami Open, the world No 43, Tallon Griekspoor, at Indian Wells and the teenage qualifier Learner Tien at the Mexican Open. By his own admission he has been “playing terrible” but clay is his strongest surface, where his powerful groundstrokes and topspin are highly effective. He has won titles in Rome and Hamburg in the past two years and fell in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final last year.

Carlos Alcaraz It is easy to forget how young the Spaniard is – he turns 22 next month – especially with four grand slam titles already won, but his recent inconsistencies are a reminder of how much he has to learn. Dominant sets are often followed by periods of vulnerability and his serve has not improved since he ended 2022 as world No 1. The good news is clay will mitigate his biggest 2025 struggle: not returning well against big servers on faster courts. Instead, he can take his time to set up points and showcase his shotmaking. The glimmer of invincibility has slightly dimmed, but he should not be underestimated on the red dirt.

Lorenzo Musetti He is not the most exciting player, but the 23-year-old won bronze at the Paris Olympics on clay, the first Italian to win a medal in singles tennis in a century, by being patient and adaptable. “He's an awkward player to play against,” said Novak Djokovic after last year's Wimbledon semi‑finals. “He has that defence slice, drop shots. He can serve and volley. He's so crafty. He can play any shot.” His biggest weakness? He always seems to end up on Djokovic's side of the draw.

Taylor Fritz With five Americans ranked in the top 25, the depth of talent is undeniable. Fritz leads the pack and while his consistent power game seems ill-suited for clay it has proved to be effective. Last year, he became the first American to reach the quarter-finals of all three ATP Masters events on clay and committed to playing the full clay-court season, challenging the traditional American aversion to the surface. “The generation before me, a lot of Americans wouldn't want to play the whole swing,” he says. “Clay is a huge part of the season. It's three Masters, some other tournaments and a grand slam. How can I ever be a top player if I can't produce some results during the clay season?”

Aryna Sabalenka The Belarusian's season has been marked by consistent dominance, with Brisbane and Miami Open titles, not dropping a set and consistently producing first serves above 80% at the latter. Her powerful backhand translates effectively to clay and while it is not her strongest surface her seven finals and two titles demonstrate her clay-court capability. “Physically I'm strong and I'm not rushing the point. I know I can stay in the point for how long I need. I have got everything to be a good player on clay,” she said after her Miami Open win.

Iga Swiatek The undisputed queen of the surface in recent years enters the clay season with a point to prove. Her 2024 dominance featured titles in Madrid, Rome and a third consecutive and fourth overall Roland Garros win, which was her last tournament victory. Opponents have exploited the Pole's forehand vulnerabilities on faster courts, but the shift to clay, with its slower pace, should favour her heavy topspin forehand. Her mental resilience will be tested, given her admitted recent struggles after a positive drugs test and subsequent ban last August. Can she reclaim her clay-court throne?

Coco Gauff Gauff's season has been marred by inconsistent performances, with four consecutive losses to unseeded opponents. Her forehand remains a significant weakness targeted by opponents, consistently hitting long. While possessing exceptional defensive skills, particularly in returning first serves, her ability to capitalise on second serves is less effective. Her 0-5 record against Swiatek on clay speaks volumes but with Swiatek's dip in form, can the American finally make a breakthrough?

Mirra Andreeva After reaching the Roland Garros semi-final last year, the Russian has solidified her status as the tour's newest teenage sensation. Her victories in Dubai and Indian Wells, including wins over Swiatek and Sabalenka in the latter, helped her record the longest winning streak by a player under 18 in two decades and become the youngest player in 40 years to defeat the world's top two players en route to a title. As the third-youngest Indian Wells champion, after Martina Hingis and Serena Williams, she enters the clay season with immense momentum.

Daria Kasatkina All eyes will be on Kasatkina who is now representing Australia after switching from her birth country, Russia. “I have to get used to it,” she says. “But I'm really happy to start this new chapter of my life representing Australia on the big stage.” Her clay-court prowess is undeniable, with more wins on the surface than any player outside Swiatek and Sabalenka in 2023 and an 8-4 record on clay in 2024. The new Australian No 1's crafty baseline game and ability to adapt to various playing styles make her a formidable opponent with her versatility being well-suited to the demanding conditions of the surface.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

By Gianni Taina

After an early-round exit at Indian Wells and a finals loss in Miami to rising star Jakub Mensik, Novak Djokovic is now shifting focus to the clay season. With Roland Garros looming and the 100th ATP title within reach, former World No. 6 Gilles Simon is highlighting the critical tweaks Djokovic has made to stay competitive.

As with all athletes, age eventually starts to take a toll—some adjust better than others. Simon believes Djokovic has made the right changes to ease the physical burden that once fueled his success.

Speaking with Tennis365, Simon explained how Djokovic has evolved, playing smarter and more aggressively to manage his physical output. “It's a very logical way,” said Simon. “He's serving better and better, because he needs more free points than before. He's less capable of holding his level playing full intensity, every point from the baseline for four or five sets, what he was doing before with Rafa [Nadal] – we all watched it”.

Simon pointed out that during Djokovic's 2023 Roland Garros title run, there were stretches where he appeared to hold back—deliberately conserving energy to make it through the match.

“It has already been a few years [now] where he can only play that level for one hour and a half and sometimes one set, or some moments in the match,” he continued. “Even when he won the French Open or Wimbledon, there is one set where he is not playing it, because he needs to recover – something he would never do before. Before he was full gas, first to last point”.

According to the French former pro, Djokovic no longer sticks to the relentless playing style that defined him in his prime. Instead, he adapts to how his body feels and paces himself accordingly.

“The choices he is making sometimes are different because he has to know how to handle this energy and regulate it, to play the five sets,” he noted. “That's where the logic is different. It's no longer: ‘No matter what happened, I will go full power first to last point”.

“He's really smart, he understands everything, he's super good obviously. He understands now how his body is responding and where the limit is, and where he has to change the choice and be a bit more aggressive to have shorter points in some moments, to hold the whole match,” Simon added.

The French Open returns on May 19 for a three-week run lasting until June 8, 2025- a not-to-be-missed event for tennis fans! This is a chance to see the world's best athletes on your screens in Paris, at the Porte d'Auteuil, on the most famous clay court in the capital's 16th arrondissement.

Organised by the French Tennis Federation, Roland-Garros is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments, and the second of the year after the Australian Open.

The 2025 edition of the world's most famous clay-court tournament promises to be as exceptional as ever! Once again this year, Roland-Garros is offering night sessions, every evening at 9pm, to give spectators an even more immersive experience.

Every summer for almost a century, Paris has become the tennis capital of the world, with the Roland-Garros tournament. You may be a keen follower of the tournament, but how much do you really know about it? Here are a few facts and anecdotes to help you shine in the evening. 

The legendary tennis tournament, scheduled to run from May 25 to June 8, 2025 at Porte d'Auteuil, has opened its ticketing to the general public, but with a new system this year. 

Every year, the Roland-Garros stadium plays host to the famous clay-court tournament, as well as many other sporting and cultural events. Located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, it's easily accessible by any means of transport. 

Originally made entirely of wood, it was designed to host the Davis Cup final in 1928, and featured just 5 courts. The stadium's name was chosen as a tribute to aviation pioneer and sportsman Roland Garros, who died in aerial combat during the First World War in 1918. During the Second World War, the stadium was requisitioned and became a transit camp for foreigners .

In the 1980s, the Roland-Garros stadium was expanded, with numerous courts added and several modernized over the years, as well as the creation of a National Training Center. The Place des Mousquetaires was landscaped in1989, with the installation of bronze statues of René Lacoste, Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon, the Four Musketeers of French tennis . In 1994, a new 10,000-seat centre court was built, named after Suzanne Lenglen, former French tennis player and the first international star of women's tennis.

In the early 2010s, controversy arose after the FFT proposed a project to extend the stadium, with the construction of an adjoining court in the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil. Work went ahead anyway, and the Philippe-Chatrier court was rebuilt and can now be covered, while the Simonne-Mathieu court was built, bringing the total number of orange courts to 18.

Since the 1930s, other sports have regularly taken over the stadium, including padel, beach volleyball, basketball (including Quai 54), boxing, breaking and, most recently, comedian Fary' s latest show! The stadium will host tennis and boxing events during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Ahead of French Open Tennis, Texapoker once again went on to stage a fine festival at Club Circus Paris in late March this year. 




The programme included an APO 500 accompanied by an APO 1000 and a Freezeout 350 to round things off in style. –Agencies","{'href': 'https://www.thenews.com.pk', 'title': 'The News International'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic and the people of Australia ain't exactly on the best terms since the pandemic ... and Aussie wheelchair tennis legend Dylan Alcott says many fans have been unfair to the 24x Grand Slam winner!

Things began to go south in 2022, when Novak, a skeptic of the COVID-19 vaccine, was banned from playing in the Australian Open (a 10x A.O. champ) and deported from the country because he didn't get the jab.

Fast forward to 2025 ... Novak pulled out of the Australian Open in the semifinals due to a muscle tear in his leg. The tennis great was heavily criticized in the country.

Not how we wanted your campaign to end, @djokernole.Thank you for another wonderful Australian summer. Well played and best wishes for a speedy recovery.#AO2025 pic.twitter.com/d5VJ6YNBeN

So, when 34-year-old Alcott, one of the greatest wheelchair tennis players ever, stopped by the TMZ offices for a taping of our new podcast, ""Big Down Under,"" host (and fellow Aussie) Charlie Cotton asked him about Djokovic, a mate of Dylan's.

""It sucks,"" Alcott, a 25x Grand Slam winner (15 singles and 10 doubles titles), said of the fans who booed 37-year-old Novak after he was hurt.

""Like who are you to say someone isn't injured, and when you won that many [Australian Opens], you don't have to be a fan of someone but you don't have to disrespect them and boo them off the court.""

Despite the harsh treatment inside his home country's borders, Alcott has nothing but love for Novak.

""He's been a supporter of me, wheelchair tennis,"" he said. ""We do this demo every year at the AO, and it really highlights that he wants to support other people in tennis, which is cool.""

Dylan, who was named Australian of the Year in '22, says everyone is entitled to their own opinion ... but that doesn't mean the athletes have to pay attention.

""You can like me; you can not like me. You can like Novak; you can not like Novak. We can't control what people think about us.""

The next Australian Open is set to go down in January 2026 ... and if Djokovic is healthy and playing, it'll be one of the most can't-miss tourneys in the tennis calendar.

Bottom line ... the man has at least ONE fan Down Under.","{'href': 'https://www.tmz.com', 'title': 'TMZ'}","tennis"

Jenson Brooksby refuses to lose in Houston.

The 24-year-old American saved match point in the first round of qualifying, three of them in the second round of the main draw and on Saturday evening, he fought off another match point en route to upsetting top seed Tommy Paul  7-6(5), 3-6, 7-6(6) in the semi-finals of the Fayez Sarofim & Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship.

Brooksby's smile after hitting a backhand return winner to seal his place in the final said it all. The qualifier had just weathered literal storms in Texas and an always game Paul to reach his fourth ATP Tour championship match.

“I've been able to recall a lot of those moments this tournament,” Brooksby said of his match point saves. “And I think I've gotten stronger as each of those have gone on. I'm just really pleased with how I've kept my mental composure here the whole week so far.”

What a match 🙌

Jenson Brooksby stuns Paul 7-6(5) 3-6 7-6(6) and advances to his first final in three years.@mensclaycourt | #USClay pic.twitter.com/yPTp5MiYT0

The No. 507 in the PIF ATP Rankings became the sixth tour-level finalist ranked outside the world's Top 500 since 1990 and the second qualifier to reach the final of the tournament since it moved to Houston in 2001. Mariano Zabaleta also achieved the feat in 2007 before falling to Ivo Karlovic.

The day's first semi-final was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. in Houston, but it did not end until about 8:30 p.m. due to multiple weather delays.

After the final delay, the players resumed action in the middle of the second set and an aggressive Paul quickly surged into a decider. However, the gritty Brooksby showed his resilience and led by a break twice in the third set. He continued putting balls into play, forcing his opponent to play nearly perfect tennis.



Paul, who was pursuing his first ATP Tour clay-court final, showed his class to turn the tables and serve for the match at 6-5. Despite letting slip that opportunity, the top seed earned match point at 6/5 in the tie-break.

With all the pressure on him, Brooksby landed a deep second serve, jamming Paul to force an error. Although he lost serve five times according to Infosys ATP Stats, the qualifier claimed a spot in the final against second seed Frances Tiafoe.

“I think regardless of what happens tomorrow, it's a huge positive for me this week. Huge,” Brooksby said. “I'm proud of the work I've put in, even last year heading into this year, and how I've responded every week, no matter if it was a worse week or a good week. Just excited for tomorrow.”

 

Tiafoe will compete in the Houston final for the third consecutive year after defeating fellow American and fourth seed Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-6(3). The second seed, who claimed the crown at this event in 2023, won 68 per cent of his second-serve return points to move on after one hour and 42 minutes.

""I thought I played pretty well tonight,"" Tiafoe said. ""Tough, tough conditions. Really tough winds on this side of the court, we were both struggling to hold serve. But I thought I came out with a great energy and it's again just having fun out here and playing really well my first tournament on clay. I really love playing here in Houston.""

 Tiafoe is the fourth player to make at least three straight championship matches in Houston, joining Jimmy Connors (1976-79), Andres Gomez (1983-1986) and Andy Roddick (2001-05).

Last year, Tiafoe lost a three-set final in Texas to Ben Shelton. He will try to overcome an 0-2 deficit in his Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry with Brooksby.

 Flavio Cobolli completed a remarkable turnaround week in his difficult 2025 season to claim his first ATP Tour title on Sunday at the Tiriac Open presented by UniCredit Bank. 

 The Italian required seven championship points but on Sunday downed Sebastian Baez 6-4, 6-4 to complete a dream title run at the clay-court ATP 250 in Bucharest. Cobolli prevailed in a big-hitting baseline battle with top seed Baez, played out in cold, damp conditions, after one hour, 46 minutes. 

 Lifting his maiden tour-level trophy in Bucharest marks a stunning turnaround in fortunes for Cobolli, who arrived in the Romanian capital on an eight-match tour-level losing streak. He dropped his first set of the week to Richard Gasquet but did not lose another en route to becoming the first Italian titlist in event history. 

FLAVIO HAS DONE IT 🏆The Italian completes a memorable week in Romania with his maiden ATP crown! 🙌#TiriacOpen | @cobollifla pic.twitter.com/9aqcZJgPps

 “I feel great. I feel happy. It's a big dream come true for my career,” said the 22-year-old Cobolli. “I always dreamed of winning an ATP tournament and it has happened today. I'm really happy to be here and to have reached my best result ever. I came from a tough moment. I had not won a match, before this tournament, this year, and I won the tournament. So I'm really happy about it."" 

 Cobolli broke Baez's serve twice en route to winning the first set of the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. The Italian struck the ball with increasing aggression, particularly off his forehand wing, into the second set, and soon led by a double-break at 5-2. 

 Then came the tricky business of closing out for his maiden tour-level crown. Cobolli let slip three championship points on serve at 5-2 and another three on return at 5-3, but there was nothing that the battling Baez could do to deny his opponent in the next game. Cobolli produced a classy lob on his seventh championship point before falling to the clay in celebration. 

 

 Cobolli completed his victory having won 74 per cent (23/31) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, compared to just 53 per cent (33/62) for Baez. Aside from his late struggles to close out the match, the Italian appeared a confident, rejuvenated player in his second ATP Tour title match (after 2024 Washington). 

 “To play against Seb on the clay is always tough,"" reflected Cobolli. ""For me he is one of the best on clay right now. He already won many titles on it, so it's a great fight and a great day for me.” 

 Following his title run, Cobolli will on Monday rise nine spots to No. 36 in the PIF ATP Rankings, six places shy of his career high. He is the fifth first-time champion on the ATP Tour this season, joining Alexandre Muller (Hong Kong), Joao Fonseca (Buenos Aires), Tomas Machac (Acapulco) and Jakub Mensik (Miami). 

 Despite Sunday's defeat, Baez can reflect on another deep run on clay in 2025. The Argentine won an ATP 500 title in Rio de Janeiro in February, when he also reached the final in Santiago. He has won seven of his eight ATP Tour trophies on clay and has won more tour-level matches (79) on the surface since the start of the 2022 season than any other player.

Yuki Tsunoda, Red Bull Racing Team

Red Bull advisor has delivered his verdict of Yuki Tsunoda's debut performance at the 2025 Japanese Grand Prix following his replacement of Liam Lawson. Despite a disappointing qualifying, the driver managed to hold his own in the RB21.

Speaking to Motorsport.com after the race, Marko was content with the performance exhibited by his driver. 

""It was good. It was just unlucky that in Qualifying 2 he had this mistake. But otherwise it was fine,"" he said. 

The 24-year-old qualified 15th after a mistake saw him lose time in Q2. After a penalty for Williams' Carlos Sainz, he was promoted to 14th while team-mate Max Verstappen started in pole position. The Japanese driver made two places, finishing 12th behind Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso.

Speaking after the race, Tsunoda admitted that he ""expected more.""

""I'm happy with the race, in terms of my performance,"" he said. ""But obviously, in terms of results, it's quite tough, especially for my home Grand Prix.

""I was definitely expecting more, and you know, at least I wanted to finish in a point, so it's mixed feelings.""

This race was a learning moment for the driver, who has had limited time behind the wheel of the challenging RB21.

""The 53, 54 laps I got in this race was the most laps I had in this car. Every lap I was learning, and finally, I got decent laps in the car, and I definitely feel more confidence in the car. I just feel overall controlled more towards the end of the race.

""I'm happy considering the amount of time I had, but because of [it being my] home Grand Prix, I just wanted to finish in the points. I just have to build the pace. It's fortunate that there's Max that I can learn from. So I just keep doing what I'm doing. I'm excited for Bahrain, actually.""

Verstappen provided the Milton Keynes team with a masterclass performance today, with Marko commenting on his chances of a fifth drivers' championship.

""I mean the car, fortunately, got a very good setup. And Max was unbelievable: 53 laps without any mistakes and absolutely on limit,"" he said.

""21 races still to come. It will be tight but we have to improve our car, that's clear.""

Can McLaren restore its dominance or is Red Bull's season up and running now? And what do all the main players have to say about today's proceedings?

You can find Jake Boxall-Legge's race report here. Catch up with all the analysis and reactions from the Suzuka paddock later today on the website.

As far as this live blog goes, thank you for joining us this weekend. Bye for now, enjoy the rest of your Sunday!

Max and the others get a proper trophy too, a sort of chalice with an elongated handle. No sponsored creation festooned with nonsense.

The celebrations will be short but sweet. It is on to Bahrain next week, and Saudi Arabia after that as part of a triple-header.

That pitlane exit moment was pretty much the only notable incident at the front. 

Now the Dutch national anthem plays for the 64th time in Formula 1. And every single time the Wilhelmus sounded for that man Max Verstappen.

 



Verstappen: ""I'm incredibly happy. The weekend started off quite tough but we didn't give up. Starting on pole made it possible to win this race.""

[Winning in Japan] means a lot to me, it was in the back of my mind as well on the final few laps. I needed to stay ahead to give Honda a great farewell. This is a perfect send-off.""

Norris: ""Max drove a great, clean race. he deserves it.""

He plays down the pitlane incident. ""That's just racing, Max was the last guy I expected to give me space. It was still a good race.""

Piastri on not swapping positions: ""There wasn't much [debate]. I felt I had really strong pace and if I had the track position I could get Max, but that's what happens when you qualify behind. It's a fair response.""

That's 64 wins for Verstappen in Formula 1. Simply lovely, as he would say.

Lando Norris still leads the championshiop with 62 points, with Verstappen just one point behind now.

What did you make of this Japanese Grand Prix then? Boring or enough to stay hooked?

How do you rate Verstappen's performance, and what do you think McLaren should have done?

It's the same for everyone, really. Qualifying dictated everything with few positional changes.

Alonso just finished outside the top 10 ahead of Tsunoda, who has only managed to gain two spots in traffic.

""Unbelievable, what a weekend. We keep pushing,"" Verstappen says.His engineer Lambiase and team boss Horner seem perplexed at the weekend he has been able to pull off. No chance Red Bull should have won here.

It all started with the magical pole lap yesterday. It allowed Verstappen to lead from the front in clear air, easily keeping McLaren at arm's length.

1 Verstappen, 2 Norris, 3 Piastri, 4 Leclerc, 5 Russell, 6 Antonelli, 7 Hamilton, 8 Hadjar, 9 Albon, 10 Bearman.

That is Verstappen's fourth consecutive win at Suzuka, sporting Red Bull's Honda tribute livery too. 

It is a perfect final home race for Red Bull-Honda as the Japanese manufacturer heads to Aston Martin next year.

Max Verstappen has done it! He beats Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in the land of the rising sun.

One more tour around Suzuka. Verstappen will take a commanding win.

With a straightforward one-stop strategy McLaren didn't have that many options either, but by pitting Norris on the same lap as Verstappen it was pretty much game over there and then. 

In Verstappen's dirty air, Norris was taking more out of his tyres. The McLaren is surely still quicker, but they have never managed to find the clear air to use its pace.

Norris' challenge on Verstappen is fading, if ever there was one. Superb drive from the four-time champion, it has to be said.

In 14th Doohan is holding up a train with Sainz, Hulkenberg, Lawson and Ocon. A good recovery from the Aussie after his FP2 crash.But, with just one position change in the top 10, it also shows people have literally been stuck in traffic all afternoon.

Antonelli sets the fastest lap and is informed he is the quickest driver on track right now.""I'm giving everything, mate!""Good lad,"" is the reply.

In fairness Norris is getting closer to Verstappen, but he hasn't cracked DRS range just yet.

Seven laps to go. Time is running out for McLaren to try something, so it looks like Piastri won't get his wish.

No other battles in the top 10 at the moment, leaving us free to focus on the top three.

It's still Verstappen from Norris and Piastri, line astern.

Piastri is now so close he may pass Norris without any help. Just get it over with, McLaren. If the Aussie can't pass Verstappen, just switch back at the end?

""If Lando is still saving, I think he should go soon. I think I have the pace to get Max.""

Piastri has read our minds. That, or we're just stating the obvious...

If Norris can't get closer to Verstappen, McLaren may just try a switch and see what Piastri's pace is. 

Verstappen is clearly not going to lose this race, is he.

Piastri gets to within a second of Norris and can use DRS. Are they free to race?

Hadjar has lost out to Lewis, but has otherwise had a solid race on his way to eighth.  Albon and Bearman look poised to take the final few points.

Tsunoda is stuck behind Alonso's dirty air in 12th.

Hamilton sounds frustrated as he watches Antonelli's Mercedes get ever smaller. ""I'd really like to know where I'm slow, mate.""

His race engineer replies with corner numbers and he shoots back: ""Yes, but by how much?!""

Antonelli has found a burst of pace on his new hard tyres and has knocked Hamilton back by two seconds.

It's a really good showing from the 18-year-old after he had been going through a pretty difficult weekend in practice. But right on time, he found a good lap in Q3 to take sixth on the grid.

Just 18 laps to go now. Max Verstappen has yet to be put under any serious pressure. 

""We are happy for you to push from here,"" is the message that will sound like music to his ears.

This easy medium to hard strategy has really robbed a lot of people up and down the pitlane of an opportunity to make some magic happen. No rain either, so far.

Hamilton is already in Antonelli's DRS range on the faster mediums, which is likely going to be the next fight.

Piastri is also still in the fight 1.8s behind Norris. Leclerc has been dropped by the leading trio and follows six seconds behind the Australian.

Antonelli also pits and keeps his original position between Russell and Hamilton.

That now hands the lead back to Verstappen, with Norris 1.3s in arrears.

Hamilton boxes from second after having a huge wobble at the chicane. That frees Verstappen right behind the Briton.

Hamilton is coming back out 10 seconds behind Russell in seventh, but now has fresh mediums to close the gap.

Lovely move by Hadjar for P9 around the outside of Sainz, who has yet to stop. Sainz was mainly trying to keep the Racing Bulls car behind to help team-mate Albon, who is actually fighting Hadjar for position.

Antonelli's still going strong on those mediums as we get past the halfway mark, keeping his Mercedes predecessor Hamilton four seconds behind.

Pirelli brought its three hardest compounds, which now feels ... conservative.

The stewards had a look at the pit exit kerfuffle between Verstappen and Norris and saw nothing wrong with it.

Hadjar pits, so it's Antonelli leading Hamilton until either comes in as well.

Verstappen is third on the road but the net leader, followed by Norris, Piastri and Leclerc. Traffic has cleared for Russell to join up behind Leclerc. His early stop hasn't really done much and he is now on slightly older tyres, but he probably had to try something.

Alex Albon is driving with gritted teeth. ""You guys make absolutely no sense, it's ridiculous,"" he fumes as he is brought in a lap after Bearman rather than before.

""It was worse [pitting] before,"" his engineer argues.

Albon pits and releases Norris.

Curious strategy from McLaren to bring in Norris on the same lap as Verstappen, eschewing a chance to do something different.

Max Verstappen has quipped that if he was driving McLaren's Formula 1 car “then you wouldn't have seen me” despite his dominant pole and victory at the Japanese Grand Prix.

The Red Bull driver took his fourth consecutive win at Suzuka, fending off both McLaren drivers in the grand prix on Sunday after securing a stunning pole position on Saturday, which completed a remarkable turnaround having appeared off the pace on Friday.

""When I came here, I didn't expect to win here at all - and after Friday, not at all,"" Verstappen said to Viaplay after the race.

""Starting on pole was the most important thing this weekend. McLaren I think was faster, but they couldn't get into the DRS to make a move.""

Asked for his reaction to the victory and whether the win was entirely down to the driver, Verstappen responded light-heartedly: ""I'm very happy with what I'm doing, I don't even want to think about it if I'd been in that other car [McLaren]. Then you wouldn't have seen me.""

Verstappen was then quick to call it a team effort with Red Bull having unlocked more pace from the RB21 car.

""In the end it's always a team that works well together, with GP [Gianpiero Lambiase] and this weekend I also had another performance engineer, Hugh Bird,"" he said. ""I worked with him until the end of 2020 as well and that actually went really well.

""In the end, we made the right choices before we went into qualifying. If you listen to the onboards, it runs very smoothly between me and GP. Those are things that are very important though.""

Despite his first breakthrough win in 2025, Verstappen was also quick to temper expectations heading into the next round in Bahrain just one point behind Lando Norris at the top of the drivers' standings.

""This was a great result, but it was difficult to overtake and qualifying was very important here,"" he said.

""This does not mean that everything is now suddenly hosanna and that we are going to win all the races, but we can be very happy with this.""

Verstappen detailed three critical factors that aided Red Bull in the Japanese GP: the difference between clean and dirty air, low tyre wear on the new track surface and lower temperatures – a notable change given the previous Red Bull cars would often perform stronger relative to rivals in hot conditions.

""You could see that at the end of a stint they were getting closer again and trying to attack, because my tyres were getting a bit too hot then,"" he explained.

""I think it helped us that it was a bit colder today, so we had less overheating of the tyres - that is still a problem for us.

""A lot of fast corners and that makes it very hard to follow - the tyres get very hot when you get close to someone.

""The cars get better every year as well, with a lot of dirty air, so it just gets harder and harder. When the lap times are quite close together without a lot of tyre degradation, then it becomes very difficult.""

For a circuit as famously difficult to master as Suzuka, seeing three Formula 1 rookies secure points during the Japanese Grand Prix is a testament to the ability of the new breed of driver coming through the ranks.

While reigning world champion Max Verstappen sealed a fine victory ahead of the chasing McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, a trio of inexperienced drivers also impressed.

Here, Motorsport.com looks at how each of them fared and what they thought of their respective races.

Having been perplexed at earning the Driver of the Day accolade at the Chinese Grand Prix, Antonelli may question why he did not claim the most votes in Japan.

The 18-year-old went into the weekend a little trepidatiously having never driven around Suzuka, missing out on the chance to do so in a Super Formula test at the back end of last year due to illness.

But, with the guidance of team-mate George Russell and third driver Valtteri Bottas, the Italian grew into the weekend and qualified alongside Russell in sixth place.

He would go on to finish in the same position, extending his run of three races and three points finishes – the first rookie driver to achieve such a feat since a certain Lewis Hamilton at McLaren in 2007, when Antonelli was not even a year old.

Not only that, he also became the youngest driver to ever lead a grand prix as he was able to extend his opening stint on the medium tyre much longer than his fellow frontrunners and then became the youngest man to claim an F1 fastest lap, too.

“Qualifying was a big click, because definitely I was able to feel the car and push it more, and today [in the race] was another step forward,” he said.

“I'm really looking forward to explore even more in the next few weekends, because now I have the feeling that I can again play with the car, and something that I couldn't really do in the previous two weekends, just because I was definitely a bit more tense while driving, while now I'm getting more experience with the tyres and the car itself.

“So definitely a good boost of confidence ahead of next weekend.”

Before a wheel had been turned in Suzuka, it was clear that Hadjar was not going to be anywhere near the focus of the media attention on the Red Bull stable.

With Liam Lawson demoted from Red Bull and returning to Racing Bulls as Hadjar's team-mate, Yuki Tsunoda replacing the New Zealander in time for his home race and Verstappen being, well, Verstappen, there was not much to say about Hadjar before the weekend.

However, he caught the eye with his best performance since entering F1, claiming his maiden top-10 finish seemingly quite comfortably.

The Frenchman had been anything but comfortable during qualifying as his seatbelts were fastened too tight during Q1 – although he overcame the issue to eventually put his Racing Bull seventh on the grid, ahead of his childhood hero Hamilton.

He ultimately lost out to the seven-time world champion in the race but still came home in eighth place to take four points and open his account for the year.

“All we could have done today was P8 and we did it - I think it was a perfectly executed race, left nothing on the table and the pace was definitely strong,” he said when analysing his performance.

“Especially on the medium, I felt really, really strong and the first half as well on the hard, and later on Alex [Albon] was just flying and he was catching bit by bit.

“But I had enough gap to secure the place. So we still need to review it, but all in all it was good.”

Bearman is certainly no stranger to points-scoring in F1, his 10th place in Japan means he now has taken a haul from four of the six grands prix in which he has raced.

This, though, is likely to be the most memorable thus far given his strong overall performance across the weekend.

Haas brought an untested floor upgrade to Suzuka and Bearman made it work much better than his experienced team-mate Esteban Ocon, even so both he and team principal Ayao Komatsu admitted reaching Q3 on Saturday was a surprise.

With Toyota now on board as a technical partner, Haas would have wanted a strong showing in Japan and Bearman delivered, as he finished the grand prix where he started it to take 10th place and the final point on offer.

Unlike his 2024 F2 team-mate Antonelli, though, Bearman did take part in the Super Formula test last year, so this was not a step into the complete unknown for the British teenager.

“Every weekend I've done so far has had a mistake somewhere, maybe not China,” he said. “But this one, completing the full weekend without any bad points, good qualifying, good race, I'm happy with this one, and it's a good baseline to improve from.

“This weekend, I felt really confident to push and lean on it and, if I have that feeling, I hope we can be that competitive in the future races too.”

Lewis Hamilton has reflected on his disappointing Japanese Grand Prix race following his seventh place finish, highlighting the lack of a safety car as the factor that killed his strategy. Pointing to issues on his Ferrari, the seven-time champion is looking forward to the team fixing the issues they've now managed to identify. 

Despite making up one position from his P8 start, the Briton had a challenging race at Suzuka.

""I was maximum today. I didn't have anything else in the car,"" Hamilton said following the race. ""Had underperformance happening at the rear of the car this weekend. And obviously, qualifying position is key.""

Running the car higher than the Scuderia would like after a disqualification in China, the car isn't running with the team's desired setup, affecting its aerodynamics. What didn't help was the lack of a safety car during the Suzuka campaign - something the Italian team was counting on for their new driver.

""There was no safety car, so it didn't really make much difference,"" Hamilton said. ""I think the medium was definitely better for the start of the race, especially in these cool conditions.""

Passing Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar, Hamilton was one of few drivers to overtake this Sunday.

""Yeah, I'm very happy I moved forward. I'm really hoping in the next race we'll see, hopefully, some positive changes. Through the first three races, there's been a bit of a deficit between both sides of the garage on the car.

""So, on my side, something's underperforming, so it's good to know.

""I mean, with what I had, that's the best result I could get.""

His assessment of Ferrari's pace is clear:

""I think we're probably the fourth-fastest, clearly, at the moment. I think we are a little bit off the other guys in terms of performance - downforce level-wise - so we've got some work to do to close the gap.

""We will slowly progress the car. It'll be interesting to see when people get upgrades for the season.

""We've got a lot of work to be able to close the gap to the top cars,"" he elaborated. ""The top guys probably have three or four-tenths on us, so we've got a lot of work to bring upgrades for that.""

When are upgrades expected for the Scuderia machines?

""They don't know,"" Hamilton admitted.

Fred Vasseur believes the current Formula 1 season is in danger of becoming a “quali championship” with overtaking at a premium in the past two rounds.

While the 2025 campaign began with a frantic Australian Grand Prix, the changeable weather played a key part in ensuring plenty of on-track action.

It has been a different story, though, in both the Chinese Grand Prix and this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix, where very little overtaking took place.

In what is the final year of the current regulations, there has not only been a convergence in car design but simultaneously teams have also found ways around the current rules that were originally introduced to promote more overtaking.

Across 2024 there were 70 fewer overtakes than a year earlier, despite their being two extra races and so far all three drivers who qualified on pole position have gone on to win the respective grands prix in 2025.

As particularly proven by the victories of polesitters Oscar Piastri in Shanghai and Max Verstappen at Suzuka, clean air is currently king. And at Suzuka, the top six in qualifying all finished in the same order come the race.

“For sure, qualifying is always crucial in the performance,” said Ferrari team principal Vasseur.

“The more you are close, the more the gap is small between cars, it's even more true because you are in the group of cars.

“It's not that you are just one fighting with the guy in front of you. Yes, it will probably be a quali championship.”

McLaren has widely been regarded as the car to beat this year, but Lando Norris could not find a way past Verstappen, while team-mate Piastri was holed up in third.

The pair both pointed to Verstappen's stunning pole lap as deciding the race as they could not find a way past the Dutchman for 53 laps.

“It was flat-out from start to finish but the pace was too similar to do anything,” said Norris, who still leads the championship having finished second. “Max drove a good race with no mistakes, and it ultimately came down to qualifying positions.”

Piastri added: “We got close for the overtake a few times, but track position around here is just so important. I think yesterday was the day where you effectively won the race.”

Meanwhile, Ferrari has endured a tough start to the season, victory in the Shanghai sprint race for Lewis Hamilton aside, and is currently the clear fourth-fastest team on the grid behind McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes.

While a double-points finish in Japan was better than both Hamilton and Charles Leclerc being disqualified in China, Vasseur conceded Ferrari requires “improvement everywhere”.

“The result of today, we need to try to do a better job next week to improve the potential and also the extraction of the potential of the car,” he said.

“We have to improve everywhere. And at least we did a step forward compared to last week, at least on the operation [side] and we have to start from there.

“But it's not ideal as the start of the season, for sure, but it's still a long one to go - still 21 [races] to go.”

McLaren says it had to choose between potentially sacrificing Oscar Piastri or losing time to Max Verstappen on new hard tyres when it came to Lando Norris' Japanese Grand Prix strategy, which explains the decision to pit the Briton on the same lap as the Red Bull driver.

Team principal Andrea Stella has explained the team's strategic options following a drab affair at Suzuka, which he felt had limited tactical latitude given the low levels of degradation experienced over the weekend.

When questioned about potentially pitting Norris sooner to gain an undercut on Verstappen, Stella reckoned that this would have left Piastri susceptible to the cars that had already pitted when it came to his own stop - and that the Australian was prioritised in order to cover the likes of Charles Leclerc and George Russell.

He also noted the safety car window in that scenario, stating that any chance of a pause in proceedings due to an accident would have immediately killed off the team's chances of a bigger points haul.

""It's unclear whether we could [do the undercut] but I think pitting Lando [first], it would have meant that we could not pit Oscar, and this would have been a problem for Oscar,"" Stella explained.

""We would have waited, which I think would have been a problem with other cars, especially Russell, that pitted and that we needed to cover.

""We will review obviously the gaps in terms of time to understand whether there was a possibility to go for an undercut with Lando that could actually be executed on Max.

""We don't have to forget though that, by giving up track positions, you also expose the car that you pit to safety car risk, for instance. Lando would have lost positions in a safety car should one be deployed.

""In hindsight, if you don't see any safety cars, you think 'oh yeah I might have gone for the undercut', but an undercut attempt comes with some risks.

""It was apparent that the degradation was low, so I think if you lose position with a safety car, it's lost. I don't think we could have overtaken a Ferrari or a Mercedes today.""

Stella also felt that an overcut strategy was not possible, as the pace advantage of fresh hard tyres versus the worn mediums would have simply maintained the status quo - but with Norris even further behind.

He again noted the pace of the earlier-stopping Russell on hard tyres, which meant that the team could not risk pitting any later than Verstappen.

""I think the problem for Lando [on an overcut] would be that he would have lost positions to some other cars, including Oscar,"" the Italian added. ""They'd pitted and they were faster, and if you stay out on a 20-lap used medium, you cannot be faster than somebody that pitted on a hard.

""The situation became very clear when Russell pitted, and he was very fast on a new hard. I think the overcut works well when you know that you gain like in Barcelona or in Suzuka in the past, you gain four or five laps of tyre delta. Then, even if you pit behind a car that stopped before, you will pass him because you have better tyres.

""But here, the tyres don't almost degrade at all from one lap to the other.""

Lando Norris has downplayed the clash he had with Max Verstappen on the pit exit during the Japanese Grand Prix, describing it as ""simply racing"".

Verstappen took the win at the Suzuka track as Red Bull commemorated the end of its partnership with Honda, making this his first victory of the 2025 season. The Dutchman crossed the line ahead of McLaren drivers Norris and Oscar Piastri. 

It was a sedate race, but a moment following the pitstops of Verstappen and Norris had fans momentarily on the edge of their seats as the drivers ran beside each other on the pit exit, with Norris losing traction as he ran his right tyres over the grass. The standings leader got squirrelly as he struggled with traction and lost some time to his rival. 

As the two drivers argued who was at fault over the radio with their engineers, the post-race interview with the Briton featured him downplaying the tussle.

""It's racing, I think. He was still ahead, it kind of squeezes into one, and Max is the last guy I expect to give me any space… in a good way, in a racing way. So, nothing more than that,"" Norris reflected.

Initially, the driver argued that Verstappen had ""forced me off,"" while Verstappen told his engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase, that ""Norris pressed his pit limiter off too early, there's no way that was legal"".

Stewards confirmed soon after that no further action would be taken, putting this to bed quickly. 

""I guess I just lost out yesterday,"" Norris said. ""Max drove a good race today, no mistakes. The pace was too similar today to do anything more. Long race, a lot of pushing.

""It was a flat-out race from start to finish, so tough, but just not enough today, nothing special that we had that we could get Max on. They were quick and no mistakes, so he deserved it.""

McLaren didn't pull off the perfect strategy today, with the undercut on the circuit not being overly powerful. Norris will now continue the triple header hoping to improve.

""I think it's still been a very good weekend,"" he said. ""Obviously, we didn't get the positions that we wanted. We're fighting for a win every weekend, but they deserved it. Both Red Bull and Max deserved it this weekend.

""They're quick, they've been catching up, they've obviously made some improvements and, as a team, we didn't have enough this weekend. So we're going to have to work harder for the next one.""

Lando Norris says McLaren should have pitted him before Max Verstappen to try to defeat the Red Bull Formula 1 driver, but thinks the Suzuka race was lost in qualifying.

Verstappen safeguarded his lead from pole on the first lap, and the four-time champion then never really looked under serious threat from the chasing McLaren duo of Norris and Oscar Piastri.

While the McLarens were the quicker cars, overtaking at Suzuka proved almost impossible, and Norris and Piastri never found clear air to extract the pace out of the MCL39.

With the Japanese Grand Prix an easy one-stop race, the only real opportunity for Norris to leapfrog Verstappen came at the sole round of pitstops, but Norris then pitted on the same lap as his rival. It led to a tense moment as Norris came out alongside Verstappen, taking to the grass on the exit.

But with no real on-track chance to challenge Verstappen over the second stint either, Norris felt McLaren should have tried different tactics.

""Maybe we could have tried a bit more with strategy and overcut or undercut,"" he said.

""We just boxed on the same lap for some reason, so there are some things we'll discuss. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

""I probably should have just tried to undercut. The thing is there's always the safety car risk.

""I don't think I could have gone longer because then I think I would have lost a position, so that wasn't on the cards. But yeah, I think we probably should have just tried to undercut and tried something different.""

But Norris felt that even by pitting one lap earlier it would have been tough for him to emerge ahead because it would have taken Pirelli's hard tyres time to get up to temperature, rendering the classic undercut less powerful.

""Honestly, I think the undercut is not easy here because the hards are not mega in the first sector,"" Norris explained. ""So, whether that even would have worked, I'm unsure.

""Max still always had a little buffer to me so, even with a good out-lap, I don't think it was enough to have passed anyway.""

That led Norris to shift the blame for him and Piastri not winning the race to Saturday, with neither driver delivering a perfect lap in qualifying while Verstappen did, giving him clear air for the entire race.

""Max didn't make any mistakes and drove a good race - being in clean air was enough to stay in that position,"" he added. ""The race was won yesterday in hindsight.

""I think our pace was probably slightly better, but not enough to get through the dirty air, get into the DRS, and then passing is a whole other story because it's pretty much impossible to pass here.""

Race winner Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing

Max Verstappen held off the two McLarens throughout the Japanese Grand Prix to clinch his first Formula 1 victory of 2025, crossing the line with a 1.4-second advantage.

The Red Bull driver capitalised on his impressive qualifying run to put together a controlled drive at the front of the order, ensuring that he did not wilt under the scrutiny from the two McLarens behind - as Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri could not prise open a chance to pass Verstappen.

Verstappen pulled a two-plus-second gap over Norris in the opening laps to ward off any early threats under DRS, and did not respond to McLaren's apparent dummy call for Norris to pit - as engineer Will Joseph suggested his driver could ""box to overtake"", but the Briton subsequently stayed out.

McLaren tried to force a response by stopping Piastri at the end of the 20th lap, and Verstappen did indeed pit - but Norris followed him into the pitlane. The McLaren pit crew found a second on its Red Bull counterparts in the box, putting Verstappen and Norris level at the exit, but Norris did not have space to go two-wide on the exit and ran across the grass.

His attempt to draw the stewards' attention on the radio did not come to pass as the incident was waved off, leaving his only opportunity of securing a second win of 2025 to come with an on-track overtake.

But, over the following 30 laps, Norris was unable to find a way to get within DRS range of Verstappen, and could only match the Red Bull driver for pace. This left McLaren with a quandary, as Piastri was happily sitting within a second of Norris and angling for a switch in positions.

McLaren did not elect to pull the trigger despite Piastri's better pace, which left Verstappen untouched in front; the orange cars were left to flank the four-time champion on the podium.

Charles Leclerc clinched fourth place, preserving his grid position to beat the Mercedes duo; although the earlier-stopping George Russell got to within 1.2s of the Ferrari driver by the end, he was unable to find any further ground on the Monegasque despite offering early pressure. Andrea Kimi Antonelli claimed sixth with a long medium-tyre stint, and finished a further 1.3s behind his more experienced team-mate.

Lewis Hamilton's contra-strategy, starting on the hard tyres, paid off to some degree with seventh, having gained a position on rookie Isack Hadjar - who scored his first F1 points with eighth.

An irascible Alex Albon claimed ninth despite his complaints on the radio to his Williams team about gearshifts and his pitstop timing, while Haas driver Oliver Bearman clinched the final point over Fernando Alonso and Red Bull debutant Yuki Tsunoda. Liam Lawson was 17th on his return to Racing Bulls.

Alex Albon, Williams

Alex Albon addressed his intense radio messages during the Japanese Grand Prix. 

The Thai-British driver vented his anger over the team radio to his engineer James Urwin on multiple occasions. In response to Haas pitting rookie Oliver Bearman, Albon raged, ""Yeah, well pit before then!"" He also fumed, ""Honestly, you guys make absolutely no sense."" However, his most passionate exchange came after he was disappointed in how his car was shifting through its gearbox. He exclaimed:

""These shifts are so bad. What have we done to them? It's been **** at the start, it's being **** now.""

The team asked for specifics, to which he responded: ""Yeah, the same! The same I've been talking about all the time.""

Albon defended the radio exchanges while speaking to the media after the race, stating that although fans were not used to hearing that side of him, it's quite normal during the high-adrenaline moments of the race. He explained:

""That is honestly me in my car. I am not... If you had my radio, you would hear me more like that than not like that.

""But for the most part, we had a couple of shift issues that we've been testing all weekend, and we settled on one that we were quite happy with but it didn't feel like the one that we settled on at the start of the race. So, it felt a little bit like we were driving with an FP1 and FP2, which I wasn't too happy with.

""Strategy wise, it was more just because Max overtook me on track, and then we boxed a lap after and I felt that we just lost unnecessary time in that exchange.""

Speaking about the race overall, the Williams driver noted:

""It was a very simple race, maybe a little on the boring side. But I don't mind boring when I am scoring points.

""We had a couple of shift issues. We settled one one we are happy with but it didn't feel like the one we settled on at the start of the race.

""I wasn't too happy with that.""

Max Verstappen scored a superb first win of the 2025 Formula 1 season with a fourth consecutive victory at the Japanese Grand Prix.

The Dutchman went unchallenged at Suzuka as he successfully defended from Lando Norris into Turn 1 at the race start, keeping the McLaren at bay for 53 laps, despite coming close together at the pit exit following their first stops.

While Norris was unable to close on Verstappen's Red Bull, Oscar Piastri attempted to apply pressure on his McLaren team mate in the closing stages and briefly petitioned the team to swap their positions so he could attempt to challenge at the front.

In a race of few flashpoints, the top six finished as they began, with Charles Leclerc, George Russell and Kimi Antonelli following the leaders home.

FIA post-race press conference – Japan

Max Verstappen scored his first victory of the 2025 season with a masterful drive to P1 in the Japanese Grand Prix, the World Champion holding off the McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri to claim a fourth consecutive win at the Suzuka Circuit.

After making a strong start from pole position, Verstappen held a decent lead over the McLarens throughout the early stages. Drama then ensued during the pit stop phase when the Dutchman's slightly slow stop saw Norris – who had pitted on the same lap – try to go side-by-side at the pit exit, resulting in the McLaren man having to take to the grass while Verstappen remained ahead.

While both drivers voiced their unhappiness about the incident over the team radio, the stewards opted not to investigate and Verstappen remained ahead of Norris as the race progressed, building a gap back to the Briton.

However, the battle ramped up in the final 10 laps as Piastri closed in on Norris – leading the latter to up his pace and begin to cut into Verstappen's advantage. It was ultimately not enough, though, with Verstappen crossing the line ahead of Norris to claim his 64th Grand Prix victory.

Race results

Norris' second place looked to potentially be under threat from his team mate in the closing stages but, as the Australian's challenge fell away in the final tours, the positions remained the same, with Piastri having to settle for third on his 24th birthday.

Charles Leclerc claimed fourth for Ferrari, ahead of the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, the latter of whom enjoyed an impressive run in the lead during the pit stop phase after going long for his opening stint.

Lewis Hamilton added to the Scuderia's tally in seventh, while rookie Isack Hadjar clinched his first points of the season with a solid drive for Racing Bulls in eighth. Alex Albon followed in ninth for Williams, with Haas' Ollie Bearman claiming the final point on offer in 10th.

Just missing out was Fernando Alonso, though the Aston Martin driver will undoubtedly be pleased to be classified after failing to finish during the opening two rounds of the campaign.

There was a moment of drama between Verstappen and Norris at the pit exit

Yuki Tsunoda took P12 on his Red Bull debut, a result that the Japanese racer will perhaps be unhappy with after failing to score points, though he did still earn the Driver of the Day accolade from the fans.

Tsunoda's former team mate Pierre Gasly was 13th for Alpine, ahead of Carlos Sainz in the Williams and the other Alpine of Jack Doohan in 15th. Nico Hulkenberg followed in 16th for Kick Sauber, while Racing Bulls returnee Liam Lawson crossed the line in 17th place.

Esteban Ocon claimed P18 for Haas, while Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll rounded out the order in P19 and P20 respectively.

In terms of the championship, Verstappen's victory means that he is now just one point behind Norris at the top of the standings, with Piastri moving up to third ahead of Russell.

Race Highlights: 2025 Japanese Grand Prix

After three practice sessions followed by a thrilling Qualifying – in which Verstappen stormed to an unexpected pole position, beating the McLarens of Norris and Piastri – the attentions of the paddock shifted to the main event, the Japanese Grand Prix.

One change had been made to the starting order prior to the race getting underway, with Sainz moving from 12th to 15th after receiving a three-place grid drop for impeding Hamilton during Q2 of Saturday's Qualifying hour.

Some uncertainty had lingered earlier in the weekend over what the weather might have in store for Sunday's race amid the potential for rain on the forecast. And while showers did indeed hit the circuit in the morning, those had abated by the time that the Grand Prix was about to begin, with the track also quickly drying out in the cool conditions.

As the cars assembled on the grid at the iconic Suzuka Circuit and the tyre blankets came off, it was confirmed that most of the field would be starting on the medium compound, with the exception of Hamilton, Bortoleto and Ocon on the hards and Doohan and Stroll running the softs at the rear of the pack.

As the cars set off for the formation lap, it soon became clear that the racing line had become drier than the other side of the track, meaning that those with odd-number starting slots were on the drier area while the drivers lining up in even-number positions faced a greasier surface.

Verstappen made a smooth start from pole position as the Japanese Grand Prix got underway

When the five lights went out for the 53-lap encounter, Verstappen made a smooth start to hold the lead from pole, with the McLarens also getting away well to maintain their starting positions.

While the top 10 order remained the same, a close fight was unfolding further back between Alonso and Gasly, the two scrapping over P11 before the Aston Martin came out on top, while Bortoleto slipped to the back of the field after running through a damp patch.

Meanwhile Tsunoda had overtaken Lawson – the man he replaced at Red Bull – to move up into 13th within the first three laps, while Antonelli cut a chicane in sixth place though did not gain a position in the Mercedes, with the top 10 standing as Verstappen, Norris, Piastri, Leclerc, Russell, Antonelli, Hadjar, Hamilton, Albon and Bearman.

Up at the front, Verstappen had built a gap of more than one second from Norris by Lap 5. But things were not running entirely smoothly for the World Champion, who reported that his upshifts were “really bad” in the Red Bull.

After getting his hard tyres up to temperature, Hamilton made a move on Hadjar to claim seventh place on Lap 6, with his Mercedes replacement Antonelli the next in his sights a further two seconds up the road.

Piastri was continuing to run in the DRS of Norris – having remained within a second of his team mate – while Verstappen had stretched his lead out to two seconds, the Dutchman reporting that his upshifts were feeling better following those earlier issues.

In an update that may have been more welcome to some than others, Norris was told by his engineer that rain could possibly fall on Lap 20, though stressed that this “doesn't change our plan”.

Elsewhere Stroll became the first driver to pit on Lap 10, the Canadian swapping his soft tyres for the hard compound to emerge in last place. There was trouble further up the order for Albon in ninth, who complained that the “shifts are so bad” in his Williams.

One driver seemingly a bit happier was Russell, the Mercedes man – who finished on the podium in Australia and China – chasing down Leclerc for fourth place, while Hamilton was also continuing to close in on Antonelli.

Norris was informed that there was “no sign of graining” on any tyre compound as the McLaren driver continued to run some two seconds behind race leader Verstappen by Lap 14, with Piastri just over one second back from his team mate in third.

Norris and Piastri were running in second and third for the opening stages of the race

Russell, meanwhile, had dropped back slightly from Leclerc, and Antonelli in sixth remained 1.8s clear of Hamilton. The top 10 order was completed by Hamilton, Hadjar, Albon and Bearman, and further back Doohan became the latest driver to pit for the hard tyres in P19.

On Lap 18, Norris was told that the area where he and Piastri were losing the most time to Verstappen was in the hairpin, before receiving a message to box to overtake Verstappen – only for the pit crew to then retreat again, meaning that the call was a dummy one in an attempt to get their rivals to stop first.

One driver who did pit, though, was Russell, who stopped for hard tyres on Lap 20 to return to the track in P13 behind Tsunoda. Piastri soon followed, putting him back out in P9 with the hard compound on ahead of Alonso.

A burst of action then ensued in the pit lane, with Verstappen, Norris and Leclerc all visiting the pits, and there was drama when Norris tried to go side-by-side with Verstappen – who, after a slow stop, had the line in the pit lane – at the exit, the McLaren then ending up on the grass and having a moment.

Both drivers voiced their displeasure at the incident over the radio, with Norris claiming that he was forced off the track while Verstappen believed he had right of way. Amidst this drama, Antonelli had taken the lead – leading by four seconds from Hamilton, the man he replaced at Mercedes.

While the stewards noted the incident between Verstappen and Norris, it was soon confirmed that there would be no investigation. Albon, meanwhile, was not happy following his pit stop for Williams, the Thai driver fuming over the radio: “You guys make no sense. Ridiculous.”

As the race reached its halfway point on Lap 27, Antonelli led from Hamilton – both yet to pit – with Verstappen, Norris and Piastri completing the top five. Given that there would be no investigation into what happened at the pit exit, Norris was reminded by his engineer that he would have to overtake Verstappen on the track.

Elsewhere, Sainz – still running on old medium tyres – was trying to defend against a chasing Hadjar in a scrap for P9, with the Racing Bulls rookie getting past the Williams into Turn 1. Hamilton, meanwhile, had a lock-up in the Ferrari, which allowed Verstappen to snatch P2 before the Briton subsequently made his pit stop for the medium rubber, dropping down to P7.

After holding the lead well for numerous laps, Antonelli dived into the pits on Lap 32, bringing him back out in sixth on the hard tyres – but with his stop being slightly slow, the Italian had Hamilton right on his tail.

Plenty of teamwork was playing out across the field, with Ocon asked to let Haas team mate Bearman by, while Gasly also swapped places with fellow Alpine driver Doohan. Meanwhile Sainz and Lawson had both bolted on the soft tyres after going long on their opening stints, potentially making them ones to watch as the race entered its latter stages.

Antonelli held the lead for several laps before eventually making his pit stop

On Lap 36 – with the gap at the front standing at 1.5s – Verstappen was told by race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase that he could push until the end, with Norris still in second ahead of Piastri in third, while Leclerc, Russell, Antonelli, Hamilton, Hadjar, Albon and Bearman completing the top 10.

One man not running in the points was Tsunoda, having stepped up to Red Bull for his debut with the team in front of his home crowd. The Japanese driver was down in 12th, though still ahead of Lawson in 17th for Racing Bulls.

Things were getting intriguing at the front for the McLaren pair, with birthday boy Piastri rapidly closing in on Norris while Verstappen remained 1.4s clear in the lead. Was an intra-team battle on the cards for the final 10 laps?

“I think I have the pace to get Max,” Piastri told his engineer – before Norris relayed the same message in terms of his own pace. The Briton then seemingly backed this up by breaking clear of Piastri and starting to cut into Verstappen's lead.

Elsewhere, Antonelli set a new fastest lap of the race during what had been another impressive event for the 18-year-old, having built a gap of seven seconds back to Hamilton. Fellow rookies Hadjar and Bearman were also continuing to run in the points in eighth and 10th respectively.

As the race entered into its final five laps, Verstappen remained 1.3s ahead of Norris – but Piastri was again getting agonisingly close to his team mate, with the gap at times closing to just half a second. Antonelli, meanwhile, was trying to chase down fellow Mercedes driver Russell.

Verstappen ultimately remained untouchable at the front, crossing the line 1.4s clear of Norris – and while the Briton had a bit of a messy moment across the final chicane on the last lap, he kept P2 ahead of Piastri, the Australian calling Norris' move “cheeky” over the team radio.

Leclerc took fourth for Ferrari, with Russell and Antonelli following in fifth and sixth respectively, meaning that the top six drivers remained in the same classification as they had started in.

Hamilton, meanwhile, moved up one place from his grid slot in seventh, with Hadjar scoring his first points of the campaign in eighth place. Albon added a further two points to Williams' tally in P9, while Bearman rounded out the top 10 for Haas.

Hadjar scored his first points of the season for Racing Bulls in eighth place

Alonso missed out on points in P11, but did record his first finish of the season after retiring in both the Australian and Chinese Grands Prix. Tsunoda followed in P12 on his Red Bull debut, though the Japanese driver was still crowned Driver of the Day in the fan vote.

Gasly, Sainz and Doohan took the positions from 13th to 15th – meaning that Alpine are still looking for their first points of the year – while Hulkenberg was 16th and Lawson ended his first race back at the wheel of the Racing Bulls machine in 17th place.

Ocon claimed P18 in the Haas, with Bortoleto and Stroll rounding out the top 10 for the third round of a 24-race campaign.

Verstappen has now taken four consecutive victories at the Suzuka Circuit

""It was tough, just pushing very hard especially on the last set,"" said Verstappen. ""The two McLarens were pushing me very hard and it was a lot of fun out there. Not easy of course to manage the tyres but I'm incredibly happy. It started off quite tough this weekend but we didn't give up, we kept improving the car and today it was in its best form. Of course starting on pole really made it possible to win this race.""

Kimi Antonelli became the youngest driver to lead a race in Formula 1 history at the Japanese Grand Prix, rounding off a simultaneously rewarding and demanding weekend for the Mercedes rookie.

Antontelli was somewhat taken aback after he qualified in sixth place for the 53-lap race, explaining that he was struggling to adapt to the circuit, which he had never competed at in his junior career.

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch up on Verstappen's stellar victory at the Japanese Grand Prix

But despite his apprehension, the Italian achieved an impressive result as he crossed the line in his Qualifying position, having led the race for a number of laps after the frontrunners pitted for fresh tyres.

In just his third race for Mercedes, Antonelli proved that he can keep up with his more experienced team mate George Russell – he finished just over 1.3s behind the Briton, taking his total to 30 points for the season.

Antonelli: P6 finish – and leading the race – ‘a good boost of confidence'

“It was a nice feeling,"" the Italian said on being the youngest driver to lead a race.

""But what I'm most happy about is the fact that we had good pace, much better than China – especially on the hards, I felt really good out there and was able to put consistent laps in.

“I was definitely much, much happier with how I finished the weekend because it was a really difficult start. Mentally, it was quite tough as well because when you start so far back, it's difficult to make the switch.

“I was also happy with how Qualifying went, and today I did another step in terms of driving so definitely a good boost of confidence ahead of next weekend.”

Russell was left frustrated that they were unable to take the fight to the frontrunners

Meanwhile, Russell appeared slightly more downbeat as he took P5, insisting that he and the team had failed to maximise the performance of the car throughout the competitive sessions.

“We definitely missed out yesterday,” he explained. “That was the first Qualifying in as long as I can remember where we did not get the potential from the car.

“Was the potential higher up the order? I don't know how much higher we could have gone, but I know that there was a good couple of tenths in it, and that ultimately paid a big price for today. Bahrain is going to be a new test.”

Max Verstappen loves Suzuka, as shown by his superb pole lap for Red Bull. The question now is will he be able to stay ahead of the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri when the lights go out in Japan.

Or could the joker in the starting pack be Charles Leclerc? The Ferrari star is fourth on the grid, four spots up on team mate Lewis Hamilton. Between the scarlet cars sit the Mercedes duo of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, and the Racing Bulls machine of rookie Isack Hadjar.

Completing the top 10 are Williams' Alex Albon and the Haas of Oliver Bearman. Albon's team mate Carlos Sainz had been due to start 12th, but has been penalised three places for impeding Hamilton during Qualifying.

And what of the home favourite Yuki Tsunoda you ask? The Japanese driver will start his first Grand Prix for Red Bull from P14 – one place behind the man he replaced at the team, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson.

Charles Leclerc was left disappointed with the outcome of his Japanese Grand Prix, with the Monegasque admitting that Ferrari have “got to work” on their performance after a maximised race saw him finish in P4 while Lewis Hamilton endured a “lonely” drive to P7.

After lining up in fourth on the grid, Leclerc remained in this position when the chequered flag fell, having fended off a possible challenge from Mercedes' George Russell during the latter stages.

Crossing the line some 15 seconds behind the McLaren of Oscar Piastri in third, the Scuderia driver reflected on his afternoon at Suzuka: “It was a very boring race for me! The McLarens were too fast in front and I was trying to manage the gap with George behind – he was a little bit faster at the end, I was a little bit faster in the middle part of the race.

“But that's the absolute best we could do, and it's a bit of a shame that there's not more in the car. I'm happy in a way because after a weekend like this we've done so much, and on Friday I feel like I found a way to help me maximise the car more for the future, so that's good.

Leclerc: P4 ‘the absolute best we could do'

“But I'm not happy that, whenever we maximised our result, that means it's a P4, that is the best result we can do, and we've got to work on that.”

Looking ahead to the next race on the calendar in Bahrain – the second stop in a triple header sequence that concludes in Saudi Arabia – Leclerc voiced his hopes that the learnings from Japan may prove beneficial.

“For Bahrain, I will keep working in the direction that I have been working in on Friday and see if that helps us,” he explained.

“But I think there's not much more performance in the car than what we are seeing now. We just need new parts and, if we have them soon enough, I'm sure that will at least be a solution to our problems.”

Hamilton reflects on ‘pretty lonely race' after P7 finish at Suzuka

As for team mate Hamilton, the seven-time World Champion stretched out his opening stint on the hard tyre and, while he overtook Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar to gain a position in the early stages, the Briton was ultimately unable to make any further ground during the remainder of the Grand Prix.

“It was a pretty lonely race, I didn't have anyone really around me,” Hamilton said later on. “I had a fairly decent start considering I was on the hard tyres, [I did] quite a bit of warm-up on that tyre the first few laps and [it was] really hard to keep up with everyone else on the mediums.

“I went as long as I could but generally didn't have the pace of Mercedes, for example, or the guys that were ahead of me, so it was pretty straightforward.”

Asked for his perspective on where Ferrari stand with their current package – and whether he had taken further learnings from his third weekend with the team – Hamilton responded: “Yeah, I think it looks like we are third, [or] Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes and then us sort of thing, so we've got some improvements to make.”

FIA post-race press conference – Japan

Max Verstappen's vice-like grip on Suzuka supremacy continued in 2025's edition of the Japanese Grand Prix, but the World Champion's fourth successive win here was far from the only fascinating fact to emerge after a tense 53 laps…

•	Verstappen is unbeaten in Qualifying or the race at Suzuka since 2019.

•	Verstappen is the first driver ever to win four Grands Prix in a row at Suzuka.

•	It was Verstappen's 64th career win, exactly double the total of Fernando Alonso.

REPORT: Verstappen surges to fourth consecutive Japanese GP victory ahead of Norris and Piastri

•	Verstappen's win gave Honda victory at their home circuit in their final Suzuka appearance with Red Bull.

•	Red Bull become the first team to win eight times at Suzuka, surpassing McLaren and Ferrari.

•	Verstappen had only led two laps this season before today.

Yet again Charles Leclerc missed the Suzuka podium by a single place

•	Lando Norris finished second and leads the Drivers' Championship by one point over Verstappen.

•	Norris has not finished lower than second in a Grand Prix this season.

•	With Oscar Piastri following Norris home in P3, McLaren have now scored more podium finishes at Suzuka (26) than any other constructor.

•	Piastri scored points for the 29th consecutive race weekend (the longest active streak in F1).

•	Verstappen, Norris and Piastri were separated by 0.044s in Qualifying, but finished in that order in the race.

DRIVER OF THE DAY: Tsunoda's your star in first Red Bull outing on home soil

•	Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth at Suzuka for the third consecutive season.

•	Leclerc's P4 is Ferrari's best Grand Prix result of the season, even including China, where Leclerc finished fifth before disqualification.

•	Today was Leclerc's 150th Grand Prix start.

•	The top four finished in the same order as they did in the 2023 Japanese Grand Prix.

•	At Mercedes, George Russell's P5 was his best career finish at Suzuka.

•	Team mate Kimi Antonelli finished in P6, in the process becoming the youngest driver ever to lead a Grand Prix (18 years 224 days).

•	Antonelli also set the fastest lap and again is the youngest driver to do so (surpassing Verstappen at 19 years 44 days in Brazil 2016).

No points, but Fernando Alonso at least finished a GP for the first time in 2025

•	The top six finished in grid order for the first time on a permanent race track in F1 history (Monaco 2018, Singapore 2018, and Monaco 2024 are the others – that's discounting the one-lap 2021 Belgian Grand Prix).

•	Lewis Hamilton' P7 was his best Grand Prix result since joining Ferrari.

•	Hamilton was the only top-10 starter to gain a position during the Grand Prix.

•	At Racing Bulls, Isack Hadjar secured his maiden points finish in F1 with P8.

•	Racing Bulls scored for the first time this season.

•	Bearman has now scored in consecutive Grands Prix.

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch up on Verstappen's stellar victory at the Japanese Grand Prix

•	Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, with P11, reached the chequered flag in a Grand Prix for the first time this season.

•	Red Bull's new recruit Yuki Tsunoda took P12, matching Liam Lawson's result in this car at the last Grand Prix.

•	All 20 cars were classified as finishers for the fifth time since the start of last season, and the third time in Suzuka history (after 2015 and 2016).

•	There has been only one mechanically-related retirement at Suzuka since 2018 (Zhou Guanyu's gearbox failed in 2024).

Warner Bros.' kid-friendly movie blew past all expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, as well as rouse the beleaguered box office back to life.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The box office blues have been banished in historic fashion.


Warner Bros.' A Minecraft Movie, made with help from Legendary Pictures, struck gold with a record-shattering $157 million opening domestically and $144 million overseas for a global start of $301 million.




	The film came in tens of millions ahead of expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, besting the $146.4 three-day launch of Universal Pictures' The Super Mario Bros. Movie over Easter weekend in 2023. (Opening on a Wednesday, Mario Bros. earned $204 million through Easter Sunday.)

					Box Office: 'A Minecraft Movie' Is Minting Gold With an $135-Plus Domestic Debut		
			









A Minecraft Movie easily boasts the top start of 2025 to date and, just as noteworthy, is the biggest domestic launch since Deadpool & Wolverine in July 2024 ($211 million). Saturday's gross of $60 million is the biggest in the history of Warners, not adjusted for inflation. Legendary put up 25 percent of the $150 million production budget (that doesn't include marketing costs).




			Popular on THR		







	The star-studded, high-wattage ensemble pic couldn't have come at a better time. The 2025 box office has seen its fortunes fall off dramatically in recent weeks. Minecraft is just the shot of confidence Hollywood studios and cinema owners needed after pics including Disney's Snow White bit the poisoned apple. 


	It's also a needed victory for embattled Warner Bros. movie studio chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, and for the studio overall. Ditto for Legendary, whose movie chief Mary Parent — known for her deft handling of big IP — is a credited producer and is given major props for suggesting that Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre) be hired to direct the pic.


	“We're absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world,” Abdy and De Luca said in statement thanking all involved, from Hess to the cast to Legendary and Vertigo, another producing partner. They also thanked their marketing and distribution teams. “A Minecraft Movie's decade long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP's Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.”


Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Jennifer Coolidge and Danielle Brooks star in the PG-rated film, as well as Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen. The movie, based on the Mojang Studios video game of the same name, centers around four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they must master their new reality's quirks while embarking on a quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, as Black steps into the shoes of the iconic character Steve.

	











	Warners global distribution chief Jeff Goldstein said the film worked everywhere, from small towns to the biggest cities. And, reached in London, Parent said the opening is a both a reflection of the mandate to celebrate the world of Minecraft in a joyful way, and the singular experience that only theatrical can offer. “This game is a global phenomenon,” she said.


	Minecraft is the the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold an an estimated 174 million active monthly players in 2024 (Microsoft bought Mojang in 2014).


	On Saturday morning, based on Friday's huge haul of $58 million, insiders at Warner Bros. projected a $135 million domestic start. Some rival studios thought it had a shot at as much as $150 million, but massive walk-up business saw the final tally come in even higher.


	Not even so-so reviews or a B+ CinemaScore dinged A Minecraft Movie (moviegoers under 18 gave it a perfect A). 


	Exit polls from PostTrak did the best job at explaining the movie's out-of-this world start: Teens between ages 13 and 17 made up 35 percent of the audience, while the largest quad was between ages 18 and 24, according to those with access to the data. Those are the demos best known for repeat viewing. Families also turned out in force, while males — as expected — dominated at 65 percent to 67 percent of the audience. General audiences and parents/kids gave the movie four out of five stars on PostTrak, while kids delivered five out of five.

	











	Overseas, A Minecraft Movie is even showing promise in China, where it topped the weekend chart with $14.6 million, the best showing of any Hollywood title this year. Legendary East is handling the film in China.


	“This was lightning in a bottle,” said Goldstein.


	Final numbers will be released Monday, and no one at Warners — or rival studios — will be surprised if grosses end up being higher.


	The next-closest film was A Working Man, which came in No. 2 with $7.3 million. Distributed by Amazon MGM Studios in the U.S., the pic has earned $27.8 million in its first 10 days of release. Fathom's screening of part two of The Chosen: Last Supper followed closely with $7.2 million.


Snow White, now in its third weekend, placed No. 4 with $6.1 million domestically for a tepid global total of $168.4 million. 


	Numbers will be updated Monday morning.

Authorities in Mexico City shut down the event at Bicentennial Park following the tragic accident and death of the photographers.

	Natalia Cano



	The AXE Ceremonia festival, which was taking place this weekend at an ecological park in Mexico City, was suspended by local authorities following the death of two people on Saturday (April 5) when a crane transporting a decorative metal object collapsed. 


	The cancellation was confirmed on Sunday (April 6) in a message on X by the Miguel Hidalgo mayor's office, the borough where the event venue is located.


	“The teams from the Miguel Hidalgo Government and Legal Affairs, along with the borough's Civil Protection department and the Administrative Verification Institute of Mexico City, completed the inspection and placed suspension seals at the entrances to AXE Ceremonia in Bicentennial Park,” the mayor's office stated in its message.

	Mexican newspaper El Universal confirmed the identity of the victims, Miguel Angel Rojas, 26, and Berenice Giles, 28, of structure collapse. They were photographers. Music portal Mr. Indie also confirmed this on Sunday, through a statement.


	“With deep sadness we say goodbye to our friends and colleagues, Berenice Giles and Miguel Hernandez, who lost their lives while doing their journalistic work. Both were an essential part of Mr. Indie, a media that exists thanks to the passion of people like them,” the document states. “From our space, we want to honor their dedication, their love for music and photography, and their commitment to this project that was also theirs”.


	The festival corroborated the incident through an Instagram story. Following the events, the Mexico City Prosecutor's Office announced that it has launched an investigation to determine the corresponding responsibilities.

	The festival also confirmed the deaths on their Instagram stories. “With deep sadness, we confirm the passing of the two people who were injured during today's incident,” AXE Ceremonia published. “We are deeply heartbroken by this loss. We are reaching out to their families to support them during this incredibly difficult time and to provide them with all our care and solidarity. The safety of our community has always been our priority, and we continue, as from the very beginning, to maintain close collaboration and complete transparency with the authorities. We will continue to share official updates about the event through our social media channels.”

	











	The company ECO Live, the festival's producer, had not responded to a request for information from Billboard Español.


	The accident occurred around 5:30 p.m. (local time) when a gust of wind shook a metal structure that fell on two people, according to a statement from the Mexico City Government, issued through the Secretariat of Comprehensive Risk Management and Civil Protection.

	“The mentioned structure fell on two people who received pre-hospital care at the scene, and were later urgently transported to the hospital, where they unfortunately passed away,” authorities wrote in the statement.


	A photojournalist who captured images of the metal structure collapse shortly after it happened told Billboard Español that, following the crash, several attendees near the point where the crane fell tried to move it to assist the victims trapped beneath it. Paramedics and police officers quickly arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area, as attested by Billboard Español.


	“Paramedics from the company hired by the event organizers provided medical attention to a man and a woman for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and various fractures at the site of the collapse,” detailed the Mexican Government on Saturday night in an informational statement through the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) Bienestar program.

	The Head of Government of Mexico City, Clara Brugada, addressed the incident in a message on X, where she expressed her sorrow over the events and extended her solidarity to the families and friends of the victims. She also thanked the “quick and efficient response” of the relevant personnel “who acted diligently to secure the area and request immediate medical attention.”

	











	“We will closely monitor the corresponding investigations by the Mexico City Prosecutor's Office to determine responsibilities,” added the local leader.

Atentos de los lamentables hechos ocurridos esta tarde en el Parque Bicentenario. Mi solidaridad con familiares y amigos de las personas que desafortunadamente perdieron la vida tras el accidente. Agradezco la rápida y eficiente respuesta del personal de la @PBI_SSC, de la…


	The mayor of Miguel Hidalgo, Mauricio Tabe, also addressed the incident and expressed his solidarity with the families of the victims. “I deeply regret what happened today during a private event at Bicentennial Park. My deepest solidarity goes out to the families of the victim,” the mayor wrote on X. 


	According to a statement issued by the Miguel Hidalgo mayor's office, the incident may have been caused by the installation of additional cranes by the organizers, which had not been included in the program submitted to authorities for the pre-festival inspection.


	Local authorities stated that, as this was a private event, the project director and the official in charge of Civil Protection, both hired by the festival organizers, will be subject to the investigation initiated by the Mexico City Prosecutor's Office.

	Following the crane collapse and the two fatalities it caused, AXE Ceremonia continued on Saturday with headline performances by corridos tumbados superstar Natanael Cano, British pop diva Charli XCX, and South Korean boy band Tomorrow X Together, according to Billboard Español. The festival's director, Diego Jiménez, had stated in a prior interview that an attendance of 55,000 people was expected on the first day.


	On Sunday (April 6), the second day of the festival's activities, the highly anticipated return of British trip-hop group Massive Attack to Mexico City had been expected, along with performances by American rapper Tyler, The Creator, Argentine duo Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso, Argentine-Spanish artist Nathy Peluso, and California-based indie pop band The Marías, among others.

	











	Festival organizers confirmed on a social media post that those performances have been canceled and that ticket buyers will be automatically refunded via Ticketmaster.

	Billboard Women in Music 2025 was full of love and sisterhood. If you couldn't make it, don't worry: We're here to catch you up on everything you missed at this year's show. From Drew Afualo reading Muni Long's birth chart to aespa snapping pics on a Polaroid to Ángela Aguilar's passionate performance of “Cielito Lindo,” keep watching for exclusive BTS moments and updates from the big night!


	Rania Aniftos:


	I had so much fun interviewing honorees, presenters and guests with my fellow correspondent, Jazzy. By the way, some of our talent were more starstruck by Jazzy than anyone else. Benedict Polizzi gave our ladies some polite catcalls that made them giggle as they walked in to claim their awards. The room was filled with sisterly love as the women honored each other for their impressive achievements in music, to which only they can relate. Tina Knowles honored her daughters in her speech. Ángela Aguilar's speech made us tear up as she honored immigrant women and called for their safety. Putting her money where her mouth is, she even had a local children's choir from the Harmony Project performing with her. Ángela continued to honor under-resourced communities backstage. The party continued in our portrait studio with all the ladies catching up and taking flicks. We had our girl Drew Afualo giving flowers backstage as she interviewed our honorees. And of course, like the Virgo she is, Drew read Billboard Birth Charts. We asked talent to give a love letter to the women of the world and sign it. Making sure to take polaroids of everyone who stepped into our interview lounge for our Billboard polaroid collection. Gracie Abrams thanked Taylor Swift as she accepted Songwriter of the Year before she performed “I Love You, I'm Sorry.” Summer Walker presented the Icon Erykah Badu with her award, and her outfit left us speechless. Billboard's Group of the Year aespa visited our backstage lounge minutes before heading onstage for the final performance of the night. Back behind the scenes, the night ended on a high note with our Woman of the Year Doechii giving Erykah Badu her flowers. Doechii also made sure to give the women on her team their flowers too. Another memorable Billboard Women in Music for the books!

Eva Longoria says she'd be the first person to sign up for a reboot of Desperate Housewives, the TV show that made her a household name.


	The American actress was one of the breakout stars of the hit drama that debuted in 2004 and ran for eight seasons. This weekend, she told Stellar magazine about the prospect of signing on for a reboot: “I would be the first person.”


	Longoria said she was “super proud” of the hit series' legacy, reflecting that its popularity helped pave the way for more female-led dramas.

	She added that, as the youngest of the show's cast to grab the spotlight through their roles on Wisteria Lane, the overnight attention caught her by surprise, recalling a trip to London when a crowd gathered outside her hotel. She recounted:


	“I said: ‘Is Bono here?' And they said: ‘No, they are here for you, that's why they are out there.' I couldn't believe they would even know me, because I'd never been to London. And that [realisation of the global reach of the show] was really weird and great at the same time.”


	She said of the first time she read the script for the show: “I only knew it was super special because it was odd. It was the first time I had read a dramedy, so I didn't get it.”

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


UPDATED: Lorne Michaels may have stewarded Saturday Night Live through half a century, but it's not like the late-night show is immune to snafus. During a call-and-response bit by the perennially charismatic Ego Nwodim on Weekend Update, the audience let out one of the FCC‘s “seven dirty words” — which has now been retroactively scrubbed as seen on the series' social media pages.


	The uncensored version saw, or rather heard, the audience shout “sh-t” as Nwodim's stand-up alter ego Ms. Eggy teed up a “These men ain't what?” Naturally, the crowd did not hold back, shouting the profanity before the censors on NBC's East Coast feed and Peacock could do anything about it. (Earlier during the bit, Nwodim's character began, “Ms. Eggy don't what?” as the audience responded, “Play.” It was part of a routine in response to the White House Correspondents Association pulling Amber Ruffin as a featured entertainer during its annual DC dinner.)

	While the audio on X is now completely eliminated, viewers can still see Nwodim and Weekend Update co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che's shocked reactions. The lattermost two were visibly startled, as Jost threw his hands up in surprise and Che could be seen exclaiming and sitting back.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Nwodim, a seasoned repertory player, took it all in stride, ad-libbing jokes like “We're finna get fired for that” and “Y'all gonna have to pay for that, Lorne's gonna be mad at y'all.” 


	An SNL spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment late Saturday night.


	It's currently unclear if any fines will be levied by the FCC against the show, given that the expletive made it onto NBC stations on the East Coast and the streamer. 


	It is worth noting the the audience profanity on Weekend Update was caught in time during the additional few-second delay on NBC's Mountain and West Coast feeds. The moment seems improvised and was clearly unexpected, though it's not difficult to guess where the audience — who may have been unaware of longstanding broadcast rules — was headed linguistically. That direction could make all the difference, especially when it comes to an activist FCC. 


	Per FCC guidelines, sh–, piss, f—, c–t, c–ksucker, motherf—er, t-ts and variations of these phrases are not allowed on public airwaves. Ironically enough, it was SNL‘s inaugural host George Carlin whose segment on the radio led to a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1978's FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, ensuring that the federal government could regulate speech on broadcast television and on radio based on a number of factors including method of transmission and time of day; additionally, the words need not be profane to warrant limited civil sanctions.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	A week after Morgan Wallen stalked off Saturday Night Live, the NBC late-nighter made sure the door hit the hit the “I'm the Problem” singer on the way out.


	“Get me to God's county,” mocked Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) in a direct swipe at controversy-inviting Wallen's merch-inspiring post-SNL March 29 Instagram of his private jet heading to Nashville and the caption, “Get me to God's country.” Coming at the tail end of SNL's ripping of POTUS' April 2 borderline incoherent Liberation Day tariffs speech, the jibe at Wallen's discourtesy got a roar from the crowd in Studio 8H.

	











	Beyond the witty takedown of the just plain rude Wallen, Liberation Day came to Saturday Night Live tonight, as did the Cheesecake Factory menu and once again Mike Myers.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Back as Elon Musk for Trump's rambling Rose Garden announcement of reciprocal tariffs kneecapping the global economy, Myers' literally and figuratively glitchy DOGE chief offered an increasingly anti-Tesla America a new electric option. “We are introducing the new Tesla Model V, the first electric car in history to be fully self-vandalizing,” Myers' Musk proclaimed.


	Building off Musk's unpopularity and the widespread attacks on Tesla dealerships and cars across America, Europe in the real world, SNL‘s Model V comes with “features like self-smashing headlights, self-slashing tires, and AI-powered graffiti,” Myers' Musk promised. And then the right-wing South African stepped it up: “You can choose from penises or swastikas, or my favorite: swastikas made out of penises!”


	Johnson's Trump said it for all of us: “Swastikas and penises. We're truly the party of Lincoln.”


	When it comes to Trump's tariffs, SNL cut to the chase tonight. 


	“Your money's gone, but that okay, we'll figure it out,” declared Johnson's Trump in yet another pitch-perfect capture of the White House occupant by the cast member.


	Or put it another way: Trump 2.0 hasn't been that great for the rule of law and many portions of America, but it's sure been great for SNL cold opens, to paraphrase ex-CBS boss Les Moonves.


	An eleventh-hour TikTok deadline extension, crashing stock markets and rumors of the DOGE departure of Musk were among the pickings out of this week's headlines for tonight, with the latter clearly making the cut to some degree. Additional possibilities also include the record-busting upper chamber marathon speech by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), revelations of more Signal group chats by the National Security Advisor, the firing of the NSA chief on the advice of MAGA influencer Laura Loomer, and a former Celebrity Apprentice host who spent a lot of time golfing in Florida while almost all the apple carts were overturned. While the potential bomb threat against the SNL studio earlier this week by an apparent Scarlett Johansson thankfully didn't make the cut, another cold open topic could have been Saturday's well attended anti-MAGA Hands Off marches and protest across the nation and the globe.

	











	Going large and close to home was one of the best choices any cold open could make, as was having SNL legend Myers back for a third time since Trump returned to office.


	Back for his fourth stint as host, and for the first tome in 20 years, Jack Black is riding high this weekend with the massive box office debut of A Minecraft Movie. Co-starring Jason Momoa, the Warner Bros/Legendary adaptation of the addictive video game took vidgame flicks to the next level with an opening-weekend haul of $260 million.


	Adding to the gold-plated nature of tonight's 16th episode of the 50th SNL season (and 984th episode overall of the Lorne Micheals-created late-nightery) is the return of Elon John for his third spin on the show over his more than 50-year career. Plugging his new album with the wonderfully ubiquitous Brandi Carlile, the EGOT winner is the musical guest this week with Oscar nominee Carlile, who is back for her third time too.


	Back with another new show next week, SNL will be hosted by Jon Hamm for a fourth time as the Mad Men and 30 Rock vet's new series Your Friends and Neighbors launches on Apple TV+. Also back for a fourth time on SNL, Lizzo is the musical guest next week. The Grammy winner has been the musical guest twice before and did double duty as host and musical guest on April 16, 2022.

	Although The Last of Us drags viewers through the emotional depths of the human experience, none go through it quite possibly as much as star Pedro Pascal.


	The Golden Globe nominee recently explained why the series, which returns to Max for Season 2 on April 13, puts him in “an unhealthy mindset” as he reprises his role as post-apocalyptic smuggler Joel Miller.


	“It's this experience, more than any I've had. It's hard for me to separate what the characters are going through and how it makes me feel,” he told People.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“In a way that isn't very healthy,” added Pascal. “And so, I kind of feel their pain I suppose, so I suppose I was in an unhealthy mindset.”

	











	After the Season 1 finale saw Joel riding off with an unconscious Ellie (Bella Ramsey), saving her from scientists that planned to experiment on her to find a cure for the Cordyceps infection, Pascal noted it's the “fiercely protective” nature of the character that he relates to most.


	“I think that storytelling is cathartic in so many ways, always has been,” explained Pascal. “It's the way that the human beings have made testimony to life.”


	At this weekend's Deadline Contenders TV event, Ramsey noted that there's “definitely some doubt” between Ellie and Joel this season, “so I think that plays a big part in the shift in the relationship.”


	“It's really difficult playing being cold to him … it's sadder for sure,” added Ramsey about the emotional toll of the show. “And it will continue to just get sadder and more cold … so look forward to that.”

Country singer Miranda Lambert has given her signature blond locks the boot, at least temporarily.

On her Instagram account, the “Little Red Wagon” singer posted pictures of herself sporting long bright blue hair topped by a bright blue cowboy hat. The singer's pants shimmered like mermaid scales, which was the look she was going for. 

In the caption, Lambert explained, “Just old friends makin new memories.

Round top antiques week 2025Under The Sea prom with @junkgypsy. My favorite theme yet!”

Miranda is flanked on either side by “Junk Gypsies” Amie Sikes and Jolie Sikes-Smith, also decked out in mermaid-inspired finery. The designer duo is known to fans for their eclectic antiques and thrift finds.

Lambert was attending their annual “Under the Sea” Junk-O-Rama Prom” during “Texas Antiques Week at the famous Round Top Antiques Fair.

A post shared by Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert)

A post shared by JG Co. (@junkgypsy)

In Miranda's post, the “Junk Gypsies” replied thanking fans for letting the singer be a “normal person” during her visit, writing, “🩵🧜‍♀️🤠🩵So glad us cowgirl mermaids got to add another adventure to the scrapbook. It's getting REAL full! Also THANK YOU to all our amazing friends & customers that let Miranda be a “normal” person and just have fun at prom! We've said it before and we'll say it again, our customers are THE BEST!!!”

And that's a big ask in a big crowd. According to Round Top's website, every spring, fall and winter, more than one-hundred thousand shoppers from all over the country and world visit Round Top, Texas, which normally boasts a population of just 90 people.

Meanwhile, Miranda's fans were here for the blue hair and mermaid/cowgirl mash up.  

One commented, “Those sure are three cute mermaids,” while another fan said, “Miranda the country queen 💐🤠”

Still another wrote, “Blue is your color 💙 glad your havin some well deserved fun!”

A post shared by Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert)

Miranda was able to hit the Junk Gypsies' “Junk-O-Rama Prom” just before a scheduled tour date in Georgetown, Texas April 5 at the Two Step Inn.

The singer will hit the road with Morgan Wallen for his “I'm the Problem” tour this summer. Lambert will open for Wallen at ten of his 19 tour stops across the country and in Canada.

A post shared by Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert)

Lambert will be supporting her latest album, “Postcards from Texas,” which debuted at number one last September on the iTunes chart according to “Forbes.”

A post shared by Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert)

But she's also celebrating a milestone. It's been 20 years since Lambert took country music by storm with the fiery release of her hit album “Kerosene.”  To mark the anniversary, Lambert has just released the 20-year-old album on vinyl for the first time ever, adding a never-before released track from the original album sessions called “I Don't Love Here Anymore,” according to “Music Row.“

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sons of Anarchy Reboot: Everything Revealed By the Cast So Far","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/sons-of-anarchy-reboot-rumors/","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 04:55:37 GMT","

Rumors have started to swirl, and speculation is mounting among fans about a potential “Sons of Anarchy” reboot. Created by Kurt Sutter, the series originally aired from 2008 to 2014 and followed the criminal exploits of an outlaw motorcycle club in a fictional California town.

After seven acclaimed seasons, the show concluded with a dramatic finale and later inspired the spinoff, “Mayans M.C.” Now, comments from cast members are fueling discussions about a possible return and it is generating significant buzz. Here's what we know so far about these intriguing developments.

During a recent panel for the movie Emily the Criminal, star Theo Rossi—who portrayed hacker and intelligence officer Juice Ortiz on SOA—was asked about a possible reboot or spinoff. 

“There might be something coming up where we're all back together, which is insane… If it happens, it's wild, but if it doesn't, it would be perfect and really cool because we also talk every day,” Rossi revealed.

This cryptic statement, first reported by Deadline, suggested a new project could reunite him with co-stars, including Charlie Hunnam. However, both Juice and Hunnam's Jax Teller met tragic ends in the original series, raising questions about how such a reunion could occur.

Hunnam's Jax Teller was the heart of “Sons of Anarchy,” but he appeared to die in the series finale. Fans will never forget when he rode his motorcycle into an oncoming semi-trailer as a sacrificial act reminiscent of Hamlet. This connection was even emphasized with a Shakespearean quote. 

Jax's death seemed final, but the lack of a body has fueled speculation. Is it possible that he faked it?

A “Sons of Anarchy” spinoff doesn't necessarily mean a continuation of Jax's story, though. Another possibility is a sequel series focused on Jax's sons, Abel and Thomas. This would allow for Jax to appear in flashbacks or in dreams. 

At Liverpool Comic Con in 2022, Hunnam actually pitched a different angle for a sequel when he mentioned a project that “doesn't involve Jax Teller, but does involve me.” He described this fresh narrative at the time as being in the early stages, with “the ingredients just being measured out.”

He also teased a potential return while speaking to Access Hollywood.

“I have an idea that I'm exploring in its infancy where that could be a possibility.

“It would be something that I would be incredibly excited about, so we're sort of, like I said, in the infancy of exploring the viability of the idea,” he told the outlet.

Since “Sons of Anarchy” ended more than a decade ago, Hunnam has built a diverse resume in both film and television. He starred in “Crimson Peak” (2015), “The Lost City of Z” (2016), “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” (2017), and “The Gentlemen” (2019). 

He also had supporting roles in “Triple Frontier” (2019) and “Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire” (2023). 

Looking ahead, Hunnam recently wrapped filming on season 3 of the Netflix hit, “Monster.” He is also set to lead “Criminal”, an upcoming TV adaptation of Ed Brubaker's comic series, alongside Emilia Clarke and Luke Evans.

Despite his busy schedule, Hunnam remains tied to “Sons.” He reiterated at Liverpool Comic Con in 2023 that a non-Jax project was in development, but it was still in the very early stages. Fans will just have to wait and see what happens.

All seven seasons of “Sons of Anarchy” are streaming on Hulu.

Tell us! Would you like to see the return of “Sons of Anarchy” in some way? Let us know in the comments below.

Justin Bieber has been extra active on social media as the month of April kicks off. He posted lots of memes and an announcement about his new clothing line, Skylrk, before sharing a tribute to the “Love On the Brain” singer.

Bieber took to his Instagram Stories to repost a video of the starlet from the Instagram account @magicalsing that was captioned, “Rihanna's not just an artist-she's a whole era.”

Bieber appeared to be in the mood to listen to music, as he had posted a YouTube clip of his own music  , slowed down 800%, right before the mention.

His next post was a clip of another singer, Nati Livian, doing a cover of the Gracie Abrams hit “That's So True.” The video was captioned, “I could listen to him all day.”

The latest post to his timeline is a blurry selfie he posted on April 4. One fan found the shot to be nostalgic, commenting, “2016 selfie era.”

Another fan related to Bieber's recent social media spontaneity, writing, “I love it, it's refreshing to see cuz I be doing the same thing and I'm like, oh cool Justin does it too.” The poster was replying to another commenter who said “Bro just posting whatever at this point,” with a cry laughing emoji.

The two musicians seem to have a long-running friendship. They possibly met for the first time when they both attended the 2009 Def Jam Spring collection party.

In the coming years, they would be spotted together sitting courtside during the 2011 NBA all-star game, sharing the stage at the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and posing at the Grammys.

Hola! reported in January 2025 that Bieber asked Rihanna, who hasn't released an album since 2016, to return to the music game. The outlet says the “Holy” singer captioned a clip of the Barbadian beauty performing her hit “Needed Me” with the words, “Missed seeing u sing, Queen.”

Rihanna, who welcomed her sons Riot Rose and RZA nearly back-to-back, promised ET in 2024 that she will eventually release more music, but she needs some time. “I'm rediscovering things. I have been working on the album for so long that I kinda put all that stuff aside and now I'm prepared to go back in the studio. I'm gonna start — give me a second!” said the star.

Former “Real Housewives of Potomac” star Candiace Dillard Bassett is sharing what it would take for her to return to the series after announcing her departure in early 2024. 

While speaking to Entertainment Tonight in March 2025, Dillard Bassett said she would consider eventually returning to the show. She said, however, that her current business opportunities may prevent her from appearing on the Bravo series for some time. 

She also shared what she would need to return to RHOP. 

“Friends. You need friends. People who want to understand you. And who aren't dedicated to misunderstanding you,” said Dillard Bassett to the publication. 

She also said she would consider coming back for a good salary. 

“A good coin. A good old nasty coin is always nice. And for me, that's it. I really enjoyed my time on Potomac. I mean you really can't look at the legacy of the show without me in it. And I'm really proud of that, humbly,” said Dillard Bassett while speaking to Entertainment Tonight. 

A post shared by CANDIACE (@therealcandiace)

During an April 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Dillard Bassett said she decided to leave RHOP after she found out she was pregnant with her son, Jett, whom she shares with her husband, Chris Bassett. 

“I wanted this space around us and around our child to feel peaceful and to feel free and to feel positive,” said Dillard Bassett during the 2024 interview. 

She also said she would consider coming back to RHOP if the show made some major changes. 

“The space would have to be different. I think time is always a teller of all things,” said Dillard Bassett to the publication. 

A post shared by Bravo's The Daily Dish (@bravodailydish)

During a November 2024 interview with People magazine, Dillard Bassett spoke about motherhood. She said Jett, who was born in October 2024, “is just the cutest little thing.”

“Chris and I couldn't be happier. It's so cliché to say, but he's brought such joy to our lives in ways I never would have been able to describe before. It's pure love!” said Dillard Bassett during the People magazine interview. 

She also shared she is looking forward to spending the rest of her life with Jett by her side. 

“I just look at him and envision all the adventures we're going to have. Throughout my pregnancy, when I would talk to him in my stomach, I would say, ‘I can't wait to see who you're going to be.' And that's been the joy in my heart that's continued after his birth. It's exciting to think about. I'm so ready for a lifetime of being on the sidelines, cheering him on,” said Dillard Bassett to People.

Since actress Mindy Cohn skyrocketed to fame in the 80s playing Natalie Green on the hit sitcom “The Facts of Life,” she's enjoyed a wide-ranging career, from voicing “Scooby-Doo” character Velma for more than a decade to her recurring role on the 2024 Apple TV+ show “Palm Royale.” 

In March 2025, Cohn made her Hallmark Channel debut, appearing as a foster mom in the network's four back-to-back “Hearts Around the Table” movies. It was an experience she loved so much, she told People on April 4 she's hoping Hallmark invites her back for many more. 

Noting that she has many friends who are Hallmark Channel “devotees” Cohn told People that joining the network was a dream. 

“I didn't know who any of these insanely terrific actors are but they taught me a thing or two,” she said. “It was such a beautiful surprise to work with such incredible actors and a production team. I just had a spectacular experience all the way around.”

Though instant chemistry among a cast is hard to come by on many Hollywood sets, Cohn told the outlet that wasn't the case this time around, explaining, “Creating chemistry is part of my job, right? Even when you don't feel it, you try and make the audience feel it. Well, there was no fakery at all here. We just really spent so much so much time together so quickly, and the bonds were real.”

In each of Hallmark's new “Hearts Around The Table” movies, Cohn plays Angie, a former foster parent who hosts weekly Sunday suppers for the now-grown kids she raised. The ensemble cast includes many familiar faces to Hallmark fans, including Torrance Coombs, Mishael Morgan, Ashley Newbrough, and Kathryn Davis. 

The third “Hearts Around The Table” movie, “Josh's Third Serving,” premieres on April 6 with a storyline that centers around a couple played by Hallmark regulars Jake Epstein and Stephanie Bennett. A fourth movie, “Kiki's Fourth Ingredient,” premieres on April 12. 

If Cohn has her way, these movies will mark the beginning of an ongoing “Hearts Around The Table” franchise at Hallmark. 

“We hope this does well because we want four more,” she said. “I'm hoping there is a way for a future for them with Hallmark as well. These characters are so delicious. We don't want to put them down. I hope the fans feel the same way.”

Cohn, who's begun filming the second season of “Palm Royale,” and the rest of her “Hearts Around The Table” castmates have gushed on social media about the bond they forged while filming their Hallmark movies from August through November 2024. 

She leaned on her co-stars for comfort after losing her dad in November, sharing on Instagram at the time that her family was “in the deepest ocean of despair.” 

While filming “Hearts Around The Table” in Ontario, she shared another post in mid-November that said, “Oh Canada. thank you for holding me while i grieve my beloved daddio and providing me with a cast, crew and production company that were sublime. ‘til soon. ❌⭕️”

Cohn told People that one of the things she loves about the “Hearts Around The Table” movies is that they portray what it's like to create safe spaces for sharing with each other within family and friend groups. 

“I think we all crave those kind of safe spaces,” she said. “I think people just long for that connection. I think the ‘Hearts' are just an amazing example of that, and I think I hope people are craving it as much as I am.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Does the ‘Minecraft' Movie Have a Post or End Credits Scene?","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/minecraft-movie-post-end-credits-scene/","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 14:39:18 GMT","

Does the new “Minecraft” movie have a post or end credits scene?

The answer is yes.

According to Forbes, it's a good idea to stick around after the movie, which has both an end credits and a mid-credits scene.

“There are two bonus scenes for viewers to enjoy after the main story wraps up,” Forbes noted.

According to Forbes, “A Minecraft Movie” was “Inspired by the popular sandbox video game.” It started showing in theaters on April 4. The rest of this article will contain spoilers for the “Minecraft” movie post-credits scene.

According to Forbes, the first bonus scene “appears shortly after the credits begin and ties into a recurring gag from the film.”

The second scene doesn't play until the credits are over, according to Forbes.  

According to Digital Spy, one of the end-credits scenes provides a clue to a possible sequel because it features Alex, which is “a reference to one of the game's nine default player skins.”

Steve goes back to his house in the real world and encounters Alex, who says, “You wanna come in? I'm Alex, by the way,” according to Digital Spy.

How are the reviews for “A Minecraft Movie”?

Critics and audiences are divided.

According to Rotten Tomatoes, the movie is not faring well with critics, who have given it a 48% positive ranking. However, audiences like it more, scoring it 87% fresh, according to Rotten Tomatoes.

“My kids and their buddies loved it. They play Minecraft. My wife and I had some laughs, but the movie wasn't for us. We don't know Minecraft,” read one of the audience reviews on the site.

“A TRUE movie for the whole family. Kids and adults alike will be rolling with laughter. We can't wait for this to be released to buy. I know my kids will be watching it daily when it does!” another audience review says.

“Seems like this movie was made for people who played the game. I didn't play the game but still enjoyed it. Stay until the very end<‘ another fan wrote.

The critics' consensus reads, “Ostensibly a film about celebrating creativity, ‘A Minecraft Movie' provides a colorful sandbox for Jack Black and Jason Momoa to amusingly romp around in a story curiously constructed from conventional building blocks.”

Bill Murrary is opening up about the incident that led to the 2022 production of “Being Mortal” shut down and nearly ended his career. Speaking in a recent interview with The New York Times, the “SNL” comedian turned actor shared that there aren't “too many day or weeks” he goes without thinking about what happened and has “tried to make peace” since.

“I ended up being, to my mind, barbecued,” said Murray of the fallout. “But someone that I worked with, that I had had lunch with on various days of the week — it was Covid, we were all wearing masks, and we were all stranded in this one room listening to this crazy scene. I dunno what prompted me to do it. It's something that I had done to someone else before, and I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, it was funny. I was wearing a mask, and I gave her a kiss, and she was wearing a mask. It wasn't like I touched her, but it was just, I gave her a kiss through a mask. And she wasn't a stranger.”

Murray doesn't blame the individual he kissed “through a mask” who ultimately submitted a complaint, but rather, as he puts it, “the human rights or ‘H & R' of the Disney corporation.” Disney owns Searchlight Pictures, which was producing the film and since the incident triggered protocols in their contracts, the issue was put into arbitration, a fact Murray bemoans. 

“It turned out there were pre-existing conditions and all this kind of stuff. I'm like, what? How was anyone supposed to know anything like that? There was no conversation, there was nothing,” Murray said. “There was no peacemaking, nothing. It went to this lunatic arbitration, which, if anyone ever suggests you go to arbitration: Don't do it. Never ever do it. Because you think it's justice, and it isn't.”

When this news first broke, it was reported that Murray thought the person he kissed had been flirting with him, but now recognizes that not to be the case. Even so, he wishes what he views as a “stupid” exchange wasn't blown out of proportions by the powers-that-be.

“It was a great disappointment, because I thought I knew someone, and I did not,” he said. “I certainly thought it was light. I thought it was funny. To me it's still funny, the idea that you could give someone a kiss with a mask on. It's still stupid. It's all it was.”

 










Murray blames his actions on a sense of playfulness he tries to bring to set, particularly when it came to “Being Mortal.” The film was set to be an adaptation of the non-fiction book by Atul Gawande, which centers around death and end-of-life care. To balance the heaviness of this subject matter, Murray said he tried to create a light space when shooting wasn't happening.

“When you're dealing with this painful material all day long, part of what my job has always been is to keep the mood light,” Murray told The NYT. “The job is not easy, and when you're doing a story about pain and misery, everyone can get pained and miserable, and you don't want that. You want to say: ‘Hey, we're still who we are.'” 

“Being Mortal” was set to be the feature directorial debut of Aziz Ansari, who was also set to star alongside Murray, Seth Rogen, and Keke Palmer. The film remains shut down since 2022, with Ansari opting to make his debut with a self-written comedy called “Good Fortune” that features Ansari, Rogen, and Palmer, as well as Keanu Reeves. 

Since the incident on “Being Mortal,” Murray has co-starred in “The Friend” with Naomi Watts. The two were recently seen on an episode of Andy Cohen's “What What Happens Live” in which Murray, once again, forcibly gave his co-star what appears to be an unsolicited kiss. Watch below.

April 6, 2025

In 1973, the readers of Creem magazine voted New York Dolls the year's Best New Band. They also voted them the year's Worst New Band. The poll succinctly captured the polarizing effect of the group's brief but marked reign over the Lower Manhattan rock scene, a post-Warhol Factory crowd that flocked to gritty gigs at Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center. That year, the proto-punk enfants terribles released their self-titled debut and split their niche fanbase into even slimmer factions. There were those who loved the record—including veteran rock critics and Dolls devotees like Robert Christgau and Ellen Willis—and those who felt that the studio environment had sapped their live set and diluted their potent slurry of blues, early rock'n'roll, and girl group melodies.

And then there were the folks who just didn't like the Dolls to begin with. The press in Memphis clocked their rouged cheeks and platform boots and wrote them off as “faggots.” Beer-swillers in Boston left in droves, marooning the band onstage in the 5,000-capacity Boston Armory. Years after the Dolls' 1975 falling-out, charismatic frontman David Johansen explained the band's highly “colloquial” sense of humor, which didn't translate beyond “St. Mark's and 2nd.” But punk entrepreneur Malcolm McLaren, who briefly managed the Dolls in their decline, might have summed up the group's trainwreck charm best in a 2004 op-ed: “They were so, so bad they were brilliant.”

Before they were New York Dolls, the bandmates were outer-borough rogues who joined forces like the various mobs stalking pavement in The Warriors. Queens-born guitarist Johnny Thunders was a high school baseball player who, according to him, was scouted by the Dodgers. But when the pro team demanded he lob off his nest of jagged jet hair, Thunders refused. He dabbled in delinquency, roaming the streets with a petty gang called the 90th Street Fast Boys. Ill-starred drummer Billy Murcia was a Bogotà-to-Queens transplant and Thunders' classmate. Bassist Arthur “Killer” Kane, a soft-spoken Bronx native who towered over his bandmates, was recruited in part for his imposing look (like a “mutated Marlene Deitrich,” as one critic put it). Sylvain Sylvain, a Queens boy by way of Cairo, replaced the group's earlier guitarist Rick Rivets, who was booted for fucking off and showing up late to practice.

Johansen, the sole member from Staten Island, was born to a librarian mother and an opera singer-turned-insurance-salesman father. Despite this middle-class milieu, he was a puckish kid, taunting the nuns at his Catholic school, engaging in minor turf warfare by riding his bike into territorial neighborhoods, and sneaking spins of his older brother's blues and doo-wop singles; the Diablos, Howlin' Wolf, and Lightnin' Hopkins were in heavy rotation. By age 17, Johansen had relocated to the East Village and was splitting his time between working at an outré clothing store on St. Mark's Place and running the sound and lights at Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company, an outpost of camp, avant-garde drama that often cast amateur actors in gender-swapped roles. The experience might have influenced Johansen's streetwalker chic, but by his account, the Dolls were cross-dressing long before they considered forming a band.

Reporters often treated New York Dolls' tough-chick attire as a calculated aesthetic, but the members had been dressing in at least half-assed drag since high school, snagging blouses from girlfriends, buying nun shoes, and caking on makeup. “We used to pick clothes out of the garbage can,” Johansen said in a 1981 interview with Musician. “We never sat down and planned it.” Among this pack of self-described street kids, platform boots and skinny silk scarves were a signal—a transmission of distaste for Top 40 acts of the era. The Osmonds. John Denver. Bread. This was how Arthur Kane spotted David Johansen—a rangy kid with a poufy coif and Jagger pout—at a screening of Beyond the‬‭ Valley of the Dolls. Before long, Kane and Billy Murcia showed up on Johansen's doorstep with a proposition to join their band.

Anything about the New York Dolls that seemed theatrical, possibly glamorous, had grubbier origins. Even the name, redolent of matinee idols or sequined Rockettes, was nicked from the New York Doll Hospital—an Upper East Side toy repair shop crammed with disembodied doll heads and severed plastic limbs. At first glance, the Dolls looked like acolytes of David Bowie and T. Rex, and while they were certainly exposed to the glitter bands emerging from England, their own music drew heavily from blues, doo-wop, and 1960s girl groups like the Ronettes, the Shangri-Las, and the Crystals. If Bowie and Marc Bolan were celestial waifs beamed in from a distant planet, New York Dolls had both heels planted firmly in a Manhattan gutter—an attitude that distinguished them from every major musical trend at the time.

The Dolls played their first gig at an Upper West Side homeless shelter on Christmas Eve, 1971, but they became known as the unofficial house band at the Mercer Arts Center, a complex of theaters tucked within the Broadway Central Hotel. David Bowie was a frequent attendee at early gigs, and while Lou Reed had publicly tossed the Dolls aside as “cute,” Bowie held them in high esteem. “[Bowie] would turn up at Dolls shows, like, you know, with a notebook!” proto-punk queen Jayne‬‭ County told Mojo in 2006. Whether it was hearsay or gospel, a popular piece of Dolls lore holds that Bowie wrote “Watch That Man” after seeing the band play at the Mercer Arts Center in '72. One night after a show, Bowie reportedly told Johansen that the Dolls had “as much energy as six English bands.” That comment signaled something bubbling under the surface of the downtown scene—the primordial ooze of punk just beginning to simmer.

In an era when Bee Gees and Carole King were crowning the charts, New York Dolls were proudly streetwise, brassy, and chaotic. Their music was utterly unconceptual; it was primal. They were camp and sloppy in a way audiences at the time didn't quite appreciate. As Johansen once told NME's Nick Kent: “We attract only degenerates‬‭ to our concerts… We want to be known as the tackiest boys in New York.”

Live, the Dolls stumbled and banged through their setlist. Thunders thrashed his guitar like a rottweiler gnashing a rabbit, his 8-ball eyes large and black; his stage presence was frightening at a time when “frightening stage presence” was still a liability. Johansen, rubber-limbed and cheeky, was the band's quotable mouthpiece and wellspring of witty ripostes. As noted in Barney Hoskyns' 1998 book Glam!, Johansen shocked the British press with his progressive take on sexuality:

Everyone here seems to be…homosexual. Kids are finding‬‭ out there isn't much difference between them sexually. They're finding out that the sexual terms—homo, bi,‬‭ hetero—are just words in front of “sexual.” They accuse me of transsexuality because I kissed [second drummer Jerry Nolan], but I love‬‭ Jerry. I think boys should kiss boys, don't you?

New York Dolls, like the glitter gods before them, were experimenting with gender expression without any pretense or agenda. They weren't meticulous drag performers like Divine or Jayne County; their trashy takes on the era-defining style of Ronnie Spector or Mary Weiss were instinctual, as was the Dolls' absorption of the 1960s girl group songbook. Their drag had a communal aspect, too. As Rolling Stone's Ed McCormack once wrote, “The Dolls pass around a Max Factor lipstick the way some bands pass‬ around a joint.”

~

After a year of gigging, New York Dolls had become underground royalty, and record labels were flocking to sign them. But industry interest soured in November 1972, when disaster struck on the band's first UK tour. After a show supporting the Faces at Wembley Stadium, a 21-year-old Billy Murcia took off for a London house party, where he passed out after reportedly mixing liquor and barbiturates. A woman tried to revive him by putting him in a cold bath and pouring coffee down his throat. He died of accidental asphyxiation.

Immediately after the tragedy, the band returned to New York, where drummer Jerry Nolan replaced Murcia. “Nothing ever happened with the Dolls until shocking things took place. People love scandals,” Sylvain Sylvain told Musician in 1981. “When Billy‬ died, all of a sudden the band was playing the bigger room in the Mercer Arts Center. Instead of the‬ 150-person room, we were playing weekends for 500.” Murcia's passing would be the first of several untimely and unfortunate deaths, including Thunders and Nolan, both of whom died relatively young after years of heroin addiction. Only Kane, Sylvain, and Johansen would make it past their 50s.

The Dolls' reputation for debauchery had scared off every label save for Mercury, and when it came time to record their debut, they had almost as much difficulty securing a producer. Bebe Buell had to drag her boyfriend, musician Todd Rundgren, to see them live. Rundgren was already working with hitmakers like Badfinger and Grand Funk Railroad, and he reluctantly signed on to produce the Dolls' debut. His hesitation only became more justified as recording commenced at the Record Plant on 44th Street. Rundgren likened his role to that of a “circus ringmaster” tasked with keeping the band focused as pals and journalists paraded through. There was an issue of competence; Rundgren had hoped to maintain the hectic thrill of the Dolls' live performances, but in the studio the band struggled to stay in sync. Nolan's tempo was unreliable. The musicians plied themselves with booze and grass. Rundgren's dog reportedly pissed on the mixing console. Worst of all, the Dolls were classic New Yorkers: impatient and pushy.

“The record would have been a lot better had they not got in such a hurry to finish it,” Rundgren divulged in a 1995 interview with Q. “They insisted it was mixed‬‭ in the same studio we were working in…where the only room available to mix in was at the‬‭ top of the building and I always thought the sound was dodgy. Then they insisted on being there when it was‬‭ mixed, which was the worst mistake. They did what was typical for a band: Everyone only hears themselves,‬‭ so everyone's standing over your shoulder saying they wanted to be louder, and at the end of a mix the faders‬‭ are all at the top of the board.”

After whining at Rundgren and getting their way, the Dolls went on to repeatedly blame him for fucking up the album's mix. (Johansen later reflected that they'd been “lucky to have someone who could get the‬ band to play all at once.”) In hindsight, the anxiety over the mix feels both earnest and a bit comical: New York Dolls didn't seize the attention of Lower Manhattan because of their high production values. In fact, fans and critics complained that New York Dolls didn't sufficiently capture the raw energy of their live sets. If anything, it should have sounded shittier.

Like most artists ahead of their time, New York Dolls were too extreme for mass appeal. Yet their scrappy, street-scuffed rock'n'roll primed downtown crowds for the onslaught of punk bands that would flock to CBGB after the Dolls' demise. Punk nihilism would hack away at any lingering reverence for Brill Building classics or jukebox standards, but the Dolls didn't care enough to be nihilistic. Their first album is awash in nostalgia for the music they grew up on; their blushing affection for early rock'n'roll and three-part harmonies has the juvenile charm of an anonymous love letter slipped into a crush's locker.

“Looking for a Kiss” is the Dolls' seedy homage to the Shangri-Las' 1964 single “Give Him a Great Big Kiss,” a song that heaped praise on a loveable bad boy. Both tracks commence with that immortal line: “When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in love, L-U-V,” a wink at teenage defiance heightened by the throes of forbidden romance. The Dolls take that prompt a tad further; while Mary Weiss swooned over tight pants and dirty fingernails, Johansen roams the streets to score a “fix and a kiss,” letting each word stretch across his tongue as Thunders' guitar revs and spins out. “Everyone's going to your house to shoot up in your room,” he sings. (A number of the Dolls had already dabbled with heroin, which was then engulfing the city in an epidemic.) The tension between teenybopper tropes and grimy urban reality is a recurring theme on the album—as if the lyrics in Grease had been re-written by Bukowski.

Hardly any song on New York Dolls doesn't reference the golden oldies. The swaying ballad “Subway Train” is the Dolls' most accurate doo-wop impression, with sweet, taffy-pulled backing vocals and a 4/4 snare beat. It is also one of the album's better mixed tracks; Johansen's gnarled, snarky vocals actually sound slightly set apart from the instrumental, and Thunders' guitar is at its most crisp and expressive. The significantly more muddied “Personality Crisis,” the Dolls' best-known single, kicks off with a flashy piano slide à la Little Richard or the Big Bopper. (While Sylvain Sylvain is also credited on keys, it is likely Rundgren's agile ragtime on this track.) Even on “Lonely Planet Boy,” a jangly, sax-laden number that feels more akin to Bowie and T. Rex's cosmic glam, Johansen manages to slip in a breathy reference to Del Shannon's 1961 hit “Runaway.”

Like so many rock bands of the '60s and '70s, the Dolls were heavily indebted to the blues. But their interpretations weren't studied like the Rolling Stones' or urgently political like the MC5's were. The band recognized a raggedness in the blues—its brutal subject matter and unvarnished delivery. “Pills,” the sole cover on New York Dolls, is a fairly straightforward rendition of a 1961 Bo Diddley joint about pain meds and substance abuse. It's the only cut to feature Johansen on harmonica, ripping a blustery solo at the top. “Pills” is a kind of curio on the album; it nods to Johansen's lifetime love affair with the blues, which he later performed with backing band the Harry Smiths and as his lounge lizard alter ego, Buster Poindexter. That several members of the Dolls would struggle with addiction up until their untimely deaths gave the song a tragic prescience.

“Trash” and “Jet Boy” are the finest offerings from New York Dolls. Both sound unique to the band—a culmination of its influences, chewed up, swashed with Night Train and spat into the crowd. “Jet Boy” is among the band's toughest cuts—in a choreographed-knife-fight, West Side Story way. The synchronized claps and burly guitar are sturdy enough to support Johansen's gristly baritone, and the goofy machismo of it all predated self-serious bands like Aerosmith and Guns N' Roses, both of whom cited the Dolls as an influence. Hair metal bands quaked at the mere thought of sexual ambiguity; the Dolls had already been there, done that.

Pithy and brash, “Trash” rumbles along to rockabilly rhythm guitar and ghostly “ooh-oohs” that haunt the perimeter. But it's Thunders' and Rundgren's whiny backup vocals—the shrill, drawn-out “traaaaaassssh”—that bristles against the melody and makes it memorable. The song's punchline borrows from another formative single: Mickey and Sylvia's “Love Is Strange.” “How do you call your lover-boy?” Johansen asks, invoking a line from the original. To wit, Thunders hollers back: “Traaaaaassssh!”

Intentionally or not, New York Dolls were recontextualizing their source material for the concrete bohemia. I'm reminded of Johansen's teenage job selling bizarro fashion at an East Village clothing shop: “We used‬‭ to, like, cut the Budweiser logo off a beer can and then fix it like a pop-art earring,” he told Mojo in 2015. In the same way that transforming literal garbage into jewelry mocks aesthetic valuation, converting rock'n'roll canon into shaggy dispatches from the dirtbag life democratizes the medium.

~

Upon release in July 1973, New York Dolls sold roughly 100,000 copies, falling short of band manager Marty Thau's outsized expectations. Days later, part of the Broadway Central Hotel collapsed, taking the Mercer Arts Center with it. But though American audiences were viciously split on the band, viewers of the British music program The Old Grey Whistle Test were about to undergo conversion. On November 27, New York Dolls took the stage at BBC Television Center in west London, clad in strangulating leather pants, frilled blouses, and perilously high heels. After back-to-back performances of “Looking for a Kiss” and “Jet Boy,” the camera cut to host “Whispering Bob” Harris, known for his gentle voice and proclivity for mellow tunes. “Mock rock,” he tutted after the Dolls wrapped their set. Backstage, Johansen had apparently told the presenter he had “bunny teeth.”

A teenage Morrissey was tuned in, enraptured by the Dolls' androgyny and belligerence. Eventually, he started a petition protesting Harris' reaction to the band, and presided over their British fanclub. “I was 13 and it was my first real emotional experience,” Morrissey wrote in a 1981 fanzine he assembled from the Dolls' press clippings. “The Dolls gave me a sense of uniqueness, as if they were my own personal discovery. Back in '73 the Dolls were total outcasts, and no-one with any sense even mentioned their name. As it was, I became the only visible proof that someone actually listened to them.”

Paul Cook, future Sex Pistols drummer, was another teenage spectator gobsmacked by the Dolls' Old Grey Whistle Test performance. “I couldn't believe it, they was‬‭ just all falling about all over the place, all their hair down, all knocking into each other,” Cook remembered in Fred and Judy Vermorel's book Sex Pistols: The Inside Story. “They was really funny. And they just didn't give a shit.” What Cook didn't yet realize was exactly how significant the band would be for the formation of Sex Pistols; Malcolm McLaren fell in love with the Dolls when they practically ransacked his and Vivienne Westwood's London clothing boutique, then called Let It Rock.

In McLaren's telling, after the band's visit, he replaced rock'n'roll oldies on the in-house jukebox with New York Dolls singles, rechristened the shop “Sex,” and rebranded it as an “emporium of perversity.” The love affair curdled with McLaren's subsequent attempt at managing the group (the Dolls' red patent leather “communist” era didn't fare well amid the ongoing war in Vietnam), and by summer of '75 the band had dissolved. According to Sylvain Sylvain, McLaren had promised him the lead position in a new group McLaren was assembling in London. Sylvain lent his Les Paul to a guitarist named Steve Jones, who was practicing along to the Dolls' debut. But Sylvain never made the cut. A young ruffian named Johnny Rotten got the gig instead.

In 2015, following a handful of Dolls reunion shows, Mojo reporter Alan Light asked Johansen if he felt “a kind of justice” in selling out large venues decades after the band's “commercial disappointment.” Johansen might have focused on the Dolls' undeniable clout, or counted the punk and hair metal bands they'd inspired. He might have heaped the blame on a dim audience, or heroin, or Malcolm McLaren. But he just rejected the construct of success altogether. “‭This is the frigging psychosis of the times,” he said. “We were certainly not shooting for commercial success; we were in the ground floor of this‬‭ revolution that was going on, and it was the opposite of commercial.” He continued: “People can't wrap their head around that, [it's] an idea that's alien to most people. People are so into‬‭ getting and spending that I don't even know if, when they're on their deathbed, they realize that they've been shoveling shit for the man for the last 70 years. But there's a lot more to life than that.‬” Johansen, who died earlier this year at 75, spurned the shovel, and New York Dolls flamed out before commercial success was even on the horizon. How very punk rock.

	President Donald Trump, Republicans, and conservatives at the Supreme Court are escalating a decades-long assault on clean water protections. Through deregulations and cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, Supreme Court rulings, executive orders, and bills in Congress, conservatives are systematically eroding rules that have successfully granted Americans clean water.


	These changes fit into a wider attack on environmental protections by the Trump administration that serve to benefit major polluters and industry. Reduced protections for clean water will affect all Americans, but particularly in low-income communities, communities of color, and rural communities.


	“It's a callous disregard for how these actions impact people and their access to safe water,” Mary Grant, Public Water for All Campaign Director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch, tells Rolling Stone. 


	In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said he will look to significantly reduce a significant portion of the waterways, such as wetlands, rivers, and streams, that are protected under the Clean Water Act, a 1972 law that regulates the discharge of pollutants in water. A memo from the EPA emphasized that it would be minimizing the water covered by the Clean Water Act and enforcing their interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court ruling, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. The Sackett decision found that millions of acres of wetlands — more than half — are not protected by the law, meaning that a permit is no longer needed to dump pollutants or destroy wetlands by filling them. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“This is to simply follow the rule of law,” Zeldin said. “We're not looking for this to be a pingpong anymore. What we're looking for is to simply follow the guidance of Sackett.”


	“There's a pretty basic attack against the Clean Water Act by industry and the Trump administration, and it's been going on for years,” Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife, and oceans at the nonprofit Earthjustice, tells Rolling Stone. “It was a feature of the first Trump administration, and they made really clear already that they're going to try and attack clean water protections in an aggressive way.”

	The definition of waters covered by the Clean Water Act has grown and shrunk for years. In 2015, President Barack Obama issued a regulation that clarified two previous Supreme Court rulings, establishing that the EPA has authority over smaller bodies of water like streams and wetlands. Then, in 2019, Trump repealed the measure. In 2022, President Joe Biden's EPA reversed Trump's move, going back to the rules that preceded Obama. In 2023, the Supreme Court issued the Sackett ruling that led Biden to weaken protections for wetlands. And in March, the Supreme Court ruled on a case about San Francisco dumping sewage into the Pacific Ocean that further weakened the Clean Water Act. 

	











	“That the Trump EPA is saying it wants to go back to the drawing board again” by revisiting the law's scope “indicates to me that they're only going to interpret the already restrictive decision even more restrictively and try to exclude more waters from federal jurisdiction,” Emily Miller, staff attorney at advocacy group Food and Water Watch, tells Rolling Stone.


	The Clean Water Act is “the most successful environmental law in America,” Caputo says. “So we're in a situation where efforts to weaken clean water protections are not only terrible public policy, because all Americans need and deserve clean water, it's also a situation where we would be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by weakening protections for clean water.”


Sackett involved an Idaho couple, Chantell and Michael Sackett, who were building a home on a vacant lot that included wetlands protected by the EPA. Despite not having the necessary permit, the couple, who ran an excavation company, dumped gravel into the wetlands so they could build on it. The EPA toldthe Sacketts to undo the damage and stop construction. In response, the Sacketts sued. The Supreme Court decided that waters that did not have a “continuous surface connection” to major lakes and rivers were not subject to the Clean Water Act, leaving many wetlands, which may have underground connections to major lakes and rivers, unprotected.

	Wetlands are important because they create clean water by filtering pollutants and they can absorb flood water. Many endangered and threatened species rely on wetlands for their habitats. The EPA estimated that more than 60 percent of wetlands lost protections under Sackett.


	The Sacketts were represented by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which Earthjustice calls “a pro-industry group that seeks to dismantle key environmental protections.”


	The Clean Water Act “drives industry crazy,” Caputo says. “It's agribusiness, it's property developers, it's the oil and gas guys. A whole suite of industry is really hostile to protections for wetlands.”


	The law requires that someone obtain a permit before discharging a pollutant from a pipe, tunnel, or other “discrete conveyance” into water. 


	“That's become the cost of doing business and industry doesn't like the cost,” Caputo adds.


	Zeldin argued in a statement last month that the Biden administration's previous definition of waters covered under the Clean Water Act “placed unfair burdens on the American people” and added costs for businesses. He claimed the Trump EPA will “protect America's water resources consistent with the law of the land while empowering American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families.”

	











	Conservative lawmakers have similarly framed the Trump administration's water deregulation as benefiting everyday people. Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) said in response to the EPA's changes that Biden and Barack Obama's policies had caused issues for farmers and ranchers. 


	“It's not every mud puddle that they should regulate,” he said. “If you can float a rubber duck in it for a half-hour after the rain, that does not mean this is something they can regulate.”


	Zippy Duvall, president of the lobbying group the American Farm Bureau Federation, also praised the Trump EPA's move. “I'm a farmer and I need a rule that's on one page, that is sitting on the dash of my truck right next to my devotional book, and if I have a question about a ravine on my farm, I can pick that one page up, read it, and interpret it myself,” Duvall said.


	But the EPA's water moves serve to benefit industry above all, experts say.


	“There is little ambiguity in EPA's announcement,” Mark Sabath, senior attorney at the nonprofit Southern Environmental Law Center, said in a statement. “We hear no concern for the health of people who depend on clean drinking water, or the safety of communities that rely on wetlands to slow flooding. Further weakening federal clean water protections may be what large polluters and wealthy developers want, but it is not what everyday people want — either in the South or throughout the nation.”


	Caputo says there are still some ways to fight back.


	“If you're somebody like me who wants to protect those wetlands, there are really two ways to do it,” he says. “One is to have Congress pass a law that reinstates the protections for those 50 million acres. The other is to have individual states do that at the state level. So in the wake of the Sackett decision, we are pursuing both courses of action.”


	The Supreme Court's conservative supermajority further attacked the Clean Water Act in March when it decided a case about San Francisco dumping sewage into the Pacific Ocean. As a result, the EPA's ability to stipulate certain basic requirements as part of permits was limited.


	“It's a decision that I think showcases the Supreme Court's open hostility towards clean water protections, and what it does is it makes it harder for EPA and state regulators to protect water quality if the Clean Water Act requires, because it takes away an important tool that regulators have routinely used in the past to achieve water quality protection,” says Miller, of Food and Water Watch.

	











	The case looked at the level of authority that the EPA and state regulators have to make polluters follow the rules. Before the ruling, the EPA would put restrictions in permits called end-result requirements — or provisions that generally “prohibit pollution discharges that violate water quality standards,” according to Miller. 


	These provisions were meant to serve as a backstop to make sure that their rules are followed. The Supreme Court ruled that these end-result requirements are beyond the EPA's authority. As such, the EPA and state regulators must now issue more specific conditions for each permit, which takes time and money. 


	“In practice, I see this decision as making it a lot more difficult and time consuming and expensive for regulators to issue protective water pollution permits, and it may unfortunately lead to weaker water pollution permitting overall,” Miller says.


	As was the case in Sackett, industry backed the polluter, San Francisco. 


	“It is unusual that one of the most liberal cities in the country would bring a lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court that essentially weakens a really important environmental law,” Miller says. “And you might not be surprised to know that they were supported in their challenge by a number of industry lobby groups that represented fossil fuels and mining and industrial agriculture interests, because this decision and this type of weakening of EPA power benefits those polluters immensely.”


	The Supreme Court's decisions favor “industrial polluter interests and works to the disadvantage of the American public that relies on water for drinking, for recreation, for all sorts of things that are now at risk,” Miller adds.


	Meanwhile, the EPA's broader deregulation agenda threatens clean water protections as well. More than 30 actions that the EPA announced affect water pollution, air pollution, and climate emissions from fossil fuel plants. Trump also issued an executive order that said for every rule an agency issues, it must repeal 10 rules. 


	One such handout to the fossil fuel industry: The EPA is looking to change rules concerning wastewater created as a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. The agency will consider expanding circumstances where this wastewater can be used and discharged.


	“EPA is playing a central role delivering on President Trump's energy agenda,” Zeldin said in a statement. “EPA will revise wastewater regulations from the 1970s that do not reflect modern capability to treat and reuse water for good. As a result, we will lower production costs for oil and gas extraction to boost American energy while increasing water supplies and protecting water quality.” 

	











	Trump's Office of Management and Budget separately withdrew a proposed EPA rule to set limits on the discharge of PFAS forever chemicals in wastewater. The administration did so based on Trump's executive order on Day One freezing all regulations in progress pending review.


	Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire leading Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, also want to make major cuts to the EPA's budget and workforce. These cuts would threaten Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, which provide major funding for local water infrastructure. 


	“I think a lot of industries view the EPA as just being in the way of what they want to do,” Caputo says. “And so there's a bit of a right-wing fantasy playing out right now, which is to get rid of this agency whose sole job it is to deliver clean water and clean air to people, and to get them out of industry's way.” 


	But, he adds, “the laws are still on the books.” 


	And in Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson's recent stopgap spending law includes cuts to a program that helps communities have access to clean water. Its cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture include the Rural Water and Waste Disposal assistance program, which provides funding to rural communities for “clean and reliable drinking water systems, sanitary sewage disposal, sanitary solid waste disposal, and storm water drainage,” according to the USDA.


	At the USDA, a leaked memo published by More Perfect Union showed that the Agricultural Research Service has banned many words and phrases from agreements and contracts — including “environmental justice,” “climate,” and “safe drinking water.” 


	“The Trump administration has tried to turn the term ‘environmental justice' into a bad word that shall not be spoken, but the people that will be overwhelmingly and disproportionately burdened by these types of decisions are frontline communities,” Miller says. 


	The EPA moved to close its Environmental Justice Offices in March. These offices worked on pollution in poor communities and communities of color. 


	“Industry and industrial polluters tend to concentrate in particular areas, usually low income communities of color or rural, isolated areas that don't really have the political power to fight them off. And so you know, decisions that let industrial polluters run wild will be felt in those communities. And simply removing the words environmental justice from the website, and you know, getting rid of the Environmental Justice Office and the EPA is not going to change that reality. It's just going to hide it,” Miller adds.

	











	Republican lawmakers also want to repeal the Lead Out of Water rule, which Biden issued last October and “was a massive victory in protecting public health against this neurotoxin, which is especially dangerous for children,” according to Food and Water Watch. The rule required that lead pipes in drinking systems be replaced within 10 years. Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) introduced the repeal legislation in January.


	This kind of change will have lasting consequences.


	“We are very worried that if Congress repeals lead and copper rule improvements… we'll never be able to mandate removal of all these toxic lead service lines ever again,” Grant says.


	If this wide variety of actions in the White House, in Congress, at the EPA, at the Supreme Court, and elsewhere seems overwhelming, that's on purpose, Grant adds.

	She says Trump and Republicans are deliberately “flooding the zone, doing a lot all at once to kind of hamstring opposition,” explaining: “It's hard to keep track of, it overwhelms media attention, it's hard to know where to focus. This massive influx of all these executive orders so fast, all these actions so fast, is intentional, and it's designed to prevent people from falling into question every illegal action that's taken, every harmful action that's taken.”

Jack Black rejoiced in his return to Saturday Night Live after nearly twenty years away, singing about the occasion to the tune of Aerosmith's “Back in the Saddle.”


	Black, who most recently hosted SNL in 2005 and was the show's musical guest with Tenacious D the following year, began his monologue by announcing he would actually have to “quit” due to the pressure. That is, until the riff to the 1976 track got the School of Rock star in the right mood. 


	“How dare you play that riff? You guys!” he reacted. “You know what this song does to me.”


	After the song kicked in, Black recapped some of his films since his last appearance on the late night show, and then headed into the studio audience.


	“I bet this guy did not know he'd be on TV,” he sang to one audience member. “And if you want to rock and roll, you best be following me.”


	Black then introduced a marching band, which made their way down from the top row behind him. 

	











	The actor then ran into a few SNL cast members, botching their names while admitting in his song, “It's been a while since I've watched this show.”

	TORONTO, ONTARIO — Donald Trump is losing an election in a landslide — in Canada. After a decade under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada was ready to move on from his center-left Liberal Party. It seemed inevitable that my homeland was about to elect a new conservative government and perhaps redefine the idea of what it means to be Canadian — an identity that mostly starts with the premise of not being American.


	If Trump had said nothing about Canada — if he hadn't bullied, belittled, and threatened to annex the country — the Conservative Party would have won a massive majority. If Trump and the chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk hadn't engaged in adolescent taunting of Canadians, for no apparent reason other than frat bro hazing of what they imagined to be a defenseless target, the relationship between the two countries might have been mutually reimagined.


	Instead, incredibly, unbelievably — but also inevitably, as any sane Canadian would have told you — Trump's bully boy behavior resulted in virtually universal revulsion. The trash-talking, Trump-like leader of the Conservative Party best resembled Wile E. Coyote after Trump's assault; the politico who had long claimed Canada broken was suddenly lost for words as the bottom fell out of his campaign. In a matter of days, there was a 25-point swing in favor of the governing Liberal Party, now led by a no-nonsense plutocrat banker named Mark Carney. No marketing genius could have come up with a way to unite Canadians more rapidly than Trump's threats and tariffs, affronts by a supposed marketing savant who is turning America into a globally toxic brand.

	











	WALKING THE STREETS of Toronto on a rainy, cold early spring day, under a billboard forecasting “Chances of Canadian Weather: 100 percent,” the most remarkable thing about the city is how unremarkable it is. The frantic chaos of Trump's America unceasing news cycle is countered with civic calm here. A pro-Palestinian protest marches along University Avenue toward City Hall, with no terror of students being disappeared by government agents wearing masks. The hip-hop exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario proceeds with no fear that the tender feelings of sensitive white men will be bruised by divergent historical and political narratives; a blonde bride poses with her groom on the circular stairs in the main atrium, oblivious to how threatened she is supposed to feel by the large poster on the wall with a set of oversized teeth and braces spelling out “Black Power.”

	In a mall on Toronto's main drag, the rebranding of America is well underway. Teen shoppers bypass American stores without a glance, the flags and lapel badges and Canada Goose fleeces abounding, as customers in Eataly ask specifically for products that are not made in the United States. My favorite pho joint in Chinatown is bustling, until I pull out a wad of American cash to pay for my lunch, and I'm met with a hush and looks of disapproval. (“Dream big little one,” the sign above the urinal says.) The evidence of economic slowdown in Canada are already evident, but the malaise is contradicted by the excited, ethnically diverse and inclusive kids equitably lining up to shop at a new Chinese fast-fashion pop-up.


	In a hotel downtown, on the top floor of a formerly Trump-branded tower, the bar once called America has been rechristened to avoid the association, the lone vestiges of the president's bad-taste version of luxury evident in the tacky black marble and gauche deco interior. Customers in bars all over the city are specifically asking for non-American brands of alcohol, bartenders and waiters say, a glimpse of the solidarity that is binding the nation together. In a nearby liquor store, there are no American brands on offer. When I ask the clerk if there have been any complaints, he looks surprised by the question.


	“No one has complained,” he says. “People are starting to appreciate Canadian whiskeys.”

	A few bleary-eyed day drinkers on the sidewalk outside are talking politics, like everyone else I meet, as they share a bottle.


	“At least Trump talked to Mark Carney with respect,” one drunk says approvingly. “Trump called Carney Prime Minister, so at least that's something.”


	Another drunkenly agrees. “C'est la vie,” he says.


	“NO WAY CANADA can win a trade war with America,” Vice President J.D. Vance declares on television, as he visits an American military base in Greenland — yet another society menaced by the Trump administration.


	But here's the thing: There is no war in Canada. Canada is not at war with America, nor is it at war with reality or empathy or the basic elements of human decency that also define Canadian identity. DEI — or Donald, Eric, and Ivanka as it has been called on Canadian television — is part of the political debate in Canada, of course, but the underlying sentiments of the diversity, equity, and inclusion movement are still the character traits taught in Canadian kindergartens: do your best, tell the truth, respect others, don't be a bully, the rules matter — along with the lyrics of O Canada.

	











	On one level, what Canada is going through is a divorce, it strikes me. What Vance doesn't seem to grasp is that no one wins a divorce. Both parties are poorer, if not happier, the bonds of trust and affection and history that tied the couple together broken beyond repair. And here's another cruel reality of divorce: The abusive partner is still an abuser after the split. The empty threats, the irrational demands, the self-pity, the lying, the cheating, the wild mood swings, all the unattractive characteristics are still staring back in the mirror the morning after the marriage is over.


	But the most elemental disagreement between Canada and America seems to be about the modern world. For years, conservative America has been engaged in an angry argument with history, with originalists on the Supreme Court selectively retelling the past to serve their ideological interests. For an old man like Donald Trump, instead of yelling at the television and changing the channels with his remote, he now possesses the power to end life on earth and thus the world cringes in fear as his discontent with the present and longing for the past turn the world upside down. 


	There are historical plaques all over the city, celebrating Canada's heritage, but no one seriously wants to travel back in time to a fantastical golden age, or live in a fantasy where all the woes of the world can be wished away by a magical red hat.


	THE SNOW IS SLANTING across Toronto on April 2, Trump's “Liberation Day,” as the event is broadcast live from the White House on Canadian TV, with the president turning reality itself into a perverse kind of reality television. The anxiety of the newscasters is evident, but it slowly emerges that Canada is being spared the worst of the new global trade tax regime. Tariffs on cars and steel and aluminum remain, but the rest of the world is now experiencing what Canada has been enduring for months: global trade rules unilaterally discarded and huge new Trump taxes described as an act of kindness — truly transcendental gaslighting — as the crowd in the Rose Garden scramble to catch a tossed MAGA hat.


	“Trump likes to be fluffed,” a Canadian commentator says, after listening to Trump praise the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that helped worsen the Great Depression and call to mind the 1880s as a golden age — a rambling proudly incoherent discourse that seems to reject the realities of the 21st century.

	The sun finally comes out the next morning — no Trump tariffs apply to that yet, it would seem — and the city again moves forward. The toll on Canadian workers and the economy are immediately felt in jobs lost and lives changed. But all the Canadian political parties agree that there is no turning back. The preexisting relationship is over, as Prime Minister Carney says; the marriage is finished. Unlike so many cratering American institutions — law firms, universities, soulless groveling tech billionaires —- Canada stands up to the bully as best it can and calls bullshit. No matter who wins the Canadian election, there is already one clear loser: Donald Trump. 

	











	In this new era of American lawlessness, treaties like the one Trump negotiated with Canada and Mexico are tossed aside with the same shameless ease that the president once displayed stiffing subcontractors. Trump has now set himself up to dispense and collect tariff favors like a mafia don, the corruption and inscrutability practiced with impunity — and, of course, immunity. The president treats the world like it is a ship of fools — certain that he's smarter than everyone else. Canadians, politely minding their own business until a few short weeks ago, now behold their neighbors with a mixture of horror and disbelief and fear, dreading that this is the kind of arrogance that always goes before the fall.

Bill Murray opened up in a new interview about the incident that led to Being Mortal, Aziz Ansari's directorial debut, being shut down in what was described at the time as Murray's “inappropriate behavior.”


	In a conversation discussing his new movie The Friend with The New York Times, Murray was asked about the parallels between Walter, the film's character he portrays, and his own experience with both of them being accused of “inappropriate misconduct.” When asked if he thought about that, Murray said, “I don't go too many days or weeks without thinking of what happened in Being Mortal.”


	In 2022, production on Being Mortal was suspended after a complaint or “inappropriate behavior” was made against Murray. At the time, Searchlight Pictures said in an email to the production crew that it looked into the incident. “After reviewing the circumstances, it has been decided that production cannot continue at this time,” the company said.


	In Murray's interview with The Times, he detailed some of the specifics of what happened, saying that he had been “trying to make peace, but instead I ended up being, to my mind, barbecued.”

	











	He added that the incident was with someone he worked with, and it was a person who he'd had lunch with several times a week. It took place during a time when everyone on set was wearing masks due to Covid.


	“We were all stranded in this one room listening to this crazy scene. I dunno what prompted me to do it,” he said. “It's something that I had done to someone else before, and I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, it was funny.


	“I was wearing a mask, and I gave her a kiss, and she was wearing a mask,” he continued. “It wasn't like I touched her, but it was just, I gave her a kiss through a mask. And she wasn't a stranger.”


	Murray said the incident still bothers him since the film was indefinitely suspended shortly after and “that movie was stopped by the human rights or ‘H & R' of the Disney corporation, which is probably a little bit more strident than some other countries'.”

	“It turned out there were pre-existing conditions and all this kind of stuff. I'm like, what? How was anyone supposed to know anything like that?” he said. “There was no conversation, there was nothing. There was no peacemaking, nothing. It went to this lunatic arbitration, which, if anyone ever suggests you go to arbitration: Don't do it. Never ever do it. Because you think it's justice, and it isn't.”

	He added that he believed he has learned from the experience, but that “it was a great disappointment, because I thought I knew someone, and I did not. I certainly thought it was light. I thought it was funny. To me it's still funny, the idea that you could give someone a kiss with a mask on. It's still stupid. It's all it was.”


	Adapted from Sigrid Nunez's novel, the Scott McGehee and David Siegel-directed The Friend stars Naomi Watts, who plays a New York writer that is saddled with the dog of her friend Walter (Murray) followin his death. The film was widely released in theaters on Friday.

	The judge overseeing the case of a Maryland man erroneously deported to El Salvador has reiterated that the Trump administration must return him to the U.S.


	Kilmar Abrego Garcia, along with hundreds of other deportees from the U.S., is being held in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), which District Court Judge Paula Xinis described as “one of the most notoriously inhumane and dangerous prisons in the world” that keeps people “in some of the most inhumane and squalid conditions known in any carceral system.”


	“The officers had no warrant for his arrest and no lawful basis to take him into custody; they told him only that his ‘status had changed,'” Xinis wrote in her order issued Friday, which was obtained by Politico.


	Abrego Garcia was arrested last month. He came to the U.S. from El Salvador because local gangs were trying to recruit him, threatening both him and his family. He was arrested in Maryland in 2019, but a judge granted him protection from deportation because he was likely to be targeted. His wife and five-year-old autistic son are both U.S. citizens. Abrego Garcia was reportedly arrested in front of his son.

	











	Even Department of Homeland Security officials admitted in an earlier court filing that Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador last month because of an “administrative error.” Despite that, the Justice Department has argued that it cannot bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.


	In a statement on Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “We suggest the judge contact President Bukele.”


	As Xinis pointed out, the Justice Department has shown “no evidence” to back up its claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang. Further, she said, by publicly labeling him as a gang member, the government put him at high risk of being targeted because as part of CECOT's cruelty, the facility “intentionally mixes rival gang members.” 


	Attorneys for Abrego Garcia told The Atlantic the accusations that he is a gang member are false, pointing to police records that state law enforcement was unable to find reliable evidence to connect him with MS-13 in 2019. They additionally noted that Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of any crimes, nor has he been involved with law enforcement at any other times.

	The obvious lack of evidence against Abrego Garcia has not stopped Vice President J.D. Vance from spreading misinformation about him. “He was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here,” he falsely claimed.


	Xinis also dismantled the Trump administration's argument that because Abrego Garcia is in El Salvador, they are not able to return him to the U.S. 


	“Surely, Defendants do not mean to suggest that they have wholesale erased the substantive and procedural protections of [federal immigration law in one fell swoop by dropping those individuals in CECOT without recourse,” Xinis wrote.


	Xinis pointed out that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently visited CECOT where she appeared in a bizarre video in front of dozens of incarcerated men held in a large cell. In the video, she called the prison “one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use.”


	“Thus, just as in any other contract facility, Defendants can and do maintain the power to secure and transport their detainees, Abrego Garcia included,” Xinis wrote, using the administration's own words to undermine its argument.

	Xinis also noted that the administration's “legal basis for the mass removal of hundreds of individuals to El Salvador remains disturbingly unclear.” But she emphasized that Abrego Garcia's case is “categorically different” because “there were no legal grounds whatsoever for his arrest, detention, or removal.”


	“Rather, his detention appears wholly lawless,” she wrote.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took aim at Donald Trump‘s massive tariffs, which have caused markets to tumble, in the process making a dig at last week's musical guest, Morgan Wallen.


	“America elected Trump to run the country like a business, but it turns out he's running it like one of his businesses,” Colin Jost joked at the outset.


	Jost then alluded to how the president has shared a video about how he ‘s “purposely crashing the stock market.”


	“I love that you can intentionally ruin the economy and still get to stay president,” he said. “It's like if you drunk-drove your car through the window of the DMV and they were like, ‘License renewed!' It's insane. This was the worst week for the stock market since summer 2020, but you have to remember: the president then was…also Trump.”


	Noting how much value has been wiped out by the tariffs, Jost joked that money is leaving the stock market “faster than Morgan Wallen at goodnights.”

	











	The country singer, who was SNL‘s musical guest last week, left the stage prematurely at the end of the show and has since been hawking merchandise off the stunt. 


	Co-anchor Michael Che then riffed on Trump's justification for the tariffs. 


	“Trump announced a tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., saying that the U.S. has been plundered and raped by other countries. And Trump will not stand for plundering,” he joked.


	Turning to how some tariffs were oddly put on islands with zero human beings but plenty of penguins, Jost offered an explanation.

Politicians claim sightings, museums report rising visitor numbers – and ‘contact events' draw thousands seeking alien encounters

Chinen recalls the moment vividly: it happened during a “contact event” in Nagano several years ago. These gatherings, popular among extraterrestrial enthusiasts, aim to initiate sightings or communication through meditation and group intention. Chinen first developed an interest in the existence of alien life shortly afterwards.

“We had not seen anything that we could definitely say was a UFO during the evening, but it was dark and there were stars and as we were talking, we saw lights moving around us,” he told This Week in Asia. “Suddenly there was one light – a huge ball of red light that expanded and then instantaneously disappeared.”

“There was one person in the group who was sceptical about UFOs,” he added. “And his back was turned at that very instant, but the rest of us saw it … that was enough to convince me.”

Asked if he felt fear during the encounter, Chinen shook his head. “They do not show themselves if they sense fear,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","other"

  A CUMBRIAN Paranormal Investigator has published a book documenting Cumbria's dark history and most haunted places. 



  Louis Dee of Workington runs a YouTube channel where he and his team visit haunted locations across the world. 



  His adventures have gained some interest online, and his viewers regularly tune in to see if he discovers anything paranormal in the places he visits. 



  Louis's love of all things macabre has inspired him to write three books. 



  The first book, The Ward, was released last summer and tells the fictional story of three young people who start a paranormal You Tube channel. 



  The trio visits an abandoned asylum to create their latest video, where they are tormented by the spirit of Dr Silas Thorne. 



  The book is inspired by Louis's adventures exploring abandoned buildings. 



  It was a top seller in the horror genre on Amazon, and he followed the book up with a sequel of the same trio travelling the world. 



  This year, he has released his third book, titled Ghosts of Cumbria. 



  Which is a nonfiction book exploring some of the dark history of Cumbria. 



  Mr Dee said: ""After writing my first book and publishing it through Amazon and Google, 'The Ward' last year I was surprised when it reached best seller in the horror genre on Amazon after the first two weeks, this made me write a second book where the lead characters went on to travel the world through big TV companies doing the most haunted locations in the world.



  ""This book was also successful. After a long year of me traveling and filming Paranornal investigations for my YouTube channel Paranormal Origins I wanted something that holds the historical value of the past and reporting on paranornal events that have happened there for example eye witness reports and peoples experiences at all these locations.""

Fire meets ice in the dramatic video.

A dramatic drone video shows Isar Aerospace's first orbital launch attempt, which ended with a fiery crash into the frigid sea about 30 seconds after liftoff.

The Germany company's first Spectrum rocket lifted off Sunday morning (March 30) from Andøya Spaceport in northern Norway on the first-ever orbital launch attempt from European soil.

Spectrum cleared the tower but suffered an anomaly shortly thereafter. The rocket flipped over and slammed into the ocean near the pad, sending an orange-tinted cloud high into a clear Arctic sky, as the video shows.



The launch pad and surrounding infrastructure appear to have escaped damage, according to Isar Aerospace. The company accentuated the positive about Spectrum's debut, saying the 95-foot-tall (28 meters) rocket performed quite well overall.

""Our first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,"" Isar Aerospace CEO and Co-founder Daniel Metzler said in an emailed statement. ""We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our flight termination system.""

European space officials were similarly sanguine.

Follow:


            It's been a long time coming, but Alex Ovechkin can finally call himself the NHL's all-time leading scorer with number 895 on Sunday.
    


            The 39-year-old overtook Wayne Gretzky's mark of 894 goals after scoring in the second period of the Washington Capitals game against the New York Islanders on Sunday in Elmont, New York.
    


            Ovechkin rocketed a wrist shot past goalie and fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin as the left winger's family and Gretzky looked on at UBS Arena. It was a power play goal, which was fitting – no one in NHL history has ever scored more power play goals than the Russian ace.
    


            Ovechkin netted his 42nd tally of the season, which is the third most in the league as Washington trails 4-1 in the third period.
    


            The game paused after Ovechkin's goal for a ceremony to recognize his achievement.
    


            Ovechkin thanked his teammates, the Capitals organization, coaches, his family, the fans and yes, Sorokin, for letting him get the record.
    


            “It's a team sport. Without my boys, I would never stand there and obviously I would never pass a great one. … We did it, boys, we did it,” Ovechkin told the crowd.
    


            “Thank you, (Ilya Sorokin) to let me score 895 … and the last thing, all of you fans, for all the world, Russia, we did it, boys, we did it. It's a history!”
    


            The fans chanted “Ovi! Ovi! Ovi!” after he finished speaking.
    


            Gretzky told the fans he doesn't think Ovechkin's record, the one he held for more than 31 years, will be broken.
    


            “We're here today to celebrate this guy here, number eight. I can tell you firsthand I know how hard it is to get 894. Eight-ninety-five is pretty special,” Gretzky said.
    


            “They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that.”
    


            Gretzky jokingly told Capitals owner Ted Leonsis when he broke the goals record, he was given a Rolls-Royce and the owner is going to have to think of a gift for his star.
    


            In his 20th NHL season, many had been waiting for him to overtake the record this year. The Russian finally did so having played the same amount of games — 1,487 — that Gretzky managed during his 21-year career.

            While many had expected Ovechkin to break the record this season, the broken fibula he sustained in November delayed his march toward what many once considered an unassailable mark. The Capitals star, though, recovered quickly to get back on track.
    


            In March, Ovechkin announced a charity partnership which would see him donate money after every goal he scores until the end of his career to raise funds for pediatric cancer research.
    


            Ovechkin has played all 20 of his NHL seasons with Washington, leading the team to its only Stanley Cup win in 2018. Earlier this year, he joined Gordie Howe as the only NHL players in history to rack up 20 goals in 20 straight seasons.
    


            He has also amassed nine seasons of 50+ goals – including a career-high 65 in 2007-08 –been named an All-Star 12 times, league MVP three times, and in 2017 was honored as one of the best 100 NHL players of all time.
    


            A year later, he lifted the Stanley Cup for the first time as his Capitals dispatched the expansion Las Vegas Golden Knights in five games.
    


This is a breaking story and will be updated.

Two pro-Palestinian British MPs were denied entry to Israel and subsequently deported after local authorities accused them of misrepresenting the nature of their visit and planning to promote campaigns targeting the state.

Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, both members of the governing Labour Party, landed in Tel Aviv at 2:30pm local time on Saturday, accompanied by two aides. During questioning at Ben Gurion Airport, they told border officers they were part of an official UK parliamentary delegation – a claim Israeli immigration officials described as “false.”

Local officials claimed that the lawmakers intended to “document Israeli security forces and spread hateful rhetoric.” Interior Minister Moshe Arbel ordered their removal “in accordance with the law.”

The Israeli Embassy in London said in a statement that Mohamed and Yang were barred from entry “after accusing Israel of false claims, calling for a boycott, spreading lies, and actively promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers while supporting campaigns aimed at boycotting the State of Israel.”

“The visit was intended to provoke, harm Israeli citizens, and spread falsehoods about them,” the embassy added, as quoted by British media. “It is Israel's responsibility to prevent the entry of such individuals (just as is the practice in the United Kingdom).”

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the decision “unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning.” 

“I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British Parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support,” he said. Lammy reaffirmed the government's commitment to “securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.”

Mohamed is the UK's first MP of Yemeni descent and has been a vocal critic of West Jerusalem's operations in Gaza. She has accused the Jewish state of “ethnic cleansing.” She previously urged the British government to “review its relationship with Israel” and initiated a campaign aimed at banning goods from the country.

Yang, the country's first Chinese-born MP, has called on the UK government to impose sanctions on Israeli officials.

Energoatom CEO, Petro Kotin, says ‘major problems' need to be overcome before it can safely generate power

It would be unsafe for Russia to restart the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and would take Ukraine up to two years in peacetime if it regained control, the chief executive of the company that runs the vast six-reactor site has said.

Petro Kotin, chief executive of Energoatom, said in an interview there were “major problems” to overcome – including insufficient cooling water, personnel and incoming electricity supply – before it could start generating power again safely.

The future of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear reactor, is a significant aspect of any negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Seized by Russia in spring 2022 and shut down for safety reasons a few months later, it remains on the frontline of the conflict, close to the Dnipro River.

Russia has said it intends to retain the site and switch it back on, without being specific as to when. Alexey Likhachev, head of Russian nuclear operator Rosatom, said in February it would be restarted when “military and political conditions allow”.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump has expressed an interest in taking control of it, though this possibility is considered very remote.

Kotin said Energoatom was prepared to restart the plant but it would require Russian forces to be removed and the site to be de-mined and demilitarised.

He said such a restart by Ukraine would take anywhere “from two months to two years” in an environment “without any threats from militaries”, while a Russian restart during wartime “would be impossible, even for one unit [reactor]”.

Kotin said the six reactors could only be brought online after the completion of 27 safety programmes agreed with Ukraine's nuclear regulator, including testing the nuclear fuel in the reactor cores because it had exceeded a six-year “design term”.

That raises questions about whether Russia could restart the plant after a ceasefire without incurring significant risk. The plant was already unsafe, Kotin said, given that it was being used as “a military base with military vehicles present” and there were “probably some weapons and blasting materials” present as well.

Russia has acknowledged that it has placed mines between the inner and outer perimeters of the plant “to deter potential Ukrainian saboteurs” while inspectors from the IAEA nuclear watchdog have reported that armed troops and military personnel are present at the site.

Last month, the US Department of Energy said the Zaporizhzhia plant was being operated by an “inadequate and insufficently trained cadre of workers”, with staffing levels at less than a third of prewar levels.

The US briefing said Ukrainian reactors, though originally of the Soviet VVER design, had “evolved differently” from their Russian counterparts and “particularly the safety systems”. Russian-trained specialists acting as replacements for Ukrainian staff were “inexperienced” in operating the Ukrainian variants, it said.

Kotin said an attempt to restart the plant by Russia would almost certainly not be accepted or supported by Ukraine. It would require the reconnection of three additional 750kV high-voltage lines to come into the plant, he said.

A nuclear reactor requires a significant amount of power for day-to-day operation, and three of the four high-voltage lines came from territories now under Russian occupation. “They themselves destroyed the lines,” Kotin said, only for Russia to discover engineers could not rebuild them as the war continued, he added.

Only two lines remain to maintain the site in cold shutdown, a 750kV line coming from Ukraine, and a further 330kV line – though on eight separate occasions shelling disrupted their supply of energy, forcing the plant to rely on backup generators.

Experts say a pumping station has to be constructed at the site, because there is insufficient cooling water available. The June 2023 destruction by Russian soldiers of the Nova Kakhova dam downstream eliminated the easy supply of necessary water from the Dnipro river.

Two civilians were reportedly killed by Russian missile attacks on Sunday, including one in a ballistic missile strike in an eastern district of Kyiv; while Russia said it captured a border village near Sumy in north-east Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 1,460 guided aerial bombs, nearly 670 attack drones, and more than 30 missiles over the past week. The Ukrainian president said: “The number of air attacks is increasing.”

US-brokered ceasefire talks have only achieved limited results thus far. Both sides agreed to stop attacking energy targets, though each accuses the other of violations; while a maritime ceasefire agreed to by Ukraine has not been accepted by Russia.

A Russian official involved in the negotiations said on Sunday that diplomatic contacts between Russia and the US could come again as early as next week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","UK touts hypersonic missile test","https://www.rt.com/news/615310-uk-hypersonic-missile-test/","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 16:24:00 GMT","

UK scientists have collaborated with the US and private firms to successfully test hypersonic missile propulsion, the British Defense Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

Hypersonic missiles are projectiles that can travel at speeds at least five times the speed of sound, velocities that make them either extremely difficult or impossible to intercept using modern air defenses. Russia has introduced and deployed its own missiles of this kind during the Ukraine conflict.

Successful tests of the prototype cruise missile engine will aid in arming the UK with hypersonic weapons by 2030, the ministry said.

A joint team led by the UK's Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), collaborating with the US Air Force Research Laboratory and companies in the industry, have run 233 tests of the new high-speed air-breathing engine. Once completed, the propulsion system could see missiles traveling at several thousand miles per hour.

”We are living in a more dangerous world and it has never been more important for us to innovate and stay ahead of our adversaries,” UK Defense Secretary John Healey said in the statement.

The test was part of the AUKUS military bloc's hypersonic weapons research program, according to Dstl CEO Paul Hollinshead. The bloc encompasses the US, the UK, and Australia.

Last December, Washington touted a successful test of its domestic Long Range Hypersonic Weapon, developed by the Lockheed Martin Corporation.

China, India, Iran, and North Korea have touted their own hypersonic weapons tests over the last several years. Tehran used its hypersonic Fattah-1 missile in its exchange of attacks with Israel last year, according to Iran.

Moscow and Beijing have pulled ahead in the race to develop hypersonic weapons over the last decade. Russia put its first armament of the kind, the air-launched Kinzhal, into service in 2017, while China rolled out its DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle two years later.

Russia has used Kinzhal and naval Zircon hypersonic missiles throughout the Ukraine conflict. Last November, Moscow carried out the first combat test of its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, striking Ukraine's Yuzhmash military industrial facility in Dnepr.

Billionaire Elon Musk said Saturday he hoped in the future the United States and Europe could create “a very close, stronger partnership” and reach a “zero-tariff zone.” He made his remarks via videolink to delegates at Italy's League party's congress in Florence.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Top administration officials said Sunday that more than 50 countries targeted by President Donald Trump's new tariffs have reached out to begin negotiations over the sweeping import taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system.

The higher rates are set to be collected beginning Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said unfair trade practices are not “the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” The United States, he said, must see “what the countries offer and whether it's believable.”

Trump, who spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, posted online that “WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy.” His Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. 

“There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?” Bessent said. “What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”

Trump's tariff blitz, announced April 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of global trade. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the U.S. He is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. 




Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly.

Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are “angry and retaliating,” and, he said, “by the way, coming to the table.” He cited the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks.

Adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting American allies and adversaries alike, including Israel, which is facing a 17% tariff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with Trump along with the war in Gaza and other issues.

Another American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. Trump said Vietnam's leader said in a telephone call that his country “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” And a key European partner, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump's move but was “ready to deploy all the tools — negotiating and economic — necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. 

“The tariffs are coming. Of course they,” he said, adding that Trump needed to reset global trade. But he committed only to having them “definitely” remain “for days and weeks.”

In Congress, where Trump's Republican Party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease.

Several Republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire.

Wyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 member of the Senate's GOP leadership, said Trump is “doing what he has every right to do.” But, he acknowledged, “there is concern, and there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets.” 

“There'll be a discussion in the Senate,” Barrasso said of the tariffs. “We'll see which way the discussion goes.”

Trump's government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, had been relatively silent on Trump's tariffs, but said at a weekend event in Italy that he would like to see the U.S. and Europe move to “a zero-tariff situation.” The comment from the Tesla owner who leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency drew a rebuke from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.

“Elon, when he is on his DOGE lane, is great. But we understand what's going on here. We just have to understand. Elon sells cars,” Navarro said. He added: “He's simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do.”

Lawrence Summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said Trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. 

If other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the U.S, does, too, he said, “it's just making a deal, then we don't raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the United States. If it's a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the United States, then we're going to have these tariffs permanently. So the president can't have it both ways.”

Bessent was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Hassett and Summers appeared on ABC's “This Week,” Lutnick and Barrasso were on CBS' “Face the Nation” and Navarro was interviewed on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Florida has gone from being picked to finish sixth in the rugged Southeastern Conference to pushing all the way to the final Monday night of the season.

Big 12 champion Houston and Florida will meet in the national championship game in the Alamodome to wrap up only the second NCAA Tournament when all the No. 1 seeds made it to the Final Four. 

Still, this title game matchup is quite a surprise, and features two teams that haven't been this far in a long time. BetMGM Sportsbook had Florida listed as a 1 1/2-point favorite.

The Cougars (35-4) won their semifinal game Saturday night by overcoming a 14-point deficit in the final eight minutes for a 70-67 stunner over Duke and freshman sensation Cooper Flagg, the AP national player of the year. 

That was after Florida (35-4), with AP All-America guard Walter Clayton Jr. scoring 34 points, only had to come back from eight points down after halftime in its 79-73 win over SEC rival Auburn. 

Houston, which has an 18-game winning streak, is in its first national championship game since back-to-back appearances in 1983 and 1984 during the Phi Slama Jama era. 

This is Florida's first since winning its back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007 under Billy Donovan. The Gators, with third-year coach Todd Golden, have an 11-game winning streak since a loss at Georgia at the end of February.




“It's pretty incredible,” Golden said. “In three years, been fortunate to build a great staff that is aligned, that works really hard for each other. Then we've just accumulated a great group of guys on our roster. It took a little bit to get all these pieces together. But to a man, they all pull the same direction.”

The Cougars have won 30 of their last 31 games since two overtime losses over three days in a tournament in Las Vegas at the end of November. Their only loss since was 82-81 in OT on Feb. 1 to Texas Tech, an Elite Eight team. Their other loss this season: 74-69 to Auburn in the second game.

Coach Kelvin Sampson and Houston also made the Final Four four years ago, losing to eventual champion Baylor in the national semifinal in the NCAA tourney in a bubble in Indianapolis because of the COVID-19 pandemic. L.J. Cryer, now Houston's leading scorer, was a freshman for the Bears on that title team. 

Now the Cougars will play for a championship after being the first Texas team to make a Final Four held in the Lone Star State — after so much talk about the other teams that made it to San Antonio. 

“This whole year, I've been trying to stay off social media and stuff like that. I really don't see those type of things,” Cryer said. “I try just to listen to coach Sampson, and he believed we were the best team in the tournament, so that's the only person I listened to.”

Florida entered Saturday's semifinals ranked No. 2 in KenPom's adjusted offensive efficiency by scoring 129.1 points per 100 possessions, and Clayton had his second 30-point game in a row. He is the leading scorer in this NCAA tourney with 123 points (24.6 per game) and has made 18 of 32 shots (.563) with 8 of 16 3-pointers the past two games.

Houston was ranked first in adjusted defensive efficiency at 87.4 points per 100 possessions, and was one of only four schools — all the teams that made the Final Four — to rank among the KenPom.com top 10 for both offense and defense. The Cougars were at 123.9 points to rank 10th offensively.

Panelists Michael Brown, Steve Duncan and Mica Trevino discuss the 29 cartel members extradited to the U.S. from Mexico on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Two people are behind bars after the latest arrests of suspected thieves from Mexico allegedly nabbing millions of dollars of Nike sneakers in elaborate railroad heists in the Mojave Desert. 

On March 27, the Hualapai Nation Police Department in Arizona pulled over the driver of a maroon Chevy Tahoe ""suspected to be involved in train robberies in the area,"" according to a statement from the agency. 

As officers conducted the traffic stop, eight people jumped out of the car and fled. Police said they located stolen Nike shoes nearby, and the driver of the vehicle, a man from Mexico, was arrested.

During the investigation, police pulled over a woman driving a white Toyota 4Runner for failing to yield to an emergency vehicle. 

Upon approaching that vehicle, officers ""observed evidence of criminal activity"" also linked to the train robberies, according to police.

The woman was ordered out of the vehicle by officers, and, despite initially complying, she reentered the vehicle and sped away, police said. As she attempted to evade authorities, she allegedly struck a patrol officer, who was not injured.

The woman dodged police for approximately 80 miles before losing control of her vehicle in a construction zone and smashing into a guardrail near the Arizona-California border, police said. She was ejected from the vehicle and transported to a hospital with minor injuries.

Both suspects were in the U.S. illegally and have been booked into the Mohave County Adult Detention Center. 

The Mohave County Sheriff's Office and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

The heist comes as authorities have seen a rise in railroad heists targeting Nike shoes between California and Arizona over the past two years.

In February, a grand jury returned an indictment against 11 defendants, including nine illegal immigrants, from a theft of Nike merchandise being shipped through northern Arizona, according to the Department of Justice. 

Authorities said the Sinaloa Cartel stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in Nike shoes from a moving BNSF train in Arizona in January.

""Criminal organizations that specialize in stealing from trains, which consist primarily of Mexican citizens with connections to the Mexican State of Sinaloa, have used the technique of cutting air hoses to control where trains with valuable cargo come to a stop,"" the DOJ said in a statement. ""This act is very dangerous and can cause the trains, which travel up to 70 miles per hour, to derail.""

Thieves will often leave boxes of stolen goods along railroad tracks for a second crew to pick up and transport to California, where the products will be sold online, according to federal prosecutors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Here's what the smartest people in markets and economics are saying about Trump's tariffs","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-liberation-day-tariffs-reactions-commentators-2025-4","Sun, 06 Apr 2025 17:50:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2 — and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering.

Here's what big names in business and economics have been saying:

Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs ""run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters."" He added: ""Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.""

He said the Business Roundtable ""supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners"" but called on him to introduce ""additional reasonable exemptions"" and a ""transparent, predictable exclusion process.""

""Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much,"" Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. ""The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion.""

Summers added that the tariffs were the most expensive and ""masochistic"" the US had imposed in decades.

""The price action in global financial markets in the immediate aftermath of the US tariff announcement points to major worries about global economic growth,"" Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant PIMCO and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on X.

""These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs,"" Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's ""Peston"" program.

Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: ""I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. This is not a buy-the-dip opportunity. It's a sell the dip opportunity.""

""So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? What is with that adverb 'again' which is defined as 'returning to a previous condition'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don't all live at the average!),"" David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, said on X.

""Have tariffs really stood in the way of wealth creation in America? I think the title should simply be the truth: 'Let's Make the World Poor Again' (and then we can buy it at a discount),"" Rosenberg added.

Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the ""Liberation Day"" label was ""Orwellian doublespeak.""

""Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be — ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world,"" he said on X.

""I guess it's just possible that when we get details about the Trump tariffs they will be lower than what he just announced, but based on what he said, he's gone full-on crazy,"" Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter.

""If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them,"" Krugman added.

""March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth,"" wrote Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column.

""Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings),"" he added.

""The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.3% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household consumer loss of $3,800 in 2024$. Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,700,"" wrote the Yale Budget Lab in a new analysis published on April 2, shortly after Trump's blanket tariff announcement.

""True, the United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries,"" said Jared Bernstein, former chief economist, in his newsletter. ""That means, as Trump has correctly argued, we can hurt them more than they can hurt us. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners.""

""First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices — as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points — and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2,"" he added.

""Monstrously destructive, incoherent, ill-informed tariffs based on fabrications, imagined wrongs, discredited theories and ignorance of decades of evidence. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else,"" said Justin Wolfers, economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky.

""If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth,"" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin chief economist, on BlueSky.

""Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built,"" she added.

The latest set of tariffs is ""a similar event to going off the gold standard in 1971. It's an epic event. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance,"" Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC.

""I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%,"" said Gross, who's also known as ""Bond King.""

Gross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to ""catching a falling knife.""

""Tariffs attack US trading partners but, in effect, attack US corporate profit margins first,"" wrote Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. ""The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. The macro risk hitting markets is real, but only accentuates the devaluation process.""

""Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising,"" Blitz wrote.

Jim O'Neill, former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the ""sensible"" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services.

He said this would be ""very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in.""

If the US wants to continue down this ""kamikaze path,"" the UK will have to respond, O'Neill added. ""It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves.""

""Just had a journalist ask me to explain ""Liberation Day,"" Stephanie Kelton, author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. ""I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets.""

George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said in a Friday note that markets were pricing in a global recession.

""This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. The countries that respond the quickest and most forcefully to this shock are those whose currencies will likely be the most resilient. And, on the flipside, the more the US fiscal strategy under the Trump administration lacks visibility, the more the market will punish the dollar and US assets.

""One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. Remember that during the European supply-shock of 2022, the ECB turned hawkish. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed.""

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a ""significant risk"" to the global economy.

""We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,"" she said in a statement on Thursday.

Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, told Ireland's Newstalk that the tariffs would be ""negative the world over.""

She said Trump's move ""will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate.""

Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, posted on X on Friday:

""The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Why not give them a chance? Make the 10pct min tariff immediate but defer the ""reciprocal"" part 6 mos. Take the win! The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!""

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations.

""While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,"" Powell said at a conference for business journalists. ""The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.""

The central bank president repeatedly said it was too early to tell what the Fed's response might be.

""We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said.""

Kevin Corinth, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs, which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes ""no economic sense.""

""The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc,"" Corinth wrote. ""But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold.""

In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could ""hit imminently and extend until next year"" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate.

""Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario,"" he predicted.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV, veteran analyst Ed Yardeni said he hoped the ""message that the stock market is sending to the administration is being heard.""

""The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy,"" he added.

Brad Setser, former senior advisor to the US trade representative and fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the latest round of tariffs will be ""painful.""

""I think what the announcement on Wednesday showed is that the decision of the administration, not surprisingly, was to follow President Trump's instincts, not the instincts of his more moderate advisors, to go all in,"" Setser said on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast.

Setser said the goal is to ""radically restructure the US and global economies using tariffs as a tool, with some flexibility perhaps to negotiate at the edges. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs.""

Greg Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young, told Yahoo Finance that ""the risk of a recession are very real"" with the tariffs in place.

""The risks of a particularly severe recession are real, because if these tariffs remain in place on a persistent basis, you would see a drag on US economic activity worth about 1% to 1.5% of growth,"" he said. ""In an economy that is expected to grow around 1.5%, that puts the economy essentially into stagnation. Add to that a 1% to 1.5% lift on inflation, and you have stagflation.""

Douglas Irwin, the trade historian and economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in The Economist that Trump's tariffs ""blow an enormous hole"" in the trade policy that the US has advanced since World War II.

""The president now touts his tariffs as mainly 'reciprocal': 'Whatever they charge us, we charge them.' This makes them sound fair. Far from it,"" Irwin said.

""Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this week's events is the ability of one person to completely remake American trade policy. A situation in which the occupant of the White House can make such momentous changes on his own, unchecked, reflects serious political decay in American politics.""

One day before Trump's latest tariff announcement, the economist Thomas Sowell told the Hoover Institution that the president's tariffs could lead to a global trade war.

""It's painful to see a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated,"" Sowell said. ""If you set off a worldwide trade war, that has a devastating history.""

""Everybody loses because everybody follows suit,"" he continued. ""And all that happens is that you get a great reduction in international trade.""

How did Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg get added to a Signal group chat with Trump administration officials discussing their plans for an airstrike in Yemen?

The simplest explanation: National Security Adviser Mike Waltz had Goldberg saved as a contact in his phone and accidentally added him. Indeed, when Waltz first claimed that Goldberg's phone number was “sucked in” from another contact, Goldberg scoffed, “This isn't ‘The Matrix.'”

But according to the Guardian, an internal investigation conducted by the White House's information technology office concluded that something more complicated taken place, with an iPhone auto-suggestion playing a key role: After Goldberg emailed the White House for comment on a story, a Trump spokesperson, Brian Hughes, texted the contents of Goldberg's email to Waltz.

As a result, Waltz's iPhone offered a “contact suggestion update” that ultimately saved Goldberg's phone number under Hughes' name. Then, when Waltz tried to add Hughes — now a spokesperson for the National Security Council — to the chat, he supposedly ended up adding Goldberg instead.

For his part, Goldberg said, “I'm not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz beyond saying I do know him and have spoken to him.”

Rookie driver Isack Hadjar secured his first top-10 finish of the 2025 season at the Japanese Grand Prix as he bounced back from his Qualifying troubles to execute a “perfect race”.

The Frenchman endured some discomfort in Qualifying for the race due to an issue with his seatbelt, but he came through the other side to claim P7 on the grid and equal his best race start.

Despite losing one position to Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton in the early stages, Hadjar was left energised by his strong performance at Suzuka Circuit as he netted four points for Racing Bulls and propelled himself to P13 in the standings.

The team have struggled to pull off their strategy calls at previous races, including in China where they went against the pack and opted for a two-stop, but they had no such issues this weekend with Hadjar.

The team celebrated Hadjar's P8 finish

“It was a perfect race honestly,” he said afterwards. “It's the first time this year [I've been] really happy.

“Even yesterday I felt I left some on the table but today, absolutely nothing so I'm really happy with the drive.”

He also confirmed that the seatbelt problem fortunately did not make a reappearance during the 53-lap Grand Prix, allowing him to fully focus and ultimately cross the line in P8, over three seconds ahead of the Williams of Alex Albon.

Hadjar also finished in front of his new team mate Liam Lawson, who swapped seats with Yuki Tsunoda to return to Racing Bulls – the New Zealander previously drove in 11 races for them over the course of 2023 and 2024 and finished Sunday's race in P17.

The result has left the 20-year-old feeling optimistic for the next stage of the season's first triple header as the drivers now switch their attention to Bahrain, which differs greatly from the Suzuka track.

	Keith Caulfield



Ariana Grande's 2024 album Eternal Sunshine returns to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for its third total week atop the list, flying 87-1 on the April 12-dated chart, following the set's deluxe reissue, dubbed Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead. Bolstered with six previously unreleased songs, the expanded effort — available at streamers, and to purchase as a download, CD and vinyl LP — earned 137,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the week ending April 3 (up 968%), according to Luminate.

	All versions of the album, old and new, are combined for tracking and charting purposes and continue to chart under the title Eternal Sunshine.




			Trending on Billboard		







Eternal Sunshine premiered atop the Billboard 200 dated March 23, 2024, and spent its first two weeks at No. 1. The set contains a pair of chart-toppers on the Billboard Hot 100 in the songs “Yes, And?” and “We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love).” The project also returns to the top 40 on the Billboard 200 for the first time since the Oct. 19, 2024-dated list, when it ranked at No. 34.


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new April 12, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on April 8. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	With Eternal Sunshine's return to No. 1 after a year and two weeks, it's the second title in the last six months to jump back to the top after more than a year away. On the Jan. 4, 2025-dated chart, SZA's SOS shot back to the top after a 22-month vacation from No. 1. It returned to lead the list after its SOS Deluxe: LANA reissue.


	Further, Eternal Sunshine has the largest positional jump to No. 1 (bolting 87-1) since last September, when Travis Scott's Days Before Rodeo vaulted 106-1 on the Sept. 28, 2024-dated list, after the album's vinyl edition was shipped to customers.

	











	Of Eternal Sunshine's 137,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending April 3, SEA units comprise 75,000 (up 541%, equaling 98.45 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it reenters at No. 2 on Top Streaming Albums), traditional album sales comprise 61,000 (up 5,338%, it reenters at No. 1 on Top Album Sales for a second total week atop the list) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 4,115%).


	Sales of Eternal Sunshine were bolstered by its availability in a variety of permutations released for the Brighter Days Ahead launch. The original Eternal Sunshine album had 13 tracks, and the core Brighter Days Ahead album added six cuts: one extended version of the album-opening “Inro (End of the World)” and five new songs.


	Grande's webstore sold three exclusive variants of the download edition of the album: the 19-track edition, a version with the 19 tracks plus instrumentals of the same cuts, and another version with the 19 tracks and a cappella versions of each cut (all with alternative cover artwork). Grande also released two vinyl variants and six CD editions of the reissue (some signed by the artist), containing the 19 tracks plus the three bonus tracks originally found on the album's “slightly deluxe” reissues last year.


Playboi Carti's MUSIC falls to No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart after two weeks on top, with 91,000 equivalent album units earned (down 31%). It holds at No. 1 on the Top Streaming Albums chart for a third week.


Lil Durk collects his seventh top 10-charting effort on the Billboard 200 as Deep Thoughts debuts at No. 3 with 64,000 equivalent album units earned. The set arrives largely from streaming activity, as it was only available to purchase as a standard widely available digital download album. Of its first-week units, SEA units comprise 63,000 (equaling 85.92 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it debuts at No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 1,000 and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.

	











	The rest of the top 10 on the Billboard 200 comprises former No. 1s. Kendrick Lamar's GNX falls 3-4 (58,000 units; down 10%); PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U is down 4-5 (nearly 58,000; down 6%); SZA's SOS slips 5-6 (56,000; down 7%); Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet dips 6-7 (51,000; down 7%); Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos is a non-mover at No. 8 (45,000; down 8%); Lady Gaga's MAYHEM falls 7-9 (nearly 45,000; down 15%); and Morgan Wallen's One Thing at a Time is stationary at No. 10 (almost 45,000; down 2%).

	The National Park Service has edited a page on its website that describes the Underground Railroad to reduce the emphasis on Harriet Tubman, instead highlighting “Black/White cooperation.”


The Washington Post first reported the changes, noting that the government replaced a large portrait of Tubman as well as a quote at the top of the page where Tubman described herself as “the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years.” In place of Tubman's portrait is a collage of five U.S. Postal Service stamps that depict Black and white abolitionist figures, including Tubman, who were involved in helping to bring escaped enslaved people to the north.


	“The Underground Railroad — the resistance to enslavement through escape and flight, through the end of the Civil War — refers to the efforts of enslaved African Americans to gain their freedom by escaping bondage,” the page used to read.


	The opening lines of the page no longer mention slavery but call the Underground Railroad “one of the most significant expressions of the American civil rights movement.” It also states that the network “bridged the divides of race.” 

	











	According to The Post, since Trump returned to office, dozens of government-owned webpages have “softened descriptions of some of the most shameful moments of the nation's past,” including erasing or editing references to slavery and Jim Crow-era segregation. 


	High-ranking political appointees at the Interior Department, which manages the Park Service, have directed staff to identify webpages that the administration might take issue with, according to anonymous sources who spoke to the paper.


	The Post found additional changes on dozens of pages, including:


	In a statement to The Post, a spokesperson for the Park Service said: “The National Park Service has been entrusted with preserving local history, celebrating local heritage, safeguarding special places and sharing stories of American experiences. We take this role seriously and can point to many examples of how we tell nuanced and difficult stories about American history.”
