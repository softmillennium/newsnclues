                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft has formed a new Superintelligence team within its AI division, aiming to develop what it calls “humanist superintelligence” — advanced AI that remains under human control. The goal, he wrote, is to advance technology “within limits” — keeping humanity in control while harnessing AI's potential to improve lives on a global scale Suleyman will lead the new MAI Superintelligence Team, joined by Microsoft AI Chief Scientist Karén Simonyan and other core Microsoft AI leaders and researchers. Key leaders who've been involved in Microsoft's model development work are also expected to be part of the effort. University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digs, a Vancouver, Wash.-based startup that sells software for homebuilding, raised $5 million. Founded in 2022, Digs' software helps residential homebuilders streamline various aspects of their workflows including document organization, communication, and other tasks. It focuses on the pre-construction and design phase, turning static blueprints into digital, searchable files. Digs also converts build documents (PDF floor plans, change orders, etc.) Fink said revenue is growing but didn't provide specific metrics. The company said it has nearly 10,000 homes on its platform. Fink previously founded an augmented reality glasses startup called ONtheGo Platforms, which Atheer acquired in 2015. Fink started Digs with Ty Frackiewicz, who previously co-founded ONtheGo and was vice president of product at Streem. Digs customer Lanthorne Homes also invested in the latest round. SPLYCAP General Partner Tyler Williams joined the board at Digs. The startup recently hired longtime sales leader Stephen Molen as chief revenue officer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meet Itiner-e, a new high-resolution digital dataset and map of the Roman Empire's roads around 150 CE. A team of researchers used archaeological and historical records, topographic maps, and satellite imagery to create the behemoth, which charts 185,896 miles (299,171 km) of roads across almost 1,544,409 square miles (4,000,000 square km). “The Roman Empire's road system was critical for structuring the movement of people, goods and ideas, and sustaining imperial control. Yet, it remains incompletely mapped and poorly integrated across sources despite centuries of research,” the researchers wrote in a study published today in the journal Nature. When the Roman Empire peaked in the second century CE, it encompassed more than 55 million people from modern-day Britain to Egypt and Syria. The new map reveals 68,734 miles (110,616 km) more of roads than previous estimates. Notably, only 2.7% of the roads' precise locations are certain. They also noted that Itiner-e does not represent how the road system developed over time. At its most basic level, Itiner-e provides an impressive new visual of the ancient Roman territories that helps you appreciate how well-connected the empire was. If you compare it to a modern map, you might even find some nerdy easter eggs—like the fact that the road that connects modern-day Bologna, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, and Milan is the same as the one that connected ancient Bononia, Mutina, Parma, Placentia, and Mediolanum in 150 CE. 1,700-year-old ancient Roman burial grounds have come to light in southern France. Homeowners found a marble slab carved with inscriptions while clearing out undergrowth in their yard. The "walking moai hypothesis" could end a long-time debate over how ancient engineers moved these iconic statues around Easter Island. Not much is known about the mysterious, prehistoric Châtelperronian people, but they did leave behind some tantalizing clues. Recently discovered stone tools in Turkey suggest the presence of a bygone landmass that early humans may have used to cross into Europe. There is mounting evidence that after the Romans left Britain, the region's economy didn't suffer as badly as once thought.</p>

And I am not talking about about people living in the middle of the desert, I am talking about people who are 10 to 15 minutes away by car from a small town.So yes Starlink or it's local equivalent are necessary. A third solution is to pipe it across timezones using HVDC and accept some level of efficiency loss and some geopolitical risks.A fourth solution is to mix lots of wind, which performs better in winter and cancels out the lower insolation.Realistically it's going to be all of the above, with the balance determined by local factors. Maybe something like microwave transmission or cheap superconductors will solve it. Extend that to 10k km and you're looking at approximately 25%, but if it's surplus solar, who cares?Such a line costs as much as a highway broadly speaking, so it's not impossible to build. If we want surplus power, if we want a strong grid, if we want cheap power, if we want to enable the ability to quite literally waste solar power on inefficient processes (including things like industrial processes that produce less CO2 or generating hydrogen or methane as long term energy storage), we have to get the government to make it happenBut, uh, we hired people who would rather spend $170 billion on harassing random cities and brown people so.....

I also know breakers for HVDC are extremely challenging to make, AC power has the benefit of sine waves crossing the zero line so power can be switched/broken a lot easier than with DC. For sure, China produces a lot of pollution as they are modernizing, but they are also investing a lot in the direction of sustainability. China's numbers did rise quickly on that measure and is above the EU now I think but still way below the US.And if you don't like per capita, then China with 4x as many people is still behind the US when you compare cumulative CO2. And if you don't like per capita, then China with 4x as many people is still behind the US when you compare cumulative CO2. The Chinese leadership understands several things very clearly:- The country has experienced multiple catastrophic natural disasters in the past.-  Such disasters often lead to regime change (losing the mandate of heaven via natural disasters leading to social unrest)- The leadership is comprised of smart people (and a lot of engineers) and they don't play dumb political games like denying the reality of climate change.- Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment. - The country has experienced multiple catastrophic natural disasters in the past.-  Such disasters often lead to regime change (losing the mandate of heaven via natural disasters leading to social unrest)- The leadership is comprised of smart people (and a lot of engineers) and they don't play dumb political games like denying the reality of climate change.- Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment. -  Such disasters often lead to regime change (losing the mandate of heaven via natural disasters leading to social unrest)- The leadership is comprised of smart people (and a lot of engineers) and they don't play dumb political games like denying the reality of climate change.- Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment. - The leadership is comprised of smart people (and a lot of engineers) and they don't play dumb political games like denying the reality of climate change.- Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment. - Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment. So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment. On the concrete side we do know that they also care deeply about local pollution. They made massive efforts to clean the air for the Beijing Olympics, amongst other many other moves to reduce local air pollution. Therefore reaching self sufficiency in terms of power generation will make this threat less relevant and an enemy will no be able to use it to make them back off. But none of that matters, China would pursue massive solar power infrastructure regardless, because they want energy independence. Stupid amounts of solar power means they will no longer be importing lots of oil and fuel, and that means they would be less vulnerable to the US blockading them in some sort of conflict, which is one of their primary geopolitical concerns.They would do this even if solar power was dramatically less effective or was significantly more expensive, because solar power is the first kind of power generation that it is economical to way overbuild, and have serious redundancy and surplus and excess, because there's no consumables that scale your running costs like if you tried to build massive amounts of coal power plants.China would like to have that kind of scale for power because they can use it to subsidize things like datacenters running less efficient Chinese made computer components. The fact that power doesn't have to run a profit in China helps this.The US should be taking fucking notes, about how nationalized infrastructure can be a force multiplier economically, and how infrastructure that doesn't have to be profitable can be even more powerful.Slaving ourselves to the enrichment of well connected capital owners is harming our country, and preventing a literal energy revolution.

Wholesale power prices become negative during peak solar times - but retail companies will still charge you for using it!.Obviously, that didn't go down too well and this is the response - free electricity during peak solar hours.That said, my understanding is that free electricity is only for people who are on the "default offer" from the electricity companies - that is effectively the highest tier of pricing.

When you let the market clear and send out price signals, markets almost always become more efficient (which means that consumers benefit overall) Prices have gone negative because of things like subsidies - which in the short term is a good thing IMHO - it subsidizes industries developing systems to make use of that free (but not negative cost) energy... Somebody has to go and turn it off, and having this person available overwhelms all of your operational costs.Or alternatively, you need the infrastructure to do it automatically, what is currently expensive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Erlanger and Se Yong Park, co-founders of consumer crypto trading app Fomo, took an unusual route to raising capital that is paying off for them. Their app launched in May and they just announced a $17 million Series A round led by Benchmark — an atypical crypto bet for the top-tier VC firm — bringing total funding to $19 million. “We knew that every single person would be valuable to us in the business,” Erlanger told TechCrunch. They landed such big names in the crypto world as Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron, co-founder of Solana Raj Gokal, and former Coinbase CTO and super-angel Balaji Srinivasan, the founders said. The angels liked their idea of a super app that gives consumers access to every crypto asset ever (millions of them), available on any blockchain, with, they promise, no technical friction. The app also has a social component baked into it, where users can follow friends and leaders they respect to see their trades. While Fomo doesn't yet have every asset from every blockchain available, the founders said they are on track to be close to that goal in six months. And among the millions of assets they do offer today, users can trade everything from major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana to meme coins and altcoins, they say. This essentially let users download the app and quickly start trading. “We saw a massive influx of users and revenue,” Erlanger said. That's a real selling point for users interested in holding the major coins, Park said. Their many-angels strategy paid off because not one but three people reached out to Benchmark early-stage investor Chetan Puttagunta to offer an introduction, Puttagunta told TechCrunch. Benchmark is selective with its picks and doesn't invest much in crypto startups. It backed Chainalysis in 2018, along with Toncoin and a few others. “Their vision is clearly resonating with truly exceptional growth since they launched a few months ago.” So far, it looks like Benchmark's bet could pay off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the story of Inception, a startup developing diffusion-based AI models that just raised $50 million in seed funding led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Mayfield, Innovation Endeavors, Microsoft's M12 fund, Snowflake Ventures, Databricks Investment, and Nvidia's venture arm NVentures. These models power image-based AI systems like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Sora. Having worked on those systems since before the AI boom made them exciting, Ermon is using Inception to apply the same models to a broader range of tasks. Mercury has already been integrated into a number of development tools, including ProxyAI, Buildglare, and Kilo Code. Most importantly, Ermon says the diffusion approach will help Inception's models conserve on two of the most important metrics: latency (response time) and compute cost. Diffusion models, trained for image generation, take a more holistic approach, modifying the overall structure of a response incrementally until it matches the desired result. But a growing body of research suggests diffusion models may perform better when a model is processing large quantities of text or managing data constraints. As Ermon tells it, those qualities become a real advantage when performing operations over large codebases. Diffusion models also have more flexibility in how they utilize hardware, a particularly important advantage as the infrastructure demands of AI become clear. Where auto-regression models have to execute operations one after another, diffusion models can process many operations simultaneously, allowing for significantly lower latency in complex tasks. “We've been benchmarked at over 1,000 tokens per second, which is way higher than anything that's possible using the existing autoregressive technologies,” Ermon says, “because our thing is built to be parallel.

An enthusiast has shared their first designs, melding the disparate worlds of PC DIY with model railroading. It adds a truly dynamic aspect to the case window view, and we can imagine a tiny stationmaster shouting, “All aboard the PCI Express, we're going gaming.” T-gauge model trains are the smallest commonly available to hobbyists. Nevertheless, once properly set up, T-gauge builders can enjoy realistic speed controls and the convenience of magnetized track building systems. Even the biggest and best graphics cards don't really have enough room for anything more substantial, so T-gauge is the best choice in a PC like this. T-gauge track has a minimum corner radius of approximately 60mm; moving up to Z-gauge would double that. Beautiful-Turnip-353 reveals that they have more ambitious plans for the build. A helpful fellow enthusiast in the comments suggested controlling the train throttle via an internal 5V PWM fan header and adjusting it using software such as FanControl. Another pointed out that it would also be possible, for example, to auto-adjust the train's speed in line with the PC's temperature sensors. Beautiful-Turnip-353 hints that they are seeking to intensify their railroad/PC crossover designs. “I want to make a much more train-themed build in the future, but something is better than nothing, haha.” There is a lot Beautiful-Turnip-353 could do with more scenery in the case, and the outer PC case design, and they know it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why focusing on the energy system and large companies is more important than policing individual behavior. Picture it: I'm minding my business at a party, parked by the snack table (of course). It quickly turns to work, and upon learning that I'm a climate technology reporter, my new acquaintance says something like: “Should I be using AI? Generally, I tell people not to worry—let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want. That response might surprise some people, but I promise I'm not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. Data centers could consume up to 945 terawatt-hours annually by 2030. But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals, partly because AI concerns remind me so much of another question: “What should I do to reduce my carbon footprint?” The reality is, no one person can address climate change alone: Our entire society is built around burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need political action and public support for researching and scaling up climate technology. People are asking climate reporters at barbecues whether they should feel guilty about using chatbots too frequently when we need to focus on the bigger picture. Big tech companies are playing into this narrative by providing energy-use estimates for their products at the user level. That's so small as to be virtually insignificant. But stopping with the energy use of a single query obscures the full truth, which is that this industry is growing quickly, building energy-hungry infrastructure at a nearly incomprehensible scale to satisfy the AI appetites of society as a whole. (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.) Increasingly, there's no getting away from AI, and it's not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Same for chatting with customer service while you're shopping online. Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that's changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact. Ultimately, as long as you aren't relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn't be too worried about your individual AI footprint.

It should be an easy sell for a wide variety of players, from those wanting to relive their youthful memories to any self-styled gaming historians wanting to experience crucial moments of the medium.

Eight more come from the Atari 5200, 11 from the Atari 7800 (albeit with a hefty caveat on that front), plus three dozen of Atari's various arcade originals and a handful from lesser-known sources such as Mattel's M-Network carts. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's also a trio of Pac-Man games (arcade classic, Atari 2600, and “Speed Up” flavors) and Balls of Steel, a mid-'90s pinball game broken out into its own section, with seven tables based on Atari games. Drifting further, there are 40 titles included from defunct Japanese publisher Jaleco, including games released on 8-bit and 16-bit consoles and in arcades, and 20 from Piko, a US label that specializes in its own digital archaeology, licensing lost and abandoned titles from yesteryear. Still, it doesn't hurt to have some added variety, and there are plenty of genuinely hidden gems in this selection—Piko's Brave Battle Saga, a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive RPG released in the Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets in 1996 is a particularly nice find. The Gamestation Go also tips its hat to modernity with five Atari Recharged titles, a series of remakes that take the core mechanics of classic games and revamp them with updated graphics, extra features, and even achievements. The five here—Asteroids, Berzerk, Breakout, Centipede, and Missile Command—are available on other platforms where they usually sell for $10 apiece, which makes for a nice value add here. Hundreds of games means inevitable overlap, though, with some titles cropping up repeatedly. Centipede alone appears five times, with 2600, 5200, 7800, Arcade, and Recharged iterations. Others, including Missile Command, Asteroids, and Berzerk, also make multiple appearances. On one hand, it's an absolute gift for games preservation—being able to see how these games changed and evolved as they hopped platforms is pretty cool. That “hefty caveat” when it comes to the Atari 7800 games, though? Select any of the games from that platform, and you're met with a slight audio pause and a flicker of the menu screen, but nothing else. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. A press spokesperson for My Arcade says that a “firmware update development is in progress, and an official announcement will be made once it's ready to deploy,” but it's far from ideal for the Gamestaion Go to be launching with several of its games unplayable and no date in sight for a fix. While most games have an option to swap the screen ratio between original dimensions and the handheld's 16:9, some don't look right in either format. Anything with vector graphics seems to be particularly prone to this, but not uniformly—Missile Command seemed mostly fine, but Tempest could throw up problems like broken text or a stretched appearance. On a more positive note, the use of emulators does mean you can expand the already massive library via a MicroSD slot, if you have any (legally obtained, obviously) ROMs to load up. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Games are grouped under chunky category headers, each one leading to a perfunctory list. You can't search for titles, just scroll through the list, but you can at least mark favorites to return to later. Players are treated to a nice bio of each game and classic case art or, in a neat touch for the arcade titles, shots of their original cabinets—another lovely nod to the history of the roster. There are also helpful touches like being able to check the controls or read a tips section for each game, while the emulated approach means you can create save states for many titles.

The most annoying system aspect is that the device doesn't remember Wi-Fi settings, meaning you'll need to enter your network credentials every time. Given you only need to connect to check for system updates, it's not a deal breaker, but it's an irritating chore every time. The Gamestation Go's secret weapon isn't in the sheer volume of games included, though, but in how many ways it gives you to play them. Along with all the expected inputs—four face buttons, four shoulder buttons, and a surprisingly great D-pad—it also incorporates unique controls inspired by traditional Atari hardware, allowing you to play some of these early, experimental games as originally intended. Below it, a “Trak-Ball” allows for more accurate rotational controls, working great in Tempest. Below the ABXY face buttons is a full 12-key number pad. While all these curious controls give the handheld a distinct look—there's no way you'll mistake it for any other gaming handheld—they might seem overwhelming. Thankfully, the Gamestation Go proves itself a bright spark, with its fantastic "SmartGlow" feature. This genius bit of design has the necessary controls for each game light up with a warm orange LED, making it immediately clear which to use. Given the vast roster included, that's no small feat. The in-built screen offers a 720p resolution and decent, if not mind-blowing, brightness or color depth—but realistically, no one in 2025 is playing the games here for their graphical prowess. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. If you do want a bit more visual clarity though, you can connect the Gamestation Go to your main TV and enjoy full 1080p thanks to an HDMI-Out port, although some input lag may be noticeable depending on the game. Two USB-C ports on the rear allow wired controllers to be connected for multiplayer, easily accessed thanks to a sturdy kickstand that also keeps the console upright. You can also use the Gamestation Go as a controller in TV mode, allowing you to use the Paddle, Trak-Ball, or Num Pad on the big screen. A solid battery life of four to six hours helps for portable or TV play without needing to plug in. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Unfortunately, the device's build quality doesn't quite match up to its engineering. Annoyingly, the Paddle also tends to feel too stiff, and the Trak-Ball, too twitchy, and while it's possible to adjust sensitivity for some games, they rarely feel right. Those hand grips are more of an indented ridge either side, just about creating space to rest fingers, and making reaching the shoulder buttons a literal stretch. It's not the most uncomfortable handheld, but its chunky form means it sits in the hands like a boxy slab and isn't great for longer play sessions. The Gamestation Go feels like it has two identities. That version feels like a real love letter to Atari fans. The other is a slapdash bit of tech crammed with more games than anyone will realistically play, some of which may not work at all, and lacking polish. If system updates fix some of the inherent software and emulation issues, there's great potential here, but even then, probably only for those with a real passion for the days when Atari was king.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto, California, has some of the best real estate in the country, with a charming hodgepodge of homes ranging in style from Tudor revival to modern farmhouse and contemporary Mediterranean. It also has a gigantic compound that is home to Mark Zuckerberg, his wife Priscilla Chan, and their daughters Maxima, August, and Aurelia. Their land has expanded to include 11 previously separate properties, five of which are connected by at least one property line. The Zuckerberg compound's expansion first became a concern for Crescent Park neighbours as early as 2016, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market. Then, about five years later, neighbors noticed that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. This would be illegal under the area's residential zoning code without a permit. They began a crusade to shut it down that did not end until summer 2025. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. WIRED obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the neighborhood dispute—including 311 records, legal filings, construction plans, and emails—through a public record request filed to the Palo Alto Department of Planning and Development Services. (Mentions of “Zuckerberg” or “the Zuckerbergs” appear to have been redacted. Over time, neighbors became fed up with what they argued was the city's lack of action, particularly with respect to the school. “Just as you have not earned our trust, this property owner has broken many promises over the years, and any solution which depends on good faith behavioral changes from them is a failure from the beginning.” “Staff met with residents, conducted site visits, and provided updates by phone and email while engaging the owner's representative to address concerns,” Horrigan-Taylor said. The listing for Bicken Ben School, or BBS for short, in a California Department of Education directory claims the school opened on October 5, 2022. This, however, is the year after neighbors claim to have first seen it operating. It's also two and a half years after Sara Berge—the school's point of contact, per documents WIRED obtained from the state via public record request—claims to have started her role as “head of school” for a “Montessori pod” at a “private family office” according to her LinkedIn profile, which WIRED viewed in September and October. However, based on the documents WIRED obtained, and Palo Alto's public database of planning applications, the Zuckerbergs do not appear to have ever applied for or received this permit. A state directory lists BBS, the abbreviation for Bicken Ben School, as having operated until August 18, and three of Zuckerberg's neighbors—who all requested anonymity due to the high-profile nature of the family—confirmed to WIRED in late September that they had not seen or heard students being dropped off and picked up on weekdays in recent weeks. However, Zuckerberg family spokesperson Brian Baker tells WIRED that the school didn't close, per se. In response to a detailed request for comment, Baker provided WIRED with an emailed statement on behalf of the Zuckerbergs. “They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.” By the fall of 2024, Zuckerberg's neighbors were at their breaking point. At some point in mid-2024, according to an email from then mayor Greer Stone, a group of neighbors had met with Stone to air their grievances about the Zuckerberg compound and the illegal school they claimed it was operating. They all alleged that the property was operating illegally under city code. Both were closed by the planning department, which found no rule violations. An unknown number of additional complaints, mentioned in emails among city workers, were also made between 2020 and 2024—presumably delivered via phone calls, in person, or to city departments not included in WIRED's public record request. In December 2020, building inspection manager Korwyn Peck wrote to code enforcement officer Brian Reynolds about an inspection he attempted to conduct around the Zuckerberg compound, in response to several noise and traffic complaints from neighbors. He described that several men in SUVs had gathered to watch him, and a tense conversation with one of them had ensued. In a September 11, 2024, email to Jonathan Lait, Palo Alto's director of planning and development services and Palo Alto city attorney Molly Stump, one of Zuckerberg's neighbors alleged that since 2021, “despite numerous neighborhood complaints” to the city of Palo Alto, including “multiple code violation reports,” the school had continued to grow. They claimed that a garage at the property had been converted into another classroom, and that an increasing number of children were arriving each day. They asked the city to conduct a formal investigation into the school on Zuckerberg's property, adding that their neighbors are also “extremely concerned” about the school, and “are willing to provide eyewitness accounts in support of this complaint.” Over the next week, another neighbor forwarded this note to all six Palo Alto city council members, as well as then mayor Stone. One of these emails described the situation as “serious” and “untenable.” On December 11, 2024, the neighbor claimed that since one of their fellow neighbors had spoken to a Zuckerberg representative, and the representative had allegedly admitted that there was a school on the property, “it seems like an open and shut case.” “Our hope is that there is an equal process in place for all residents of Palo Alto regardless of wealth or stature,” the neighbor wrote. “It is hard to imagine that this kind of behavior would be ignored in any other circumstance.” That same day, Lait told Christine Wade, a partner at SSL Law Firm—who, in an August 2024 email thread, said she was “still working with” the Zuckerberg family—that the Zuckerbergs lacked the required permit to run a school in a residential zone. “Based on our review of local and state law, we believe this use constitutes a private school use in a residential zone requiring a conditional use permit,” Lait wrote in an email to Wade. According to several emails, Wade, Lait, and Mark Legaspi, CEO of the Zuckerberg family office called West 10, went on to arrange an in-person meeting at City Hall on January 9. Wade did not respond to a request for comment. There was another increasingly heated conversation happening behind the scenes. But a day after the meeting with Fox, two additional neighbours added their names to the September 11 complaint, per an email to Lait. On February 12, a neighbor began an email chain with Fox. This email was forwarded to Planning Department officials two months later. The neighbor, who seemingly attended the meeting, said they had “connected” with fellow neighbors “to review and revise” an earlier list of 14 requests that had been reportedly submitted to the Zuckerbergs at some previous point. The email notes that the Zuckerbergs had been “a part of our neighborhood for many years,” and that they “hope that this message will start an open and respectful dialogue,” built upon the “premise of how we all wish to be treated as neighbors.” This includes restricting parking by “security guards, contractors, staff, teachers, landscapers, visitors, etc.” In the event of major demolitions, concrete pours, or large parties, the email asks for advance notice, and for dedicated efforts to “monitor and mitigate noise.” Specifically, it asks the Zuckerbergs to get a use permit for the compound's school and to hold “a public hearing for transparency.” It also asks the family to not expand its compound any further. “I hope that as we continue to grow our relationship with you over time, you will increasingly enjoy the benefits of our proximity—e.g., enhanced safety and security, shared improvements, and increased property values.” Fox said that the Zuckerbergs instituted “a revised parking policy late last year” that should address their concerns, and promised to double down on efforts to give advanced notice about construction, parties, and other potential disruptions. She acknowledged that the compound has “residential support staff” including “childcare, culinary, personal assistants, property management, and security,” but said that they have “policies in place to minimize their impact on the neighborhood.” Starting in February, one of these neighbors took the lead on following up with Lait. They asked him for an update on February 11, and heard back a few days later. He didn't have any major updates, “but after conversations with the family's representatives, he said he was exploring whether a “subset of children” could continue to come to the school sometimes for "ancillary" uses. “I also believe a more nuanced solution is warranted in this case,” Lait added. Horrigan-Taylor, the Palo Alto spokesperson, told WIRED that Lait's mention of a “nuanced” solution referred to “resolving, to the extent permissible by law, neighborhood impacts and otherwise permitted use established by state law and local zoning.” “Would I, or any other homeowner, be given the courtesy of a ‘nuanced solution' if we were in violation of city code for over four years?” they added. “Please know that you have not earned our trust and that we will take every opportunity to hold the city accountable if your solution satisfies a single [redacted] property owner over the interests of an entire neighborhood,” they continued. The neighbor followed up on March 13, asking if he had “reconsidered” his plan to offer a “‘nuanced solution' for resolution of these ongoing issues by a serial code violator.” They asked when the neighborhood could “expect relief from the almost decade long disruptions.” In a document dated March 14, Wade argues that she believed the activities at “the Property” “represent an appropriate residential use based on established state law as well as constitutional principles.” to minimize noise, not loiter anywhere other than within the Family properties, and to keep areas clean,” Wade added in the letter. However, the family's representative said that they were pursuing a daycare license. Horrigan-Taylor confirmed with WIRED that “state licensed large family day care homes” do not require city approval, adding that the city also “does not regulate homeschooling.” “Thanks for this rather surprising information,” the neighbor replied about a week later. Baker told WIRED that the Zuckerbergs never ended up applying for a daycare license, a claim that corresponds with California's public registry of daycare centers. (There are only two registered daycare centers in Palo Alto, and neither belongs to the Zuckerbergs. The Zuckerbergs' oldest child, Maxima, will also turn 10 in December and consequently age out of any daycare legally operating in California.) In a school administrator job listing posted to the Association Montessori International website in July 2022 for “BBS,” Bicken Ben head of school Berge claims that the school had four distinct locations, and that applicants must be prepared to travel six to eight weeks per year. Most of the Zuckerbergs' neighbors did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. “Frankly I'm not sure what's going on,” one neighbor said, when reached by WIRED via landline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Siri, which somehow still stinks, is finally getting a new core AI model, and it's going to be a 1.2 trillion parameter Google Gemini-based LLM, according to Bloomberg Apple reporter Mark Gurman. Until Apple gets its act together on a proprietary AI system, Gurman writes, it will reportedly give Google about $1 billion per year for a temporary fix. Internally, Apple apparently calls the Google-powered Siri upgrade by the code-name “Linwood,” according to the report, and rather than announcing an exciting AI partnership, Apple regards Google's role in this deal as that of a “behind-the-scenes technology supplier,” Gurman writes. Instead it has come to symbolize Apple's sluggishness in the AI race—mostly perceived as a 15-year-old piece of software that tells you the weather, and says it doesn't understand you or can't help you aside from that. According to MacRumors, the upgrade will still involve Apple's proprietary models when queries can be answered with a lower-powered model that runs on the device itself, and there will be privacy measures in place for when Google's software gets involved. “User privacy will be preserved by running the Google models on Apple's server infrastructure without any external data sharing, and on-device personal data will likely be processed using Apple's own Foundation Models,” writes Benjamin Mayo of MacRumors. Gurman's report, as usual, comes from anonymous leaks, while Apple's formal statement in response to this report notes that the spring release of new Siri features is not something the company has formally announced. As Gizomodo's James Pero wrote in July of this year, Apple was reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Anthropic about the possibility of powering this Siri upgrade with a GPT or Claude model. Given that the AI announcements in July didn't match what had been previously advertised, it looked like things were “not going as planned.” Apple supposedly still intends to develop its own AI system to power some future version of Siri, even as AI staff defections mount—for example, Ke Yang, who was spearheading Apple's in-house chatbot effort, and who left for Meta last month. But in the meantime, it seems a $1 billion-per-year Google Gemini model will do. Finally, search results compromised by capitalism, now with AI! Gemini for Home is available in early access today, which means Google actually has to start delivering on its promise. "When people don't know what to trust, they end up trusting nothing at all..."</p>
