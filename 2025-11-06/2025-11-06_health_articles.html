                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of scientists at the University of Seville has identified an essential process that protects DNA integrity in reproductive cells, providing new clues about how organisms avoid genetic defects during egg formation. A recently published study, the result of Nuria Fernández-Fernández's doctoral work, describes how phosphorylation, a chemical modification of the BRC-1/BRD-1 protein complex in the Caenorhabditis elegans worm, acts as a "switch" against DNA damage. This activation allows the genome to repair itself properly during meiosis, the process that gives rise to reproductive cells.When this mechanism fails, the DNA suffers serious breaks, leading to accumulated damage, chromosome fragmentation and loss of embryo viability. The researchers also identified two enzymes, Bloom and Mus81, that contribute to these problems by incorrectly resolving the bonds between damaged DNA molecules. Dr. Tatiana García-Muse, principal investigator at the Andalusian Centre for Molecular Biology and Regenerative Medicine (Cabimer) The study highlights the importance of DNA repair systems in fertility and healthy development and could pave the way for new research into reproductive disorders in humans. Damage-induced phosphorylation of BRC-1/BRD-1 in meiosis preserves germline integrity.

The study was led by Cecilia Johnsson, Division of Occupational Therapy, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on November 02, 2025, in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. The intervention group may have been motivated to succeed for both personal benefit and to comply with the study. The sample was largely homogenous, with high education and income levels. Both groups received lifestyle analysis and goals; thus, the control group acted as an active control group. This study received funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare and the Research School in Health Science at Karolinska Institutet. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest. This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition driven by the immune system and often precedes the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Children with AD are also at higher risk for infections, including those affecting the skin and respiratory system." Tristan Nguyen, BS, medical student, lead author of the study Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study, analyzing 5,758 vaccinated and 5,758 unvaccinated pediatric AD patients, younger than 17 years of age. "Our study suggests that COVID-19 vaccination not only protects against coronavirus but may also have broader health benefits for children with atopic dermatitis," said Zhibo Yang, MD, PhD, the principal investigator (PI) of the study.

A long-term study found that a peanut patch treatment – epicutaneous immunotherapy – continued to help toddlers safely build tolerance to peanuts over three years. This new analysis looked at toddlers who originally received placebo in an earlier one-year study and then used the peanut patch for up to three years. Importantly, the treatment continued to show a strong safety record. No cases of treatment-related anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) were reported in the third year. Researchers also found that children's reactions during food challenges became milder, with fewer severe symptoms after three years than after one year. These results show that ongoing treatment with the peanut patch continues to improve tolerance and remains safe over time. Matthew Greenhawt, MD, MBA, allergist, lead author and ACAAI member The study results add to growing evidence that early intervention in young children could help change the course of peanut allergy. Researchers stress that parents should not attempt any form of peanut desensitization at home and should discuss emerging treatment options with a board-certified allergist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study finds that thunderstorms can trigger sharp increases in asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, underscoring the importance of storm preparedness for people with asthma. "Thunderstorm asthma" is a well-documented environmental phenomenon internationally, but studies in United States in areas with heavy pollen have been limited. Researchers analyzed 4,439 asthma-related ER visits across three Wichita, KS hospitals from January 2020 to December 2024. Using meteorologic records, they identified 38 thunderstorm days during this period. These results confirm that thunderstorms can pose a serious health risk for people with asthma, even in the United States. Because storms are unpredictable, patients and healthcare providers should include storm-specific precautions in asthma action plans." The researchers note that storm-related surges in asthma cases place a significant burden on emergency departments. Says allergist Selina Gierer, DO, ACAAI member and one of the study authors, "If you or your child has asthma, it's smart to think about thunderstorms the same way you prepare for high-pollen days or cold weather. "Understanding triggers and having a clear plan can help avoid emergency room visits."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A nationwide study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has found that adolescents who experience migraines are three times more likely to have high blood pressure. The research, which analyzed data from over two million Israeli teens, revealed that the link was strongest among those with severe or frequent migraines. The findings suggest that early blood pressure screening for teens with migraines could help detect cardiovascular risks before they develop into chronic disease. A massive Israeli study tracking over 2 million adolescents has uncovered a striking connection between migraine headaches and high blood pressure—conditions rarely studied together in young people. The research, conducted by scientists at The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center , reveals that teens diagnosed with migraines were three times more likely to have hypertension than their peers, suggesting that what may seem like "just headaches" could signal deeper vascular issues. The study analyzed medical records from Israel's national pre-military health screenings between 1990 and 2019, covering adolescents aged 16 to 20. Among more than 61,000 teens diagnosed with migraines, nearly 1 in 150 also had hypertension, compared to 1 in 500 among those without migraines. The link held strong even after accounting for factors like age, gender, body mass index, and socioeconomic background. What stood out most was the severity connection: adolescents with severe migraines were over four times more likely to have high blood pressure than those with mild or no headaches. Similarly, cases of severe hypertension were more common among those with frequent or disabling migraines. Migraine is often dismissed as a temporary neurological complaint. But our findings suggest it may also serve as a marker for early vascular dysfunction—meaning these young people could be at higher cardiovascular risk long before adulthood." The study, published in Hypertension, is the largest of its kind to examine this relationship in adolescents using verified medical diagnoses rather than self-reported symptoms. Previous research mostly focused on adults, leaving a gap in understanding how these conditions interact during youth—when prevention can make the biggest difference. Identifying elevated blood pressure early could help prevent long-term complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage later in life. For parents and teens, the takeaway is clear—don't ignore frequent or severe headaches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite higher awareness of caffeine's dangers, new research shows that university students, including future doctors, keep reaching for energy drinks to power through their studies. Study: Energy Drink Knowledge, Consumption, and Regulation Support Among Polish Medical and Non-Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study. Young adults commonly consume energy drinks (ED), despite the association with high-risk behaviors. A recent study published in Nutrients explores the effect of health education on knowledge about EDs, their consumption, and their attitudes towards them, as well as towards ED sales regulation for minors. EDs comprise an expanding segment of the global beverage market, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Not only are they widely available, but they are also heavily marketed, making them extremely attractive to this age group. In addition, EDs are most frequently consumed by males and physically active people. These effects are often overlooked by marketers, who focus instead on improvements in cognitive and physical performance. Unmarried people and non-medical students are also at a higher risk for ED consumption. Heavy academic workloads also play a role, with students preferring to use EDs to fight fatigue and maintain alertness. Most university students have mixed feelings about energy drinks and a limited understanding of their potential risks. Polish studies indicate high public awareness of these dangers, and public demand for ED sales to be prohibited for minors. It officially defines EDs and requires that they be clearly labeled. The current study aimed to evaluate the consumption of EDs and attitudes towards them among Mazovian students in Poland. They were asked to fill out an online survey on ED consumption, their knowledge of ED, and their attitudes towards regulation. The students were primarily female, with an average age of 22 years. Approximately 14% each had EDs two or three times a week, once a month, or less than once every three months, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in consumption frequency between medical and non-medical students. Only a third of students knew the recommended daily limit of caffeine consumption, with 35% stating they had no idea. Medical students were more likely to answer this correctly. Knowledge of what goes into EDs was greater among medical students. This group was aware that EDs contained simple sugars, B vitamins, L-carnitine, and electrolytes. Even so, they were no more likely than nonmedical students to identify the presence of caffeine, ginseng, artificial colorants, and taurine in EDs. Medical students were better informed about the ill effects of ED, including nausea, dizziness, and irritability. Both medical and non-medical students had the same frequency of ED consumption, despite the former group having superior knowledge. Males were more likely to consume EDs than females, reflecting a broader societal pattern. Almost all ED consumers self-reported disrupted sleep, and 95% said they experienced self-reported elevated blood pressure, while over 90% reported anxiety and irritability. Both groups had similar patterns of use for alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or psychoactive drugs, as well as taking dietary supplements. Adverse effects were also similarly reported in both groups. The most common age of first trying EDs was between 15 and 18 years, but 30% said they had their first ED before the age of 15 years. Conversely, 59% and 58% of non-medical students showed this pattern, respectively. The use of EDs for energy and concentration was more pronounced among medical students. This marks medical and associated professionals as high-risk groups for ED consumption and could underline the need for stronger regulation of the advertising of EDs and other caffeinated beverages. This step may reduce their exposure to these advertisements. Coupled with their heightened awareness of the negative aspects of these drinks, this could lead to a decrease in their consumption among young people. Both groups supported the legal prohibition protecting minors from EDs. Female students were more often in favor of not selling ED to minors, and supported restrictions on ED advertising, but most students did not believe a ban could be enforced in the real world. Medical students knew more about the composition and adverse effects of EDs, but did not reduce their use of EDs compared to non-medical students. Health education on the importance of avoiding unsafe caffeine consumption is crucial in preventing excessive caffeine use by medical students, who often seek to overcome fatigue associated with shift work. Medical students are likely to become responsible for counseling patients with lifestyle disorders and advising them to cease behaviors such as consuming caffeinated drinks. Combining targeted education with stronger enforcement could enhance the impact of regulatory policies and reduce risky consumption among young adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, children born to mothers with T1D are less likely to develop the disease than those whose fathers or siblings have T1D. A new study published in Nature Metabolism has identified distinct blood methylome changes in children exposed to maternal T1D. Some of these changes were related to reduced islet autoimmunity development, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may underlie the protection against islet autoimmunity. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the body's own insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas, leaving patients with a lifelong dependency on external insulin. Children whose parents or siblings have type 1 diabetes have an 8- to 15-fold increased risk of developing the autoimmune disease themselves. Therefore, researchers suspected that early-life epigenetic programming may be a key mechanism through which maternal type 1 diabetes confers a protective effect. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation determine which genes are ultimately read and expressed. By changing DNA methylation patterns, environmental influences in the womb such as smoking by the mother, medical conditions, stress, or diet can have far-reaching effects on a child's health by switching genes on or off in the early life period and later in life. We observed DNA methylation changes at multiple type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes in children born to mothers with type 1 diabetes." Her team investigated how maternal type 1 diabetes influences the child's epigenome. These changes appear to affect the expression of several genes involved in immune function. The researchers examined blood samples from 1,752 children at around two years of age from the BABYDIAB, BABYDIET, and POInT cohorts. All children included had an increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. They compared DNA methylation patterns of 790 children with and 962 children without a mother affected by type 1 diabetes to identify differences linked to maternal diabetes. "Our study identified numerous differentially methylated genetic locations, predominantly in the HOXA gene cluster and the MHC region in offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes. Using 34 differentially methylated positions at type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci that best reflected exposure to maternal type 1 diabetes, the researchers created a methylation propensity score. Testing this score in children without a mother with type 1 diabetes, they found that those who developed islet autoimmunity had significantly lower scores, indicating less protective epigenetic modification. These findings suggest that environmental factors may modulate the risk of islet autoimmunity through epigenetic changes to key susceptibility genes. In a following project led by Sandra Hummel, the researchers will take a closer look at the relative protection of children born to mothers with type 1 diabetes. Together with Prof. Ezio Bonifacio and colleagues from the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden at the TU Dresden University of Technology, the team aims to identify which type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes are epigenetically modulated by maternal type 1 diabetes and whether similar epigenetic effects occur in children born to mothers with gestational diabetes. In collaboration with further Helmholtz Munich researchers, the project will also explore potential protein and metabolomic biomarkers linked to DNA methylation patterns and how these molecular changes contribute to protection against islet autoimmunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rise in virtual research since the COVID-19 pandemic has created opportunities for researchers to expand and diversify clinical trials, but it has also opened up avenues for fraudulent participation in these studies. A new study led by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researchers directed by Michael Stein, chair and professor of the Department of Health Law, Policy & Management (HLPM) at BUSPH, provides a comprehensive checklist of indicators that researchers can utilize to quickly identify suspicious behavior and prevent fraudulent actors from enrolling in online studies and compromising valuable data. In addition to automated fraud detection methods, the study suggests that researchers should utilize a checklist of precautions to spot, along with videoconferencing and photo identification requests from participants during the screening process. These actions can reveal fraudulent actors-who are largely driven by financial gain from research compensation-before the actual enrollment process begins. Modest financial remuneration is a cornerstone of most studies, important for recognizing participants' time and effort, while also helping to boost engagement and retention. However, as compensated research opportunities expand in the online setting, so too do opportunities for fraudulent participation, from participants misrepresenting their eligibility or enrolling multiple times, to automated bots attempting to complete online surveys. As online research becomes more prevalent, it is essential for investigators to be vigilant and design their digital studies with fraud prevention in mind." Kara Magane, study corresponding author, senior director of research operations in HLPM at BUSPH Digital recruitment is especially valuable because it allows researchers to collect data among populations that are underrepresented or difficult to reach through traditional in-person methods. "Online research has lowered barriers to participating in research, particularly for people with stigmatized diagnoses, such as HIV," says study lead author Robert Siebers, an HLPM research coordinator at BUSPH at the time of the study. "Allowing participants to remain in their own home ensures higher levels of privacy and comfort that in-person research cannot. Some of the suspicious behavior that researchers should look for during the prescreening process include similar patterns in email addresses (such as those that use multiple numbers), zip codes that do not correspond to the participant's home state, or other details that seem unusually similar, such as the same level of physical activity among multiple participants. During the screening portion, the team says researchers should also investigate participants who enroll multiple times, provide predictable responses or swift answers to questions that typically require thought, or have similar accents or patterns of speech to participants previously identified as fraudulent. In their trials, the team modified the study protocol to allow phone screenings to take place on camera so that they could monitor participants' appearance and other suspicious behavior, such as muting their microphone frequently after each question. "Ensuring participant comfort and privacy is of utmost importance for all researchers, but particularly in research that involves stigmatized populations or diagnoses," Siebers says. "Requesting, but not requiring, a photo ID in our study was a key flexibility that allowed us to be respectful of participant privacy concerns while ensuring we had the opportunity to verify someone's true identity when needed." They also did not request electronic copies of IDs, he adds. Automated methods, such as IP address identification systems and bot detection tools, can also be effective at identifying fraudulent activity in the earliest stages of the selection process, but these methods often require financial or technological resources that may not be available to all researchers. "IRBs and funding agencies can play an important role by recognizing fraud prevention as an integral part of research workflows, particularly for online studies," Magane says. "They can encourage researchers to include fraud detection and prevention plans in their study protocols, and allocate appropriate resources for these efforts within study budgets. Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and all precautions should be tailored to each study design, the researchers say. "As a community of researchers, I'm not sure we have a grip on how much virtual research involves fraudulent participants and therefore how much published data might be tainted," says Stein, senior author author of the study. Fraud protection may need to be described in all published fully virtual studies going forward." Siebers, R., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Medical and scientific evidence is proving invaluable in holding public authorities accountable for the impact of unlawful air pollution on people's health, say experts in The BMJ's climate issue today. Gaia Lisi and Rupert Stuart-Smith at the University of Oxford say that relatively few studies attributing health impacts to climate change have been published so far, but as this research field matures, methods are becoming more widely recognised, opening up new routes for climate accountability. For example, in the UK, the inquest into the death of 9-year-old Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah concluded that exposure to high levels of air pollution contributed materially to her death, while in a case against Italy, the European Court of Human Rights used peer reviewed research to establish a "real and imminent risk" to life. And they say scientific evidence demonstrating the human health consequences of climate change is likely to assume greater importance in lawsuits in national, regional, and international forums following recent advisory opinions on climate change by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and International Court of Justice saying that states have specific duties to protect the health of individuals from life threatening effects of climate change. In lawsuits concerning environmental pollution, they also point out that medical experts have had a key role in helping courts understand the protections needed to uphold health related laws, be it through conducting research underpinning legal arguments and judicial decisions, acting as expert witnesses, or providing third party evidence. "Improved understanding of the health consequences of climate change could have a similar effect, clarifying the extent to which states are meeting their legal obligations to protect health, and opening up routes for climate justice where they fall short," they conclude. In a linked article, Laura Clarke at ClientEarth and Hugh Montgomery at University College London, say these landmark court decisions mean that big emitters, both states and companies, can no longer feign ignorance about the impacts of their activities. "As attribution science strengthens further, we expect to see more class actions and damages claims brought by climate affected communities which, when they scale, will change the calculations and business models of big emitters," they add. However, attribution to socioeconomic impacts will require the development of new models, they note. Medical professionals can also drive action by helping to support legal interventions where those responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions are wilfully indifferent or unresponsive, they add. Medical professionals, everywhere, should play their part in this process," they conclude. Lisi, G., & Stuart-Smith, R.
