                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Looming flight cuts: The Trump administration said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports — including major hubs like New York City, Chicago and Atlanta — starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the impasse, potentially impacting thousands of flights. According to an airline official, the administration is also weighing a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow, increasing by 1% each day the shutdown drags on. • Negotiations ongoing: Key sticking points remain as centrist Democrats try to hammer out a deal with Republicans to end the longest shutdown in history. Some Democratic senators — emboldened by their party's wins in Tuesday's elections — are ramping up pressure to not yield to the GOP without a real victory on health care. • Food aid: The US Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, revised its SNAP reduction plan to provide more partial benefits in November — though some beneficiaries could still see much less aid than usual. United Airlines will preemptively cancel about 200 flights starting tomorrow, the airline tells CNN. United says it will cancel about 4% again on Saturday and Sunday. A federal judge in Rhode Island will consider this afternoon whether he should order the Trump administration to provide 42 million Americans with their full food stamp benefits for November amid the government shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration will reduce flights at dozens of major airports as early as Friday if no shutdown deal is reached, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced at a news conference. CNN's Pete Muntean reports on how airlines are responding. More airports are seeing delays today due to air traffic control staffing issues across the country, including at major hubs like Washington, DC and New York. Regardless, there's probably going to be headaches and delays around Thanksgiving because of just the ripple effect,” Daniels said. There's going to be delays after the shutdown,” he added. And we're also 400 controllers short — shorter than we were in the 2019 shutdown,” Nick Daniels told CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown. The Department of Transportation said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports — including major hubs — starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the shutdown. Daniels said the move is necessary to help mitigate safety risks. He also said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford will need to monitor the situation closely, “but they are taking those proactive steps of putting a smaller level of capacity to the airspace or a smaller number of flights” so that controllers can “provide the best service they can.” Asked if some controllers are calling out sick in protest, Daniels said the situation is more complicated. They're calling in with real-life situations,” Daniels said. He added that some employees are calling in saying they can't afford gas for their cars to get to work or childcare because they haven't been paid for 37 days. Daniels went on to explain that while controllers will eventually recieve back pay once the government reopens, “it probably will drag on for over two-and-a-half months for them to actually be made whole from what's going on now. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a key senator involved in the talks to reach a deal to open the government as soon as this week, touted “productive” bipartisan conversations as lawmakers work through sticking points. I think we need to get government back up,” she said, stressing the importance of restoring SNAP benefits and paychecks to federal employees. Pressed by on concerns by some in her party that the guarantee of a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies without more substantial assurances it will become law is not sufficient, Shaheen responded, “Everybody will have an opportunity to have their input and to vote on what we do.” “We ought to be able to keep the government open and make sure that people are not forced off their health insurance because they can't pay,” she said, noting that she's been talking to Republicans who are also interested in extending the ACA credits. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal made clear he wants an extension of ACA credits to be included in the plan to reopen the government, saying the “vague promise” of a separate vote would be a “mistake.” “I think voters would rightly see it as a surrender,” he said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he will be watching for progress out of this afternoon's Democratic policy lunch to see if there will be enough centrist members of that party who will decide to vote to end the government shutdown. They're under an enormous amount of pressure from the left,” he told reporters. He was asked if he will keep the Senate in session this weekend and into next week's schedule Veterans Day recess if a deal is not reached. “That depends a little bit on what happens if there's a path forward to vote, whether that's today, tomorrow, Saturday. I think all options will be on the table,” he said. Asked about Democratic concerns that while he has offered to let Democrats have a vote by a date certain on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which is at the center of the debate over the standoff, Speaker Mike Johnson is balking at one in the House. “I can't speak for the House,” he said. Thune said he did not think it was needed to bring President Donald Trump into the shutdown talks at present. Top Democrats are praising California Rep. Nancy Pelosi following her announcement this morning that she would not seek reelection after this term. In a statement, Former President Joe Biden reiterated his belief that Pelosi was the best person to serve as speaker of the US House of Representatives. “When I was President, we worked together to grow our economy, create millions of jobs, and make historic investments in our nation's future. She has devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also praised Pelosi as a historic figure in the party and the US House, writing, “Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi is an iconic, heroic, trailblazing, legendary and transformational leader. He added later: “During her 20 years leading House Democrats, she fiercely navigated many trials and tribulations, including a once-in-a-century pandemic, a horrific attack on the United States Capitol and a violent attempt on her husband's life. Through it all, she led with strength and dignity. Like Esther, she was Speaker and Leader for such a time as this. Personally, Speaker Pelosi has been an incredible mentor, trusted friend and awesome colleague who has profoundly blessed me with her insights, perspectives and leadership values.” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene slammed House leadership for not holding a session during the shutdown — which is now the longest in US history. And the House has not been in session since then. And I just — I truly believe that's an utter failure,” the congresswoman from Georgia told CNN's Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer while discussing Tuesday's election results. Greene said she spoke to Trump about using the so-called nuclear option “some time ago.” President, this is the only way you're going to get your agenda across.' “I think it was early October, I actually started calling saying that, you know, Democrats should vote to fund the government, but Republicans are equally responsible. Asked by CNN whether President Donald Trump's remarks saying Republicans are being blamed for the shutdown were helpful for negotiations, House Speaker Mike Johnson revealed that he spoke with Trump directly to give his own view of the political implications. “I don't read too much into that,” he added. Johnson again sought to downplay the results from Tuesday's elections. Speaker Mike Johnson said he would not guarantee a vote in the House on extending expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies — even if Senate GOP leaders ultimately make that commitment to end the shutdown. “No, because we did our job and I'm not part of the negotiations,” Johnson said. Pressed further on his position, he added: “I'm not promising anybody anything.” Johnson's remarks underscore some of Democrats' biggest fears in their negotiations: Even if Senate Majority Leader John Thune allows a vote on health care, there would likely be no such vote in the House and would therefore infuriate the rest of their party. On the state of shutdown talks, Johnson said he is personally “less optimistic” about them. At least three major US airlines are waiving fees for travelers who want to cancel or change their upcoming flights due to tomorrow's looming cuts to 10% of air traffic at 40 major airports. In a notice to passengers, Delta Air Lines is allowing passengers “to change, cancel or refund their flights, including… basic economy fares, without penalty.” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby announced in a letter to employees last night that “any customer traveling during this period is eligible for a refund if they do not wish to fly – even if their flight isn't impacted. And American Airlines said in a statement: “Disrupting customers' plans is the last thing we want do to. To provide additional flexibility during the impacted travel period, customers whose flights are cancelled for any reason or who choose not to travel will be able to change their flight or request a refund, without any penalty.” This post has been updated with additional information. A group of increasingly frustrated Senate Democratic freshmen are currently meeting to discuss potential off-ramps to the 37-day shutdown as anxiety ramps up inside Washington over the funding lapse's escalating effects, according to three people familiar with the discussions. That idea would be a huge lift for the Senate GOP, which has been strongly opposed to changing that 60-vote threshold. But it's an attempt to force any movements within the GOP after President Donald Trump himself called on Republicans to abolish the filibuster in a White House meeting on Wednesday. The group is also discussing pushing their freshman class to stay in Washington this weekend and into next week as the shutdown drags on — an idea from Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, one of the sources said. We've gotten some more information on the latest air travel disruptions. Delays are being reported in Washington, DC, and New York this morning as the Federal Aviation Administration warns of air traffic control staffing shortages and prepares to reduce flights at 40 major airports. Negotiations between key senators will continue this morning as they push to announce a deal before the end of the week — or even today — to reopen the government, according to multiple sources in both parties. There are still some key sticking points, the sources said, so it's not yet clear when an accord will come together nor when the Senate will vote. But even after a deal is reached, it will take several days for it to be processed in both the Senate and the House, which has been out of session since September 19. So the government shutdown is expected to continue for at least another couple days. It's still unclear how senators would deal with a key sticking point: expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. Negotiators are discussing a stand-alone ACA vote, far short of the demand of many Democrats who want an extension in the underlying package that President Donald Trump would sign into law. Airlines are bracing their passengers for disruptions as a 10% reduction in air traffic — impacting some major airport hubs — will go into effect starting tomorrow if the shutdown is not resolved. “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said there will be significant disruptions in the airspace when the Federal Aviation Administration slashes 10% of air traffic at 40 busy airports Friday if there's no shutdown agreement. “This is not a political decision, this was data-driven to make the right call to get ahead of any issues that could happen in airspace that could have negative consequences,” Duffy said in an interview on Fox. The DOT announced today that 10% of air traffic at 40 busy airports would be cut, potentially impacting thousands of flights, though the details of how many and which specific airports will be cut was not announced. Even with the cuts, flights could still be delayed if there are not enough workers to control them safely. “As we come into Thanksgiving, if we're still in the shutdown posture, it's going to be rough out there, really rough,” Duffy said on Fox. Controllers will receive their second $0 paycheck next week, and Duffy has said some have taken second jobs to make ends meet or calling out sick in protest. Remember: Since the start of the shutdown, controllers and other essential workers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, have been required to do their jobs but won't be paid until after the government reopens. The administration also said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the impasse, potentially impacting thousands of flights. Obviously, he has a robust agenda, and it is on us to get that through,” the senator from Alabama said on CNBC's “Squawk Box” this morning. Trump has been vocal in recent days for Republicans to end the shutdown by using the “nuclear option,” in other words, eliminating the filibuster — a 60-vote threshold for passing legislation — and voting with a simple majority. He made that pitch again yesterday at a breakfast with Senate Republicans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An United Airlines flight arrives at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. airports in more than two dozen states are among those facing 10% reductions in air traffic Friday due to the government shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration is imposing the reductions to take pressure off air traffic controllers, who are federal employees and have gone without pay during the shutdown. Here's a closer look at what to know about the reductions. The list includes 40 airports with Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Miami, Newark and San Francisco among them. A full list of airports facing reductions is here. That's led to controllers calling in sick and contributed to staffing shortages that have been affecting air travel for weeks. Most controllers work mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said. That leaves little time for a side job unless controllers call in sick to the FAA. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Airlines have said people could see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. It's unclear when the reduced flights could end. A traveler moves through a baggage claim in Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia, Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. The cuts could include up to 1,800 flights and about 268,000 seats combined, according to one estimate. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both said they would offer refunds to travelers who opt not to fly, even if they have tickets that aren't normally refundable. The cuts also could disrupt package deliveries because two airports with major distribution centers are on the list. FedEx operates at the Memphis, Tennessee, aiport and UPS in Louisville, Kentucky, where there was a deadly cargo plane crash this week. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for controllers to miss their second full paycheck next week. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said this week that he's never seen these kinds of measures taken before in his nearly four-decade experience in the aviation field. Staffing problems led to delays throughout October, but they were mostly isolated and temporary. From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. During weekends from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional control centers and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis.</p>

Diana” an educator who was detained by federal law enforcement officers at Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center this morning, Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025, in Chicago. CHICAGO (AP) — A federal judge said Thursday she will order federal agents in Chicago to restrict using force against peaceful protesters and news media outlets, saying current practices violate their constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ‘s ruling, which is expected to be appealed by President Donald Trump's administration, refines an earlier temporary order that required agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain riot-control techniques, such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. Ellis, who began Thursday's hearing by describing Chicago as a “vibrant place” and reading from poet Carl Sandburg's famous poem about the city, said it is “simply untrue” that the Chicago area is a violent place of rioters. “I don't find defendants' version of events credible,” Ellis said. Ellis said agents will be required to give two warnings before using riot control weapons and that agents are restricted from using force unless it is “objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat.” She described protesters and advocates facing tear gas, having guns pointed at them and being thrown to the ground, saying “that would cause a reasonable person to think twice about exercising their fundamental rights.” The preliminary injunction stems from a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force during demonstrations. In court, an attorney representing the federal government said senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino, has a body-worn camera after Ellis required him to get one and complete the training for using it at a previous hearing. A message left Thursday for the Department of Homeland Security wasn't immediately returned. During Wednesday's eight-hour hearing, witnesses gave emotional testimony when describing experiencing tear gas, being shot in the head with pepper balls while praying, and having guns pointed at them when recording agents in residential streets. One after another, witnesses described their anxiety about returning to protests or advocacy work. “I get really nervous because it just feels like I'm not safe,” Leslie Cortez, a youth organizer in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, told Ellis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that it will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 “high-volume” markets beginning Friday morning to maintain safety during the ongoing government shutdown. Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday it would reduce air traffic by 10% across “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers go unpaid and exhibit signs of strain during the shutdown. In some of the biggest cities — such as New York, Houston and Chicago — multiple airports will be affected. Controllers already have missed one full paycheck and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as the shutdown drags on. The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers. Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. What to do if you're facing flight disruptions during the government shutdownStaffing shortages have caused flight delays at a growing number of airports as disruptions pile up nationwide. Here is what to know about your rights as a passenger. If you are already at the airport, it is time to find another flight. Airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. You can ask to be booked on another airline, but airlines aren't required to put you on another carrier's flight. If your flight is canceled and you no longer want to take the trip, or have found another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly, even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable. The head of Frontier Airlines recommended that travelers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded. The cuts could affect as many as 1,800 flights, or upward of 268,000 passengers, per day, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium. An United Airlines flight arrives at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Airlines are used to dealing with cutting thousands of flights on short notice during severe weather, but the difference now is that these cuts during the shutdown will last indefinitely until safety data improves. “I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday. Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said that few cities will be spared because some airlines have indicated they will focus on reducing routes to and from small and medium-sized cities. “This is going to have a noticeable impact across the U.S. air transportation system,” said Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Most work mandatory overtime six days a week, leaving little time for side jobs to help cover bills and other expenses unless they call out. Mounting staffing pressures are forcing the agency to act, Bedford said. Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that they would meet with airline executives to figure out how to safely implement the reductions. The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system and “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience,” said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement. Duffy warned earlier this week that there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paycheck next week. He said some controllers can get by missing one paycheck, but not two or more. Staffing can run short both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don't always lead to flight disruptions. Throughout October, flight delays caused by staffing problems had been largely isolated and temporary. From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Powerful Democratic former speaker Nancy Pelosi won't seek reelection to the U.S. House. Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday. Pelosi, appearing upbeat and forward-looking as images of her decades of accomplishments filled the frames, said she would finish out her final year in office. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., arrives to speak about the House coronavirus bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, March, 13, 2020. “My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,” she said. Pelosi said, “And now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.” The decision, while not fully unexpected, ricocheted across Washington, and California, as a seasoned generation of political leaders is stepping aside ahead of next year's midterm elections. Some are leaving reluctantly, others with resolve, but many are facing challenges from newcomers eager to lead the Democratic Party and confront President Donald Trump. Pelosi, 85, remains a political powerhouse and played a pivotal role with California's redistricting effort, Prop 50, and the party's comeback in this month's election. She maintains a robust schedule of public events and party fundraising, and her announced departure touches off a succession battle back home and leaves open questions about who will fill her behind-the-scenes leadership role at the Capitol. Former President Barack Obama said Pelosi will go down in history as “one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.” An architect of the Affordable Care Act during Obama's tenure, and a leader on the international stage, Pelosi came to politics later in life, a mother of five mostly grown children. She has long fended off calls for her to step aside by turning questions about her intentions into spirited rebuttals, asking if the same was being posed of her male colleagues on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif. reacts as she listens to a question from a reporter during her weekly press briefing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Sept. 30, 2021, in Washington. In her video address, she noted that her first campaign slogan was “a voice that will be heard.” But after Pelosi quietly helped orchestrate Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, she has decided to pass the torch, too. Last year, she experienced a fall resulting in a hip fracture during a whirlwind congressional visit to allies in Europe, but even still it showcased her grit: It was revealed she was rushed to a military hospital for surgery — after the group photo, in which she's seen smiling, poised on her trademark stiletto heels. Pelosi's decision also comes as her husband of more than six decades, Paul Pelosi, was gravely injured three years ago when an intruder demanding to know “Where is Nancy?” broke into the couple's home and beat him over the head with a hammer. Ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Pelosi faced a potential primary challenge in California. Newcomer Saikat Chakrabarti, who helped devise progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's political rise in New York, has mounted a campaign, as has state Sen. Scott Wiener. While Pelosi remains an unmatched force for the Democratic Party, having fundraised more than $1 billion over her career, her next steps are uncertain. But a conservative Republican “tea party” revolt bounced Democrats from power, ushering in a new style of Republicans, who would pave the way for Trump to seize the White House in 2016. Determined to win back control, Pelosi helped recruit and propel dozens of women to office in the 2018 midterm elections as Democrats running as the resistance to Trump's first term. President Donald Trump turns to House speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., as he delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, as Vice President Mike Pence watches, Feb. 5, 2019. Trump was impeached by the House — twice — first in 2019 for withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine as it faced a hostile Russia at its border and then in 2021 days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. After Democrats lost control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi announced she would not seek another term as party leader. Rather than retire, she charted a new course for leaders, taking on the emerita title that would become used by others, including Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California during his brief tenure after he was ousted by his colleagues from the speaker's office in 2023.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sharply diverged from his Senate counterpart on Thursday as the upper chamber continues to negotiate a way out of the government shutdown. Johnson said he would not commit to holding a vote on extending COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year without congressional action. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., however, had been floating a vote on such an extension in exchange for Democrats voting to end the shutdown — which is now in its 37th day. You know what they told him in response? ‘No, we need you to guarantee the outcome of that vote.' Well, that's ridiculous," Johnson said when asked about holding such a vote by a guaranteed date in the House if the deal succeeds in breaking the logjam. Senate Majority Leader John Thune holds a copy of a continuing resolution bill as he speaks alongside Speaker of the House Mike Johnson during a news conference in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, Oct. 3, 2025. When pressed again on a vote, he said, "No, because we did our job, and I'm not part of the negotiation." I'm going to let this process play out," Johnson said. The issue of enhanced Obamacare subsidies has been a matter of debate within the GOP, with some Republicans in more moderate districts calling for at least a year-long extension to give lawmakers time to create a new healthcare deal in its place. But House conservatives are rejecting any such extension out of hand. Fox News Digital first reported that leaders of the 189-member Republican Study Committee issued an official position earlier Thursday demanding the credits not be extended. It's been a key ask for Democrats, however, that such an extension be paired with any federal funding bill before they agree to help end the shutdown. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks to the media next to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the day President Donald Trump met with top congressional leaders at the White House in Washington, Sept. 29, 2025. Senate Democrats are huddling on Thursday afternoon to discuss what they could and could not accept out of a deal to end the government shutdown. There are a dozen in the caucus who have been meeting to find a way out of the shutdown, but following Democrats' Tuesday night election sweep, many in their caucus feel emboldened that their shutdown strategy is working and don't want to let up yet. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he believed Tuesday's election was "having an impact" on the caucus. "It would be very strange for the American people to weigh in, in support of Democrats, standing up and fighting for them, and then within days, for us to surrender without having achieved any of the things that we've been fighting for," Sen. Chris Murphy said. The government is in a shutdown after Congress failed to reach an agreement on federal funding. But Thune has remained adamant that he can't promise anything more than a vote and can't predict an outcome. Previous digital bylines seen at Daily Mail and CBS News.

Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of ISIS murder victim Kayla Mueller, exclusively spoke with Fox News Digital on their endorsement of Kash Patel to lead the FBI. EXCLUSIVE: The parents of slain American aid worker Kayla Mueller, Carl and Marsha Mueller, have written an emotional open letter to President Donald Trump, asking him to use his upcoming meeting with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to bring their daughter's remains home 10 years after she was killed by ISIS. The letter, shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, comes just days before al-Sharaa's first visit to Washington since taking power following the collapse of the Assad regime. American Kayla Mueller, 26, was killed while in the hands of ISIS, her family said Tuesday. "Ten long years have passed since our daughter's body found its resting place, unmarked and unknown, somewhere in the crimson folds of Syria's hills," the Muellers wrote. "Kayla's body has not been returned home to us; her story remains incomplete. Kayla Mueller was a 26-year-old humanitarian aid worker from Arizona who was kidnapped by ISIS in 2013 while helping Syrian refugees near the Turkish border. She was enslaved by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who reportedly abused and murdered her in 2015. The family's letter recounts how, in 2019, Operation Kayla Mueller — ordered by President Trump — led to the death of al-Baghdadi in northern Syria. Arizona Republican Rep. Abe Hamadeh with Kayla Mueller's parents on Jan. 3, 2025. With Assad's ouster and Syria now under an interim government, the Muellers say the political landscape has shifted dramatically. They praised growing regional cooperation to locate missing Americans and cited Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., who has personally visited Damascus to advocate for her return. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Hamadeh said, "I was sworn into Congress with my hand resting on Kayla Mueller's Bible, with my family and Kayla's parents standing by my side. In their letter to President Trump, Kayla's parents wrote about how Kayla was killed attempting to ‘bring light to the darkest corner of the earth — and in her own darkest hour her spirit refused to break.' That is why I refuse to give up on bringing this remarkable young woman home to her family." "Through your leadership, we believe the torch Kayla was forced to drop has roared back to life." They ended the letter with a plea: "Your meeting is sure to inspire real hope across Syria's war-torn streets. Bringing Kayla's body home will do the same for every American heart, and together we will slam shut the era of terror's reign in Syria and finally bring closure to Kayla's story. This is a moment to reaffirm America's resolve: that we never abandon our own. One more push could bring Kayla home." Efrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

Smith asked where the money to fund New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's initiatives will come from, arguing his biggest fans aren't "people who pay bills every day." FIRST ON FOX: A House GOP lawmaker is proposing to block federal funds from New York City for as long as Zohran Mamdani is mayor. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., is called the Moving American Money Distant from Anti-National Interests Act, or the "MAMDANI Act" for short. The two-page bill text stated that "notwithstanding any other provision of law, during any period in which Zohran Mamdani is mayor of New York, New York" that "any unobligated Federal funds available" for the city "are hereby rescinded" and that "no Federal funds may be obligated or expended for any purpose to New York, New York." It is expected to be introduced on Friday, Fox News Digital was told. Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. His victory was not a surprise to election watchers; New York City has not elected a Republican mayor since Michael Bloomberg won a second term in 2005. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., attends the House Energy and Commerce markup of the FY 2025 budget resolution on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 13, 2025. A House Republican campaign operative signaled to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the GOP would seek to tie vulnerable Democrats across the country to Mamdani and his far-left platforms. Carter, who is running for U.S. Senate in Georgia, said taxpayer dollars from his state "should not be wasted on programs that will bankrupt the financial capital of the world." "If New Yorkers want communism, we should let them have their wish and not artificially prop them up with our successful capitalist system," Carter said. "Any New Yorker with common sense is welcome to move to the great, FREE state of Georgia." Historically, New York State has sent more taxpayer dollars to the federal government than it takes in federal dollars.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, presented a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on Wednesday to partner nations aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan, including authorization for an international security force, according to a senior U.S. official. Waltz recently met with representatives from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, who are expected to coordinate humanitarian and reconstruction efforts around the proposal. The draft resolution seeks to authorize a two-year international stabilization force in Gaza under U.N. oversight — part of what officials describe as "phase two" of the broader postwar plan. The plan includes forming a transitional "Board of Peace" to coordinate with Egypt, Israel and a vetted Palestinian police force. Israeli officials have already said they will not allow Turkish troops on their borders. Military vehicles are gathered near the Israel-Gaza border, amid a ceasefire, in southern Israel on Oct. 12, 2025. In an interview with Fox News Digital, John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, said the concept can work — but only if it follows successful precedents. "For Gaza, I personally would like people to think Kosovo, not Lebanon," he said. "History shows exactly what determines success: a clear mandate, enough troops and the authority to act." Polish soldiers, part of the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, guard a municipal building in the town of Zvecan, northern Kosovo, May 29, 2023. "If somebody believes this will just disappear from the news in six months, that's not reality," he said, noting that KFOR remains in place decades later, albeit with fewer troops. A woman mourns among graves in Memorial Center Potocari, near Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on July 11, 2015. About 60,000 troops were deployed to enforce the peace, separate armies and support reconstruction. "These were significant forces with clear mandates for disarming," Spencer said. "That's what success looks like — a mission with both muscle and legitimacy." He added that Gaza's mission must mirror Bosnia's strong command structure and clear legal authority, not rely on unarmed observers. East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao is embraced as he returns to the Armed Forces of National Liberation army camp after his release from an Indonesian prison in the hills outside of Dili, East Timor on Oct. 24, 1999. It restored order and laid the groundwork for local governance. "East Timor shows how quickly you can start rebuilding governance when the force has legitimacy and local trust," Spencer said. "That legitimacy must exist from day one in Gaza." By contrast, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), established in 1978 and expanded after the 2006 war, is what Spencer calls a failure. "Southern Lebanon was not a success story," he said. "They were glorified observers without a mandate to demilitarize anything." Israel has long criticized UNIFIL for allowing Hezbollah to entrench under its watch. Spencer said the same mistake cannot be repeated in Gaza. "It has to be seen as liberating areas from militant rule, not occupying them," he said. Spencer described an "inkblot strategy" — stabilizing cleared districts while combat continues elsewhere. "You can create safe areas where a stabilization force, under the right mandate and equipped correctly, is stabilizing areas while you are also conducting operations against Hamas," he said. He predicts that the Israel Defense Forces will continue high-intensity operations while the international force focuses on humanitarian aid, demining and restoring order in secured zones. During a recent visit to Gaza, Spencer said he saw "a glimmer of hope" in newly established humanitarian zones inside cleared areas. About 200 U.S. personnel are already on the ground in a civil-military coordination center managing logistics and planning for the proposed transition in Israel. Spencer said this small presence will be vital to coordinating aid, reconstruction and stabilization without engaging in combat. He warned that the mission will face disinformation and attacks from groups opposed to peace. "There are people who do not want this to succeed," he said. "Thinking through how they'll try to undermine it — especially online — is vital." He added that stabilization must move alongside local capacity-building. "You have to start training a vetted Palestinian police force and governance team," he said. Efrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? So far, the biggest successes against President Donald Trump's second-term assault on democracy have come not from Congress and the Supreme Court, but more unusual sources: lower-court judges, “No Kings” protests, a Disney+ subscriber boycott, and Trump's own indiscipline and incompetence. And in some ways, this avenue of resistance may prove to be the most consequential one (at least until the 2026 midterms). Tuesday's election results have, specifically, created a major barrier to one of Trump's most dangerous authoritarian ambitions — an attempted one-sided national gerrymander. But this major development should also be an opportunity for most people, who focus on national politics, to evaluate the power of state governments. The United States is unusual among backsliding democracies in the strength of its federal system, and that creates some major opportunities for institutional pushback that may not have been possible elsewhere. This is somewhat ironic: For most of American history, states (most notably in the South) have been places where pockets of authoritarianism could exist in a nationally democratic society. Yet today, as the national government moves in an authoritarian direction, the comparatively major powers invested in states — like control over election administration — are now creating opportunities for small-d democratic to resist a national authoritarian power grab. Convinced that such a defeat would spell disaster for his presidency, he has pushed state-level Republicans to engage in a highly unusual round of mid-cycle redistricting: basically, a nationwide attempt to rig the maps in the GOP's favor. Because election administration is almost entirely devolved to the states in the American system, Trump has very limited powers to actually try and rig elections from DC. Instead, gerrymandering at the state level — threatening and cajoling governors and state legislatures into drawing as many safe seats for Republicans as possible — is his best shot at actually stacking the deck in the GOP's favor in 2026. This was a key reason he could maintain power despite rising unpopularity: In the 2014 election, Fidesz maintained over two-thirds of seats in parliament, a majority large enough to amend the constitution at will, despite winning only 44 percent of the national vote. The most obvious reason is that Democrats gained new powers to counter-gerrymander. California voters endorsed a ballot referendum in support of Gov. And Virginia voters handed Democrats a super-majority in the statehouse, giving them the numbers they needed to pass their own new map. The Democratic gains in the two states put together could, per one calculation, cancel out or even exceed GOP gains from currently proposed gerrymanders in states like Texas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri. This is hardly an ideal solution to the problem of gerrymandering. As my friend Kelsey Piper writes in The Argument, gerrymandering in any sense is bad for democracy: It decreases voters' ability to make meaningful political choices. But in criticizing counter-gerrymandering, Piper misses two other important factors: national representativeness and power. If only one party gerrymanders, then the effect is to give that party an unfair advantage relative to their true level of national support. That makes the outcome meaningfully more democratic than a one-sided gerrymander, even if on a district-by-district level it is far less fair and representative than it should be. More fundamentally, though, counter-gerrymandering is necessary to put a break on Trump's authoritarian ambitions. Democracy instead dies from an accumulation of incremental advantages, each working in tandem to make it nearly impossible for the opposition to win fairly. Of those, gerrymandering is among the most singularly important weapons. Preventing the party from attaining that advantage, then, is a direct blow to their attempt to stay in power indefinitely and undemocratically. If Democrats had not won approval for counter-gerrymandering in California and Virginia, Trump would be meaningfully closer to creating a system like Hungary's. There is, internationally, a fairly well-worn playbook for an elected leader who wishes to seize autocratic control. They consolidate formal power in their own hands, neuter independent checks on their authority, undermine the fairness of election administration, and impose political constraints on civil society and big business. In Trump's second term, he has attempted to check every box — helped along by a completely pliant GOP majority in Congress and a Supreme Court that has only rarely ruled against him on executive power. On paper, this seems like a recipe for democratic failure. In recent cases of resistance, such as Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro failed to consolidate power and lost his 2022 reelection bid, and South Korea, where activists and legislators stopped President Yoon Suk Yeol's overnight coup attempt in 2024, presidents lacked meaningful control over the other two branches of government. That has, as my colleague Ian Millhiser points out, presented significant legal barriers to Trump's authoritarian consolidation. It is much harder to rig elections or successfully prosecute your political opponents when a real measure of power in those areas is delegated to localities that you do not control. That being said, federalism is not a panacea against authoritarian takeovers. A recent study by three political scientists found four cases of countries with federal systems where the national leadership attempted an authoritarian power seizure: the US during Trump's first term, Brazil, India, and Venezuela. It's not that strong federalism guarantees democracy: Any look at American history shows that, in fact, federalism can allow authoritarianism to rise and thrive at the local level. Rather, it's that the US federal system creates opportunities for contestation when the national government is moving in an authoritarian direction — one that people in non-federal collapsed democracies, like Hungary and Turkey, simply didn't have. It's possible to think of states as a kind of “fourth branch” of the federal government, one imposing constraints on the executive's efforts at power consolidation even when the federal firewalls are failing. We can see this at work, very obviously, in the 2025 Virginia election results. But there will be many fights to come in statehouses and governors' mansions, ranging from red-state decisions on complying with Trump's demands to gerrymander to blue-state decisions over checking abusive federal law enforcement, that can serve as a crucial backstop in the year-plus before the midterm elections provide an opportunity to stiffen federal resistance. The Trump administration just killed an IRS tool for free, direct tax filing. What New Jersey can teach the parties about Latino voters. The Supreme Court might take away Trump's international weapon of first resort.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of Americans expecting to fly this month could have their plans grounded if the government shutdown drags on. The Federal Aviation Administration's “Core 30” airports are among those on a preliminary list of sites expected to be impacted, an FAA source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN. Here's what to know if the travel nightmare turns into reality Friday: The “Core 30” high-traffic airports include New York City's three major hubs and large airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington, DC, the source said. Another 10 airports across the country are expected to be impacted. “As we start to implement this drawdown in service, it will be restricted to these 40 high-volume traffic markets,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. Trump administration will reduce traffic at 40 airports across the US starting Friday if shutdown continues Flight volume will be reduced by 10%, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Thursday. But he did not say whether that's 10% of the flight volume at the 40 impacted airports, or 10% of all US flights – which would be significantly more. “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram. For example, book Economy on Frontier so you can reuse the ticket value as changes are free or you can get a credit,” Biffle wrote. “If your flight is cancelled your chances of being stranded are high so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline.” It's also helpful to book directly with an airline instead of through a third-party website. And try to avoid booking flights with layovers, the US Public Interest Research Group says. The government shutdown, which started on October 1, has prevented many federal employees from getting paid. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are considered essential employees during the shutdown and are expected to go to work. More than 400 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis. But federal officials say reducing the number of flights will improve safety. “THIS is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system, and it's the right thing to do,” National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy posted on X. “NTSB has repeatedly stated low air traffic control staffing levels, mandatory overtime, and six-day work weeks have a direct impact on #safety.” CNN's Pete Muntean, Alexandra Skores, Forrest Brown and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For nine months, congressional Republicans have largely stood idly by as President Donald Trump has gone to great lengths to try to expand the power of the presidency, demolish norms and disregard laws. Perhaps most striking was a scene Wednesday at the Supreme Court, during oral arguments in a challenge to Trump's worldwide tariffs. The day prior, a CNBC host had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent whether he worried about a Democratic president abusing the power Trump was claiming. Host Joe Kernen posited that this future president could levy large tariffs on energy based solely on a declaration that there was a climate change emergency. Bessent demurred, saying, “I would question whether there's a climate emergency.” While Bessent was able to squirm out of this hypothetical on Tuesday, the Trump administration wasn't so fortunate at the Supreme Court on Wednesday. In fact, three justices – including Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch – pressed the Trump administration's solicitor general, D. John Sauer, on this exact hypothetical. Sauer, like Bessent, cast doubt on whether that declaration would be accurate. But he otherwise acknowledged: “It's very likely that could be done. When Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether anyone would be able to challenge that declaration, Sauer suggested the bar would be sky-high. Trump is attempting to set a precedent that his own administration says could be wielded by a liberal president in huge ways that Republicans would very much not like. (Of course, Congress could simply assert its power over tariffs and prevent all that. But that would require actually standing up to Trump.) He wants Republican senators to make it so that legislation only requires a bare majority (which Republicans currently have) rather than the currently required 60 votes. But the current debate has apparently given him a good opportunity to break down one of his most significant remaining obstacles. But it's also led to some rather unusual and pretty firm pushback among Republicans. Their argument: This would be a disaster when Democrats have power. House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly predicted Democrats would add Democratic senators by making Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states. And he's said they would restrict gun rights, among other liberal grab-bag policies. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered similar warnings after Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel over a joke about Trump and Charlie Kirk. “Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again – wins the White House … they will silence us,” Cruz said. “I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina,” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told The Hill last month. Kevin Stitt in comments to the New York Times warned his fellow Republicans about the precedent set by a president working with governors of other states to impose National Guard troops on a state where officials didn't want that. “We believe in the federalist system — that's states' rights,” Stitt said, adding: “Oklahomans would lose their mind if (Gov. JB) Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.” Washington state Republican Party Chairman Jim Walsh has also reportedly raised concerns about future presidents overusing the National Guard. Vance urged the student not to worry about such things. “It's an important part of my entire political philosophy – is we cannot be afraid to do something, because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said. Of course, there is no actual evidence Democrats have prepared to do such things with the National Guard. Indeed, former President Barack Obama recently wondered aloud what the right would say if he imposed the National Guard on a red state like Texas. “It is mind-boggling to me how Fox News would have responded,” Obama said. And this is also an area in which the administration has basically claimed unchecked presidential power when pressed by judges. During an appeals-court hearing back in June, a Trump-appointed judge asked top DOJ official Brett Shumate if it was the Trump administration's position that a president's decision to call up militias from all 50 states and the District of Columbia was un-reviewable by the courts. In other words, Obama, under this line of thinking, would indeed have been able to send the Guard into Texas, no questions asked. Of course, Trump has an answer for that, too. “Now, if we do what I'm saying (on the filibuster), they'll most likely never attain power,” Trump told GOP senators on Wednesday. “Because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.” It seems unlikely GOP senators will actually buy into that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LEESBURG, VIRGINIA — When Winsome Earle-Sears's campaign bus caught fire on a Virginia highway days before the election, it offered a fitting metaphor for a gubernatorial bid that never found its footing and ultimately went up in flames. Earle-Sears, the Republican lieutenant governor who once made history as the first Black woman elected in Virginia, lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger by nearly fifteen points on Tuesday. Earle-Sears's blowout even stunned veteran operatives accustomed to Virginia's blue tilt. Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) conservative blueprint ended in disarray, undone by weak fundraising, muddled messaging, and a candidate critics say never fully engaged the grind of a modern statewide campaign. But he said her problems went far beyond the political environment. That gap shaped everything while Spanberger flooded the airwaves with ads on affordability and later tied Republicans to the October government shutdown. It became a rallying cry for Democrats, especially in Northern Virginia, where Spanberger blamed Republican dysfunction in Washington, D.C., for the disruption. Republican operatives say it was nearly impossible for Earle-Sears to blunt the impact. One strategist described it as “a perfect storm that juiced Democratic enthusiasm in exactly the parts of the state she needed to win.” Rather than closing the race with a forward-looking pitch to voters, Earle-Sears poured millions into ads defending herself. One of her final statewide spots, a six-figure buy, tried to reframe a viral moment when she told hecklers, “I'm speaking now.” Spanberger's campaign had looped the clip in a string of attack ads painting her as combative and unprepared. Earle-Sears's response, opening with, “They pick your worst day,” sought to cast the moment as proof of her grit as a Marine, but it only reinforced the image of a candidate more focused on explaining herself than persuading voters. “You can be a victim of your own polling,” he said. “You come off as tone-deaf when people are worried about paying their mortgage or being able to afford rent.” Even before the general election began, her candidacy showed signs of strain. In the spring, she narrowly avoided a primary challenge from former state Sen. Amanda Chase, a staunch Trump ally whose fiery brand of politics threatened to pull the race further right. Party officials ultimately ruled that Chase failed to submit enough valid signatures to make the ballot, sparing Earle-Sears a costly fight, but exposing early fractures among Virginia Republicans. Earle-Sears and her running mate, lieutenant governor hopeful John Reid, stopped speaking for weeks after Gov. Glenn Youngkin privately urged Reid, a Richmond radio host and the state's first openly gay statewide nominee, to suspend his campaign. The request came after allegations surfaced that Reid had reposted nude photos of men years earlier on a Tumblr account linked to his social media. The sense of dysfunction soon spilled into public view. In one embarrassing episode, the campaign's website featured watermarked stock photos on its issues page, prompting veteran GOP strategist Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 campaign, to deride Earle-Sears's team as “amateurs.” The blunder deepened doubts about whether Earle-Sears had assembled a team capable of running a modern statewide campaign. Under mounting pressure from donors, Earle-Sears replaced her campaign manager, a pastor with no prior political experience, in an attempted reset. “She could never stay on message, could never drive a message, didn't grind it the way that you just have to in a place as difficult to win as Virginia,” said a Republican strategist based in Virginia. Several Republicans familiar with the operation said she often went days without making donor calls or holding events, instead taking “personal admin days.” By late summer, conservative radio host John Fredericks publicly urged Youngkin to “take control” of her campaign, calling its lack of visible activity “embarrassing.” Earle-Sears appeared on Fox News several times but granted few interviews elsewhere. Several Virginia outlets reported that their requests had been denied or ignored, including VPM News, which said it had reached out multiple times over two months to schedule an interview for its statewide candidate series, with no success. Cardinal News reported that Virginia FREE, a pro-business organization that meets with major candidates each cycle, tried for three months to secure a meeting with Earle-Sears while her Democratic opponent had already met with them. The pattern left reporters and business leaders uncertain about her positions on key issues as the race entered its final months. Still, he stayed off the trail as Youngkin kept him at arm's length, avoiding joint appearances and downplaying the MAGA agenda to win over suburban voters. Throughout this year's race, Trump kept Earle-Sears at a distance. He phoned into two brief get-out-the-vote calls for Virginia Republicans ahead of the election, urging voters to “vote Republican up and down the line” but never mentioning Earle-Sears by name. The gesture stood in sharp contrast to former President Barack Obama, who spent the weekend campaigning in person for Spanberger. Trump declined to issue a formal endorsement, referring to Earle-Sears only as “the Republican candidate” and saying he “hadn't been too involved in Virginia.” His list of social-media endorsements in the campaign's final days included dozens of other GOP hopefuls, but not her. The distance reflected both political pragmatism and personal history. Earle-Sears drew Trump's ire in 2022 after suggesting he had become “a liability” to the party following midterm losses. She built her candidacy around cultural flashpoints, devoting more time to transgender issues than to the economy, even as polls showed inflation and the cost of living were voters' top concerns. A September survey of likely Virginia voters by Christopher Newport University found that affordability was the dominant issue across the electorate, followed by threats to democracy. Democrats overwhelmingly named threats to democracy as their biggest concern, while Republicans were divided among economic pressures, immigration, and crime. “She didn't make any major mistakes, didn't leave a door open for Earle-Sears to get in very easily.” “It was going to be very difficult for Earle-Sears to really run on that when her party is supposedly in charge of everything.” When Democrats called a surprise redistricting session in early October, forcing her back to Richmond just as early voting ramped up, Earle-Sears barely mentioned it on the trail, beyond holding a press conference a week before the election. While other Republicans running blasted the move as “election interference,” she glossed over it for days before adopting the same language, a sign, strategists said, of her difficulty adapting to fast-moving events. The same problem surfaced with the controversy surrounding Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, whose leaked text messages appeared to reference violence toward Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. But rather than folding the episode into a broader argument about Democratic governance or accountability, Earle-Sears and the entire Republican ticket made it their singular focus, hammering it long after voters had moved on. Oh, so it's all about you, Abigail,” drawing laughter from loyal supporters. To many strategists, that moment summed up the problem. “It's not that voters disagreed with her,” said a separate GOP operative in Virginia. When people are worried about paying their bills, they don't want a lecture on bathrooms or a comedy bit onstage.” “This could have been a closer contest,” the operative added. “But the margin that she lost by isn't just the wave; a good chunk of that percentage is her campaign messaging and her actual campaign organization. For Virginia Republicans, the scope of Earle-Sears's defeat was devastating. Her fifteen-point loss to Spanberger didn't just end a campaign; it wiped out the gains the party made under Glenn Youngkin and left Republicans without a single statewide officeholder for the first time in nearly a decade. It can happen again, but only with great candidates, real money, and flawless campaigns.” Roday said the party's challenge now is rebuilding credibility in a state that has steadily trended blue. “There absolutely could be a snapback election,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the living room of her third-floor apartment in rural Germany, Abeba winces as she stares at her phone. “I understand that you may not have the financial means to assist me directly, and I never expected that from you. Please, just make sure my message reaches those who might be able to help.” They've heard it's an area called Kufra. What they do know is that every time he calls, or they receive a video, he's being mercilessly tortured by men who remain off camera. Videos seen by CNN show Daniel being tied up, urinated on, kicked, and beaten with a metal pole. CNN is using pseudonyms for Daniel and Abeba because they fear retribution. If his family doesn't manage to gather the $10,000 being demanded by his captors, he may soon be dead. CNN has spoken to dozens of individuals and families in their situation. Daniel is just one of an unknown number of migrants who are currently being tortured on a near daily basis, somewhere in Libya's Sahara Desert. Libya, in North Africa, has long been the transit country of choice for those hoping to travel across the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. The passengers on this dangerous route change over time as conflicts ebb and flow. Recently, the vast majority have been coming from Sudan, embroiled in a brutal civil war which has displaced millions. Much of it is relatively functional – insofar as clients pay several hundred dollars to be transported in bare-bones conditions to Libya's coast, and onto an overcrowded inflatable dingy bound for Italy or Greece. But if someone is unlucky enough to come from a country perceived to have a large diaspora – wealthy, at least compared to everyone else – then they stand a good chance of falling into the hands not of smugglers, but of traffickers, who coerce and exploit those in their control. Eritreans, who make up the second largest share of refugees recorded in Libya according to the United Nations, fall into this group. Their dictatorial hermit nation is often called Africa's North Korea. Many thousands flee its mandatory, indefinite military service – and some fall prey to exploitative trafficking gangs. This is what happened to Abeba's brother. But the traffickers know this terrain far better than they do. To an observer, their efforts appear futile in the extreme. That's plain to see in Al Jawf, the first major settlement migrants encounter as they transit Libya's vast Kufra province from south to north. They believe him to be “a money man” – helping to transfer money between relatives of trafficking victims who live abroad, like Abeba, and the traffickers both in Libya and in foreign safe havens who profit from the industry. Many of the payments are sent through an informal money transfer system known as “hawala.” Because it is widely used to send legitimate remittances and operates entirely on a human-to-human level via text messages and phone calls, it is nearly impossible to track. It is entirely feasible that this man has no idea the extent of the sordid industry he is facilitating. “Only God knows,” the Sudanese man replies. Torture videos are currently circulating on social media – and being sent to families around the world. The trafficker and his “passengers” were operating from a farm not even a kilometer from the police base. Foreign passports and bedding are strewn across the rooms, but both captors and victims are long gone. When the traffickers are stopped, it's usually because of luck, not advanced police work. Three years ago, two Sudanese men stumbled into a police station in the desert town of Tazirbu. They explained that they'd just escaped from a nearby farm, where hundreds of other men were being held for ransom – beaten as their families were extorted for money. Police geared up and stormed the compound, using a hoe to knock the padlock off a door inside. In grainy footage taken that August day, dozens of men streamed out of the cramped room in which they were confined and yelled “Allahu Akbar!” as they walked into the sunlight, their arms held to the sky. Convicted last year of “forced disappearance,” he is now serving a life sentence at Benghazi Central Prison, where CNN was granted extraordinary access to speak with him. Benghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army, under commander Khalifa Haftar, rather than the divided country's internationally recognized Government of National Unity. “I didn't do anything,” Tesfay told CNN. In 2023, Emirati forces operating in Sudan arrested Kidane Zekarias Habtemariam, an alleged Eritrean trafficking kingpin, and rendered him to the UAE. He has not yet entered a plea, according to prosecutors. A Dutch court is already set to hear a case this month against another Eritrean man, who has been charged with allegedly being part of a criminal organization that specializes in human smuggling, taking hostages, extortion, and violence including sexual violence. “I haven't seen or heard anything,” he said. “I haven't seen anything in front of me. And yet, when questioned on why so many Eritreans join the trafficking networks in Libya, the explanation he gives is clear. It's a simple explanation with profound consequences. In Benghazi's Ganfuda Detention Center, dozens of young women and girls crowd the floor of a warehouse strewn with foam mattresses and the plastic-bag detritus of an itinerant life. They've since been picked up by local authorities and detained for illegal entry into Libya. Now they await help from the United Nations or non-governmental organizations – help that often takes months to arrive. “These guys, they touched me,” she says of her former captors. A government-provided doctor in Benghazi has confirmed she's not pregnant, but that's the extent of the help she's received so far. Every day, the women and girls around her sob in traumatic memory of what happened to them. Each has their own heart-wrenching story of abuse and misery. Abrihet looks down at her forearms, which are criss-crossed with the scars of self-harm. For girls like Abrihet, it is impossible to contemplate how this network of abuse is allowed to continue, year after year. In a divided country, with rival governments, the agency is an oddity in operating nationwide, in both the internationally recognized west and the Haftar-controlled east and south. The situation, he insists, is much better than it once was. But the international community needs to step up. “Look, this matter requires participation by states,” he said. They should all be partners to eradicate the phenomenon.” In 2016, the European Union struck a deal with Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli that funded Libyan forces to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. It resulted in a sharp drop in people taking what is known as the Central Mediterranean route from North Africa to Europe over the next few years, but also meant they were often held in squalid Libyan detention centers. The number of migrants braving the dangerous crossing has been rising in recent months, particularly between eastern Libya and Greece, where it is up more than three-fold in a year. And Eritreans are among those most likely to take the risk – they are now the second-largest national group arriving in Italy, after Bangladeshis. Human rights groups have accused DCIM of maintaining inhumane conditions and using violence against migrants. A UN experts panel alleged that those migrants freed during the Tazirbu raid were subject to further abuses at the hands of DCIM. Al-Fadhil said that the accusation was “useless if it is not accompanied by clear evidence.” There were just over 100,000 refugees and asylum-seekers registered in Libya as of October. But the true number of those in Libya fleeing conflict is undoubtedly much larger, because the UN – which registers refugees – only operates in areas controlled by the internationally recognized government in western Libya. UN officials have appealed for help in expanding their efforts to help the influx of Sudanese refugees in Libya. Haftar, who controls eastern and southern Libya, runs a government unrecognized by the United States or European powers. It is just one of the many reasons why increasingly heightened anti-immigration sentiment in Europe has not translated into more cooperation to stop southern Libya's smugglers and traffickers. Following months of agony and fundraising, Abeba was eventually able to send enough money to pay for her brother Daniel's release. He is now in Libya's western city of Tripoli: still far from being reunited with his family. “May God punish them for what they did,” she cried. I beg you, tell this story to the world.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A win for Democrats in blue New Jersey's gubernatorial race was not surprising, but the victory was attributed to a larger trend at play: Republicans desperately need to work on voter turnout, and President Donald Trump needs to rethink how he conveys his policies. Rep. Mikie Sherrill's (D-NJ) decisive win against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, as well as other Democratic victories Tuesday night, have been brushed off by national Republicans as a predetermined outcome, arguing it is not reflective of how voters across the country perceive the GOP. However, Sherrill managed to flip key counties that Trump won in 2024, and she attracted more of the Latino vote, a historically blue voting bloc that helped the president narrow his margin in the Garden State last November. Republicans historically do not match Democrats' turnout rates in non-presidential years. National GOP strategist Brian Seitchik told the Washington Examiner that New Jersey was “always going to be an uphill climb,” but Tuesday was “the latest example of a reality that Republicans need to understand.” “One thing that Republicans have done a very poor job of doing is motivating the Trump voters while attracting anyone else,” Brian Kirwin, a longtime Virginia GOP strategist, echoed. And rallying Trump voters was a considerable part of Ciattarelli's campaign. He linked himself closely to the president's agenda, taking a gamble that it would drive out Trump's supporters. The government shutdown didn't help matters either, playing a “tremendous role” in his eyes, said Hank Sheinkopf, longtime Democratic political consultant. “Ciattarelli could not walk away from Trump,” he said. “He grabbed Trump's hand and held it too tight. Eyes were on the government shutdown, which reached 37 days as of Thursday, to see if it would negatively affect Sherrill, a sitting member of Congress who had voted against the Republican spending deal to fund the government. Sheinkopf, who advised Hudson County Republicans in New Jersey how to bolster support for Ciattarelli, said he thought Virginia was a rebuke of candidate quality, whereas New Jersey was a rebuke of Trump's policies, plain and simple. Because Ciattarelli was within 3 to 5 [points] two weeks out this closing,” the consultant said. In his concession speech, Ciattarelli didn't mention Trump. He said “nobody's more disappointed than me” and noted his chances were slim in a blue state, but he's “proud of the effort we put forth.” “Yes, Republicans are the minority party, but that means also being the loyal opposition and continuing to ensure that our voice is heard,” he added. Ciattarelli received a Trump endorsement and the financial backing of national Republicans, whereas Lt. Gov. But Sheinkopf noted there could have been some “voter fatigue” given this was Ciattarelli's third attempt at the governor's mansion. Henry de Koninck, a New Jersey strategist and political consultant, agreed that Ciattarelli was a “fine” candidate, pointing out that his vote total of over 1.3 million votes was more votes than outgoing Gov. Kirwin said that candidate quality is incredibly important when it comes to finding someone who can grow a message and “not just play R vs. D.” The 2025 election results sent a strong signal to Capitol Hill that Republicans will not be able to solely ride the wave of Trump back into the White House and maintain any momentum gathered from 2024 victories. Trump himself told GOP senators on Wednesday morning that he wanted to have a “discussion” about “what last night represented.” He blamed GOP losses on the shutdown, telling the senators behind closed doors that Republicans are “getting killed.” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said that if Trump and Republicans “don't get their act together,” they will face an even worse defeat in 2026. In his eyes, candidate quality matters the least in a midterm election because many voters go to the polls and “don't even know congressional candidates are, may not even know who their incumbent member of Congress is.” “But they'll vote based on how they feel about the president, and if Trump's job rating is anything like it was last night, that suggests that the Republicans are ready for a big hurt a year from today,” Bannon said. David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, disagrees. “People can overlook some economic problems and issues if they're excited about a candidate, but if they're not excited about the candidate and they feel like the party in power is to blame, then the party in power is going to suffer,” Richards said. “It is really important to them, but it doesn't move voters off their party preference choice in the way that a lot of pundits and folks in the political consulting class think that it does.” “So it's not that Ciattarelli spoke about the wrong issues, and it's just that those issues were not ultimately shaping vote preference,” he added. The Washington Examiner reached out to Ciattarelli for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy made this revelation at a press conference announcing the cuts, as previously reported by the Washington Examiner. It was a precautionary measure to avoid any disasters or emergencies, given the effect the shutdown has had on air traffic controllers. According to ABC News, here is a list of the 40 airports that will see a reduction in flights: It will commence with a 4% reduction and ramp up to the 10% total, ABC News reported. One exception is that international flights are not included in the cuts, and at least one airline company announced that “hub-to-hub flights will not be impacted.” Reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations. This is not based on light airline travel locations. This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure,” said Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford, who joined Duffy at the press conference on Wednesday. They're going to work with passengers, but in the end, our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. One of them, though, is going to be that there is going to be a 10% reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations.”</p>
