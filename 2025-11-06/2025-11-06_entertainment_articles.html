                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar-nominated actress Pauline Collins, best known for her role in Shirley Valentine, has sadly passed away. She also appeared in films such as “Quartet” and “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.” The beloved British actress passed away at the age of 85. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, Collins passed away “peacefully” at her home in London in the presence of her family. Her death came after a years-long battle with Parkinson's disease. Collins leaves behind four children and her husband, John Alderton. Collins appeared in over 70 roles throughout her legendary career. One person on X wrote, “Thanks for everything, Pauline Collins. Your quiet talent shone out no matter what the job. Another person said on X, “Always guaranteed to light up the screen, either big or small, Pauline Collins has sadly left us. Someone else expressed their disbelief, saying, “Oh, it can't be true!! Shirley Valentine is my all-time favourite film, I must've seen it a million times. Another fan wrote, “Sad to hear we've lost Pauline Collins. From Upstairs Downstairs to Mrs Caldicot's Cabbages via Shirley Valentine, she never failed to entertain in her own unique style.” The social media tributes continued as someone else said, “One of my favourite actors – started watching Upstairs Downstairs again on ITVx. Finally, another fan of her work wrote, “RIP Pauline Collins. Her most recent role was in the 2017 film “The Time of Their Lives.” Collins will be missed, but her legacy will live on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bianca Censori is taking her revealing everyday outfits to new heights. On Thursday, she returned to the airport in Melbourne, Australia, wearing an all-black outfit comprised solely of a thong bodysuit and a long-sleeve top. Evidently, Censori put on a pair of sheer black tights, slipped into a high-waisted thong bodysuit, added some heels, grabbed her oversized Hermès Birkin and was ready to catch her flight. On Monday morning, she arrived at the same airport in a nude-colored version of her go-to travel look, complete with a long-sleeve tee and high-waisted briefs worn over super shiny tights. She accessorized with a matching pageboy hat. During her short visit, she was spotted shopping with her mom and sister while wearing undergarments from Marc Jacobs' fall 2025 collection, including a purple bullet bra and sheer pink body stocking as a top. It seems to be a trend for the designer, as she also caught a flight this past summer wearing briefs and knee-high boots, and kicked off the year with a Tokyo flight in a grey thong bodysuit and heels. While Censori often takes to Instagram or is spotted out and about with husband Kanye West in barely-there looks, the choice of wearing lingerie on a 14-hour flight, let alone any flight, is questionable. Most travelers, celebrities included, opt for more comfortable attire, like sweatpants or leggings… Either way, she probably had to check a bag.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: We have two more additions to Amazon MGM Studios‘ Road House 2: Peter Sarsgaard (September 5) and Rob Delaney (Dying for Sex). As we first told you, there have been many other recent additions to the cast of the sequel, including Rico Verhoeven, Michael Chandler, Michael “Venom” Page, Dustin Poirier, Stephen Thompson, Tyron Woodley, Jay Hieron, Andrew “King Bach” Bachelor, Iko Uwais, and Hidetoshi Nishijima. Hieron is reprising his role as UFC fighter Jax “Jetway” Harris from the first film. Plot specifics for the sequel, which sees Jake Gyllenhaal return as UFC fighter–turned–bouncer Dalton, also remain under wraps. But the film is said to be a production of greater scope, scale, and ambition, with filming taking place across the U.K., Malta, and Savannah, Georgia. The sequel follows 2024's Road House — Amazon's reboot of the '80s classic starring Patrick Swayze — which drew 80 million viewers worldwide in its first eight weeks on Prime Video. Amazon MGM's 'Road House 2' Adds Andrew Bachelor, Iko Uwais & Hidetoshi Nishijima To Cast 'We Were Liars' Author E. Lockhart Praises Rain Spencer's "Full Range" Ahead Of 'Genuine Fraud' Adaptation Ilya Naishuller is directing from a script by Will Beall. As previously announced, the cast also includes Leila George, Aldis Hodge, and Dave Bautista. Atlas Entertainment's Charles Roven and Alex Gartner are producing alongside Nine Stories Productions' Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh McLaughlin, who are under a three-year first-look film deal with Amazon MGM. An Emmy nominee who was most recently seen in Tim Fehlbaum's Golden Globe-nominated September 5, as well as the hit Apple series Presumed Innocent, Sarsgaard will next be seen in the upcoming Warner Bros. film The Bride!, directed by his wife, Maggie Gyllenhaal. He is represented by Anonymous Content, WME, and Peikoff Mahan. Best known for co-creating and co-starring in Channel 4/Amazon MGM's Catastrophe, Delaney is coming off an Emmy nomination for his supporting role in FX'S Dying for Sex and recently wrapped Apple TV's civil rights drama Being Heumann from CODA‘s Sian Heder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man standing near Donald Trump in the Oval Office collapsed as the president was holding a press event to announce discounts to two popular weight loss drugs. Fox News, NewsNation and C-SPAN were covering the event live, and NewsNation's White House correspondent updated viewers on the situation. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “a representative with one of the companies fainted. Nancy Pelosi Says She Will Not Seek Reelection In 2026 Zohran Mamdani's Media Savvy Helped Make Him New York's Next Mayor, But Will He Give The Struggling Film & TV Biz A Boost? At the event, Trump announced a White House initiative to lower drug costs, this time over innovative weight-loss treatments. Trump said that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to offer their most popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs at “drastic discounts.” The drugs are Zepbound and Wegovy. The president said that the costs will fall from more than $1,000 per month to a couple or several hundred dollars. “All these drugs will be available directly to the consumer at trumprx.gov. They wanted to use my name,” Trump said. He said that Medicare and Medicaid would cover the cost for patients suffering from obesity. Fox News and NewsNation carried Trump's remarks; other cable networks did not. Trump at one point said to Robert Kennedy Jr., his secretary of Health and Human Services, “Is there anything bad about them, Bobby? Someday, maybe it will come out, which we'll notify you immediately.” Trump's announcement comes after Tuesday's off-year elections, in which exit polls showed voters showed their top concerns were the economy and affordability.

In the Peacock limited series' first scene, Marissa (Snook) stops by a friend's house to pick up her son from a playdate. Neither is the mom who's supposed to be watching him. While she's very nice — inviting Marissa inside, offering reassurance, helping her make phone calls — her every kindness only leads to more questions. Her son's playdate pal is at the park with a bunch of other kids. After a few exposition-heavy minutes of searching, there's only one conclusion left for Marissa to draw. Related Stories ‘Death by Lightning' Review: Michael Shannon Leads a Rollicking Elegy for the American Experiment True Crime Casting Still Doesn't Look Doofy Enough on TV “I don't know where my son is,” she says, right before the title “All Her Fault” flashes across the screen. Not subtle, sure — but also, kind of fun? It is for a while, at least, before an overextended story runs out of steam and the delayed answers stretch themselves silly to emphasize a point made patently clear from the start. Throughout the hour-long premiere, Megan Gallagher's adaptation of Andrea Mara's 2021 novel balances the tragic urgency of a missing-kid mystery with the soapy indulgences of a trash-TV thriller. There are emotional meltdowns as the family's fresh reality dawns on each of Milo's loved ones. The cast largely helps to keep things grounded, rebutting the histrionics by treating each claim with legitimacy or reciting each gauche line with apt conviction. But really, they're all just suspects, as the first episode's closing flash-forward to a police lineup of each series regular's mugshot makes clear. Marissa runs her own wealth management firm in Chicago, alongside her very handsome business partner, Colin (Jay Ellis). Despite looking like a fighter pilot who could win a game of dogfight football, Colin isn't framed as a temptation for Marissa, and a lack of sexy secrets proves to be a recurring blind spot for the series, even if those two have plenty of other skeletons in their massive, boring closets. (In case you couldn't tell from the moneyed term “wealth management,” everyone in this show is filthy rich — which makes the drab interior designs feel like an obvious oversight. Instead of pining over co-workers, Marissa is happily married to Peter (Jake Lacy), a commodities broker and, conversely, a gold-star human being. After an early inquiry into his whereabouts — was he with another woman?! — it's clear he would never cheat on Marissa, and his lack of resentment over the accusation only serves as further evidence of his good-guy bonafides. But… he is played by Jake Lacy, Hollywood's go-to actor for self-centered douchebags, so he's not to be trusted. (You could say the typecasting started with “The White Lotus,” and you wouldn't be wrong, except it actually started with “Carol,” and in this house we do not forget about “Carol.”) Brian is a nice guy, too, but vague allusions to a mysterious accident that left him in constant pain keep the door open to a hidden dark side. Lia's issue is out in the open: She's a drug addict who's spent half of Milo's life in rehab, so is she as devoted to her nephew as she claims? The fellow mom from school says she has no idea a playdate was scheduled with her son and Milo, but as another mom cattily voices directly to Jenny: “If someone did take Milo Irvine, why would they pretend to be you?” Yeah, Jenny! For as dismissive as “All Her Fault” can be toward childcare professionals, it does sport a feminist edge so blunt it would struggle to cut Milo's birthday cake. When Marissa is first interviewed by the police, she's lightly chided by her otherwise respectful husband for not checking a parent's phone number against the school registry. When Jenny has to work late one night, her husband won't stop bugging her with questions about their kid — questions he should know how to answer if he was ever “on duty” (his words) for bedtime. The other moms at school cast dubious glances at both Marissa and Jenny for making mistakes any good mom could avoid, while the media pounces on the women for every perceived error whether it's rooted in fact or not. Lending such prominence to an under-addressed parenting issue — the disparity in childcare, even in “progressive” couples that aim for an equal workload — makes “All Her Fault” that much easier to cheer, especially when you're already yelling at your TV. If that level the enthusiasm proved sustainable over eight long hours, perhaps Peacock would have another “Apples Never Fall” on its hands. Instead, episodes start to drag and the big reveals lose steam, leaving Sarah Snook to reign over a series that can't maximize her skillset. The series' failures are not, of course, her fault, and it's to Snook's immense credit that a tender moment at the end of the first episode lands at all. “All Her Fault” premieres Thursday, November 6 on Peacock. All eight episodes will be released at once. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

Bi Gan pushes against the edges of the cinematic medium once again with his new dream-logic epic, “Resurrection.” It's the 35-year-old Chinese filmmaker's first feature since he dared audiences to put on 3D glasses 70 minutes in for an unbroken take, which is also when the title card showed up, in “Long Day's Journey Into Night.” “Resurrection” is an even more daring achievement, one that will enchant and alienate audiences in ways that will equally encourage conversation and, hopefully, more dreams. No 3D glasses required, though, when Janus Films opens “Resurrection” in theaters on December 12. Across the six chapters in “Resurrection,” director Bi adopts the aesthetics of a number of genres and periods in film history as his canvas, from Méliès-inspired silent films and wartime epics to a con-artist buddy movie and even a millennial vampire romance, to tell stories revolving around the same monster's dreams. Taiwanese superstar Shu Qi headlines as a woman who, in a far-off future, enters the consciousness of the only remaining creature who can dream. The phrase “bravura sequence” gets tossed around with abandon, but “Resurrection” has a truly special one. A work of staggering imagination from visionary Chinese director Bi Gan, ‘Resurrection' conjures vast and ever-shifting worlds on the brink of collapse in an era-spanning journey through our deepest and most human desires.” In my experience, one viewing at the New York Film Festival was not enough to parse the film's gorgeous riddles and meditation on cinema as a dream machine. IndieWire's own review by Sophie Monks Kaufman out of Cannes asked enthusiastically, “Endurance Test, or Imaginative, Boundary-Defying Cinema? It feels reductive in late 2025 to call a film or television series Lynchian anymore, but parts of “Resurrection” feel like Bi Gan somewhere out there mainlined “Twin Peaks: The Return” and it burrowed its way into his own unconscious: floating orbs, ghostly light patterns, time loops, and all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lily Allen's new album, West End Girl, has pulled the rug out from under happily-married-after dreams. From the title track — which begins like a whimsical skip down the altar to a brownstone in New York, before abruptly being rerouted to a devastating phone call  — to the shocking confrontation of “Madeline,” where Allen endures the hollow sympathy from a woman who slept with her husband, West End Girl has left every corner of social media knocked off its high horse. “Absolutely obsessed and horrified at how specifically relatable every track was,” wrote a commenter on Allen's Instagram, while another observed, “A load of lads'll get triggered cause they've cheated on their birds, but for every woman who's twisted herself into a human pretzel to keep some emotionally constipated bloke happy, this is our national anthem.” While many songwriters may opt for coy innuendos to discuss similar subject matter, Allen has detailed revelations of butt plugs, condoms, and a husband who is quite possibly a sex addict — all set against honeyed pop scores — making it all feel like the time D. H. Lawrence scandalized Britain by penning the word “fuck” in Lady Chatterley's Lover. The album has resonated with not just women in — and after — marriages, but also anyone who has considered the idea of coupling with another person and trusting them enough to hold you at your most vulnerable. There's a headline by satire website Reductress — “Woman Who Has Never Been Married or Cheated On Feeling Seen by New Lily Allen Album” — that rings true here, as each track is rooted in a fear that's at once ubiquitous, timeless, and vividly current. “Pussy Palace” salts infidelity with the discovery of a Duane Reade plastic bag filled with lube, while “Nonmonogamummy” and “Dallas Major” find Allen wandering dating apps and hating it: “You know, I used to be quite famous, that was way back in the day/I probably should explain how my marriage has been open since my husband went astray,” she sings. Pulling apart fact from fiction in Allen's story is tricky territory, however, despite the album being widely perceived as a tell-all about her ex-husband, actor David Harbour. Resendez, a social media editor with two children who is out of a long-term relationship, says that Allen's record has arrived at a time when women are reclaiming their autonomy, chipping away at patriarchal norms, and publicly holding men accountable for their misdeeds. “Women have financially, emotionally, and mentally done the work to advance ourselves, and now we're realizing we don't need to keep putting ourselves in situations where men embarrass us or do things that make us feel ashamed,” she says. Following the release of West End Girl, the note that Harbour wrote Allen ahead of her stage debut resurfaced: “My ambitious wife, these are bad luck flowers 'cause if you get reviewed well in this play, you will get all kinds of awards and I'll be miserable. Jimmy Kimmel Celebrates Trump's Reaction to Democratic Wins: ‘Everything He Touched Was a Loser' BTS' Jimin and Jung Kook Announce Season 2 of Travel Show ‘Are You Sure?!' Lily Allen Says She Has Moved on From David Harbour Heartbreak: ‘I Don't Need Revenge' Lily Allen Apologizes to Katy Perry for Space Trip Criticism: ‘It Was Internalized Misogyny' “When you put your trust into someone and they use it against you, or they have no empathy, the hardest part is learning how to navigate other relationships in your life. She sings about these sad, traumatic experiences, but the beat is uplifting. You still have to go about our day and go to work, take care of our loved ones, and do the song and dance every time you meet someone new on these apps, while still walking around with this gray cloud over you.” Yet there's liberation in Allen's ability to strip down the shame, jealousy, fear, and torment into art — something she can remember on her own terms. On the penultimate song, “Let You W/In,” she asks, “All I can do is sing. So why should I let you win?” before declaring, “I can walk out with my dignity, if I lay my truth on the table.”And when the tale of ill-starred lovers-turned-strangers closes with “Fruityloop,” Allen's defiant refrain, “It's not me, it's you,” lands less as a kiss-off and more as a resounding victory.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actor hinted at the major next steps his and his girlfriend's ultra-private relationship will take in a cover interview with Vogue, published Thursday. The “Wonka” star did not divulge much about his romance with the “Kardashians” star, whom he's been dating since early 2023 — not out of “any fear,” he clarified, but because he doesn't “have anything to say.” He mentioned recently watching a video in which someone was “bragging about not having kids and how much time it afforded them to do other stuff” — a mindset he considered “bleak.” Page Six has reached out to Jenner's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. Chalamet, 29, and Jenner, 28, first sparked romance rumors in 2023 when the latter's Range Rover was seen outside the Golden Globe nominee's Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. That September, the pair shocked fans when they were seen making out at one of Beyoncé's “Renaissance” tour stops in Los Angeles. Jenner accompanied Chalamet to the Golden Globes in January 2024, where they shared several kisses during a commercial break, and she has since supported her beau at many awards ceremonies. Jenner and the “A Complete Unknown” star proved they are still going strong by grabbing coffee together in Hungary. Last month, they made back-to-back outings for the New York Film Festival premiere of Chalamet's forthcoming movie, “Marty Supreme,” and a New York Yankees game. Jenner shares daughter Stormi, 7, and son Aire, 3, with ex Travis Scott.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are learning why you don't get a Mogwai wet. The directing duo behind this summer's horror hit Final Destination: Bloodlines have teamed up with Chris Columbus to write the new feature installment of Gremlins, Warner Bros.' horror comedy franchise featuring little mischievous monsters, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. New 'Final Destination' Movie Finds Its Director in Michiel Blanchart Kristie Macosko Krieger and Holly Bario of Amblin Entertainment are producing the project, as are Columbus, Michael Barnathan and Mark Radcliffe via their banner, 26th Street Pictures. Lipovsky and Stein are working with Columbus as a writing team. A script by Columbus has been in development since at least 2017 — Toby Halbrooks and Carl Ellsworth wrote previous drafts — and the boarding of Lipovsky and Stein, who are very much in demand around Hollywood thanks to Bloodlines, is an electric charge for the project. “It's a privilege to be working alongside Steven (Spielberg), Chris (Columbus), and the entire creative team, and we look forward to audiences experiencing the magic, mayhem, and heart of Gremlins on the big screen in 2027.” With Bloodlines, Lipovsky and Stein reinvigorated a moribund Warners title, helming the first Final Destination movie in about 14 years. The duo are known for their directing work, but the opportunity to work as writers on a movie series that was a childhood favorite to them both, and to work with Columbus, who also wrote 1980s classic The Goonies and directed Home Alone, was too good to pass up. Lipovsky and Stein have yet to pick their next directorial outing but are being heavily courted by studios. Of course, all those rules are broken and soon, all hell breaks loose in the hero's small town, as not only new Mogwais appear, led by the nasty-tempered Stripe, but they then turn into reptilian killers as well. The movie was released the same weekend as Ghostbusters, with both becoming hits and making their mark on 1980s pop culture. Dante came back for the sequel, but Columbus did not. The franchise and IP went into a cocoon for decades, but talk of an eventual third movie would pop up intermittently. “The fact is that it's too big a property for somebody not to make something.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel is pleased that Democrats did well in the election this week, but even more pleased that Donald Trump isn't taking the news very well. “I'm glad it was because we needed a big night. Democrats have had fewer wins this year than the Jets. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor with more than 50 percent of the vote. Which means your racist aunt and uncle have a new name to mispronounce this Thanksgiving.” Kimmel noted that it was “not a good night for the president” because “everything he touched was a loser.” “Trump hasn't been this embarrassed since he found out there was a Donald Trump Jr.,” Kimmel quipped. Kimmel shared a second post from Trump, which read, “And so it begins.” Kimmel noted, “Which was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race or he just sat down on the toilet.” Jimmy Kimmel Celebrates Trump's Reaction to Democratic Wins: ‘Everything He Touched Was a Loser' BTS' Jimin and Jung Kook Announce Season 2 of Travel Show ‘Are You Sure?!' “Trump has been desperately trying to convince anyone who will listen that Democrats are responsible for the shut down and that it has nothing to do with him trying to hide the Epstein files,” Kimmel said. Earlier this week, Kimmel announced that he and his show created a food donation center — named the “Big, Beautiful Food Bank,” in reference to President Donald Trump's so-called Big, Beautiful Bill — to aid those in need. The food bank is being hosted at the ABC show's backlot in Hollywood and is set to gather both food and donations for local orgs St. Joseph Center and the Los Angeles Food Bank. “Cutting SNAP benefits creates uncertainty for American children, seniors, and families,” Kimmel wrote on Instagram. “To support our community members in need, we're starting a donation center.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defying an assumption we would have made with some confidence at pretty much any point between, like, 1998 and today, the American entertainment industry has apparently pushed Snoop Dogg's ability to self-promotionally appear in things to its limit. Admittedly, it took the confluence of the planet's biggest ice-based sporting event and its largest party holiday to do it, as Mr. Dogg reported today that he will be canceling his planned live NBC New Year's special, Snoop Dogg's New Year's Eve, in favor of focusing more of his energies on the Winter Olympics. But don't worry, we'll party together bigger and better later in 2026. Ya dig indeed, as NBC has clearly decided that getting Snoop's energy on hand for the Winter Games—after he was a breakout hit at the network's very expensive Paris coverage back in 2024—will be key to making next year's Winter Olympics pop. (The Games are scheduled to take up most of next February, and are set for Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy; apparently, when Snoop Dogg puts on a New Year's Eve party, he does so in such a way that it makes him unavailable for luge commentary duties for at least a month.) The question now is what NBC will put on in the event's place, or whether it'll worry about it at all. (There's not enough time to organize a whole new New Year's event, apparently, although we've done some pretty bold things in less time with a couple of lovingly burnt mix CDs, and a cocktail best described as “Anything sold on the bottom shelf of the liquor store that happens to be blue.”) The network has been inconsistent about handling the holiday, in recent years to the point that it just ran a football game last year, since New Year's fell on Sunday anyway; in previous years, it tapped Miley Cyrus to handle its competition for ABC's regular Ryan Seacrest-focused offerings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the sort of legal action that makes us want to cry into our Kleenex while xeroxing Photoshopped pictures of our Jet Skis, the Motion Picture Association has made it clear that it is not happy that Meta and Instagram have been using the term “PG-13” to refer to its upcoming guidelines for teen users. Specifically, the group has now (per Variety) issued a cease and desist order to Meta, ordering that it stop using “PG-13” as a way to describe its new teen-focused accounts. “Teens will see content on Instagram that's similar to what they'd see in a PG-13 movie,” the blog's writer asserted, apparently not cluing in to the idea that the whole concept of “PG-13” remains owned by a non-profit corporation that's extremely vigorous in pursuing and protecting its trademarks. Among other things, the MPA sounds pissed that its own rating and curation work might end up getting smooshed together in the public consciousness with what Meta's doing, work that is likely to rely heavily on automation. “Instead, Meta's content restrictions appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence or other automated technology measures.” (Noting that it used “publicly available PG-13 standards” to set the new guidelines.) None of which seems likely to mollify the MPA, which knows better than most that you have to nip these kinds of things in the bud, lest you find yourself having to take an aspirin after weeping too hard into your Jell-O over having your trademark get genericized out from under you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Music Publishing Group, which owns Dylan's song catalog, says it has a "longstanding policy" of keeping his compositions out of political projects. Bob Dylan's “The Times They Are A-Changin'” scored New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's final advertisement before his election night victory — but the campaign spot has now been removed from X amid a licensing rejection from Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG). The ad, posted by Mamdani's various social media accounts just before polls closed on Tuesday (Nov. 4), featured the caption “New York is a-changin'” and a montage of scenes from the 34-year-old progressive's campaign set to Dylan's famous protest song. The Mamdani campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. A rep for Sony Music, which owns Dylan's master recordings, declined to comment. Representatives from Instagram owner Meta and TikTok did not immediately respond to questions about whether the platforms also received takedown notices for the ad. While individual social media users are free to soundtrack their videos with songs covered by blanket licenses, advertisements must get clearance from copyright owners via a so-called sync license. Failure to get a sync license for a political video creates potential legal liability, as Billboard has recently reported in the wake of President Donald Trump's administration posting TikTok videos featuring Taylor Swift's No. 1 single “The Fate of Ophelia” and Zach Bryan's track “Revival.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The collab marks Biza's first "BZRP Music Session" in 10 months. Titled “BZRP Music Sessions #0/66”— which can easily be interpreted as the first of 66 brand new sessions — the collaboration between the Argentine hitmaker and Puerto Rican global star was announced Tuesday (Nov. 4) on social media just hours before it officially dropped on Wednesday. In the nearly three-minute-long track, DY returns to his roots spitting bars and rhymes over a reggaetón drum. “If you ask me, I owe nothing to anyone,” DY sings. The collaboration also comes just weeks after Daddy Yankee's Superstar Q&A panel at Billboard Latin Music Week 2025, where he sat with Billboard's Leila Cobo for a one-hour-long conversation about his personal and professional rebirth after his conversion to Christianity. “The personal, spiritual, and faith-based change certainly feels good in my heart. Everyone has a purpose to fulfill in their lives, and mine was this path: to forefront popular culture, announcing the Kingdom — that's a challenge. My father is so strategic that he's calling many people.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
