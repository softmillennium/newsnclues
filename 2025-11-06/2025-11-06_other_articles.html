                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Still, the idea got its hooks in me because it seems so far from plausible," admits playwright Levi Holloway as we discuss the stage production of Paranormal Activity. The multimillion-dollar film franchise has spawned seven films so far, and now a theatrical production that has garnered solid audiences and reviews in Chicago is headed to Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre, with plans to arrive in London's iconic West End in early 2026. "I spoke with Felix a couple of times, and we really hit it off. We were so simpatico in our notion of the genre and our love for the uncanny, the strange, and 1970s horror, as well as great films like Don't Look Now and Jacob's Ladder. "I came up with a loose pitch that was mostly ridiculous, and Paramount, Simon, and Felix all bit. Paramount didn't lay down a hefty mandate. They just said, 'It should probably be about a couple who are haunted by something,' and that was it. We did have many masters to serve, so it was our pleasure to run amok all over any mythology they had created, not as a reduction, but because we wanted to do our own thing." In the story, James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape the past, but they soon discover that places aren't haunted, people are. "I live in Chicago, and I had to go to London to meet Felix over the course of a year, and I became completely enamored with the city. I was newly married, so I was like, 'Okay, well, how about a couple from Chicago going to London for work?' What a big stretch of the imagination." "You are right, though, in saying London is drenched in ghost stories and folklore, and it just feels a lot more tactile over there. It was an exciting sandbox to be in. In any good horror story, you have to isolate your main characters and you have to answer the question right away, especially in a play." He partly answered it with the production design. "My goal was to have a single set. When it comes to horror on stage, I think it serves the work well to keep your characters on one set and to make that set a character in itself," he reveals. "I wanted to make them strangers in a strange land that was familiar, but somehow not familiar, with that sheen of bizarro over it. This version of Paranormal Activity isn't about demons, God, the devil, or anything else; it's about ghosts. My idea of a ghost is that people are haunted, not places, so that's another reason you can't run." Paranormal Activity takes place on a single set, but that set is a multi-level house, which complicates things and can lead to mishaps. "When I wrote the script, I set it in a two-story house, half imagining what that execution would be. Fly Davis is our scenic designer and has done an incredible job," Holloway enthuses. "I knew that to honor what the film does, you have to immerse the audience and instantly make them into a community, sitting in the dark, watching something they shouldn't be watching. That reminded me of Rear Window or When a Stranger Calls. "In the films, it's just a couple in a house, and it's unremarkable, but the set is designed within an inch of its life. Everything is alive in that house, but figuratively, and has a narrative responsibility tied to it. You watch a married couple very familiar to you, arguing in the kitchen, but if your eye wanders up to the bedroom upstairs, maybe a little piece of storytelling is up there, too. It felt like a great way to pull the audience in, but, like you say, 100 million things can go wrong. With tension being key to Paranormal Activity's success in keeping things intimate and audiences on the edge of their seats, does that limit the production from playing specific venues? "You have to serve a lot of masters when you're trying to dream up something like that, but a lot of it you don't have control over," Holloway muses. "If your biggest problem is that the house you've placed your show in is too big, that's a pretty good problem to have. If we were in an arena, I would have some concerns, but I think we're pretty confident that the intimacy holds even in a huge house. Right now, in Chicago, I think we seat around 700, and that's not nothing. When you place it in a too small a house, the texture may change, which might cause the audience to withhold their response. There's something about safety and numbers that I think works very well for the show." If you've been lucky enough to see Paranormal Activity already and plan to see it again in another city, don't expect the same show, as it continues to evolve. "I write for the actor, I write for the human, so those scenes would change from what we've done before. "There's always that gap between intent and impact, but it changes all the time, and it streamlines, and it mostly just gets pared down to the point where over the course of two iterations, I've lost about 30 pages off the script. I only have so much confidence in the ink. It's a negative space which is on brand with the films." As we conclude our chat, one thing we've been very clear about is steering clear of spoilers. "You have to guard your monster," the playwright concludes. "There are some things you can't withhold from an audience. I think that when you're dealing with a piece of work like this, it creates something conspiratorial in the audience, a shared experience that becomes precious to them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In its North American premiere production from Nov 13 to Dec 7 Center Theatre Group presents Paranormal Activity in its North American premiere production, running November 13 to December 7 at the Ahmanson Theatre as the third attraction of its 2025-2026 season. Based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film difranchise, the original story from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at the McKittrick Hotel, promises thrills and chills galore! The play centers around newly married couple James and Lou who move from Chicago to London to escape the past. But they soon discover that places aren't haunted and deeply hidden secrets about each other will make them question how well can you really know another person? L–R: Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today, Levi. I have read about your history of night terrors and dreams. How did that draw you to write plays filled with both horror and humor? A story about who I am or what the world means to me. But I'm led by those stories and try to put them down in ink in a shape that makes sense to me as soon as I wake. To me, plays, like dreams, have no rules. Cher Álvarez in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Describe working with collaborator Felix Barrett on the production in Chicago which runs just prior to the Los Angeles production. Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London - working to create an actual nightmare - has been a dream. I like to think Felix and I are the same species of storyteller, though really that's giving myself too much credit. We do share a language though, especially when it comes to the horror space. Working with him has made me a better artist. Paranormal Activity draws themes from the award-winning film series of the same name, a franchise of seven horror films that follow supernatural hauntings, primarily centered around a demonic entity. When writing Paranormal, I really only ever concerned myself with the first film. Patrick Heusinger in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. I was more interested in a ghost story. I think we're all haunted in some way. And I think a marriage can bring many ghosts. I think when we enter into a marriage, we're forced to contend with those ghosts, to appease them somehow. I wanted to write about how sometimes broken people find each other and try to fix one another, and how often that is an entirely tragic and fruitless endeavor. Are the two characters in Paranormal Activity, newly-married couple James and Lou, related to the first film's characters Katie and Micah? And if not, how did you develop them? James and Lou are my invention and like all my characters, much of me is in them. I think all writers do that, place themselves, however abstracted, within the people they create. L–R: Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Have you previously worked with the two actors (Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger) who portray them? (Shannon Cochran, Kate Fry) If so, where and when? Shannon and Kate, too, are some of my favorite artists working on the stage. Cher Álvarez in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Why did you decide to set the play in London, and why do the characters move there from Chicago? So, I was writing from much of my own experience. I also wanted to isolate the characters, give them no connections abroad. It's another version of a cabin in the woods. We don't have the luxury of doing that on stage since everything is done live and in the moment. So, we must capture the attention of the audience from moment to moment to make them feel what they are seeing is real, even if they don't believe their eyes. L–R: Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Does that “we” refer to illusions by Tony Award winner Chris Fisher (Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter & The Cursed Child) which will again haunt us long after leaving the theater? He's a brilliant engineer, making our nightmares materialize. I suspect people will talk about his work on this show for a very long time to come. How did the two of you work in collaboration with the entire production team, including Fly Davis (Scenic & Costume Designer), Anna Watson (Lighting Designer), Gareth Fry (Sound Designer), Luke Halls (Video & Projections Designer), and Melanie J. Lisby (Production Stage Manager) to make them happen realistically? We'd meet and throw ideas at the wall, laughing all the while, delighted by each other's messed up imaginations. It felt like kids in a treehouse, holding flashlights in the dark, never picking truth - always only dare. I can't say enough about them as people and artists and what this collaboration has meant to me. Who or what is on the stairs in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Please describe if and how cast members were frightened by any of the special effects the first time they took place in rehearsal. It's not easy, holding your body in a near constant state of tension and fear day after day. Even when you see how the sausage is made, it doesn't mean you want to eat it. Please allow me to change direction for a minute. As someone who also works with special needs actors in the theatre, tell me about your reasons behind co-founding the Neverbird Project, a youth based deaf and hard of hearing theatre company specializing in working with deaf children and creating theatre for deaf people. And are you still actively involved with the project? I spent nearly 20 years as an educator in Chicago, and a lot of that time was spent in Deaf classrooms. I saw the opportunity to give those young artists some work and took it. 90% of the plays I write feature a Deaf character. I plan for that to always be the case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With everyone having Google in their pocket at all times, we'd finally have reached a point where we could put this whole urban legend thing behind us. But lo and behold, here we are in 2025 with people still thinking that Steve from Blue's Clues died from a heroin overdose decades ago. Don't even get us started with Little Mikey from the Life cereal commercials dying from a fatal mixture of Pop Rocks and Coke. Both of them are alive and well, by the way—the last we checked, at least. Texas stand-up hero Bill Hicks died in 1994 at just 32 years old after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer. Well, some would have you believe that Hicks didn't actually die all those years ago, and that he went on to become infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. How do the people who proposed this theory account for Hicks and Jones having wildly different ideologies? Josh Saviano, the actual actor who played Paul, first heard the rumor from his The Wonder Years co-star Danica McKellar when he was in college, and they've both been asked about it ad nauseam ever since. Saviano didn't even know who Manson (whose real name is Brian Warner) was at the time, but hoped to one day get onstage at one of his concerts and put the rumor to bed for good. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro was the subject of a persistent rumor following his appearance in a Pepsi commercial with Michael Jackson back in 1984. And although newspapers tried to dispel the rumors, people would still come up to him on the street and ask how he was alive. Apparently, they think he's supposed to be dead, which, of course, can't be true because he's still on TV to this day; and don't you dare try to convince us that Bill Hicks has been hosting America's Funniest Home Videos this whole time. Well-known prankster Andy Kaufman, like Bill Hicks, passed away from cancer in his 30s. Kaufman's brother, Michael, even helped keep the idea of the hoax alive when he brought a woman on stage in 2013 who said that she was Andy's daughter and that her comedian father really had faked his death.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seehorn leads the new Apple TV+ series from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul  creator Vince Gilligan, which sees Earth's population afflicted with a mysterious virus. Entertainment Weekly has an exclusive look at the mystery's beginnings with a sneak peek of the first four minutes of the sci-fi series, which feature a group of people trying to decode a very interesting signal from ... somewhere. And perhaps most importantly, it's coming from 600 lightyears away. Just as someone says, "I think I know what it is," the series' title card appears. Although Gilligan certainly made a name for himself in more recent years with his beloved dramas, a sci-fi series isn't new to the former X-Files writer — though the premise of Earth's most miserable person having to save humanity from happiness certainly is. Seehorn's Carol is the aforementioned miserable person, a best-selling author of historical romance novels, whose life is turned upside down when a virus sweeps the planet. As maybe the only person immune to said virus, Carol is left with a lot of questions. “The drama of the show is that the world's most miserable person is desperately trying to save the planet from happiness,” Gilligan previously told EW, later adding, “She doesn't really want to be tasked with saving the world, but she more or less feels like it's her duty.” Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter. Gilligan created the show specifically with Seehorn in mind, whom he'd worked with across six seasons of Saul. “Initially I was thinking in terms of a male protagonist because that's how I think, being a guy,” he said. “But then I thought, well, what about Rhea?

Astronauts could soon be able to move with greater ease, thanks to a soft robotic exosuit developed by researchers at the University of Bristol.Not only does the technology have extraterrestrial benefits, but it could also help people who need support with their mobility on earth, too. Worn underneath the spacesuit, the exosuit features artificial muscles that work automatically to help astronauts reduce muscular fatigue while maintaining natural movements during future Moon and Mars missions. Here, the exosuit was tested as part of an international ‘proof of concept' simulated space mission run by the Austrian Space Forum.Dubbed the ‘World's Biggest Analog', the mission saw 200 scientists from 25 countries working together on different experiments and operational simulations across four continents and reporting back to the mission control base in Austria. The experiments evaluated comfort, mobility and biomechanical effects when performing planetary surface tasks ,such as walking, climbing and load-carrying on loose terrain. “Fortunately, my grandmother worked as a tailor and she was able to give me some advice,” Dr Pulvirenti said. The artificial muscles in the suit consist of two layers: an outer nylon layer and an inner thermoplastic layer that allows airtight inflation.The anchoring components, such as the waistband and knee straps, are made from Kevlar for high strength and tension resistance. Dr Pulvirenti said: “The hope is that this technology could pave the way for future wearable robotic systems that enhance astronaut performance and reduce fatigue during extra-vehicular surface activities. “I would love to continue developing this technology so that it could eventually be tested at the International Space Station.” “It's exciting that this technology could also potentially benefit people too,” Dr Pulvirenti continued. “This exosuit is assistive, meaning it artificially boosts the lower-limb muscles, but we have also separately developed a resistive exosuit, which applies load to the body to help maintain muscle mass. “Our next goal is to create a hybrid suit that can switch between assistance and resistance modes as needed, which could be of great benefit for people in need of support with mobility going through physical rehabilitation.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrity medium Anthony Mrocka started as a skeptic, including toward his first mentor, who spotted him at a free public event and offered to help him. Once you start paying attention, you'll probably notice some weird things start happening, weird things Mrocka told Andrea Miller on the Getting Open podcast. Halfway through the episode, Miller admits that after meeting Mrocka, even her brilliant skeptic husband was blown away. He also believes everyone is a little psychic, in some ways, and shares how to tap into those "magical" talents. You have to open your mind to your own abilities and what may not be as conventional as you have previously thought. We talk about intuition, gut feelings, sixth senses, and other terms for what can also be seen as psychic abilities. Everything is made of energy, protons, electrons, neutrons, atoms, and molecules. RELATED: My Mother Was Dying — So I Called A Psychic Silence will tune you in to your energy, and all the energy around you, all the vibrations, all the molecules and atoms caught in their kinetic dance. To find silence, you can quiet your mind through meditation, listening to word-free music, or being still for a set period of time. It's not sitting there for hours, chanting, or following a checklist. Mediation is about learning to quiet your mind. Research shows that it benefits many areas of your health, well-being and success, possibly by allowing our busy brains to rest and recover. RELATED: The Art Of Calm: 3 Grounding Habits That Quiet Your Mind Fast Listen to what you hear or sense when you walk into a room or start talking to a person. Mrocka met strangers, a few of whom he was immediately able to sense their backstory and the struggle they were carrying. He was able to sense their energy by being open to it and letting it flow through him. That is energy, we are that energy, so pay attention, and you can read it and understand it. In order to read and understand the energy around us, within ourselves, and inside other people is by practice. Mrocka would watch reality competition shows and practice reading the contestants to see who might be eliminated next. Spoiler alert: he got really good at it and could ruin the suspense for anyone who watched the shows with him. He suggests doing the same with sports or whatever you're interested in, simply for a fun way to hone your skills. RELATED: The Art Of Inner Light: 20 Signs You Were Born To Be A Spiritual Healer Establish your ethics around when and who you try to read. As Mrocka cautions, "It's so apparent to me how inextricably connected we all are through our energy, and the conduit is hugely in our emotions." Mrocka told Miller how, at the beginning, it wasn't going around purposely trying to tune into people. When he would walk by these people and immediately understand everything about them, it was part of his awakening. RELATED: 5 Questions To Ask Yourself Before You See A Psychic Or Medium Realize you've taken on other people's energy, so it is important to have some sort of self-protection. Mrockas says, "Grounding is always going to be the easiest number one way. Just going and putting your bare feet onto the grass somewhere. The other thing is Epsom salt baths. That's why the ocean is so cleansing." It's easy to be a skeptic, but there's no real risk in being open to your own sensitivities, even if you don't believe they're psychic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Riley Keough will soon be honoring her mom's third anniversary since she passed on January 12, 2023. But just because she is no longer on earth, doesn't mean she no longer has moments where she feels connected to her in unexplainable ways - especially since she cowrote her memoir, From Here to the Great Unknown. “I think if you're open to those things, they're kind of everywhere,” Keough told PEOPLE. “So, I certainly feel connected to whatever that world may be. I do feel connected to it, yeah. There are certainly moments that are very... too weird to not be something,” the Daisy Jones & The Six star shared. It's not the first time Riley has had an experience, and it's something she seems to have gotten from her mother. Lisa Marie, the only child of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, was only nine when her famous father passed away. "I'm apprehensive to say this because the headlines can be crazy, but she did have like a thing where she felt connected to… she was very intuitive,” Riley told Drew Barrymore in 2024. “And in a way that wasn't like woo-woo, or, you know, in the clouds—it was very kind of grounded and matter-of-fact. And it was pretty incredible," she continued. She was on an airplane, trying to reach her mom, texting her dad, musician Danny Keough, when she sensed that “her mom was departing earth,” as Barrymore described it. There had been incidents before—health incidents—and I didn't have the same feeling. I felt this sort of surrender in the moment, and yeah, I just had a little bit of a sense,” she said. Riley even texted her dad to ask if she was gone, and he replied, "Yes, 2 or 3 minutes ago."
