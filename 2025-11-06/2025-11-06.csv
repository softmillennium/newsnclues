            A palliative nurse was convicted on Wednesday of the murder of 10 patients with lethal injections and the attempted murder of 27 others and was handed a life sentence by a German court.
    


            Prosecutors had argued that the nurse injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives to ease his workload at night.
    


            The crime was found to be particularly severe, said a spokesperson for the court in Aachen, meaning the nurse has little chance of being released after 15 years, the minimum time that can be served for a life sentence in Germany.
    


            The nurse committed the crimes between December 2023 and May 2024 in a clinic near Aachen in western Germany.
    


            The verdict can be appealed.
    


            Investigators are looking at several other suspicious incidents during the nurse's career, German media reported.
    


            In the worst killing spree in Germany's post-war history, a former nurse was jailed in 2019 for life for murdering 85 of his patients.

            Typhoon Kalmaegi made landfall in central Vietnam late Thursday after killing more than 100 people in the Philippines and cutting a path of destruction.
    


            Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons on record to hit Vietnam, was expected to bring heavy rainfall to an area already saturated by heavy rains last week, raising fears of flash floods as well as damaging winds.
    


            It left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines this week, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 114 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.
    


            The typhoon strengthened as it barrelled towards the coast of Vietnam Thursday, carrying maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed.
    


            Scientists have long warned the human-induced climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.
    


            In the Philippines, survivors have begun the mammoth task of salvaging belongings and digging through the thick mud and debris of their destroyed homes, as the receding floodwaters expose widespread devastation.
    


            Another tropical storm Fung-Wong – or Uwan locally – is expected to intensify and could become a dangerous Category 3 or 4 over the weekend, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, threatening more flooding and damage to the northern portions of the Philippines' Luzon Island.
    


            Here's what to know:
    


            The scale of the disaster in the hardest-hit Cebu province and surrounding areas took residents and local officials by surprise.
    


            Drone footage showed catastrophic flooding that turned streets into rivers, submerged homes and overturned cars as Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, dumped more than a month's worth of rain in only 24 hours in some areas.
    


            In Talisay city, rows of homes were flattened and communities along the Mananga River were buried in mud and debris. In Cebu city, and rescue workers could be seen wading through waist-deep water to free trapped residents from roofs and submerged homes.
    


            “We don't have any home anymore. We weren't able to salvage anything from our house,” Mely Saberon, 52, from Talisay told Reuters news agency. “We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons, but this one was different. Our homes were gone.”
    


            Another survivor in Cebu city said the floodwaters “quickly rushed in” and they had no time to gather belongings.
    


            “I've been living here for almost 16 years and it was the first time I've experienced the flooding,” said Marlon Enriquez, 58.
    


            Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday declared a state of national calamity and promised to continued relief and response operations.
    


            The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons and Kalmaegi was the 20th named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.
    


            Though not the strongest storm to hit, it was slow-moving and dumped huge volumes of water over highly populated areas. Officials said most people died from drowning.
    


            Nearby Leyte and northern parts of Mindanao, both populous islands in the center of the country, saw between 150 and 250 mm (6 to 10 inches) of rain in only 24 hours — well above the typical monthly rainfall for November.
    


            On Cebu, the rugged terrain funnelled water straight into communities that lack sufficient drainage.
    


            “Wind speed is often what the public focuses on and it is in fact how meteorologists categorize these systems, but water is almost always the no. 1 killer,” said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.
    


            The impact of the storm was worsened by clogged waterways in an already flood-prone area, and an apparent lack of understanding of early warnings, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV, deputy administrator for the Philippines Office of Civil Defense told local media.
    


            “We need to check how we issue our early warnings and translate it into actions,” he said
    


            Alejandro also called for the building of better and bigger drainage systems and resilient infrastructure that can withstand the threats of more intense storms fueled by climate change.
    


            “We need to rethink how we build our megacities and improve on our resiliency,” he added.
    


            The Philippines is one of Asia's most flood-prone countries but this year it has also been mired in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects that have brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets.
    


            Dozens of legislators, senators and construction companies have been accused of receiving kickbacks with money that was supposed to go toward establishing thousands of flood control projects.
    


            Kalmaegi will weaken to a tropical storm as it tracks farther inland from central Vietnam before moving on to northern Cambodia, Laos and eastern Thailand through Friday, local time.
    


            Around 350,000 people were expected to be evacuated from central Vietnam's Gia Lai province, according to Reuters.
    


            The typhoon comes as the region struggles to recover from devastating flooding last week that submerged historical sites including the ancient town of Hoi An.
    


            At least 13 people were killed and over 116,000 houses and 5,000 hectares of crops flooded, Reuters reported, citing the government's disaster agency. Roads and railways were damaged and power disrupted in several areas.
    


            Usually packed with tourists wandering through the lantern-lit streets lined with iconic wooden houses and bustling markets, images showed the UNESCO World Heritage listed Hoi An submerged in water and mud after record rainfall.
    


            The western Pacific is the most active tropical basin on Earth but global ocean temperatures have been at record levels for each of the last eight years.
    


            Hotter oceans, fueled by human-caused global warming, provide ample energy for storms to strengthen.
    


            The climate crisis is supercharging rainfall events – like those seen in Vietnam and with Typhoon Kalmaegi – as warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities.
    


            In September, Typhoon Ragasa brought destructive winds and torrential rain to the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China as the strongest storm in the region this year.

US President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to restart nuclear testing, following Washington's launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already warned of “appropriate retaliatory measures” should the US breach a moratorium on nuclear tests.

Trump last week ordered the US Department of War to commence preparations for nuclear testing “immediately.”

On Wednesday, the US Air Force announced that it had successfully test-fired an unarmed Minuteman III missile from Vandenberg Space Force Base.

“Because of other countries' testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said in a video shared on Truth Social later in the day.

The video statement appeared to be AI-generated and repeated word-for-word the text of Trump's post from last week, including the iconic sign-off: “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

It remains unclear whether it was posted by the president himself or one of his aides, as the White House declined to comment, citing staff shortages linked to the ongoing government shutdown. 

Several clips shared at around the same time featured an identical background and similarly rehashed unrelated past statements.

Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov said earlier in the day that Moscow “must respond to Washington's steps” and “start preparing for full-scale nuclear tests immediately.” Putin, however, indicated that such a move was premature as long as Washington abides by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

In the meantime, the Russian president instructed all relevant government agencies to analyze US plans and submit proposals on “the possible commencement of work on preparing for nuclear weapons tests.”

Trump's announcement followed Russia's recent weapons trials, including the launch of the new Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone. However, neither of those tests involved actual nuclear detonations.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified on Sunday that the testing ordered by Trump would not involve live nuclear explosions, describing the planned “non-critical tests” as part of a broader modernization program.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was informed in advance about the latest Minuteman III launch. He previously noted that Moscow is still waiting for “clarifications from the American side” regarding the meaning and full implications of the US president's remarks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","South Africa doesn't belong in G20","https://www.rt.com/news/627414-trump-south-africa-g20/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:22:00 GMT","

US President Donald Trump has blasted South Africa, saying the country “shouldn't even be” a member of the G20, where it currently holds the rotating presidency.

During South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's visit to Washington in May, Trump accused his administration of tolerating a “genocide” of Afrikaners – descendants of Dutch settlers who dominated during the apartheid era.

Speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday, Trump said he would not attend the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg, arguing that South Africa “shouldn't even be in the ‘Gs' anymore because what's happened there is bad.”

“I told them I'm not going. I'm not going to represent our country there,” Trump added.

At Wednesday's forum, Trump also described Miami as a “haven for those fleeing communist tyranny in South Africa,” adding that more people would soon arrive “fleeing communism in New York City,” where Zohran Mamdani, a socialist politician and critic of Trump, was elected mayor this week.

Trump's rebuke apparently referred to immigrants from socialist nations in South America – a region he blasted during the same remarks – many of whom have settled in Florida.

The US leader regularly voices various grudges against nations in the Global South. He previously accused Mexico of “sending criminals” to America, criticized Brazil for prosecuting right-wing former President Jair Bolsonaro on charges of plotting a coup, and denounced Colombian President Gustavo Petro for allegedly being involved in the drug trade.

The G20 was founded in 1999 to accommodate non-Western nations that were gaining economic power. Supporters view it as more representative than the G7 group, which includes only the US and its allies.

Kiev's controversial conscription crews illegally attempted to enlist a group of ethnic Hungarian students in Ukraine's western Transcarpathia Region, Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, has said.

Ukrainian draft officers reportedly deceived four students at the Ferenc Rakoczi II Transcarpathian Hungarian University in the town of Beregovo, where a significant ethnic minority is based, into presenting at a local recruitment center.

The students were reportedly forcefully held at the facility and faced pressure to join the military.

Szijjarto later said in a Facebook post that the students had eventually been released.

The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has been in constant contact with the Transcarpathian Hungarian Cultural Association, which represents an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 ethnic Hungarians in the region, and the administration of the university, he added.

“The Ukrainian legislation is clear: these students are exempt from conscription,” Szijjarto noted.

The fact that the four men avoided illegal mobilization is “good news, but at the same time, it again stresses the importance of peace” between Russia and Ukraine, the diplomat said.

“The sooner there is peace, the sooner this conscription will stop,” Szijjarto stressed.

The regional Territorial Center of Recruitment and Social Support (TSR) issued a statement on Thursday, saying that claims of the students being detained were “untrue and manipulative.” The men had been summoned to confirm their personal data, but it turned out that three of them had not undergone the obligatory medical examination, it said. The ethnic Hungarians left the recruitment center as soon as the checkups were completed, according to the statement.

Budapest had already criticized the harsh recruitment drive launched by Kiev in response to manpower shortages and military setbacks on the front line. In September, Szijjarto described it as an “open manhunt,” during which people “are often beaten, in some cases beaten to death.”

The Hungarian foreign minister previously said the “very bad bilateral relations” between Kiev and Budapest have nothing to do with the Ukraine conflict but stem from “about ten years ago when the Ukrainian government began violating the rights of national minorities,” including restricting the use of non-Ukrainian languages in education and public life.

MOSCOW, November 6. /TASS/. It is important to clearly understand Russia's intentions, which currently involve assessing whether preparations for nuclear tests are necessary rather than actually beginning them, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a TASS question on whether the presidential administration shares the view that the world is closer to nuclear war today than during the Caribbean crisis.

""President [Vladimir] Putin reiterated that Russia remains committed to all its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We remain faithful to our undertakings. However, given everything that the participants in the Security Council's operational meeting said at the beginning of the session, Putin has instructed to assess whether it is necessary to begin preparations,"" Peskov said.

""Thus, we are not starting preparations right now; we are first trying to figure out whether we need to start them, given what we are hearing from the United States.

MOSCOW, November 6. /TASS/. Russia responds to Trump's statements about resuming nuclear tests by signaling it may do the same; Canada moves forward with legislation to seize Russia's sovereign assets; and Russia and the US see surge in trade under Trump. These stories topped Thursday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

At a meeting of the Security Council on Wednesday, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin drew President Vladimir Putin's attention to the statement made by US President Donald Trump on October 30, in which Trump instructed the Pentagon to ""immediately"" prepare for conducting nuclear tests so as not to fall behind China and Russia. A discussion ensued, ending with Putin ordering that the issue of a potential US resumption of nuclear weapons testing be examined and analyzed. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that if the US resumes nuclear testing, it will pave the way for Russia, China, and others to do the same, seriously weakening global non-proliferation efforts. Russia, for its part, has indicated that it won't just stand pat amid the US moves.

Hearing the statements coming out of Washington, the Russian authorities feel they need to show that they are ready to act symmetrically, research fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Alexander Ermakov told the newspaper. The length of time it would take Russia to prepare for nuclear tests depends on the condition of the test site, which is not publicly disclosed. However, most likely, the timeframe would be several months.

If Washington resumes nuclear testing first, it will effectively give Moscow, Beijing, and other states the go-ahead to follow suit, Director of the Center for Military-Economic Studies at the Institute of Global Military Economics and Strategy Prokhor Tebin told Vedomosti. If that happens, it would be a serious blow to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and to international security. ""All the more so since the Russian side is demonstrating that, in practice, everything needed for testing is already in place,"" he added.

Russia is currently signaling its willingness to up the nuclear ante, but it should be noted that it's the US that sent things in this direction, Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics Dmitry Suslov believes.

According to the expert, there are two ways the United States could go now that Russia has made its position clear. The first and more reasonable option would be to accept Russia's proposal to maintain for another year the quantitative limits outlined in the New START Treaty, refrain from escalatory steps such as resuming nuclear testing or conducting exercises simulating preemptive strikes against Russia, and instead begin a dialogue on arms limitation and strategic stability under new conditions. The second path, Suslov continued, is escalatory: rejecting Russia's proposal, issuing unfounded accusations of alleged covert nuclear testing by Russia and China, and resuming US nuclear tests.

 

The Canadian Senate is officially considering a bill on the seizure of Russia's sovereign assets, Russian Ambassador to Ottawa Oleg Stepanov told Izvestia. According to him, Canada will continue coordinating its approach with Brussels and may share its legislative blueprint for asset confiscation. Within the European Union, there is no consensus on using Russian assets to fund a loan to Ukraine, with Belgium, France, and Italy opposing the measure. In the coming days, representatives of the European Commission intend to turn Belgium, while the other EU nations have been given two options by Brussels: confiscate Russia's assets or fund Kiev out of their own national budgets. Russia has already prepared a package of countermeasures should the decision to confiscate assets be adopted, Stepanov emphasized.

""Canada is leading the charge on the issue of confiscating Russian assets and is itself able to share what it comes up with with the Europeans. In particular, it has devised unilateral legal mechanisms through domestic legislation that allow it to seize foreign private property. At present, the Canadian Senate has resumed consideration of the bill on seizing sovereign funds. Ottawa will undoubtedly continue coordinating its approach with Brussels,"" the diplomat told Izvestia.

""There should be no particular difficulties in moving such a legislative initiative through both houses of the Canadian parliament. This is more of a technical procedural matter. It now depends on the political decision of Prime Minister Mark Carney's government,"" Evgeny Khoroshilov, head of the Economic Research Department at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Izvestia.

Georgy Ostapkovich, Director of the Center for Market Research at the Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge at the Higher School of Economics, told Izvestia that, so far, the only country to take specific steps toward confiscation has been Estonia. However, the consequences of Canada adopting such a law would be significant.

""This would lead to lawsuits that will drag on for years. Moreover, Russia will almost certainly take reciprocal measures,"" the expert explained.

Ostapkovich believes that while the formal confiscation of the assets themselves is still unlikely, their return is also improbable for at least the next ten years. ""The West will delay that moment, using the interest generated by these funds,"" he said.

 

Trade between the United States and Russia could double under Donald Trump's administration to $6-8 bln, according to experts interviewed by Izvestia. In the first half of 2025 alone, bilateral turnover increased by nearly one-third, reaching $2.8 bln. The primary reason is the United States' active purchases of Russian fertilizers, enriched uranium, and platinum. Nevertheless, mutual trade with Washington still remains low compared with Russia's other key partners, including China and the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition, the situation is complicated by new US sanctions targeting Russian oil companies.

Overall, Trump's election has brought a moderate sense of optimism to US-Russian relations, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Economics of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia Sergey Zaynullin told Izvestia. In particular, during the first half of 2025, bilateral trade hit $2.8 bln, a relatively modest amount, but still a notable one-third uptick. Most of that amount, $2.5 bln, consists of Russian exports to the United States, the expert noted.

Still, the specialists interviewed by Izvestia expect that by the end of 2025, the volume of trade will grow by 1.5-2 times to $6-8 bln. This expansion could be driven by US purchases of Russian-made fertilizers, enriched uranium, and platinum, Senior Analyst at AMarkets Igor Rastorguev noted. Some experts offered more conservative estimates: according to Freedom Finance Global analyst Vladimir Chernov, turnover may reach $4.8-5.6 bln. Meanwhile, independent expert Andrey Barkhota believes the figure will be in the range of $6.3-6.8 bln.

Meanwhile, the Russian ruble has strengthened by nearly 20% over the past year. On November 2, 2024, the dollar was trading at 97.4 rubles. Fast forward to the beginning of November this year and it was significantly lower at around 80.9 rubles per dollar, according to the Bank of Russia's exchange rate. One factor behind this fluctuation has been political signals from Washington. According to analysts interviewed by Izvestia, the dollar may trade at roughly 85-88 rubles by year's end.

At the same time, the United States' foreign economic strategy of trade wars and sanctions continues to negatively affect Russia, Acting Chair of the Department of Global Financial Markets and FinTech at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics Svetlana Frumina told the newspaper. According to her, increasing trade barriers and expanding export controls are reshaping trade flows and creating less favorable conditions for Russian exports.

 

In its latest report, the European Commission again noted progress made by Ukraine toward its goal of joining the European Union, including the adoption of plans to ensure key principles and the rule of law. In reality, however, Kiev has continued to disregard these declared principles, which has caused dysfunction within the Ukrainian judicial system, as acknowledged by domestic analysts, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Brussels is painting a pretty picture in order to maintain an overall favorable narrative, though it recognizes that Ukraine's EU accession is still decades away, experts emphasized.

In its report, the European Commission stated that, along with other candidate countries such as Moldova, Montenegro, and Albania, Ukraine had made the most progress in reforms over the past year. The Ukrainian government has declared its intention to complete accession negotiations with the EU by the end of 2028. Yet achieving this ambitious goal will require accelerating reforms in fundamental areas, particularly concerning the rule of law, the Commission indicated.

""It is clear that for the leadership of the European Commission, it is important today to ensure at least the appearance of support for Ukraine by a majority of EU member states. To do that, the talk needs to stay positive - for example, regarding the prospects of future enlargement,"" Professor at the Department of European Studies at the Faculty of International Relations of St. Petersburg State University Stanislav Tkachenko told the newspaper.

Meanwhile, in a statement posted on social media on Wednesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban once again reminded that decisions regarding EU enlargement can only be made with the consent of all member states. Budapest will not support Ukraine's accession to the EU, he said, because doing so would risk bringing the military conflict with Russia onto European territory.

Amid all this, US President Donald Trump could move Hungary off its position, that is, if he wants to, analysts at the US think tank Atlantic Council suggested. They noted that during his upcoming visit to Washington, Orban will likely attempt to secure exemptions from recently introduced US sanctions on Russian oil companies. Trump could use this as leverage to press Orban to stop blocking Ukraine's accession process, the analysts suggested.

However, Tkachenko believes that Trump is unlikely to exert pressure on Budapest to support any EU-backed plans. Rather, the US president will likely acknowledge the legitimacy of Orban's request, given that the Hungarian leader represents pro-Trump forces in Europe, which are now on the rise.

 

After two years of voluntary output cuts under the OPEC+ framework, Russia's oil production is recovering, Kommersant writes. Analysts forecast that by the end of 2025 it will return to a level close to last year's - exceeding 9.5 mln barrels per day. However, due to slowing global demand and the potential for declining oil prices, the prospects for production growth in 2026 remain uncertain.

According to a report by Euler analysts, Russia's oil output in 2025 will exceed 9.5 mln barrels per day (bpd), which is close to the previous year's figure. In their assessment, output in the second half of the year will increase by 5.3%, or 322,000 bpd, compared with the first half, due to the lifting of voluntary OPEC+ restrictions. As a result, the average production volume will remain at last year's level.

In 2026, Euler estimates that if all voluntary OPEC+ limits are removed, Russia's production could reach 9.7 mln bpd. The main risks, analysts warned, stem from a sharp drop in oil prices caused by weakening demand and, consequently, renewed supply constraints imposed by OPEC+.

According to energy expert Kirill Rodionov, one of the factors limiting production growth is the structure of Russia's well stock: unlike the Middle East, Russia has a relatively small share of free-flowing wells capable of rapidly increasing output. Maxim Malkov, partner at Kept, added that the marginal cost of producing an additional barrel often rises, forcing producers to focus on cost optimization and profitability rather than expanding volumes.

Managing Partner at Kasatkin Consulting Dmitry Kasatkin estimates that Russia retains the potential to increase production by 1 mln bpd in 2026, despite constraining factors such as increasingly challenging extraction conditions, oil prices, the ruble exchange rate, the Bank of Russia's key rate, and labor shortages. He noted that competitive production costs remain a key advantage that allows Russia to offset these limitations. According to his forecast, in 2026 Russian oil will likely maintain a discount of around $10 to Brent, with Urals trading in the range of $55-65 per barrel.

Kevin Roberts, whose group pushed Project 2025, had defended ex-Fox News host's talk with Nick Fuentes

The leader of the conservative thinktank behind Project 2025 apologized for supporting a white nationalist amid turmoil on the right over the mainstreaming of extremist ideology, but is resisting calls to resign.

Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, previously defended the former Fox host Tucker Carlson for having Hitler fan Nick Fuentes on his podcast without pushing back on his white supremacist views.

In leaked footage of a Heritage town hall from Wednesday, staffers largely said Roberts's decision to align the thinktank with Fuentes was a mistake. “I made a mistake and I let you down and I let down this institution. Period. Full Stop,” he told Heritage staff.

He also claimed he “didn't know much” about Fuentes before he recorded a video and posted it on X in which he defended Carlson as a “close friend of the Heritage Foundation”. He said that a chief of staff, who has since resigned, wrote the video's script.

Some called for him to step down. Roberts, who holds a PhD in history and spearheaded the rightwing manifesto Project 2025, has moved the foundation into more of a Trumpian stance since he joined in 2021.

He has said he will not resign his position, writing on X: “I'm staying. I'm all in.”

The Washington Post reports that “at least” five members of an antisemitism taskforce at the organization have resigned in protest. One staffer in the internal meeting called the issue her “final straw”.

Roberts previously called those speaking out against Carlson a “venomous coalition”, a loaded phrase he subsequently said was a “terrible choice of words” that caused “justified concern” among those who worry about rising antisemitism.

Fuentes – who used to be ostracized by the mainstream right for his views, including support of Hitler and claims that Jews run the country – said on Carlson's podcast that “organized Jewry” held outsize influence and said he was a fan of Joseph Stalin. Fuentes's appearance on Carlson's podcast has roiled the right, with many seeing the interview as a further invitation of extremist views into mainstream conservatism.

Roberts said that, while supporting Carlson, he disagreed with and even “abhors” Fuentes's views. .

Roberts then wrote a detailed post on X explaining the depths of Fuentes's extremist views.

“Fuentes made grotesque analogies to try to cast doubt on the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust and has said ‘I think the Holocaust is exaggerated. I don't hate Hitler,'” Roberts wrote. “Fuentes called for the death penalty for ‘perfidious Jews' and other non-Christians, stating that ‘when we take power, they need to be given the death penalty.'

“Everyone has the responsibility to speak up against the scourge of antisemitism, no matter the messenger. Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging,” he said in a video posted on X.

During the Q&A portion of Wednesday's town hall, a longtime Heritage staffer identified by the Washington Free Beacon as Robert Rector recalled the conservative writer William F Buckley Jr's boundaries for the conservative movement: expunge all antisemitism and “expel the lunatics”.

“And we have them back now,” Rector said. “The issue here is Tucker Carlson … Tucker's show is like stepping into a lunatic asylum.”

A full video of the internal town hall was leaked to the press. Some at Heritage have said the culture of infighting and leaking to media has eroded people's ability to have difficult conversations.

Roberts has sought to cast the turmoil as a needed conversation: “Movements like ours are not weakened by adversity. We are sharpened by it. Let's take what we've learned. Let's recommit and, by all means, let's go win.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US government shutdown blamed for cuts from Friday, two weeks before busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period

US politics live – latest updates

New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines.

The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation's largest airports.

The Federal Administration Agency has said flights are being reduced to maintain safety during the ongoing federal government shutdown, now the longest recorded and with no sign of a resolution between Republicans and Democrats to end the federal budget standoff, now in its 37th day. 
  Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be canceled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium.

The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the US – including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be affected.

The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. The flights affected by these reductions are scheduled during the hours of 6am to 10pm.

The likely airspace shutdown comes two weeks before the Thanksgiving holiday – typically the busiest travel period of the year – and raises pressures on lawmakers to reach a deal to end the shutdown.

Air traffic controllers, already in short supply, have been working unpaid since 1 October, with many working mandatory overtime and others taking second jobs, according to Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, who said the cuts would be to “alleviate the pressure”.

“Many of the controllers said, ‘A lot of us can navigate missing one paycheck. Not everybody, but a lot of us can. None of us can manage missing two paychecks,'” Duffy said on Wednesday. He accused Democrats of being responsible for any “mass chaos” that ensues even though the shutdown is the result of both Republicans and Democrats refusing to agree to a deal.

In a statement, American Airlines said most customers would be unaffected and long-haul international travel would remain as scheduled, and that customers could change their flight or request a refund. “In the meantime, we continue to urge leaders in Washington to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown,” the statement said, adding thanks to “to the air traffic controllers, TSA officers, CBP officers and other federal employees who are working right now without pay”.

The agency's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is responsible for the scheduling and safety of more than 44,000 flights and more than 3 million airline passengers daily across more than 29m square miles of airspace.

The government shutdown has left shortages of up to 3,000 air traffic controllers, according to the administration, in addition to at least 11,000 more receiving zero wages despite being categorized as essential workers.

Bryan Bedford, the FAA administrator, said the flight reductions are intended to keep the airspace safe during the shutdown.

“I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” Bedford said. “We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.

“Our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. Reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations. This is not based on light airline travel locations. This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure,” Bedford added.

Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association president and CEO, said in a statement that the government shutdown was “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the US air travel experience”.

Aviation expert John Nance told ABC that regulators were “probably trying to do their best” to prevent any reduction in the margins of safety. “We're facing the potential of almost a shutdown of the national airspace … You cannot continue to operate this in a way that ignores the diminution of safety. This is an incredibly serious situation.”

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center. The figure, which is probably an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

During weekends from 1 January to 30 September, the average number of airport towers, regional control centers and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began, the average more than tripled, to 26.2 facilities.

Focus shifts to other states where Trump is pushing for redrawn districts as parties race to seize midterm advantage

California voters overwhelmingly approved a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year's midterm elections. Now, the focus will shift to other states, where Trump is pressuring Republican-led legislatures to redraw their districts. Democrats are racing to do the same in an all-out sprint to rejigger district lines ahead of next year's midterms.

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans passed a map that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress. The new California map neuters that effort by adding the same number of Democratic seats.

Republicans currently hold a razor-thin 219-214 majority in the US House. There is one Republican vacancy and one Democratic one.

Republicans in North Carolina and Missouri have already passed new maps that would add one Republican congressional district apiece in each state. In Missouri, however, a citizen-led initiative could block the new map from going into effect in 2026.

Democrats are poised to wipe out those gains by passing a new congressional map in Virginia, where they expanded their majority in the state legislature on Tuesday. That effort could add two to three more Democratic seats. After a court struck down Utah's congressional map for violating state constitutional provisions prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. Lawmakers put a new plan in place, which is still awaiting court approval, that added two competitive districts Democrats could win.

In Ohio, lawmakers were required to redraw the state's map this year because they could not pass a bipartisan plan after the 2020 census. In a somewhat surprising move, Republicans and Democrats on the redistricting commission reached a bipartisan compromise that put one Democrat in a competitive seat, and made one Democratic district much more Republican-friendly. There is an outside shot both Democrats could hang on to their seats next year, according to the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan and well-respected election analysis website.

Trump is also strongly pressuring Republicans in Indiana to redraw their map to target two Democratic seats in the state. The legislature is set to meet in December to consider redistricting, though it's unclear if Republicans have the votes to do so. Chris LaCivita, a co-manager of Trump's 2024 campaign, recently set up an outside group designed to pressure lawmakers on redistricting. “Now the real fun begins,” he posted on X.

In Kansas, a Republican effort to get rid of a Democratic district has also stalled as Republicans have failed to muster the votes for a special session on redistricting.

Republicans may still be able to pick up a significant number of seats in Florida. The GOP-controlled legislature has already convened a committee to work on the issue, and a state supreme court ruling earlier this year could give lawmakers more leeway to dismantle existing districts. A provision in the state constitution prohibits drawing districts for explicitly partisan reasons.

Beyond those states, the redistricting path forward remains unclear in many places. Democrats are not uniformly on board with scorched-earth tactics to redraw maps and gain every possible advantage in the redistricting wars. In Maryland, the Democratic president of the state senate, Bill Ferguson, said he opposed a redistricting effort to get rid of Maryland's lone Republican seat, saying it was too risky and could result in a court-ordered map that might be friendlier to Republicans than the one currently in place. Ferguson tweeted that Democratic wins in Virginia on Tuesday were evidence that Democrats could win without redistricting.

This drew a testy rebuke from L Louise Lucas, the president of the Virginia senate. “Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points. Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just embarassing [sic],” she posted on X on Wednesday.

The Maryland governor, Wes Moore, has also announced an advisory commission to gather input on maps. Any potential map would still have to go through the Maryland legislature. Democrats in Illinois are also tepid on redrawing their map to add more Democratic seats.

Beyond those states, there is still much uncertainty about the redistricting landscape before next year's midterms.

Democrats are suing over maps in New York and Wisconsin in hopes of having courts force those states to redraw districts to add more Democratic districts. It's unclear if those lawsuits will succeed at all or if they will force any action ahead of the midterm elections.

The US supreme court is considering whether to scrap a critical provision of the Voting Rights Act that protects the ability of minority voters to elect the candidate of their choice when certain conditions are met. It's unclear if the court will rule in time for the midterms, but getting rid of that protection could enable Republicans to gain about a dozen seats, according to a New York Times analysis.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Latest: 'She wasn't afraid of the bombs' — Kherson locals in awe over Angelina Jolie's visit

American actress Angelina Jolie visited medical staff, families, and volunteers in Kherson and Mykolaiv, the Legacy of War Foundation confirmed on Nov. 6.

During her visit, Jolie was shown how medical and educational institutions in Ukraine's southern front-line regions have been moved into reinforced underground spaces to continue their operations, according to a press release from the organization.

Jolie was also shown how netting has been placed above a number of roads in an effort to protect locals from near-daily targeting in Russian drone attacks. 

""The people of Mykolaiv and Kherson live with danger every day, but they refuse to give in. At a time when governments around the world are turning their backs on the protection of civilians, their strength, and their support for each other is humbling,"" Jolie said in a statement released by the Legacy of War Foundation.

""After nearly (four) years of conflict, exhaustion is visible, yet so too is determination. Families want safety, peace, and the chance to rebuild their lives. Diplomacy and the protection of civilians should not be allowed to fall away in a brutal contest of weapons and technology.""

The actress previously visited Ukraine in the spring of 2022.

Reports circulated that during Jolie's visit, a Ukrainian man from her entourage was detained by military enlistment officers.

Local outlet MykVisti confirmed with the regional military recruitment office in Mykolaiv that Jolie visited the premises. MykVisti added that a man traveling with Jolie, being a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue.

Those living in Ukraine's south have endured some of the deadliest Russian attacks in the nearly four years of full-scale war.

Kherson Oblast has been a front-line region since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian forces captured the regional capital, Kherson, in March 2022, but Ukrainian troops liberated the city later that year. 

Parts of the oblast remain under Russian occupation, and the civilian population of Kherson continues to face daily deadly attacks.

Ukrainian forces continue to stubbornly defend the pocket around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, despite relentless Russian assaults in and around the two cities, leading to an ever-increasing threat of encirclement. 

Over two weeks since Russian soldiers were filmed breaking into the urban area of the mining city in Donetsk Oblast en masse, the city has descended into a deep gray zone, in which the concept of territorial control is lost in a fog of chaotic movement. 

""The situation hasn't changed that much in Pokrovsk,"" a Ukrainian drone pilot fighting in the area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Kyiv Independent.

""It's a mess, with a bunch of our soldiers and a bunch of bastards and all of them mixed together.""

With more and more Russian forces flowing into Pokrovsk, after Ukrainian lines on the southern outskirts of the city quickly disintegrated, reversing the situation with large-scale clearing operations looks to be an increasingly impossible task.

Meanwhile, for the neighboring industrial city of Myrnohrad, which the brigades deployed that have continued to hold despite an ever-worsening logistical nightmare, the threat of encirclement has only increased.

As of Nov. 6, most of the urban area of Pokrovsk remains in a contested ""gray zone"" according to most open-source battlefield maps, including the Deep State map, widely trusted in Ukraine. 

Although both the gray zone and the areas assessed as firmly under Russian control have expanded over the past week, Ukrainian positions are still present inside the city, intermixing and overlapping with streets and buildings taken by Russian soldiers.

Ultimately, because of the nature of the fight in the city, talk of an encirclement of Pokrovsk itself is inaccurate, Deep State co-founder Roman Pohorilyi, said.

""Logistics are the most important thing here, because they are what defines an encirclement, which bloggers and analysts try to determine,"" he said.

""But in reality, Pokrovsk is simply being absorbed; enemy soldiers are seeping in and setting up positions.""

As Russia's small assault and infiltration groups continue to move north through Pokrovsk and beyond, the lack of a stable Ukrainian line of defense makes Ukrainian drone teams increasingly vulnerable to being assaulted and caught in firefights themselves. 

This, said the drone pilot, disrupts their ability to focus on their own work, which is crucial for maintaining the kill zone that slows, if not stops, Russian advances. 

The Ukrainian defense is also hampered by Russian drone strikes on logistics further back in the rear, with dozens of drone teams from Russia's elite Rubicon school deployed to the front-line hotspot.

""Thirty days ago, at an intersection on our way to positions, there was only one of our destroyed cars there, close to the enemy,"" Artem Fysun, a member of the Peaky Blinders drone unit, redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in summer, told the Kyiv Independent.

""When I left the position, there were up to a dozen of our cars; in such a short period of time, in less than a month, the enemy has already destroyed a significant amount of our equipment.""

With winter and the cooldown of fighting that will likely come with it just around the corner, the battle of Pokrovsk has taken on a clear political significance, with both Ukraine and Russia keen to round off the year's campaign with a major success story. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin's premature claim on Oct. 29 that Pokrovsk — as well as Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast — was already surrounded by Russian forces of the importance placed on the capture of Pokrovsk by Moscow.

Meanwhile, as he has done with front-line flashpoints throughout the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Ukrainian commanders in the Pokrovsk area entrenched the ""fortress"" mentality that had characterized the defenses of other Donetsk Oblast cities, especially Bakhmut and Avdiivka. 

But just like with those cities, the near-encirclement of the Pokrovsk pocket by Russian forces has also led to sharp criticism within Ukraine of the decision to defend the city at all costs.

""If someone does not sign an order to withdraw troops from Pokrovsk and Myrnhohrad in the near future, we may find ourselves in a situation where we will not only lose a significant number of highly motivated paratroopers and marines,"" journalist and volunteer Vitalii Deineha, co-founder of the Come Back Alive fund, wrote on Facebook.

""We may find ourselves in a situation where there is no one to patch the hole in the front, and the fortifications dug in our rear will quickly fall to the enemy.""

With less than five kilometers of drone-infested fields north of Pokrovsk left connecting Myrnohrad and the surrounding area, logistics into the pocket has become increasingly fraught.

One Ukrainian battalion commander, who also spoke to the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity due to the unsanctioned nature of his comments, said that during recent rotations, his infantrymen came into direct firefights with Russian soldiers on several occasions. 

According to the commander, the density of Russian drones and mines is so high in the area that no vehicles are able to pass through the corridor, and even unmanned ground vehicles — often used in such conditions — usually don't survive the trip.

On top of the political importance attached by Kyiv to holding Pokrovsk, the reluctance to save lives by ordering a timely withdrawal is linked to the systemic culture of ""not one step back,"" commonly associated with the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

This, together with the associated problem of false reporting of tactical developments up the command chain, threaten to facilitate an optimistic narrative among the military and political leadership while the situation continues to deteriorate on the ground. 

""The reports of the General Staff sent upwards are made up of more and more lies every day,"" Deineha wrote. 

""In fact, we have practically lost Pokrovsk, which means that there is no point in holding Myrnohrad either. We must acknowledge this, and work to save those who refuse to leave without an order.""

For as long as the Russian pincers fail to properly close, the Pokrovsk pocket — i.e. Myrnohrad and the surrounding area — continues to hold.

In the meantime, on top of the visits of Zelensky and Syrskyi to the front, Ukrainian forces have carried out a couple of flashy operations to let the nation know that the fight is not lost. 

On Oct. 31, reportedly under the personal command of General Kyrylo Budanov, Ukrainian special forces of the country's military intelligence (HUR) landed a Black Hawk helicopter under cover of darkness near Pokrovsk.

Further details of the mission, from its objective to its outcome, were not disclosed, but at the scale the landing carried out at — reportedly two special forces platoons — it was not a force capable of clearing a large urban area like Pokrovsk.

The next week on Nov. 6, the Skelia Assault Regiment, one of the largest units of the controversial new Assault Forces, published a video showing the planting of the Ukrainian flag above the city council building of the city.

Typical of a practice of ""flag-raising"" carried out by both sides along Ukraine's increasingly porous front line, the mission, while proving briefly that central Pokrovsk was not fully under Russian control, is a far cry from any evidence of a successful Ukrainian clearing of the city.

Hi, this is Francis Farrell, cheers for reading this article.

For Kherson journalist Yevheniia Virlych, “difficult” doesn't begin to describe day-to-day life in her city — “critical” is closer to the mark. So when American actress Angelina Jolie visited Kherson on Nov. 5, she and other local residents began to hope the world might finally look closer at how Russia is terrorizing them.

“Thanks to the fact that a star of truly global stature — someone with influence and media recognition — has seen the city's realities firsthand, Kherson residents received a ray of hope: maybe Angelina Jolie can use her influence to help the city somehow,” Virlich told the Kyiv Independent.

If Jolie continues to speak out about what she witnessed in the front-line city firsthand, that could help with the delivery of relief aid, according to Virlich and others.

On Nov. 5, Jolie traveled with the UK-based Legacy of War Foundation to Ukraine's front-line Kherson and Mykolaiv regions in the south, visiting schools and hospitals that have been forced underground to continue functioning despite constant Russian attacks.

Jolie's visit caused a stir not only in Kherson but across Ukraine, with people eager to learn more about the reasons behind her visit to one of the most dangerous parts of the country.

There was also speculation after a Ukrainian man in Jolie's entourage was reportedly detained by military enlistment officers, but local media confirmed that the man, a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue.

The situation in Kherson has remained fraught since the earliest days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces captured most of Kherson Oblast, including its capital, in the early spring of 2022, occupying it until a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive forced their retreat later that November.

While the city of Kherson was liberated from Russian occupation, the Dnipro River now marks a tense front line for the region, dividing Ukrainian-controlled territory on the western bank from Russian-occupied areas to the east.

Day-to-day life in Kherson unfolds under constant threat with Russian forces positioned just across the river. Kherson faces more than relentless shelling, though — Russian forces are increasingly using FPV drones to hunt civilians in what they call a “human safari.”

“Every month, we have dozens of civilians killed and hundreds wounded. Residential buildings, hospitals, museums, ambulances, and rescue workers have all become targets for almost every kind of weapon,” local historian Dementii Belii told the Kyiv Independent.

“Lately, Russian forces have also been trying to block the only main highway that brings food, goods, and people into Kherson. Kherson residents live in these nightmarish conditions every day.”

Given the dangers of visiting Kherson today, Jolie's trip meant a lot more than words of support from afar for some locals — in a country where even safer areas can feel distant from their reality, it reminded them that they were not alone.

“Many people in Kherson feel that the authorities, society, and even Ukraine have forgotten them — that no one is paying attention to the city's suffering and the citizens' problems. These thoughts undermine people's strength and their hope for survival,” Belii said.

“That's why people here deeply respect the courage of Angelina Jolie, because she was not afraid to come under bombs and shelling to support the people of Kherson.”

Pipelines at Canadian Natural Resources' Primrose Lake oil sands project near Cold Lake, Alta., in 2023.Dan Riedlhuber/Reuters

Canadian Natural Resources CNQ-T on Thursday posted quarterly earnings that narrowly beat analysts' estimates, as record oil and gas production helped offset a decline in crude prices.

The country's oil sands producers, including Canadian Natural Resources, have shown resilience during the global oil industry downturn, buoyed by years of investment that have made them among the lowest-cost operators in North America.

Quarterly production jumped about 19 per cent from a year earlier to a record 1.62 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), driven by both acquisitions and strong operational performance.

The Calgary-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to between 1.56 million and 1.58 million boepd from a prior range of 1.51 million to 1.55 million boepd, citing newly integrated assets and stable field performance.

Following its asset swap with Shell Canada SHEL-N on Nov. 1, Canadian Natural now fully owns and operates the Albian oil sands mines and associated reserves, and holds an 80-per-cent non-operated stake in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest facilities.

The deal adds about 31,000 barrels per day of low-decline bitumen output, further strengthening its oil sands business.

The company kept its annual capital budget steady at about $5.9-billion.

While weaker Western Canadian Select differentials and maintenance work have tempered margins at times, Canadian producers remain well-positioned heading into 2026 with disciplined capital spending.

For Canadian Natural, realized price of exploration and production liquids fell 8.3 per cent in the reported quarter to $72.57 per barrel.

The quarter included a $700-million charge related to updated cost estimates for its Ninian and T-Block assets in the North Sea.

TC Energy TRP-T missed estimates for third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by weakness in the pipeline operator's U.S. operations and in its power and energy solutions business.

AI-driven power demand, industrial applications and LNG exports are driving up natural gas consumption, yet price pressures and competition from coal remain ongoing market challenges.

U.S. natural gas futures fell over 4 per cent sequentially, extending a decline that began in the second quarter after snapping four consecutive quarters of gains.

The drop in prices weighed on TC Energy's transport volumes.

Net income from the company's U.S. natural gas pipelines, its largest segment, fell to $801-million in the third quarter, from $1.3-billion a year ago.

Adjusted core profit in the power and energy solutions business was $266-million in the quarter, down 18.4 per cent from a year ago.

However, its Canadian natural gas pipelines saw adjusted core earnings rise to $913-million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $845-million a year ago.

Climate activists say B.C. needs to conduct new assessment for natural gas pipeline

The company operates a 58,100 mile-long network of pipelines, supplying more than 30 per cent of the clean-burning natural gas consumed daily across North America.

The company expects adjusted core profit for 2026 to be in the range of US$11.6-billion to US$11.8-billion, nearly 6 per cent to 8 per cent growth year-over-year.

It also anticipates 2028 core profit to be in the range of US$12.6-billion to US$13.1-billion, representing a 5 per cent to 7 per cent annual growth rate between 2025 and 2028.

On an adjusted basis, the Calgary-based company earned 77 Canadian cents per share for the three months, compared with analysts' average expectation of 80 Canadian cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The airports affected by flight cuts cover more than two dozen states and include the busiest ones across the U.S.MARK FELIX/AFP/Getty Images

Airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago along with hubs across the U.S. are among the 40 that will see flights cut starting Friday due to the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines and obtained by The Associated Press.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that it would reduce air traffic by 10 per cent across 40 “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the ongoing government shutdown.

The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the U.S. – including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be affected.

The FAA is imposing the flight reductions to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the government shutdown and have been increasingly calling off work.

Controllers already have missed one full paycheque and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as the shutdown drags on.

 

The Associated Press

The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers.

Passengers should start to be notified about cancellations Thursday. Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice.

United Airlines said it would focus the cuts on smaller regional routes that use smaller planes like 737s. United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly – even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable.

The head of Frontier Airlines recommended that travellers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded.

U.S. to reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 ‘high-volume' markets due to government shutdown

Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be cancelled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

“I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” Bedford said Wednesday. “We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”

Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Most work mandatory overtime six days a week, leaving little time for side jobs to help cover bills and other expenses unless they call out.

Mounting staffing pressures are forcing the agency to act, Bedford said.

“We can't ignore it,” he said, adding that even if the shutdown ends before Friday, the FAA wouldn't automatically resume normal operations until staffing improves and stabilizes.

Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that they would meet with airline executives to figure out how to safely implement the reductions.

Major airlines, aviation unions and the broader travel industry have been urging Congress to end the shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest on record.

The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system and “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience,” said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement.

Duffy warned on Tuesday that there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paycheque next week.

Explainer: Why has the U.S. government shut down? Here's what to know

Duffy said some controllers can get by missing one paycheque, but not two or more. And he has said some controllers are even struggling to pay for transportation to work.

Staffing can run short both in regional control centres that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don't always lead to flight disruptions. Throughout October, flight delays caused by staffing problems had been largely isolated and temporary.

But the past weekend brought some of the worst staffing issues since the start of the shutdown.

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

During weekends from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional control centres and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began, the average more than tripled to 26.2 facilities.

Officials said an investigation was underway after the incident on the French Atlantic island of Oleron. At least nine people were injured, with two in hospital in critical condition.

A man rammed a car into pedestrians and cyclists on France's island of Ile d'Oleron on Wednesday, injuring at least nine people, the interior minister and local officials confirmed.

A 35-year-old suspect has been arrested, with local prosecutors saying the incident appeared to be ""deliberate.""

Officials are currently investigating the suspect for attempted murder.

Five people have been hospitalized, with two in critical condition.

French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez has arrived on the island at the request of the prime minister.

The small island of France's west coast, which is a popular summer tourist destination, is home to 22,500 people.

Speaking to the press on Wednesday afternoon, Nunez said that French anti-terror police was assisting investigations in an ""observer"" capacity.

Nunez confirmed French media reports that the suspect shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) when he was arrested.

But he added that it was ""too early in the investigation"" to be say whether the car ramming was a terrorist act, and that the investigation should be allowed to run its course.

Nunez said the suspect acted alone, and was not known to anti-terror police.



 He said the attack lasted approximately 35 minutes, and that the suspect had set fire to his vehicle before being police used a taser to subdue him.

The incident took place on a roadside connecting the communities Saint Pierre and Dolus-d'Oleron.    

One of the victims has been identified as a parliamentary staff member of the far-right National Rally legislator, according to French broadcaster BFM.



The suspect is a 35-year-old French national who is a resident of the small fishing village of La Cotiniere.

The mayor of Saint-Pierre d'Oleron described him as a local who lived an ""isolated life in a mobile home.""

BFM reported that the suspect apprehended was known to the police for disorderly conduct and petty crime, including drunk driving. The French daily Le Parisien said investigators indicated the suspect may have had a history of mental health issues.

Yael Braun-Pivet, President of France's lower house, the National Assembly, said her thoughts were ""with those injured this morning on the island of Oleron, victims of an attack of unprecedented violence.""

""The justice system must respond with all necessary clarity and determination,"" she wrote on X.

Olivier Falorni, MP of the centrist Democrat Movement, addressed the National Assembly, saying that ""there is a sense of shock in the country today, and deep concern for the victims.""

Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a deputy of the interior minister, condemned the attack as ""tragic and heinous"" during the heated debate in parliament.

She also clashed with Sebastien Chenu of the far-right Rassemblement National, who claimed the incident was the latest Islamist attack to affect the country. ""There is no town, there is no neighborhood in our country that feels safe from such events,"" Chenu said.

French authorities have not said the incident is related to terrorism or Islamism.



Car rammings remain a sensitive topic in western Europe, including in France, after a spate of incidents over the last decade.

One of the worst was an attack in France in 2016, when a Tunisian national drove a truck into crowds in Nice celebrating the French national holiday of Bastille Day, killing 86 people and injuring over 400 others.

Shein is in the thick of controversy, as French authorities announced they would suspend the online platform a couple of hours after the clothing company opened the doors to its first-ever physical store in Paris.

Shein, the clothing company that has built a massive reputation online for fast fashion, opened its first physical store in Paris on Wednesday. But not without controversy.

The French Finance Ministry announced shortly afterward that it was moving to suspend Shein's online platform until it complies with French laws and regulations.

Days earlier, Shein came under fire from French authorities for listing a ""childlike"" sex doll for sale.

""On the Prime Minister's instructions, the government is initiating proceedings to suspend Shein for as long as necessary for the platform to demonstrate to the authorities that all of its content is finally in compliance with our laws and regulations,"" the ministry said in a statement.

""An initial review will be conducted by ministers within the next 48 hours.""

Shein said in a statement it was temporarily suspending listings by third-party sellers in France — a move the the company said it planned before the finance ministry's statement. 

""We acknowledge the announcement made today by the government. The safety of our customers and the integrity of our marketplace [a platform for third-party sellers] are our top priorities,"" the company said.

The company said it wished ""to engage in dialogue with French authorities as soon as possible.""

Earlier this week, the French consumer watchdog flagged the listing of ""childlike"" sex dolls for sale on Shein's website. It said the product descriptions and categorization left little doubt as to their child-like pornographic nature of the sex dolls.

French Economy Minister Robert Lescure said at the time that ""boundaries have been crossed"" and authorities launched an investigation.

In response, Shein said it was banning all sex dolls from its website and was temporarily removing its adult products category as it reviews procedures.

The company is set to be questioned by lawmakers on the issue within two weeks, with the French economy minister having said earlier this week he would seek to ban Shein's online store in France if such incidents were to occur again.

Shein set up shop in one of the city's most iconic department stores, BHV Marais department store, which also sits right across from Paris City Hall.

The company has been a hit online but its move to a brick-and-mortar store to expand sales in the heart of the world's fashion capital has not sat well with politicians and retailers alike.

Shein has long been criticized for  poor environmental, labor and human rights practices.

Labor groups and retailers condemned the opening of the Paris store because they denounced the incursion of the low-cost company into France, which was first founded in China in 2012 but is now based in Singapore.

Some BHV employees protested against the opening of the store last week as well. Several dozen protesters camped outside the BHV store ahead of Wednesday's opening.

An online petition opposing the Paris store opening, for example, has also surpassed 120,000 signatures.

But similarly there were people lined up before the store as well, with customers saying they relied on clothes that weren't so expensive.

The head of the BHV store said he was catering to people who were reliant on clothes they could afford to buy, according to French broadcaster BMFTV.

While atrocities against civilians and combatants alike remain a sad reality of Sudan's brutal civil war, some of the most viral content around the conflict doesn't show what it claims to show. DW takes a closer look. 

When it comes to calculating the number of victims in the brutal civil war in Sudan, precise figures are hard to come by.

But whether 20,000, up to 150,000 or even 200,000 people have been killed since the start of the conflict in April 2023, it's clear that atrocities, including mass rape, have been committed on a huge scale ― in particular by the rebel paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been accused of genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity by international actors including the United Nations and the government of the United States.

Predictably, social media is awash with content purporting to show evidence of these atrocities. Sometimes, the content is indeed accurate. Often, however, it's not Fake, misleading and artificially-generated content abound.

""This war is also very much taking place on social media, where disinformation is being spread in the wildest forms,"" explains Volker Perthes, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Sudan from 2021-2023. 

""Depending on which side different activists are on, they blame the war and various massacres on the opposing side — or on the US or the UN,"" he tells DW. ""It's all very hate-filled.""

Claim: ""This video shows the UAE-backed RSF terrorizing a mother and her children in Sudan.""

DW Fact check: False

At the end of October, a viral video claimed to show a Sudanese mother and her three children cowering in front of RSF troops who, it was insinuated in several social media posts, were firing their weapons at or near her, prompting the woman to flinch in fear.

On October 29, an account on X which describes itself as an ""independent analyst"" of geopolitics, international affairs and breaking news posted the video, which it said showed ""the UAE-backed RSF terrorizing a mother and her children in Sudan."" The video has since been viewed almost 13 million times, liked more than 80,000 times and reposted more than 41,000 times.

On October 30, the same video was included in a post describing the fall of the city of el-Fasher to the RSF and the subsequent atrocities reportedly committed.

""A Sudanese woman and her children are being threatened with death by UAE-backed Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militias,"" read an insert. The post has been viewed almost 30,000 times.

On October 31, the video was picked up by prominent Syrian internet personality Jamil Al-Hasaan who embedded it in a video of himself which he posted on his Instagram channel (where he has more than 2.4 million followers and where the video accrued almost 450,000 likes) and his X account (where he has almost 400,000 followers and where the video has been viewed almost one million times).

""Save our people in Fasher in Sudan, be their loud voice,"" he wrote on each platform. In the version of the video embedded in his plea, a caption in Arabic reads: ""The mother was trying to carry [protect] her child."" In a five-minute long plea, Al-Hasaan claims several times, without evidence, that the woman in the video was ultimately killed.

Finally, later on October 31, Al-Hasaan's video, including the embedded video of the Sudanese mother, was further shared by an X account describing itself as an ""alternative news agency"" where it racked up another 800,000 views.

However, the initial video doesn't show what the various accounts say it does.

A reverse image search for several screenshots from the video reveals that it was originally posted on TikTok on September 12 ― more than a month before the capture of el-Fasher by the RSF and therefore contrary to the narrative offered by at least two of the accounts which reposted it.

Furthermore, local language experts from DW's Arabic desk have confirmed some of the dialogue audible in the video which suggests that the men are not members of the RSF, but rather belong to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). They don't appear to be threatening the woman, but are rather asking her where she is from and whether she is linked to the RSF. The woman replies that she is part of the Zaghawa tribe and that the RSF arrested her husband.

While she initially appears to flinch at the sound of gunfire, the shots don't appear to be that close, but rather further away, and not directed at her. What's more, about 25 seconds into the video, an adult hand appears from behind the camera and briefly takes the hand of the little boy in a manner which appears more comforting than threatening. Indeed, from this point, the mother appears slightly calmer.

Claims that the woman and her children were subsequently killed are unsubstantiated and impossible to prove.

In the video posted by the Syrian commentator Al-Hasaan, the footage of the woman and her children isn't the only embedded clip; Al-Hasaan also comments on a second clip which appears to show a woman holding a young child and cowering in a desert trench before two armed soldiers, depicted as shadows cast from behind the camera.

A reverse image search for a screenshot of the clip reveals that the motif has been posted hundreds of times on various social media platforms over the past week, including here (almost 150,000 views) and here (over 12,000 views).

The clip, however, is entirely fake and was generated using artificial intelligence.

Not only do the soldiers' ""shadows"" not move, the boy's trousers also change colour slightly. And if those clues weren't obvious enough, the clip even features the creator's watermark: @khoubaib.bz, an Instagram account belonging to Khoubaib Ben Ziou, a self-described ""Creative AI specialist."" 

Ben Ziou posted the clip on October 28 along with an explicit note that it was ""AI generated,"" but this didn't prevent it from accruing almost 110,000 likes or Al-Hasaan from using it in his video.

DW asked both Jamil Al-Hasaan and Khoubaib Ben Ziou whether they were aware that they were spreading inaccurate and AI-generated content, or that their AI content was spread as something real. DW also asked what their motivation was, but received no response.

""Disinformation is a huge problem in Sudan,"" says Gerrit Kurtz, a conflict researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) in Berlin, with a particular focus on the Horn of Africa. ""Media literacy isn't particularly high. Then again, the availability of social media and the internet in rural areas is limited.""

Disinformation coming out of Sudan appears to be aimed more at the outside world, where numerous foreign powers all have stakes in the strategically-located and mineral-rich country.

""There are close personal ties between the leadership of the RSF and political leaders in the United Arab Emirates (UAE),"" explains Kurtz. 

""The warring parties are constantly posting their narratives on their own channels. Telegram is popular, Hemedti [RSF General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo] is on [US President Donald Trump's] Truth Social, the SAF and their allies are on Facebook and X.""

But while the disinformation battle rages online, it's ordinary people on the ground who are suffering in real life.

			President says mayor-elect of NYC must be more ‘respectful of Washington' if he wants to succeed

Donald Trump has accused Zohran Mamdani of delivering a “very dangerous” speech after he was elected as the next mayor of New York City.

The 34-year-old, who stormed to victory in the election on Tuesday, directly addressed Mr Trump in his acceptance speech, telling the president to “turn the volume up” and that “to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us”.

Mr Trump responded on Wednesday night, telling Fox News that the mayor-elect should be more “respectful of Washington”.

“I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York,” the president, a New York native, said.

He added: “I think it's a very dangerous statement for him to make. He has to be a little bit respectful of Washington, because if he's not, he doesn't have a chance of succeeding.”

Asked if he had spoken to Mr Mamdani, Mr Trump said: “We'll see what happens. But I think it would be more appropriate for him to reach out to us.”

Mr Mamdani won Tuesday's election with more than 50 per cent of the vote, defeating Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Mr Trump, who endorsed Mr Cuomo, spent months deriding Mr Mamdani as a “communist” and repeatedly warned that he would withhold federal funding if he was elected.

On the eve of the election, he posted on Truth Social: “It is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!

“It can only get worse with a Communist at the helm, and I don't want to send, as President, good money after bad.”

The White House also said in October that it was freezing billions of dollars in funds for New York transport projects.

The results were seen as the first test of Mr Trump's second presidency and an indicator of how next year's crucial midterm elections might go.

Results in Virginia and New Jersey showed big swings towards Democrats. Both states moved towards Mr Trump in last year's presidential election, but this year there were signs that his diverse coalition of younger voters and minorities was breaking down as Democrats capitalised on worries about a lingering cost of living crisis.

Mr Trump has so far deflected responsibility for this week's elections, which also saw Republicans lose governor races in New Jersey and Virginia.

The president said they lost because he “wasn't on the ballot” and also accused Republicans of failing to talk about the cost of living.

“I think they [costs] are coming down. I think they're down already,” Mr Trump told Fox News's Bret Baier in an interview on Wednesday. “I think the biggest problem is Republicans don't talk about it. They don't talk about the word ‘affordability', and Democrats lie about it.”

Recommended

James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff, told Politico that the president would put more focus on affordability in the future.

He said: “I think you'll see the president talk a lot about cost of living as we turn the year and into the new year.

“The president is very keyed into what's going on, and he recognises, like anybody, that it takes time to do an economic turnaround, but all the fundamentals are there, and I think you'll see him be very, very focused on prices and cost of living.”

Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, has announced her retirement from politics.

The 85-year-old, who was first elected to Congress in 1987 during Ronald Reagan's presidency, said she would not be standing for re-election in her California district in 2026.

As the first female speaker of the House, Mrs Pelosi ushered landmark legislation through Congress, and was widely seen to have ended the political career of Joe Biden during the 2024 presidential election.

“I will not be seeking re-election to Congress. With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,” she said in a video message released on Thursday.

Mrs Pelosi, a lifelong Catholic, told constituents in San Francisco said she had “loved serving as your voice in Congress” and quoted St Francis of Assisi: “Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.”

She went on to describe her election as the first female speaker of the House as a historic moment, and said she had secured billions of dollars for San Francisco and California during her time in office.

She made the announcement after California voters passed “Proposition 50”, a ballot measure she campaigned for which is expected to give Democrats five extra seats in the House ahead of the 2026 mid-terms.

The Democrat grandee will remain a hugely influential figure long after she leaves Congress. But, she has not announced what her next moves are, if any.

Mrs Pelosi led her party in the House for 20 years, from 2002 to 2022. She is credited with marshalling votes to pass legislation such as the Affordable Care Act under Barack Obama, along with massive spending projects during Mr Biden's administration.

She is widely understood to have leveraged her supporters to put pressure on Mr Biden during his faltering campaign before he pulled out of the 2024 presidential race.

The former president is reported to have a grudging respect for Mrs Pelosi, regarding her as a “ruthless” operator. She played up to that reputation, often saying: “I eat nails for breakfast.”

Despite her intervention, she was considered one of Mr Biden's staunchest allies during his presidency, as well as one of Mr Obama's.

Mrs Pelosi mobilised her caucus against Donald Trump, particularly during his first term, when he was impeached twice.

Mr Trump on Thursday hit out at the former speaker as “evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country” and claimed she was “rapidly losing control of her party”.

“I'm very honoured she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice,” the US president said in a statement to Fox News. “Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician.”

Concluding her retirement announcement, Mrs Pelosi urged San Franciscans to “fight for the American values we hold dear”.

She said: “In doing so we ensure that our city shines on as a beacon of hope, justice and peace for the country and for generations to come.”

Speculation has mounted in recent weeks that Mrs Pelosi would not seek another term and step down after the result of the “Proposition 50” vote, ending her career on a high.

Mrs Pelosi recently appeared to hint that at her retirement, suggesting she might not be on the House floor to watch Hakeem Jeffries, currently the Democrat leader in the chamber, sworn in as the first black speaker in 2026.

Mr Jeffries hailed Mrs Pelosi as the “greatest speaker of all time” and an “incredible mentor” in a statement.

Praising her “giant and historic legislative accomplishments”, he said: “The United States is a much better nation today because [of] Nancy Pelosi.”

The party has been riven by splits over the age of their leaders, amid accusations from younger figures that the party is in the grip of a “gerontocracy”.

Two Democrats, both several decades younger than the former speaker, launched primary campaigns to challenge her for her California seat.

Mrs Pelosi, who is three years older than Mr Biden and will be 86-years-old by the time her term ends in January 2027, had made no outward move to counter them.

Experts and civil rights advocates are denouncing Trump's biometric power grab.

A proposed change to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule could impose “biological sex” DNA testing on millions of immigrants and Americans as part of the Department's mass biometric surveillance program — which also includes retinal scans, voice capture, and more.

In addition to the obvious human rights violations posed by the changes — which, among other things, would amend policy to allow children to be targeted by biometric surveillance — it would put a target on the back of trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming people, as well as women and trans people of color, citizens and non-citizens alike.

“Under this proposed rule, DHS may also require, request, or accept raw DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or DNA test results, which include a partial DNA profile, as evidence of genetic relationship, to determine eligibility for immigration and naturalization benefits or to perform any other functions necessary for administering and enforcing immigration and naturalization laws,” the proposal reads. “Where evidence of a relationship is required, this rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results (which include a partial DNA profile) from relevant parties such as applicants, petitioners, derivatives, dependents, and beneficiaries, to prove or disprove the existence of a claimed, or unclaimed, genetic relationship or biological sex.”

For example, it says, “DHS may request DNA evidence to prove or disprove an individual's biological sex in instances where that determination will impact benefit eligibility.”

The policy as proposed doesn't have many safeguards for privacy or constitutionality — the government can retain someone's DNA profile indefinitely. It could further be weaponized to deny bids for immigration or asylum, out trans and intersex women being held in detention (who may not even know they are intersex otherwise), and track individuals in perpetuity through “continuous vetting.”

The DHS claims these changes will enable immigration officials to perform more thorough background checks, prevent fraud, and enforce immigration and naturalization laws. But it's not only new arrivals that could be forcibly subjected to this treatment — longtime residents, naturalized citizens, and the families and sponsors of immigrants may also have to submit to sex tests.

Alejandra Caraballo, an instructor at Harvard's cyber law program who has also provided legal aid to trans immigrants, called the initiative “dystopian.” When paired with troubling innovations in surveillance tech and attempts to criminalize trans people's very existence, she says, the devastating potential of this rule, if finalized, cannot be overstated.

“You can create a digital Panopticon,” Caraballo said.

There is a 60-day public comment period ahead of any formal implementation.

The policy in question falls under the guidelines for the Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It's a revitalized version of a 2020 proposal from Donald Trump's first term empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to launch dragnet surveillance campaigns.

That original bid was struck down by the Biden Administration before it could take effect, but Trump 2.0 brought it back with added provisions greenlighting sex testing via buccal swab — in other words, testing the chromosomal composition of DNA in a person's saliva.

These biometrics can be used to trace and quash dissent, surveil marginalized communities, and add massive obstacles to trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people entering the country, including asylum seekers who may be fleeing gender-based violence abroad. If you can't prove you're a “biological woman” to the White House's liking, then your ability to file for relief under, say, the Violence Against Women Act, may become more difficult.

Depending on a variety of factors, such as a person's country of origin, this kind of sex testing can cost a small fortune. Not to mention the implications of such a policy ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles — if the U.S. government can grant or deny visa requests based on its own unscientific and inexact definitions of “biological sex,” then it can functionally control who gets to compete. And we know from decades of sports scandals that sex testing is also weaponized against cisgender women, and disproportionately, women of color. Think: Imane Khelif, Caster Semenya, or one of the eight women who suddenly found out they were intersex during sex testing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, likely ending their athletics careers.

Even before the DHS added the new sex testing provision, countless medical groups, politicians, legal scholars, and human rights organizations decried Trump's biometric powergrab. During the public comment process for the 2020 version of the policy, the American Medical Association argued that authorities lack “the capability to collect and process DNA at the appropriate scientific level to ensure evidence-based standards,” and that it further robs women and children fleeing violence of “informed, non-coercive consent.”

Meanwhile, The National Center for Lesbian Rights chimed in that the rule tramples privacy rights and “empowers mass and unprecedented surveillance” of the LGBTQ community. And the Congressional Committee on Homeland Security said the rule would increase the already staggering backlog of immigrant applicants under the DHS while endangering the personal data of millions.

“Like any authoritarian regime, they want control over the population, and they feel like they need control over the identification of every single person, in a multitude of ways, so that they can be tracked,” Caraballo told Erin in the Morning. “There's no more anonymity.”

No one should be caged, tortured, detained, or deported by the state — all carceral violence is done wrongfully.

This article is an excerpt from Read This When Things Fall Apart, edited by Kelly Hayes, Copyright © 2025. This text was originally published by AK Press and has been reprinted here with permission.

I 've been an organizer for half of my life now. What a strange thing to write.

I've been involved with struggles to abolish the death penalty, worked to kick racists and war criminals off campuses, to fund and expand abortion access, to form unions and strike committees; I've slept on concrete during youth rebellions, navigated supporting criminalized survivors of gender based violence, taught people how to reverse overdoses and test their drugs, built peer education amongst sex workers toward decriminalizing our labor, organized too many vigils for fallen comrades, gotten arrested symbolically and against all my best efforts, and liberated resources from institutional spaces and moved them to community as often as I could. I've done more, but I shouldn't put it in writing (and neither should you, lesson one). 

May this find you grounded in community and living your values, even as your survival, your labor, and your basic needs are vilified, exploited, or criminalized. For some of us, these are all too familiar conditions. For people organizing within the sex trades, or whose harm reduction work occurs outside the law, public scorn and carceral violence come with the territory. As someone who has done (and continues to do) movement work within these spheres, I want to share some thoughts, and lessons I've learned, with people who are trying to do the work of collective survival in these environments. If you are not a sex worker or involved in harm reduction work, you may also have something to learn from people whose political work often occurs outside the law (or in direct opposition to it). As authoritarianism tightens its grip, more and more people are going to face criminalization upon choosing to organize as workers, resist unjust policies, or practice mutual aid. If you are grappling with the difficulties that come with this kind of work, here's what I can share.

I cannot stress enough how crucial it is to have a small, tight-knit crew you call your chosen political family. These can be people you actively organize with, or used to, or maybe you're all involved in different projects now, maybe you met at the club, clinic or on the stroll, but these are your people who know you, trust you, are conflict brave, and can gut check you. You've engaged in political education together, you have shared values, and you have experience — these are qualities that are earned and grown collectively. There are no substitutes for these kinds of relationships. Lots of people will tell you what to do; these are the people whose advice you should consider first and foremost. 

That being said, it is the criminality of the work that I need to focus on. Or at least the impact of criminalization on our waged work, our organizing work — our political work (because all labor is politicized). 

Unlearn the language of “good,” “innocent,” or “wrongfully.” This is not just a rhetorical shift, but a shift in values. Let go of any preconceived notions you had about “criminals.” In fact, let me officially welcome you to the criminal class. Divorcing oneself from respectability politics can be hard, especially when there are so many barriers to resources when you're perceived as criminal or charged as such. There are no “good ones,” there are only people, fellow workers, co-strugglers. Innocence is irrelevant because the laws have already betrayed us. And it is my belief that no one should be caged, tortured, detained, or deported by the state — all carceral violence is done wrongfully. We cannot pick and choose who rightfully and wrongfully experiences the hell of carcerality. If we do this, we are affirming the very system that seeks to kill us. 

You must commit to unapologetic politics. It might be tempting to give into something we call the whorearchy — or the hierarchical stratification of sex working/trading people whose perceived value or worth is ranked based upon the associated stigma of their particular form of sex work (i.e., “I'm better than them because I work indoors instead of on the street”, or “I don't deserve to be arrested because I'm paying for school, not drugs”). Whorearchy exists because of classism, colorism, substance stigma, racism, xenophobia, transmisogyny, ableism and other forms of discriminatory, oppressive ideologies. But whorearchy thrives because of the criminalization and stigma of the sex trades. There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. When building a broad coalition, and involving people who have feminist and abolitionist politics, make sure you're not so quick to win them that you abandon your lived experiences for respectability. Remember, those elites in power don't actually care if you pander to them now, if your existence threatens their agenda, they will never honor your humanity, no matter how “good” and “respectable” you try to be. Remain illegible and unruly. 

Skill up as many people as you know, now. Your skill shares do not need to be large or public or perfect. They just need to happen thoughtfully, carefully, and often. Refreshing your own skill sets on gunshot wound care, overdose reversal, rescue breathing, needle cleaning/disposal, learning the right quantities of misoprostol and mifepristone, and testing drugs for fentanyl and xylazine is a priority. Getting people together in person to build safer sniffing kits, and gather other harm reduction supplies, creates social community opportunities to check-in on each other, engage in risk and movement assessments collectively, and share advice on using and caring for our comrades who use drugs. There is no substitute for off-line, in-person conversations about strategy, tactics, and navigating work outside of the law. It is both urgent and patient work. 

Urgent in that these are timely skills that more of us need to learn and practice, especially since the majority of people will still call 911 even though they may be scared of the potential for police violence. Often this comes down to a lack of self-trust and lack of knowledge on how to intervene without the state in an emergency situation. When you're a sex worker, and your client or fellow worker overdoses, you need to be able to act swiftly and without state intervention whenever possible. Remember, you don't need to reinvent the wheel, radical harm reductionists and sex workers have been making toolkits, zines, and DIY guides for decades. Find what speaks to you, and use it as a template, build from something that already exists and fact check it with trusted friends. It's patient work because new skills may need to be acquired, language and practices change with new knowledge, and because people will say some really upsetting and problematic shit to you about drug use. I'm so sorry but they will. Even the comrades who you think should know better. You can't see through everyone's journey, focus on the skills, recommit to a politics of solidarity and care. It's hard work doing peer to peer education, it can be draining, and you'll need to ask for help, a lot. Take a deep breath, you've got this. 

There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. 

Be discerning, and figure out who's in the room. There's practicing safer communication (what I used to call security culture before the term was wrecked, and the concept debased) and then there's becoming obsessive and gate-keeping. What I'm expressly advocating, especially within criminalized workplace contexts, is moving things offline whenever possible. Learn how to assess risks as an individual within a formation, and collectively for the formation as a whole. Technology will change, adapt, and entrap. Work only with platforms that have clear terms of service that aren't already committed to throwing you under the bus, or expressly work with platforms that are built by community-minded people. We often can't control how we make money, or what platform consolidation means. But when it comes to our organizing work, we can opt in and out of using tools that don't serve us. We can also control what we do and don't say and to who. This is critical — you have to move at the speed of trust. That will likely feel slower than you desire to act. You've got to get to a place where trust, collaboration, and safer outcomes for your communities are prioritized instead of appearing to have all the answers on the internet, jeopardizing your own safety to respond to every direct service ask, or inflating your organization's numbers too rapidly. 

Yes, it will present new challenges and there will be learning curves, but an emphasis on safer communication means talking to the people you are directly organizing with, regularly — checking in on materials, assessing needs and risks, outlining safer methods to trade sex or obtain substances, discussing the political landscape in real terms, and making space to do visioning work beyond immediate crisis-related tasks. If you are doing work outside of the law, you cannot do this on a zoom call with 90 people who you do not know. You also cannot do this at a large general membership meeting of an organization that's open to the public. It will mean you have to repeat yourself, schedule more meetings, and develop an ear for infiltration. Some of these skills feel intuitive, but I promise, if you and your crew are paying attention, they can be learned, practiced and modified for your own needs. 

Sex workers, and really all workers in criminalized economies, have gotten really good at developing new languages, code switching, and sharing information to keep each other safe by getting creative and working both within and against the repressive laws and their enforcement of any given generation. You're being hoisted onto the shoulders of some tough, resourceful worker-organizers. You too will build and experiment with new tech, new skills, new tactics. Something that remains, however, is how you embody your politics and values. Don't let people shut sex workers and drug users out of spaces you find yourself working in —  speak up, point to the outlaw legacies of harm reduction and mutual care, be bold in your comradeship. 

Remember you're not alone — like Eugene Debs said, “While there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The detention of Sami Hamdi “is about silencing political dissent to create a chilling effect,” his wife wrote.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) taunted the wife of a British journalist who is being detained by immigration agents on social media on Wednesday, after she publicly urged her husband's release and warned that he was suffering a health emergency in custody.

U.K. journalist Sami Hamdi, a 35-year-old father of three and outspoken critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza, was residing in the U.S. on a travel visa when he was abducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at San Francisco International Airport on October 26. His wife, Soumaya Hamdi, only found out he was being detained after a friend sent her a text message about DHS bragging about the abduction on social media. 

In an interview with The Independent published Monday, Soumaya Hamdi said she was deeply concerned about her husband's health and the conditions he was being subjected to in detention.

“He called me on Saturday and I could barely hear him on the phone,” she told the publication. “He was clearly struggling to speak properly and he said: ‘Soumaya, I'm in a lot of pain. I've been asking for hours to see a doctor. They haven't brought me one. I need you to help me find a way to help me see a doctor.'”

After calls to the British consulate and pressure from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which is providing the family legal representation, Sam Hamdi was finally examined and told he may have a severe case of gastroenteritis. 

In addition to that ailment, the journalist is living in a “very overcrowded” space, sharing a room with around 80 to 90 people, Soumaya Hamdi said. 

Earlier this week, Soumaya Hamdi wrote an op-ed for USA Today, demanding her husband's release and condemning DHS and ICE for violating his speech rights.

Wrote Soumaya Hamdi:

Sami was on a routine speaking tour in the United States when he was arrested — after a far-right social media influencer pressured the Trump administration to revoke his visa. Days later, in an act as unconscionable as it was surreal, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed on social media, of all places, that it had answered the call, as though this were a perfectly ordinary course of action.

“Why are they keeping him against his will? Why are American taxpayers funding Sami's arbitrary detention when they could be used to support American citizens instead — at a time when the American government has been shut down and millions of children risk going hungry by losing their food aid?” she went on, stating that Sami Hamdi's “abduction by ICE is not merely an immigration issue; it is about silencing political dissent to create a chilling effect.”

Soumaya Hamdi concluded her op-ed by asking the U.S. government to release her husband “immediately,” and to “reaffirm that America's strength lies in defending freedom of speech, not silencing it.”

In response, the official account for DHS shared a screenshot of her op-ed on X, baselessly accusing Sami of being a “terrorist sympathizer” for his opposition to Israel's genocide and saying that the U.S. had “no obligation” to host individuals “who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.”

“[DHS Sec. Kristi Noem] has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-American and anti-Semitic violence and terrorism — think again,” the account added.

DHS has not provided any evidence for their allegations, and Hamdi has not been formally charged with any crime. His detention comes as the Trump administration is cracking down on anyone who voices opposition to Israel's genocide; among the people detained have been Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested and faced deportation for writing an op-ed in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and former student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained and nearly deported for leading protests at Columbia University.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

ZACK COOPER is a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a lecturer at Princeton University. He is the author of Tides of Fortune: The Rise and Decline of Great Militaries.

 If Deterrence Fails, Could America Thwart China?

 Zack Cooper

In recent years, many in Washington have focused on deterring China from invading Taiwan. Before taking office earlier this year, Elbridge Colby, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, asserted that Taiwan should be “laser focusing on implementing a denial defense against invasion.” Indeed, an array of small, inexpensive weapon systems holds great promise for repelling a Chinese amphibious landing. The Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy is therefore correct to embrace a strategy of denial for stopping an invasion of Taiwan.

But rebuffing an invasion might not end the war. Joel Wuthnow, an expert on the Chinese military, has warned, “There is no scenario in which China, following an unsuccessful invasion, accepts responsibility, acknowledges that military solutions are impractical, or pivots to a fundamentally different set of political objectives toward Taiwan.” In the wake of a failed invasion, Chinese leader Xi Jinping (or his successor) would be unlikely to simply pack up and go home. Instead, Chinese leaders might reason that they have less to lose by continuing the fight.

This is why the political scientist Michael Beckley has argued that “war over Taiwan likely would become protracted, as nearly all great power wars have since the Industrial Revolution.” World War II ended only when Allied forces captured Germany's capital and the United States dropped nuclear weapons on Japan. Neither option seems advisable in the context of a U.S.-Chinese war; Washington needs to find other ways to end it. And so, in the years to come, the United States must prepare two forces: one to stop a Chinese invasion and another to end the conflict. Preventing a war from starting in the first place will rely to some extent on the innovative forms of deterrence by denial on which the Trump administration and others have focused. But denial capabilities on their own will not be enough. Ending a war that churns on even after a failed invasion will also require old-fashioned power projection.

In the twentieth century, the United States perfected the art of projecting power around the globe. A combination of forward bases and aircraft carriers allowed U.S. forces to operate worldwide. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the U.S. military's dominance also meant that one set of forces could employ two distinct forms of deterrence simultaneously: denial and punishment.

Consider the role of U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis. At the time, China was staging military exercises and testing missiles in the waters around Taiwan. As tensions rose, Washington maneuvered two carriers near the island. Those strike groups practiced deterrence by denial by threatening to physically repel an attack. But they also performed deterrence through punishment by threatening severe consequences if Beijing went through with it, since carrier-based aircraft could strike ships heading toward China and even targets on the Chinese mainland.

In the last few years, however, the United States has begun tailoring its forces—and those of its allies and partners—for more specific missions. Forward bases and aircraft carriers are expensive to build and maintain, yet still vulnerable to ballistic missiles and other asymmetric systems. Pentagon officials are therefore pushing to acquire more “attritable” systems, which are relatively cheap to produce and designed to be expendable, for use by small units operating within the expanding area that China threatens. As David Berger, the former commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, explained at a defense industry conference in 2021, the United States must “get comfortable with throwaway things.”



But attritable systems are of limited use against China's day-to-day coercive operations in the air and sea around Taiwan. Last year, Taiwan detected 5,105 Chinese sorties into its airspace. Defending against these aircraft requires expensive jets rather than low-flying drones. In the maritime context, responding to Chinese naval incursions in the waters around Taiwan will require vessels that can monitor those activities and challenge Chinese forces if necessary.

Even after open conflict begins, denial is still only a partial answer. U.S. mines and missiles can sink Chinese vessels, killing thousands of troops in the process, but Chinese leaders might still seek at least a partial victory. The People's Liberation Army could attempt to seize Taiwan's outlying islands or conduct a maritime blockade while its military arsenal makes the waters around Taiwan a no man's land. “There is no path to U.S. victory that does not include the long blockade,” the former intelligence officer Lonnie Henley has argued.

That is why the United States must be able to convince China that it will face unacceptable costs if it continues fighting in the wake of an unsuccessful invasion. A strategy of denial is only step one; the threat of punishment will be the United States' ultimate trump card.

The war in Ukraine illustrates the difficulty of terminating a conflict even after an initial invasion has bogged down. With small and cheap systems such as drones and mines, Ukraine was able to deny Russia a swift victory but has failed to impose costs high enough to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop fighting. Russia has suffered terrible losses in the war, but Putin appears to have calculated that the costs of continuing are lower than the costs of admitting defeat.

Russia's example serves as a warning about China's likely behavior. Ideally, the prospect of a failed invasion of Taiwan would deter China, but Chinese leaders might perceive several incentives for protracting a war following an initial loss. First, China's industrial capacity far outstrips that of the United States, so it could recapitalize its forces more rapidly. Over the last three decades, China has undergone a massive military buildup. The Office of Naval Intelligence has assessed that China has over 230 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. Meanwhile, U.S. armed forces face significant munitions shortages, with some experts predicting that American stockpiles would be expended after just weeks, or even days, of a conflict with China.

Beijing might believe it can outlast Washington and Taipei in terms of other supplies, as well. Getting provisions across land into Ukraine has proved challenging; delivering even basic necessities over water to Taiwan amid a conflict with China would be an order of magnitude more difficult. Taiwan is a relatively small island with limited food and energy stockpiles. Conversely, Beijing's rapid expansion of wind, solar, and nuclear power would help insulate it against a U.S. energy blockade.



A conflict over Taiwan could eventually become a contest of wills—which Beijing believes it could win. Chinese officials have described Taiwan as “the very core of China's core interests.” U.S. President Donald Trump's take is decidedly different: “Taiwan is 9,500 miles away,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. “It's 68 miles away from China. I just think we have to be smart . . . it's a very, very difficult thing.” The American people support Taiwan, but many do not want a direct conflict with China: when asked in 2024 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs about their commitment to defending Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, the majority of Americans surveyed either opposed such a policy or were unsure.

A Chinese failure in a conflict over Taiwan could also threaten Xi or his successor's hold on power and undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi would want to avoid an admission of failure and thus might order the Chinese military to keep waging an unsuccessful war. Without the prospect of punishment, the CCP might decide that failure poses a greater risk than continuing the conflict.

For all these reasons, Chinese leaders might prefer to keep fighting even after an initial defeat. To bring the conflict to a close, the United States would need to credibly threaten punishment. Colby and other Trump administration officials clearly recognize this; he co-authored a 2022 report advocating “selective punishment operations” and “cost-imposition to favorably manage escalation and seek to terminate a war with China.” These operations could include an embargo or the seizure of Chinese assets held abroad. But Beijing has been insulating itself against political and economic pressure, so military escalation might well be required, including strikes on critical infrastructure and parts of China's defense-industrial base. These moves would raise the costs for China of continuing a conflict, but they also present a strategic dilemma.

A number of factors would complicate any threat of punishment. First is what researchers at the RAND Corporation have termed the “Goldilocks challenge”: threats of punishment must be high enough to persuade Beijing to end a conflict in which it is deeply invested but low enough to avoid provoking unacceptable escalation, such as nuclear use. Finding this middle ground would not be an easy task.

It will therefore be important to try to keep an initial fight over Taiwan limited in order to provide Chinese leaders a pathway for deescalation. Chinese leaders might back down after claiming to have taught Taiwan a lesson or taken some contested territory. Yet China's own messaging before a conflict could set a higher bar: Chinese leaders might demonize Taiwan and the United States to rally public support, while trumpeting the PLA's military superiority and China's great rejuvenation. An invasion of Taiwan might start with Beijing metaphorically burning its ships so there would be no turning back.

In the aftermath of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, politicians in Washington, Taipei, and elsewhere might themselves raise the stakes. They could seek to use Beijing's moment of weakness to constrain China's ambitions, formalize Taiwan's independence, or undermine the CCP's hold on power. There would be a fine line between “too hot” and “too cold” policies, and the tradeoffs would become more difficult as the war grew longer, bloodier, and more destructive.

A second challenge is that U.S. “horizontal escalation”—widening the scope of the conflict—may not be as effective today as it once might have been. Devoting more funding to denial capabilities risks cannibalizing resources for military platforms more capable of threatening punishment, such as stealthy bombers and submarines armed with cruise missiles. And although American strategists have discussed the possibility of a blockade to prevent China from importing energy supplies, the country's nuclear power plants and renewable energy sources now account for a third of its energy production, so that Beijing is less vulnerable to an energy blockade. Cutting China's fossil fuel imports would hurt over time, but Taiwan would be in a far more dire position.

Therefore, the biggest challenge for the Trump administration's National Defense Strategy is not whether it allocates resources to a strategy of denial but how it integrates denial and punishment into a holistic deterrence framework. Rebuffing an initial attack on Taiwan is necessary but not sufficient. Without a plan for terminating a war, Washington would risk repeating the pattern of U.S. strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan that many Trump officials critiqued: winning the first battle but losing the war. If the United States is to deter China, it will have to persuade Chinese leaders that Washington has a strategy not only for the early stages of a conflict but also for the end stage of a war.

 Only American Pressure Can Stop the Killing in Sudan

 Alex de Waal

On October 26, a horrific massacre rapidly unfolded in North Darfur as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)—one of two main factions in Sudan's brutal two-and-a-half-year civil war—captured its capital, El Fasher. The world has finally turned its eyes toward this genocidal war, thanks to videos taken and circulated by the killers themselves. The unedited, close-up footage is too sickening for television and newspapers to show. But pools of blood can be seen from satellites in space. At just one hospital, according to the World Health Organization, fighters murdered 450 patients and health-care workers as well as their family members. The official death toll from the city's occupation has risen to over 1,500, and thousands more civilians are missing.

Survivors have made their way to Tawila, a once sleepy town 45 miles west of El Fasher, where aid agencies such as Doctors Without Borders and the International Rescue Committee provide small quantities of assistance, and some protection is afforded by a rebel group that has thus far managed to stay neutral. Every child reaching Tawila's clinics is malnourished. This week, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification's Famine Review Committee (FRC)—the premier multinational body that assesses hunger worldwide—declared a famine in El Fasher and its environs.

The FRC had, in fact, already declared a famine in the area well over a year ago. And although the war's atrocities have recently captured worldwide attention, the RSF has never tried to hide them—in fact, it has long openly advertised its intent to destroy entire groups, whether for punishment or to seize their land. The mass killing of civilians in El Fasher was foreseeable and foreseen; genocide has been underway in Sudan since well before October. Official recognitions that a genocide is happening or even International Criminal Court (ICC) charges and sanctions cannot stop it. Indeed, to some observers, the war has acquired a brutal sense of inevitability.

But escalation is not inevitable. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's effort to secure a cease-fire in Sudan and the delivery of more humanitarian aid was tantalizingly close to success. In the aftermath of the shocking crimes in El Fasher, there is a chance that the Middle Eastern states that have backed Sudan's warring parties may agree to fully adopt a peace template and force the factions they support into compliance. Such an outcome, however, would require a much bigger push from the White House. And that is a major ask of an administration often wary of becoming entangled in conflicts in which the United States has no clear, immediate interests. But the alternative is more civilians murdered, more children dying of hunger, and many more refugees fleeing a collapsing country.

The principal practitioners of Sudan's genocide, RSF fighters led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), advertise their brutality on purpose. Since the RSF began fighting Sudan's regular army, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)—headed by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan—the conflict has destroyed much of Khartoum, Sudan's capital; forced about a quarter of the country's 45 million people from their homes; and created the world's biggest humanitarian catastrophe. The RSF has intentionally sought to build a reputation for conspicuous atrocities, telegraphing its mercilessness through killing and raping and then circulating trophy videos among its network of social media influencers.

Over the course of 40 years of studying Sudan and working in the country, I have seen genocidal slaughter become a normalized strategy on the battlefield. In the 1980s, militia fighters and military intelligence officers dispatched to southern Sudan to put down rebellions massacred civilians and created widespread hunger. These fighters were told: do what you need to do and don't report back. Slaughter and starvation unfolded in secret. Outside analysts had to rely on oral reports gathered by journalists and aid workers, most of them Sudanese.

As that civil war dragged on into the 1990s, organizations such as Human Rights Watch began to more systematically compile evidence of war crimes. Moved by harrowing stories of suffering in Sudan, including accounts of starvation and enslavement, a bipartisan coalition of American churches, charities, and human rights campaigners pressed the U.S. government to help end the war and punish the abusers.

President George W. Bush's administration helped broker a peace deal in southern Sudan, but in 2003, a new rebellion erupted in the western province of Darfur; rebel leaders protested Khartoum's neglect and opposed attacks by Arab militia units, including a clan led by Hemedti's uncle. To beat back the rebels, President Omar al-Bashir licensed a local militia to wage a counterinsurgency on the cheap. Backed by regular army brigades and the air force, young men with rudimentary training—the Janjaweed—attacked villages suspected of harboring rebels. The criterion for their assaults was singular: if a community was the same ethnicity as a rebel leader, it was fair game. Because Janjaweed fighters often went without direct pay, they rewarded themselves with land, loot, and the bodies of women and girls. They murdered tens of thousands of civilians, and hundreds of thousands more perished of hunger and disease.

Foreign governments and multinational watchdogs used new technology to spotlight the abuses, mapping burned villages using satellite imagery. In 2004, U.S. State Department investigations prompted Secretary of State Colin Powell to declare that the Janjaweed had committed a genocide. A UN inquiry shortly afterward compiled irrefutable evidence of war crimes on a vast scale and pushed the Security Council to refer Darfur to the ICC. At the same time, a coalition of young American and European activists under the “Save Darfur” banner pressed for the protection of Sudanese civilians, the delivery of humanitarian aid, and justice for genocide victims. Bush stepped up humanitarian aid and backed the deployment of a joint UN–African Union peacekeeping force, the biggest in the world at that time. In 2008, then Senator Barack Obama made ending the genocide in Darfur a component of his presidential campaign.

But the trajectory of the Darfur conflict also taught Sudanese combatants that ultimately, even if their atrocities were aired worldwide, they wouldn't be called to account. Just two months after the United States declared a genocide in Darfur and four months after the UN demanded that Bashir disarm the Janjaweed, African Union peacekeepers encountered Hemedti in a burned-out village. He made no secret of the fact that his forces had been responsible for the 126 bodies the peacekeepers found in the ashes, including 36 children.

Hemedti had no reason to worry about consequences. Khartoum had empowered the Janjaweed to do its dirty work and, by then, could not crack down on the thuggish group even if it wanted to. Bashir decided that his best bet was to formalize the Janjaweed into the RSF, immensely upgrading the militia's status, in return—he hoped—for loyalty. Despite occasionally paying rhetorical lip service to accountability, the Sudanese authorities have never brought any Janjaweed commander to trial.

The ICC has done better—but only just. In October, the court found a Janjaweed commander, Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman (known as Kushayb), guilty of 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity; the ICC will impose his sentence later this month. The trial was a model of due process, featuring a mountain of evidence painstakingly compiled and presented. But 20 years after the outbreak of genocide in Darfur, Kushayb is the only individual who has ever been brought to trial—and only because he surrendered to the ICC in 2020, worried that authorities in Khartoum might have something even worse in store for him.



The ICC's investigators are still at work in Darfur. They are particularly focused on a rampage committed by RSF fighters in mid-2023 against the Masalit, a non-Arab ethnic group that resides in western Sudan and Chad. The fighters killed between 10,000 and 15,000 people (including the governor of West Darfur state) and drove most survivors off their land. But so far, no charges have been brought against Hemedti, his lieutenants, or any of the commanders of the SAF, who themselves are responsible for many abuses in other theaters of war. One of the Biden administration's last acts was to declare that the RSF was responsible for genocide, and in his early 2025 confirmation hearing, Rubio agreed with this determination. The United States has imposed financial and travel sanctions on Hemedti, but these have failed to have any discernible impact.

Over the course of decades, many Sudanese fighters have become so confident that they will face no real consequences for genocidal acts that they now advertise such practices to terrorize any who stand in their way. Impunity reigns. In videos recently circulated by RSF fighters, they have forced their victims—before they were killed—to crawl and make animal sounds while calling them dogs, donkeys, or slaves. As the RSF has pillaged residential neighborhoods in Khartoum and elsewhere, committing murder and sexual assault and vandalizing schools, hospitals, and government offices, its fighters have continued promoting their most gruesome deeds and telegraphing their intent. They have promised to avenge any attack by the government tenfold and to wipe out any communities that resist them. In its siege of El Fasher, the RSF blocked aid and trade and intercepted all who tried to flee, overrunning a nearby camp for displaced people in April and killing hundreds, including nine nurses.

It is little wonder, then, that Hemedti and his band of killers remain unbothered by calls for accountability from the United States, European governments, and the United Nations. In late October, Hemedti did arrest one commander who was notorious for flaunting his crimes. But terror is simply woven into Hemedti's modus operandi. RSF forces have encircled the city of El Obeid, the SAF's main garrison on the road to Khartoum, and overrun the nearby town of Bara, killing 50 civilians—including five Red Crescent humanitarian workers who were distributing aid. Because the SAF (and especially its Islamist brigades) is also responsible for grave abuses, many Sudanese worry that the SAF's rage and fear will further escalate the catastrophe.

Determinations of genocide, investigative commissions, and sanctions are nowhere near enough to curb the killing—nor are most of the peacemaking efforts mustered thus far. Days after the war broke out in 2023, the United States and Saudi Arabia summoned the RSF and the SAF to Jeddah for cease-fire talks. The two sides dutifully signed a “Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan” but then ignored its promises entirely.

It soon became clear that both Burhan and Hemedti believed they could win, or at least gain a decisive battlefield advantage—and, moreover, that they could each marshal enough foreign sponsors to sustain their violent campaigns. The United Arab Emirates quickly became the war's most significant foreign patron, putting its weight behind the RSF. Although Abu Dhabi consistently denies backing the RSF, the evidence is overwhelming that it has armed the militant group, including with sophisticated drones. A coalition of other Middle Eastern powers, meanwhile, led by Egypt and Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, are arming the SAF—including its powerful Islamist brigades. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are rivals on the Arabian Peninsula, and UAE leaders were not going to accept Riyadh running peace talks without an equal say.



Although foreign backing has made it possible for Sudan's generals to fight their war, that backing also creates leverage for ending it. The road to peace in Sudan runs through Abu Dhabi, Cairo, and Riyadh. The Biden administration knew this, but it failed to acknowledge that top-level leaders such as President Joe Biden himself or Secretary of State Antony Blinken would have to force these three capitals to set aside their differences long enough to impose a humanitarian truce. Instead, they placed responsibility for shepherding a peace process in the hands of the State Department's Africa Bureau, which did not have the leverage to succeed.

Rubio grasped the formula that his predecessor had shunned by creating the “Quad”—a dialogue comprising the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE—and putting a special envoy close to President Donald Trump, Massad Boulos, in charge day to day. The Quad's template is workable: it calls for a cease-fire, humanitarian access, and political talks toward the formation of a civilian government. But the Biden administration's missed opportunities has made Rubio's job tougher; the scale of the atrocities has hardened each faction's determination to fight on. Earlier this year, the UAE was dragging its feet. But it was the SAF's Islamist faction—which is backed by Qatar and Turkey—that sabotaged the Quad talks in Washington at the end of October. Burhan had agreed on the Quad's template with his closest sponsor, Egypt. But unlike Hemedti, whose word is the RSF's law, Burhan heads a fractious coalition, and the Islamists vetoed a deal at the last moment.

The day after the talks collapsed, the RSF launched a full-scale assault on El Fasher. If Abu Dhabi gave Hemedti the green light, however, it surely did not anticipate the wave of revulsion that would follow the RSF's killings or the reputational damage that the UAE would suffer. Rubio's formula remains the right one. The backers of the SAF's Islamist faction, however—Qatar and Turkey—need to be brought into the room, as does Trump himself. It remains unlikely that the UAE will draw back its support for the RSF's military campaign or that other foreign actors will make serious and necessary concessions unless Trump wields direct pressure. Rubio, Boulos, and their counterparts in Arab capitals and in Ankara can work out the details, but the theatrics of a true deal require the Oval Office as a stage.

Without quick action, the RSF and its drones will close in on Khartoum, and the SAF will almost certainly attempt a vengeful counterattack. However terrible the war and its consequent famine in Sudan is today, it can still get much worse.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","US flights could soon get slashed if the shutdown continues. Here's what to know if you're about to fly","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/flight-cuts-government-shutdown-travel","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:03:10 GMT","


            Millions of Americans expecting to fly this month could have their plans grounded if the government shutdown drags on.
    


            Starting Friday, the Trump administration will reduce flights at 40 airports nationwide if the shutdown continues.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration's “Core 30” airports are among those on a preliminary list of sites expected to be impacted, an FAA source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN. 



            Here's what to know if the travel nightmare turns into reality Friday:
    


The “Core 30” high-traffic airports include New York City's three major hubs and large airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington, DC, the source said.
    


            Another 10 airports across the country are expected to be impacted.
    


            “As we start to implement this drawdown in service, it will be restricted to these 40 high-volume traffic markets,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We're going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules.”
    


Trump administration will reduce traffic at 40 airports across the US starting Friday if shutdown continues



            Flight volume will be reduced by 10%, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Thursday. But he did not say whether that's 10% of the flight volume at the 40 impacted airports, or 10% of all US flights – which would be significantly more.
    


            Either way, a 10% reduction could result in thousands of canceled flights a day – an unprecedented cut.
    


            “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram.
    


            “Don't book a basic ticket. For example, book Economy on Frontier so you can reuse the ticket value as changes are free or you can get a credit,” Biffle wrote. “If your flight is cancelled your chances of being stranded are high so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline.”
    


            Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are both offering waivers to allow passengers who do not want to fly to change their tickets without fees.
    


Is it safe to fly during the government shutdown? Here's what aviation experts say



            It's also helpful to book directly with an airline instead of through a third-party website. That's because if your flight gets canceled, you might have to deal with another party to resolve the problem.
    


            And try to avoid booking flights with layovers, the US Public Interest Research Group says. The more planes you have to get on to reach your destination, the more chances there are for a flight to be delayed or canceled.
    


            The government shutdown, which started on October 1, has prevented many federal employees from getting paid.
    


            Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are considered essential employees during the shutdown and are expected to go to work. But they're not getting paid, and some have needed to find other sources of income to pay the bills.
    


            More than 400 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis.
    


            The longer the shutdown drags on, the more risks could emerge – especially as controllers go longer without pay, a union leader said earlier this week. But federal officials say reducing the number of flights will improve safety.
    


            “We're supposed to go to work and be 100%, 100% of the time. I'm going to work right now, and I'm thinking about, how do I pay my rent?” said Nick Daniels, the president of the union.
    


            “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” Daniels told CNN earlier this week.
    


            But the newly announced flight cuts will help maintain safety, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
    


            “THIS is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system, and it's the right thing to do,” National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy posted on X.
    


            “NTSB has repeatedly stated low air traffic control staffing levels, mandatory overtime, and six-day work weeks have a direct impact on #safety.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The GOP starts to confront what Trump's power grabs will mean when Democrats are in charge","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/trump-power-grabs-gop-democrats-analysis","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:00:01 GMT","


            For nine months, congressional Republicans have largely stood idly by as President Donald Trump has gone to great lengths to try to expand the power of the presidency, demolish norms and disregard laws.
    


            But increasingly, the implications of those power grabs are starting to come into focus – and specifically, what they might mean when the shoe is on the other foot the next time Democrats are in charge.
    


            And Republicans seem to be starting to reckon with that.
    


            Perhaps most striking was a scene Wednesday at the Supreme Court, during oral arguments in a challenge to Trump's worldwide tariffs.
    


            The day prior, a CNBC host had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent whether he worried about a Democratic president abusing the power Trump was claiming. Host Joe Kernen posited that this future president could levy large tariffs on energy based solely on a declaration that there was a climate change emergency. Bessent demurred, saying, “I would question whether there's a climate emergency.”
    


            But that's not really the point. The point is that the Trump administration has more or less argued that it wouldn't matter if there was actually a climate emergency; it says all that really matters is that a president would say there's one, and that the courts lack the authority to question that.
    


            While Bessent was able to squirm out of this hypothetical on Tuesday, the Trump administration wasn't so fortunate at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
    


            In fact, three justices – including Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch – pressed the Trump administration's solicitor general, D. John Sauer, on this exact hypothetical.
    


            Gorsuch asked whether a president could impose a 50% tariff on gas-powered cars and auto parts by simply claiming a climate emergency.
    


            Sauer, like Bessent, cast doubt on whether that declaration would be accurate. But he otherwise acknowledged: “It's very likely that could be done. Very likely.”
    


            When Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether anyone would be able to challenge that declaration, Sauer suggested the bar would be sky-high.
    


            “That would be a situation where at least there'd be a very, very, very deferential judicial review of that kind of determination,” Sauer said. He again emphasized the courts' review should be “very, very deferential and easily satisfied.”
    


            The exchanges laid bare the potential cost of tariff-skeptical Republicans' acquiescence to Trump.
    


            Trump is attempting to set a precedent that his own administration says could be wielded by a liberal president in huge ways that Republicans would very much not like.
    


            (Of course, Congress could simply assert its power over tariffs and prevent all that. But that would require actually standing up to Trump.)
    


            Another example in recent days is the burgeoning GOP debate over getting rid of the filibuster.
    


            Trump seems to have settled on the so-called “nuclear option” as his recipe for ending the now-record-breaking federal government shutdown. He wants Republican senators to make it so that legislation only requires a bare majority (which Republicans currently have) rather than the currently required 60 votes.
    


            Trump has long desired this, of course. But the current debate has apparently given him a good opportunity to break down one of his most significant remaining obstacles.
    


            But it's also led to some rather unusual and pretty firm pushback among Republicans. Their argument: This would be a disaster when Democrats have power.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly predicted Democrats would add Democratic senators by making Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states. He's said they would pack the Supreme Court to overturn the current conservative advantage. And he's said they would restrict gun rights, among other liberal grab-bag policies.
    


            “(The filibuster) holds us back from the Democrats' worst impulses,” Johnson said this week.
    


            Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania have made similar points.
    


            “And listen: Just imagine a world where there's no filibuster and you have the crazy radical part of the Democratic Party in charge,” McCormick told Fox News over the weekend. “We would become a country of socialism.”
    


            Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered similar warnings after Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel over a joke about Trump and Charlie Kirk. Cruz compared it to mob tactics and called it “dangerous as hell.”
    


            “Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again – wins the White House … they will silence us,” Cruz said. “They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.”
    


            We even saw a smattering of these kinds of objections to Trump's extraordinary deployments of the National Guard around the country.
    


            “I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina,” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told The Hill last month.
    


            Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt in comments to the New York Times warned his fellow Republicans about the precedent set by a president working with governors of other states to impose National Guard troops on a state where officials didn't want that.
    


            “We believe in the federalist system — that's states' rights,” Stitt said, adding: “Oklahomans would lose their mind if (Gov. JB) Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”
    


            Washington state Republican Party Chairman Jim Walsh has also reportedly raised concerns about future presidents overusing the National Guard.
    


            And Vice President JD Vance last week was pressed on such a hypothetical during a Turning Point USA event. A student told him the Guard deployments were “kind of disturbing me a little bit,” because of how Democrats might use such a precedent against conservatives.
    


            Vance urged the student not to worry about such things.
    


            “It's an important part of my entire political philosophy – is we cannot be afraid to do something, because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said. “The left is already going to do it, regardless of whether we do it.”
    


            Of course, there is no actual evidence Democrats have prepared to do such things with the National Guard.
    


            Indeed, former President Barack Obama recently wondered aloud what the right would say if he imposed the National Guard on a red state like Texas. “It is mind-boggling to me how Fox News would have responded,” Obama said.
    


            And this is also an area in which the administration has basically claimed unchecked presidential power when pressed by judges.
    


            During an appeals-court hearing back in June, a Trump-appointed judge asked top DOJ official Brett Shumate if it was the Trump administration's position that a president's decision to call up militias from all 50 states and the District of Columbia was un-reviewable by the courts. Shumate said that it was.
    


            In other words, Obama, under this line of thinking, would indeed have been able to send the Guard into Texas, no questions asked.
    


            These kinds of hypotheticals haven't caused Republicans to truly move to check Trump's power, at least not yet. But if anything, the elections this week, in which Democrats won pretty resoundingly, should remind them that the shoe could be on the other foot relatively soon.
    


            Of course, Trump has an answer for that, too. Maybe if he just gets all the power, he'll make it so Democrats never actually win power again.
    


            “Now, if we do what I'm saying (on the filibuster), they'll most likely never attain power,” Trump told GOP senators on Wednesday. “Because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.”
    


            It seems unlikely GOP senators will actually buy into that.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Curio is a CNN Style series spotlighting small objects and the big ideas behind them.



            In an age when clocks are found in most pockets and on every screen, watchmaker Col&MacArthur's selling point is not just time, but history itself.
    


            Known for using unconventional materials — from Pearl Harbor seawater to meteorite moondust — in the name of horological storytelling, the brand is now commemorating the D-Day landings with a series of watches made from US soldiers' helmets and haversacks, as well as sand from the beaches of Normandy.
    


            “People are not buying this watch because it tells the time,” the company's CEO Sébastien Colen said on a call from Belgium, where the former energy executive co-founded the company in 2013. “It's because it is bringing them back somewhere in the past.”
    


            Colen had spent three years developing a prototype for his Normandie 1944, a luxury watch featuring metal from an M-1, the standard-issue helmet used by the US Army during World War II. Sourced from a military memorabilia trader in Dallas, Texas, the helmet was flattened in a press, rather than with a hammer, to preserve its original markings and imperfections. The resulting metal sheet was then cut into circles that can be incorporated into dials and inserted in the watches' 43-millimeter cases at the brand's studio in Liège, Belgium.
    


            The pieces are being produced to order, meaning the number of helmets required depends on how many are sold. (One M-1 contains enough metal for “about 20” watches, Colen said.) The watchmaker is currently accepting orders via a Kickstarter campaign, which has raised over $86,000 at the time of publication.
    


            Elsewhere, the design features a small capsule of Normandy sand and a strap made from an M-1928 haversack, the backpacks widely used by the US Army during World War II. The dial displays a historical map of Omaha Beach, a codename given to one of the five landing areas — alongside Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword Beaches — used by Allied troops on D-Day.
    


            Operation Neptune, as it is also known, was the largest amphibious invasion in history, marking a major turning point in the war. The M-1 was worn by the vast majority of the 73,000 US troops who landed in Normandy — either on the beaches or as airborne troops — on June 6,1944. The helmets' one-size-fits-all design comprised a manganese steel outer shell and an adjustable inner lining that was attached to a leather chinstrap.
    


            In the absence of markings identifying the wearer, it is often impossible to trace individual helmets to specific soldiers or battles. And although Col&MacArthur cannot guarantee that each M-1 helmet it uses was worn during the D-Day landings, certificates of authenticity from the dealer, Gustafsons, confirm that they were used during the wider liberation of Europe.
    


            Col&MacArthur will produce two versions of the watch, the varying prices reflecting differences in their internal mechanisms. The premium “Legacy” edition (priced at $1,749 and limited to a symbolic run of 1,944 units) features a Swiss-made movement, while the standard version (priced at $699) uses a cheaper Japanese movement.
    


This watch was carved from a meteorite that hit Earth a million years ago



            Colen came up with the idea while at Belgium's Ciney Militaria, one of the world's largest military collectibles fairs. He then visited Normandy to speak to locals and familiarize himself with the landings' geographical context. “It's very important that we go on site, to feel it,” he explained.
    


            Unlike the helmets and haversacks, the sand presented a legal hurdle: Taking sand from any French beach is prohibited by law. Normandy's D-day sites are commonly targeted by souvenir-seekers (France's Ministry of Culture has meanwhile asked UNESCO to afford them World Heritage status), and although authorities tolerate people taking small amounts for personal use, doing so at scale or for commercial purposes can attract fines of 1,500 euros ($1,724).
    


            Colen instead sought permission from a local mayor, whose office advised him to collect sand that had naturally blown from Sword Beach onto a neighboring road. “If we want to respect the memory, it's very important that we do these things properly,” Colen said.
    


            Other ethical considerations will arise as the watches go into production. Among them is the question of whether to use stained parts of the haversacks — possibly containing blood — on the straps' reverse side, or to cut around them entirely. “It's tricky, because some people could be offended. But on the other hand, for me, it's something that's very important to show,” Colen said, without offering a definitive answer to how he will approach this dilemma. “It's a question of authenticity.”
    


            Then there is the wider moral question of whether historical artifacts should ever be intentionally destroyed. M-1 helmets were mass produced, with over 20 million made between 1941 and 1945 — and they are relatively common on the collectors' market, where they typically fetch hundreds, rather than thousands, of dollars each. But Colen understands why people might criticize his decision to recycle them into luxury items.
    


The Broker, The Astronaut and The Vampire: Enter the mysterious world of Soviet watch collectors



            “Every time we do a project, we really question ourselves, ‘Is it is it respectful?'” he said, before referencing Winston Churchill's quote that those who “fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”
    


            “This is exactly what is happening today,” he argued. “So, instead of having a helmet sitting in a warehouse, it's on a watch, it's providing emotion and it's reminding us, every single day, of events of the past.”
    


            Col&MacArthur's short history is rooted in British, rather than American, military tradition. Originally a collaboration between Colen and former British serviceman Iain Wood, the company was founded 12 years ago to produce watches for the country's Scots Guards, the latter's erstwhile regiment. The pair later designed pieces for various regiments of the Royal Guards, the sentries protecting Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace in London.
    


            In 2017, Col&MacArthur began work on a line of watches marking the centenary of World War I — one of which was presented to French president Emmanuel Macron. The watch's success heralded a pivot towards timepieces centered on major historical figures and events. “Without knowing at the time, I was already working on our first commemorative watches,” Colen said.
    


            In the years since, the watchmaker has released collections based on more than a dozen themes, from Leonardo da Vinci to the Battle of Britain. Many of them contain “tangible” artifacts, including moon dust from a lunar meteorite (used in watches dedicated to the Apollo 11 mission) and water from Pearl Harbor (trapped between sapphire crystals in watches commemorating the Japanese attack on America's naval base there in 1941).
    


            If its latest crowdfunding campaign exceeds $100,000, Col&MacArthur will start putting money toward its next collection: timepieces memorializing the Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany's last campaign on the Western Front. Colen plans to incorporate fragments of a shell, dropped on the Belgian city of Bastogne, into the watches' design.
    


            “For every single watch, we really try to integrate something unique,” he said.

    CNN's Isobel Yeung traveled to Libya to investigate refugees being tortured for ransom. Subscribe to watch the full report.



            From the living room of her third-floor apartment in rural Germany, Abeba winces as she stares at her phone.
    


            “This will be my final message,” her younger brother Daniel says in an audio message. “I understand that you may not have the financial means to assist me directly, and I never expected that from you. Please, just make sure my message reaches those who might be able to help.”
    


            She and her husband don't know exactly where her brother is. Somewhere in southern Libya. They've heard it's an area called Kufra. What they do know is that every time he calls, or they receive a video, he's being mercilessly tortured by men who remain off camera. Videos seen by CNN show Daniel being tied up, urinated on, kicked, and beaten with a metal pole. CNN is using pseudonyms for Daniel and Abeba because they fear retribution.
    


            If his family doesn't manage to gather the $10,000 being demanded by his captors, he may soon be dead.
    


            CNN has spoken to dozens of individuals and families in their situation. Daniel is just one of an unknown number of migrants who are currently being tortured on a near daily basis, somewhere in Libya's Sahara Desert.
    


            Libya, in North Africa, has long been the transit country of choice for those hoping to travel across the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. At the northeast corner of the Sahara Desert, its vast wilderness marks the final leg on the African continent for those fleeing war, persecution, and lack of opportunity in search of a better life.
    


            The passengers on this dangerous route change over time as conflicts ebb and flow. Recently, the vast majority have been coming from Sudan, embroiled in a brutal civil war which has displaced millions.
    


            Inevitably, human smuggling is big business.
    


            Much of it is relatively functional – insofar as clients pay several hundred dollars to be transported in bare-bones conditions to Libya's coast, and onto an overcrowded inflatable dingy bound for Italy or Greece.
    


            But if someone is unlucky enough to come from a country perceived to have a large diaspora – wealthy, at least compared to everyone else – then they stand a good chance of falling into the hands not of smugglers, but of traffickers, who coerce and exploit those in their control.
    


            Eritreans, who make up the second largest share of refugees recorded in Libya according to the United Nations, fall into this group. Their dictatorial hermit nation is often called Africa's North Korea. Many thousands flee its mandatory, indefinite military service – and some fall prey to exploitative trafficking gangs.
    


            This is what happened to Abeba's brother.
    


            Flying over the Sahara in the back of a Soviet-era Mi-17 twin-turbo helicopter, it's clear to see how the traffickers operate with such impunity.
    


            The desert is vast. The barren Martian landscape stretches as far as the eye can see, interrupted only occasionally by the faintest of tire tracks marking the unpaved road on Libya's north-south route.
    


            “We are doing our best with the capabilities that we have,” Col. Mohammad Hassan Rahil says from the desert hilltop post he commands near the Sudanese border.
    


            His forces are part of the Libyan National Army and live in a small, air-conditioned compound, surrounded by hundreds of miles of desert on all sides. They drive up and down the sandy tracks and stop any suspicious vehicles. But the traffickers know this terrain far better than they do. To an observer, their efforts appear futile in the extreme.
    


            That's plain to see in Al Jawf, the first major settlement migrants encounter as they transit Libya's vast Kufra province from south to north.
    


            From the fetid and overcrowded cells of the town's migrant detention center, officers pick out a Sudanese man who had been arrested the day before.
    


            They believe him to be “a money man” – helping to transfer money between relatives of trafficking victims who live abroad, like Abeba, and the traffickers both in Libya and in foreign safe havens who profit from the industry.
    


            “I receive them, then deduct my commission,” he readily tells the interrogator of the payments. CNN is not identifying him because he was not formally charged.
    


            The industry is highly compartmentalized. Many of the payments are sent through an informal money transfer system known as “hawala.” Because it is widely used to send legitimate remittances and operates entirely on a human-to-human level via text messages and phone calls, it is nearly impossible to track.
    


            “Does he torture them?” the interrogator asks the Sudanese man of the trafficker to whom he allegedly transfers money.
    


            It is entirely feasible that this man has no idea the extent of the sordid industry he is facilitating.
    


            “Only God knows,” the Sudanese man replies.
    

Torture videos are currently circulating on social media – and being sent to families around the world. Thousands of dollars in ransoms are demanded in exchange for their freedom. CNN traveled to Libya's Sahara Desert to investigate this global trafficking ring.


            But he does have some useful information. The trafficker and his “passengers” were operating from a farm not even a kilometer from the police base.
    


            The police set off to raid the premises. But by the time the convoy of pickup trucks arrives there, it's too late. Foreign passports and bedding are strewn across the rooms, but both captors and victims are long gone.
    


            When the traffickers are stopped, it's usually because of luck, not advanced police work. Three years ago, two Sudanese men stumbled into a police station in the desert town of Tazirbu.
    


            They explained that they'd just escaped from a nearby farm, where hundreds of other men were being held for ransom – beaten as their families were extorted for money.
    


            Police geared up and stormed the compound, using a hoe to knock the padlock off a door inside. In grainy footage taken that August day, dozens of men streamed out of the cramped room in which they were confined and yelled “Allahu Akbar!” as they walked into the sunlight, their arms held to the sky.
    


            As the police gathered them in the courtyard, they began yelling and pointing at one man who had not been in the room with them: their captor.
    


            His name is Tsinat Tesfay – an Eritrean man in his mid 30s. Convicted last year of “forced disappearance,” he is now serving a life sentence at Benghazi Central Prison, where CNN was granted extraordinary access to speak with him. Benghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army, under commander Khalifa Haftar, rather than the divided country's internationally recognized Government of National Unity.
    


            “I didn't do anything,” Tesfay told CNN. “I only say that it was a mistake that I came to Libya. Just that.”
    


            The trafficker groups are often an eclectic mix – Libyans alongside nationals from the migrants' native lands, who translate on the ransom calls to families, and are often the enforcers for payments.
    


            The money rarely stays in Libya. In 2023, Emirati forces operating in Sudan arrested Kidane Zekarias Habtemariam, an alleged Eritrean trafficking kingpin, and rendered him to the UAE. He is awaiting extradition to the Netherlands, where prosecutors are planning to try him. He has not yet entered a plea, according to prosecutors.
    


            A Dutch court is already set to hear a case this month against another Eritrean man, who has been charged with allegedly being part of a criminal organization that specializes in human smuggling, taking hostages, extortion, and violence including sexual violence.
    


            Tesfay claims that he himself was trafficked by Kidane's network – a victim, not a perpetrator. He denies seeing anyone tortured.
    


            “I haven't seen or heard anything,” he said. “I haven't seen anything in front of me. I am in a warehouse, I eat, I drink, paid my money (to be smuggled through Libya), then I was taken out.”
    


            There is nothing, he said, to read into the fact that he was free to roam the compound when police arrived on the scene. And yet, when questioned on why so many Eritreans join the trafficking networks in Libya, the explanation he gives is clear.
    


            “They want money,” Tesfay said. “They want money, so they work in trafficking. They want to change their lives.”
    


            It's a simple explanation with profound consequences.
    


            In Benghazi's Ganfuda Detention Center, dozens of young women and girls crowd the floor of a warehouse strewn with foam mattresses and the plastic-bag detritus of an itinerant life.
    


            Most of the people here have already paid the ransoms demanded and been released from captivity in the Sahara. They've since been picked up by local authorities and detained for illegal entry into Libya. Now they await help from the United Nations or non-governmental organizations – help that often takes months to arrive.
    


            Among them is a 16-year-old Eritrean teenager, whom CNN is calling Abrihet because she is a minor.
    


            “These guys, they touched me,” she says of her former captors. “They touch you. Your hand. Your leg. I can't explain it.”
    


            A government-provided doctor in Benghazi has confirmed she's not pregnant, but that's the extent of the help she's received so far. Every day, the women and girls around her sob in traumatic memory of what happened to them. Each has their own heart-wrenching story of abuse and misery.
    


            Abrihet looks down at her forearms, which are criss-crossed with the scars of self-harm.
    


            “I want to die too much. I want. But I can't… I want to die, but I cannot do it.”
    


            For girls like Abrihet, it is impossible to contemplate how this network of abuse is allowed to continue, year after year.
    


            Responsibility for stopping it falls on Col. Mohammed Al-Fadhil, from Libya's Department for Combating Illegal Migration (DCIM). In a divided country, with rival governments, the agency is an oddity in operating nationwide, in both the internationally recognized west and the Haftar-controlled east and south.
    


            The situation, he insists, is much better than it once was. But the international community needs to step up.
    


            “Look, this matter requires participation by states,” he said. “It's a partnership issue. All countries should share it. The whole European Union, the countries impacted by illegal migration. They should all be partners to eradicate the phenomenon.”
    


            In 2016, the European Union struck a deal with Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli that funded Libyan forces to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. It resulted in a sharp drop in people taking what is known as the Central Mediterranean route from North Africa to Europe over the next few years, but also meant they were often held in squalid Libyan detention centers.
    


            The number of migrants braving the dangerous crossing has been rising in recent months, particularly between eastern Libya and Greece, where it is up more than three-fold in a year. And Eritreans are among those most likely to take the risk – they are now the second-largest national group arriving in Italy, after Bangladeshis.
    


            Human rights groups have accused DCIM of maintaining inhumane conditions and using violence against migrants. A UN experts panel alleged that those migrants freed during the Tazirbu raid were subject to further abuses at the hands of DCIM. Al-Fadhil said that the accusation was “useless if it is not accompanied by clear evidence.”
    


            There were just over 100,000 refugees and asylum-seekers registered in Libya as of October. But the true number of those in Libya fleeing conflict is undoubtedly much larger, because the UN – which registers refugees – only operates in areas controlled by the internationally recognized government in western Libya. UN officials have appealed for help in expanding their efforts to help the influx of Sudanese refugees in Libya.
    


            Haftar, who controls eastern and southern Libya, runs a government unrecognized by the United States or European powers. It is just one of the many reasons why increasingly heightened anti-immigration sentiment in Europe has not translated into more cooperation to stop southern Libya's smugglers and traffickers.
    


            Following months of agony and fundraising, Abeba was eventually able to send enough money to pay for her brother Daniel's release. He is now in Libya's western city of Tripoli: still far from being reunited with his family.
    


            But her distress over seeing him so brutally abused – and losing her entire family's life savings to secure his freedom – has broken her.
    


            “May God punish them for what they did,” she cried. “How many mothers are crying blood and tears for their children and loved ones? I beg you, tell this story to the world.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years.

But access to the drugs has been a consistent problem for patients because of their cost — around $500 a month for higher doses — and insurance coverage has been spotty.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved.

“(It) will save lives, improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” said Trump, in an Oval Office announcement in which he referred to GLP-1s as a “fat drug.”

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Drugmakers Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. 

As with the other deals, it's not clear how much the price drop will be felt by consumers. Drug prices can vary based on the competition for treatments and insurance coverage.

The obesity drugs work by targeting hormones in the gut and brain that affect appetite and feelings of fullness. In clinical trials, they helped people shed between 15% and 22% of their body weight -- up to 50 pounds or more in many cases.

Patients taking these drugs usually start on smaller doses and then work up to larger amounts, depending on their needs. Because of obesity being considered a chronic disease, they need to take the treatment indefinitely or risk regaining weight, experts say. 

The fast-growing treatments have proven especially lucrative for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co. and Novo Nordisk. Lilly said recently that sales of Zepbound have tripled so far this year to more than $9 billion.

But for many Americans, their cost has made them out of reach.

Medicare, the federally funded coverage program mainly for people ages 65 and over, hasn't covered the treatments for obesity. President Donald Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, proposed a rule last November that would have changed that. But the Trump administration nixed it last spring.

Few state and federally funded Medicaid programs, for people with low incomes, offer coverage. And employers and insurers that provide commercial coverage are wary of paying for these drugs in part because of the large number of patients that might use them.

The $500 monthly price for higher doses of the treatments also makes them unaffordable for those without insurance, doctors say.

Medicare now covers the cost of the drugs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but not for weight loss alone.

The effort to lower costs barriers to popular GLP-1 drugs comes as the White House is looking to demonstrate that Trump is in touch with Americans' frustrations with rising costs for food, housing, health care and other necessities.

“Trump is the friend of the forgotten American,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at Thursday's announcement. “Obesity is a disease of poverty. And overwhelmingly these drugs have only been available for people who have wealth.” 

Kennedy had previously expressed skepticism to GLP-1s in fighting obesity and diseases related to the condition. But he was full of praise for Trump for pushing to help a broader segment of Americans have access to the drug.

The announcement came after Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia faced a drubbing in Tuesday's election in which dour voter outlook about the economy appeared to an animating factor in the races. 

Roughly half of Virginia voters said “the economy” was the top issue, and about 6 in 10 of these voters picked Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor, powering her to a decisive win, according to an AP voter poll.

In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won about two-thirds of voters who called “the economy” the top issue facing the state, the poll found. She defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. More than half of New York City voters said the cost of living was the top issue facing the city. The Democratic mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won about two-thirds of this group.

The White House sought to diminish the effort by the previous Democratic administration as a gift to the pharmaceutical industry because the proposal did not include adequate price concessions from the drug makers.

Trump, instead, consummated a “belt and suspenders” deal that ensures that Americans aren't unfairly financing the pharmaceutical industry's innovation, claimed a senior administration official, who briefed reporters ahead of Thursday's Oval Office announcement by Trump.

Another senior administration official said coverage of the drugs will expand to Medicare patients starting next year. Medicare will start covering the treatments for people who have severe obesity and others who are overweight or obese and have serious health problems, the official said. Those who qualify will pay $50 copays for the medicine.

Lower prices also will be phased in for people without coverage through the administration's TrumpRx program, which will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers. starting in January.

The officials said lower prices also will be provided for state and federally funded Medicaid programs. And starting doses of new, pill versions of the obesity treatments will cost $149 a month if they are approved. Administration officials said the average price of the drugs sold on TrumpRx will start at around $350 and then drop to $245 over the next two years.

The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House.

Dr. Leslie Golden says she has roughly 600 patients taking one of these treatments, and 75% or more struggle to afford them. Even with coverage, some face $150 copayments for refills.

“Every visit it's, ‘How long can we continue to do this? What's the plan if I can't continue?,'” said Golden, an obesity medicine specialist in Watertown, Wisconsin. “Some of them are working additional jobs or delaying retirement so they can continue to pay for it.”

Both Lilly and Novo have already cut prices on their drugs. Lilly said earlier this year it would reduce the cost of initial doses of Zepbound to $349.

Dr. Angela Fitch, who also treats patients with obesity, said she hoped a deal between the White House and drugmakers could be the first step in making the treatments more affordable.

“We need a hero in obesity care today,” said Fitch, founder and chief medical officer of knownwell, a weight-loss and medical care company. “The community has faced relentless barriers to accessing GLP-1 medications, which has ultimately come down to the price, despite the data we have supporting their effectiveness.”

Powerful Democratic former speaker Nancy Pelosi won't seek reelection to the U.S. House. Pelosi's announcement brings to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.




WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi will not seek reelection to the U.S. House, bringing to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday.

“I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said in a video address to voters.

Pelosi, appearing upbeat and forward-looking as images of her decades of accomplishments filled the frames, said she would finish out her final year in office. And she left those who sent her to Congress with a call to action to carry on the legacy of agenda-setting both in the U.S. and around the world.

“My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,” she said. “We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way.”

Pelosi said, “And now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.” 

The decision, while not fully unexpected, ricocheted across Washington, and California, as a seasoned generation of political leaders is stepping aside ahead of next year's midterm elections. Some are leaving reluctantly, others with resolve, but many are facing challenges from newcomers eager to lead the Democratic Party and confront President Donald Trump.

Pelosi, 85, remains a political powerhouse and played a pivotal role with California's redistricting effort, Prop 50, and the party's comeback in this month's election. She maintains a robust schedule of public events and party fundraising, and her announced departure touches off a succession battle back home and leaves open questions about who will fill her behind-the-scenes leadership role at the Capitol.




Former President Barack Obama said Pelosi will go down in history as “one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.”

An architect of the Affordable Care Act during Obama's tenure, and a leader on the international stage, Pelosi came to politics later in life, a mother of five mostly grown children. She has long fended off calls for her to step aside by turning questions about her intentions into spirited rebuttals, asking if the same was being posed of her male colleagues on Capitol Hill.

In her video address, she noted that her first campaign slogan was “a voice that will be heard.”

And with that backing, she became a speaker “whose voice would certainly be heard,” she said.

But after Pelosi quietly helped orchestrate Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, she has decided to pass the torch, too.

Last year, she experienced a fall resulting in a hip fracture during a whirlwind congressional visit to allies in Europe, but even still it showcased her grit: It was revealed she was rushed to a military hospital for surgery — after the group photo, in which she's seen smiling, poised on her trademark stiletto heels.

Pelosi's decision also comes as her husband of more than six decades, Paul Pelosi, was gravely injured three years ago when an intruder demanding to know “Where is Nancy?” broke into the couple's home and beat him over the head with a hammer. His recovery from the attack, days before the 2022 midterm elections, is ongoing.

Ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Pelosi faced a potential primary challenge in California. Newcomer Saikat Chakrabarti, who helped devise progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's political rise in New York, has mounted a campaign, as has state Sen. Scott Wiener.

While Pelosi remains an unmatched force for the Democratic Party, having fundraised more than $1 billion over her career, her next steps are uncertain. First elected in 1987 after having worked in California state party politics, she has spent some four decades in public office.

Pelosi's legacy as House speaker comes not only because she was the first woman to have the job but also because of what she did with the gavel, seizing the enormous powers that come with the suite of offices overlooking the National Mall.

During her first tenure, from 2007 to 2011, she steered the House in passing landmark legislation into law — the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in the aftermath of the Great Recession and a repeal of the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy against LGBTQ service members.

With President Barack Obama in the White House and Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada leading the Senate, the 2009-10 session of Congress ended among the most productive since the Johnson era.

But a conservative Republican “tea party” revolt bounced Democrats from power, ushering in a new style of Republicans, who would pave the way for Trump to seize the White House in 2016.

Determined to win back control, Pelosi helped recruit and propel dozens of women to office in the 2018 midterm elections as Democrats running as the resistance to Trump's first term.

On the campaign trail that year, Pelosi told The Associated Press that if House Democrats won, she would show the “power of the gavel.”

Pelosi became the first speaker to regain the office in some 50 years, and her second term, from 2019 to 2023, became potentially more consequential than the first, particularly as the Democratic Party's antidote to Trump.

Trump was impeached by the House — twice — first in 2019 for withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine as it faced a hostile Russia at its border and then in 2021 days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Senate acquitted him in both cases.

Pelosi stood up the Jan. 6 special committee to probe Trump's role in sending his mob of supporters to the Capitol, when most Republicans refused to investigate, producing the 1,000-page report that became the first full accounting of what happened as the defeated president tried to stay in office.

After Democrats lost control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi announced she would not seek another term as party leader.

Rather than retire, she charted a new course for leaders, taking on the emerita title that would become used by others, including Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California during his brief tenure after he was ousted by his colleagues from the speaker's office in 2023.

President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years.

Access to the drugs has been limited because of their costs — around $500 a month for higher doses — and spotty insurance coverage.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage.

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters.

Still, it's unclear how much the price drop will be felt by consumers. Drug prices can vary based on the competition for treatments and insurance coverage.

A few minutes after the event was abruptly ended, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a statement saying that “a representative with one of the companies fainted” but that “The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay.”

She didn't identify the man, but said the drug price event would resume shortly.

It had featured executives from drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.

A judge said Thursday she will order federal agents in Chicago to restrict using force against peaceful protesters and media, saying current practices violate their constitutional rights.

The preliminary injunction came in response to a lawsuit alleging federal agents have used excessive force in their immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

U.S District Judge Sara Ellis‘s ruling, which is expected to be appealed by President Donald Trump's administration, refines an earlier temporary order that required agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain riot-control techniques, such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. After repeatedly chastising federal officials for not following her previous orders, she added a requirement for body cameras.

Ellis began Thursday's hearing by describing Chicago as a “vibrant place” and reading from poet Carl Sandburg's famous poem about the city. 

Ellis said it is “simply untrue” that the Chicago area is a violent place of rioters.

“I don't find defendants' version of events credible,” Ellis said.

The president's drug price announcement ended abruptly when a man standing near Trump in the Oval Office collapsed.

Officials rushed to help the man after his collapse, and the press was quickly removed. It was unclear what caused the collapse or who the man was.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. had previously expressed skepticism to GLP-1s in fighting obesity and drugs diseases related to the condition. 

But Kennedy was full of for praise of Trump for pushing to help a broader segment of Americans have access to the drug.

“It's not a panacea, it's not a silver bullet,” Kennedy noted. 

He added, “Trump is the friend of the forgotten American. Obesity is a disease of poverty. And overwhelmingly these drugs have only been available for people who have wealth.”

Introducing the officials who joined him for the announcement in the Oval Office, Trump asked or commented on who has or hasn't used any of the weight-loss medications he calls the “fat drug.”

“Do you take any of this stuff, Howard?” Trump asked Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “Not yet,” Lutnick replied.

“He doesn't take it,” Trump said when he got to Dr. Mehmet Oz, director of Medicare and Medicaid services.

Trump introduced a few others before he asked for “Steve,” referring to him as “head of public relations for the White House.”

“He's taking it,” the president said of Steven Cheung, who is the White House director of communications.

Former president Barack Obama said “No one was more skilled at bringing people together and getting legislation passed — and I will always be grateful for her support of the Affordable Care Act.”

In a post he said, “She made us proud to be Democrats, and will go down in history as one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.”

Trump has unveiled a deal with drug makers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years.

But access to the drugs has been a consistent problem for patients because of their cost, and insurance coverage has been spotty.

Jeffries wants information about the Trump administration's layoffs and Federal Aviation Administration changes and that have been underway even before the shutdown.

“We need a full and complete briefing so we can understand from the administration what the current status is, what the impact of administration layoffs have been, prior to the Trump Republican shutdown,” Jeffries of New York said during a press conference at the Capitol.

He said the administration “has been going after the FAA since the beginning of their time in office, since January 20th, and we need to understand how we got to this moment, separate and apart from the Trump Republican shutdown.”

The Trump administration is lifting a four-year-old arms embargo on Cambodia that had been imposed over the country's increasing military ties and partnership with China after Cambodia and Thailand agreed to a truce in their border conflict last month.

The move will take effect Friday after the formal publication of an official notice in the Federal Register, according to an announcement made Thursday. It had been previewed by various U.S. officials in late October following the signing of an agreement between the Thai and Cambodian prime ministers at a summit in Malaysia that President Trump witnessed.

The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off on the step “based on Cambodia's diligent pursuit of peace and security, including through renewed engagement with the United States on defense cooperation and combating transnational crime.” It means that arms sales requests from Cambodia will now be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and not automatically be subject to denial. It will also lift restrictions on third countries providing Cambodia with U.S. weapons.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Thursday he would not guarantee Democrats a vote on extending enhanced tax credits for those with coverage through the Affordable Care Act.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has offered Democrats such a vote as part of the way out of the government shutdown.

Asked whether he would do the same, Johnson said the House had already done its job in passing a short-term funding patch.

“I'm not promising anybody anything,” Johnson said.

Johnson also rejected the idea that congressional leaders get together and negotiate a compromise on extending the enhanced tax credits that make coverage more affordable.

“We're not taking four corners, four leaders in a back room and making a deal and hoisting it upon the American people,” Johnson said. “I'm not going to be a part of that.”

They include airports in Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, and San Francisco.

In some of the biggest cities — such as New York, Houston and Chicago — multiple airports will be affected.

The U.S. on Thursday sanctioned three men from Lebanon and Syria for allegedly helping to funnel tens of millions of dollars from Iran to the militant Lebanese group Hezbollah.

The Treasury Department says the men use exchange houses to take advantage of Lebanon's cash-based financial sector and funnel the money from Iran to support Hezbollah.

Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said “we will work with our Lebanese partners to create a resilient economy that puts the interests of all Lebanese citizens front and center.”

While plans to reopen the federal government remain stalled, the shutdown's impact continues to grow. The Federal Aviation Administration said it will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 markets starting Friday, and millions will go without SNAP benefits even as the Trump administration says it will partially fund the program in November.






The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

The president gave the remarks on Pelosi's retirement exclusively to a reporter broadcasting on Fox News' “America's Newsroom.”

Pelosi led the House in impeaching Trump twice during his first term — first over withholding military support for Ukraine as it confronted Russian aggression and later after inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. He was acquitted both times by the Senate.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the political old guard is being “repudiated,” though he commended Pelosi for her service.

Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice.

United Airlines said it would focus the cuts on smaller regional routes that use smaller planes like 737s. United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly — even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable.

The head of Frontier Airlines recommended travelers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded.

Air traffic controllers are working without pay during the government shutdown and have been increasingly calling off work. 

Controllers already have missed one paycheck and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as as the shutdown drags on and the financial pressure on them mounts.

The FAA has already been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers.

Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune opened what's seen as a pivotal day in efforts to end the government shutdown by keeping all options open.

“I think it's all going to be subject to whether or not it looks like there's a path to wind this down, this weekend,” Thune said.

He added that the next step is getting a response from Democrats on the offer before them, “and then we'll see where they go with that.”

Asked whether the Senate would cancel its recess next week, Thune said he's “not ruling anything out at this point.”

Jeffries of New York is in line to become the speaker himself if the party regains control of the chamber in next year's election.

“The United States is a much better nation today because Nancy Pelosi dedicated her life to serving the children, the climate, the country and the American people,” Jeffries said in a statement.

“Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi is an iconic, heroic, trailblazing, legendary and transformational leader. She is the greatest Speaker of all time,” he said.

“House Democrats will always be down with NDP.”

Airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago along with hubs across the U.S. are among the 40 that will see flights cut starting Friday due to the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines and obtained by The Associated Press.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the ongoing government shutdown.

As House Speaker, she became the Democratic Party's antidote to President Trump.

Trump was impeached by the House — twice — first in 2019 for withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine as it faced a hostile Russia at its border and then in 2021 days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Senate acquitted him in both cases.

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi will not seek reelection to the U.S. House, bringing to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.

Pelosi, who's represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday.

“I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said in a video address to voters.

President Trump has warned the United States will be rendered “defenseless'' and possibly “reduced to almost Third World status” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he imposed this year on nearly every country on earth.

The justices sounded skeptical during oral arguments Wednesday of his sweeping claims of authority to impose tariffs as he sees fit.

The truth, though, is Trump will still have plenty of options to keep taxing imports aggressively even if the court rules against him. He can re-use tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression.

“It's hard to see any pathway here where tariffs end,” said Georgetown trade law professor Kathleen Claussen. “I am pretty convinced he could rebuild the tariff landscape he has now using other authorities.”

Travelers through some of the busiest U.S. airports can expect to learn Thursday whether they'll see fewer flights as the government shutdown drags into a second month.

The Federal Aviation Administration will announce the 40 “high-volume markets” where it's reducing flights by 10% before the cuts go into effect Friday, said agency administrator Bryan Bedford. The move is intended to keep the air space safe during the shutdown, the agency said.

Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be canceled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

Central to any resolution will be a series of agreements that would need to be upheld not only by the Senate but also by the House and the White House, which is not at all certain in Washington.

Senators from both major parties, particularly the members of the powerful Appropriations Committee, are pushing to ensure the normal government funding process in Congress can be put back on track. Among the goals is guaranteeing upcoming votes on a smaller package of bills to fund various aspects of government such as agricultural programs and military construction projects at bases.

More difficult, a substantial number of senators also want some resolution to the standoff over the funding for the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at year's end.

During the shutdown in Trump's first term, the government was partially closed for 35 days over his demands for money to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. At that time, he met publicly and negotiated with congressional leaders. Unable to secure the money, he relented in 2019.

This time, it's not just Trump declining to engage in talks. The congressional leaders are at a standoff, and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson sent lawmakers home in September after they approved their own funding bill, refusing further negotiations.

Now at 37 days, it's the longest in U.S. history.

While some Democrats saw Trump's comments on the shutdown Wednesday as evidence that he'd soon get more involved, he's largely stayed out of the fray. Instead, the talks have intensified among a loose coalition of centrist senators trying to negotiate an end to the shutdown.

Trump has refused to negotiate with Democrats over their demands to salvage expiring health insurance subsidies until they agree to reopen the government. But skeptical Democrats question whether the Republican president will keep his word, particularly after his administration restricted SNAP food aid despite court orders to ensure funds are available to prevent hunger.

Grassroots Democratic groups nationwide touted Tuesday's election results as voter approval of the shutdown strategy — and warned lawmakers against cutting a deal too soon.

“Moderate Senate Democrats who are looking for an off-ramp right now are completely missing the moment,” said Katie Bethell, political director of MoveOn, a progressive group. “Voters have sent a resounding message: We want leaders who fight for us, and we want solutions that make life more affordable.”

Some Senate Democrats echoed that sentiment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats and a leading voice in the progressive movement, said Democrats “have got to remain strong” and should secure assurances on extending health care subsidies — including “a commitment from the speaker of the House that he will support the legislation, and that the president will sign.”

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities confirmed Thursday that the remains of a hostage returned the previous day from Gaza are of a Tanzanian agricultural student in Israel who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023 in the Hamas-led attack that started the war.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the remains were identified as those of Joshua Loitu Mollel and that his family has been notified. The development was the latest step forward under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. 

Mollel, 21, had arrived at kibbutz Nahal Oz only 19 days before the attack, after finishing agricultural college back home and looking to gain experience in Israel he could apply in Tanzania. He is survived by two parents and four siblings in Tanzania.

“Joshua's return offers some comfort to a family that has endured unbearable uncertainty for over two years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement.




There are now six bodies of hostages that remain in Gaza. The territory's militants have released 22 bodies of hostages since the ceasefire began last month. Among the six bodies still in Gaza is that of Sudthisak Rinthalak, an agricultural worker from Thailand, the only non-Israeli.

Hamas returned 20 living hostages to Israel on Oct. 13. The subsequent exchanges of the dead are the central component of the initial phase of the deal which requires Hamas return all hostage remains as quickly as possible. 

The exchanges have gone ahead even as Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching other terms of the agreement.

Israel has handed over 285 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which handles the exchanges. 

Health officials in Gaza have said identifying the remains handed over by Israel is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits. Israel has not disclosed how many bodies it is holding or where they were recovered, but has been returning 15 for each set of hostage remains handed over. 

Hamas has said that recovering bodies is complicated by the widespread devastation in the coastal enclave and has returned one to three bodies every few days. Israel has pushed to speed up the returns. In several cases, the remains have turned out not to be those of hostages. 

Separately, Israeli concerns over weapons smuggling with the use of drones along its 200-kilometer (130-mile) border with Egypt prompted the the country's defense minister on Thursday to order a border area be designated as a closed-off military zone to curb the illegal activity. 

Israel Katz said troops would also be authorized to fire on smugglers operating in the zone, according to a statement from his office.

“Anyone who enters the unauthorized area will be harmed,” said Katz.

Katz on Wednesday met with top military and security officials who also agreed to work on designating arms smuggling as a terrorist threat so that “security forces deploy appropriate tools to combat the threat.” 

U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan calls for an international stabilization force for Gaza and diplomats are working to define its role, persuade Arab countries to take part, and win wider international support.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the force would need the legitimacy of a U.N. Security Council mandate. 

The United States said Wednesday that representatives from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates met with 10 non-permanent U.N. Security Council members about getting support for a U.N. Security Council resolution on Gaza.

Also, the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said Wednesday the bloc is looking to extend the mandates of its two current missions helping the Palestinian Authority train a police force and bolster security procedures as a way to contribute to the stabilization force. 

A freed Israeli hostage said he was stripped naked and beaten by Palestinian militants who held him for two years in Gaza. His testimony makes him the latest of several hostages released from Gaza to report being sexually abused in captivity.

Parts of Ron Braslavski's account was published in the Daily Mail newspaper, ahead of the full interview set to air on Israel's Channel 13 later on Thursday night.

In the clips, Braslavski said his captors had starved and sexually abused him and he recounts how he prayed for the abuse to stop.

“It was sexual violence and its main purpose was to humiliate me,” he said. “While I was there — every day, every beating — I'd say to myself, ‘I survived another day in hell.'” 

Braslavski was a guard at the Nova musical festival and was captured by the militants who overran the grounds during the October 2023 attack on southern Israel. He was released last month as part of the ceasefire agreement.

Released Palestinians who had been seized from Gaza during the war and held in Israeli prisons have reported being stripped down to their underwear during their initial detention and frequent beatings by guards, as well as sexual abuse, being bound for days, causing infections that led to amputations of limbs in some cases, and insufficient food or medical care. 

At least 75 Palestinians have died in Israeli prisons and detention facilities during the war, according to the U.N. The Israeli military has said it abides by international standards in its prisons.

The 2023 attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel sweeping military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that it will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 “high-volume” markets beginning Friday morning to maintain safety during the ongoing government shutdown.

Airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are among 40 of the busiest across the U.S. where flights will be cut starting Friday due to the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines and obtained by The Associated Press.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday it would reduce air traffic by 10% across “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers go unpaid and exhibit signs of strain during the shutdown.

The affected airports in more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the U.S., including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities — such as New York, Houston and Chicago — multiple airports will be affected. 




The FAA is imposing the flight reductions to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the government shutdown and have been increasingly calling off work. The move also comes as the Trump administration is ramping up pressure on Democrats in Congress to end the shutdown.

Controllers already have missed one full paycheck and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as the shutdown drags on.

The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers.



Passengers should start to be notified about cancellations Thursday. Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. 

What to do if you're facing flight disruptions during the government shutdownStaffing shortages have caused flight delays at a growing number of airports as disruptions pile up nationwide. Here is what to know about your rights as a passenger.

My flight was canceled. Now what? If you are already at the airport, it is time to find another flight. Airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. You can ask to be booked on another airline, but airlines aren't required to put you on another carrier's flight. It is often hit or miss.

Am I owed a refund? If your flight is canceled and you no longer want to take the trip, or have found another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. 



United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly, even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable. 

The head of Frontier Airlines recommended that travelers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded.

The cuts also could disrupt package deliveries because two airports with major distribution centers are on the list — FedEx operates at the airport in Memphis, Tennessee, and UPS in Louisville, Kentucky, the site of this week's deadly cargo plane crash.

The cuts could affect as many as 1,800 flights, or upward of 268,000 passengers, per day, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

Airlines are used to dealing with cutting thousands of flights on short notice during severe weather, but the difference now is that these cuts during the shutdown will last indefinitely until safety data improves. 

“I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday. “We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”

Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said that few cities will be spared because some airlines have indicated they will focus on reducing routes to and from small and medium-sized cities.

“This is going to have a noticeable impact across the U.S. air transportation system,” said Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group.



Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Most work mandatory overtime six days a week, leaving little time for side jobs to help cover bills and other expenses unless they call out. 

Mounting staffing pressures are forcing the agency to act, Bedford said. 

“We can't ignore it,” he said.

Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that they would meet with airline executives to figure out how to safely implement the reductions. 

Major airlines, aviation unions and the broader travel industry have been urging Congress to end the shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest on record.

The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system and “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience,” said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement.

Duffy warned earlier this week that there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paycheck next week.

He said some controllers can get by missing one paycheck, but not two or more. 



Staffing can run short both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don't always lead to flight disruptions. Throughout October, flight delays caused by staffing problems had been largely isolated and temporary.

But the past weekend brought some of the worst staffing issues since the start of the shutdown.

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

Hours after Democrats scored major wins in elections nationwide, President Donald Trump addressed the results, saying they're not “good for anybody.” Trump blamed the government shutdown in part for GOP losses and demanded the Senate end the filibuster.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Elections this week that energized Democrats and angered President Donald Trump have cast a chill over efforts to end the record-breaking government shutdown, raising fresh doubts about the possibility of a breakthrough despite the punishing toll of federal closures on the country.

Trump has increased pressure on Senate Republicans to end the shutdown — now at 37 days, the longest in U.S. history — calling it a “big factor, negative” in the poor GOP showings across the country. Democrats saw Trump's comments as a reason to hold firm, believing his involvement in talks could lead to a deal on extending health care subsidies, a key sticking point to win their support.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune opened what's seen as a pivotal day in efforts to end the government shutdown by saying the next step hinges on a response from Democrats to an offer on the table. 

“It's in their court. It's up to them,” Thune told reporters Thursday.

But Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer held firm in opening remarks Thursday, saying voters “fired a political torpedo at Trump and Republicans” in Tuesday's election. 

“Donald Trump clearly is feeling pressure to bring this shutdown to an end. Well, I have good news for the president: Meet with Democrats, reopen the government,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Trump is refusing to meet with Democrats, insisting they must open the government first. But complicating the GOP's strategy, Trump is increasingly fixated instead on pushing Republicans to scrap the Senate filibuster to speed reopening — a step many GOP senators reject out of hand. He kept up the pressure in a video Wednesday, saying the Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass legislation should be “terminated.”




“This is much bigger than the shutdown,” Trump said. “This is the survival of our country.”

Senate Democrats face pressures of their own, both from unions eager for the shutdown to end and from allied groups that want them to hold firm. Many see the Democrats' decisive gubernatorial wins in Virginia and New Jersey as validation of their strategy to hold the government closed until expiring health care subsidies are addressed.

“It would be very strange for the American people to have weighed in, in support of Democrats standing up and fighting for them, and within days for us to surrender without having achieved any of the things that we've been fighting for,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.

Meanwhile, talks grind on, but the shutdown's toll deepens. On Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced plans to reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 high-volume markets beginning Friday to maintain safety amid staffing shortages. Millions of people have already been affected by halted government programs and missed federal paychecks — with more expected as another round of paydays approaches next week.

Grassroots Democratic groups nationwide touted Tuesday's election results as voter approval of the shutdown strategy — and warned lawmakers against cutting a deal too soon.

“Moderate Senate Democrats who are looking for an off-ramp right now are completely missing the moment,” said Katie Bethell, political director of MoveOn, a progressive group. “Voters have sent a resounding message: We want leaders who fight for us, and we want solutions that make life more affordable.”

Some Senate Democrats echoed that sentiment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats and a leading voice in the progressive movement, said Democrats “have got to remain strong” and should secure assurances on extending health care subsidies — including “a commitment from the speaker of the House that he will support the legislation and that the president will sign.”

Still, how firmly the party remains dug in remains to be seen. Some Democrats have been working with Republicans to find a way out of the standoff, and they held firm after the election that it had not impacted their approach. 

“I don't feel that the elections changed where I was,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo. “I still feel I want to get out of the shutdown.”

Some Republicans also shared in Trump's concerns that the shutdown is becoming a drag on the party. 

“Polls show that most voters blame Republicans more than Democrats,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “That's understandable given who controls the levers of power.”

While some Democrats saw Trump's comments on the shutdown Wednesday as evidence he'd soon get more involved, he's largely stayed out of the fray. Instead, the talks have intensified among a loose coalition of centrist senators trying to negotiate an end to the shutdown.

Trump has refused to negotiate with Democrats over their demands to salvage expiring health insurance subsidies until they agree to reopen the government. But skeptical Democrats question whether the Republican president will keep his word, particularly after his administration restricted SNAP food aid despite court orders to ensure funds are available to prevent hunger.

Trump's approach to the shutdown stands in marked contrast to his first term, when the government was partially closed for 35 days over his demands for money to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. At that time, he met publicly and negotiated with congressional leaders. Unable to secure the money, he relented in 2019. 

This time, it's not just Trump declining to engage in talks. The congressional leaders are at a standoff, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent lawmakers home in September after they approved their own funding bill, refusing further negotiations.

Johnson dismissed the party's election losses and said he's looking forward to a midterm election in 2026 that'll more reflect Trump's tenure.

In the meantime, food aid, child care money and countless other government services are being seriously interrupted. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or are expected to work without pay.

Central to any resolution will be a series of agreements that would need to be upheld not only by the Senate but also by the House and the White House, which is not at all certain in Washington.

Asked if the House would guarantee a vote on extending health care subsidies if the Senate struck a deal, Johnson said Thursday, “I'm not promising anybody anything.”

Senators from both major parties, particularly the members of the powerful Appropriations Committee, are pushing to ensure the normal government funding process in Congress can be put back on track. Among the goals is guaranteeing upcoming votes on a smaller package of bills to fund various aspects of government such as agricultural programs and military construction projects at bases.

More difficult, a substantial number of senators also want some resolution to the standoff over the funding for the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at year's end. 

With insurance premium notices being sent, millions of people are experiencing sticker shock on skyrocketing prices. The loss of enhanced federal subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic and come in the form of tax credits, are expected to leave many people unable to buy health insurance.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has promised Democrats at least a vote on their preferred health care proposal, on a date certain, as part of any deal to reopen government. But that's not enough for some senators, who see the health care deadlock as part of their broader concerns with Trump's direction for the country.

House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., shredded Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for failing to get his party to vote to end the ongoing federal government shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sharply diverged from his Senate counterpart on Thursday as the upper chamber continues to negotiate a way out of the government shutdown.

Johnson said he would not commit to holding a vote on extending COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year without congressional action.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., however, had been floating a vote on such an extension in exchange for Democrats voting to end the shutdown — which is now in its 37th day.

""Leader Thune has bent over backwards. He's offered them a vote. You know what they told him in response? ‘No, we need you to guarantee the outcome of that vote.' Well, that's ridiculous,"" Johnson said when asked about holding such a vote by a guaranteed date in the House if the deal succeeds in breaking the logjam.

When pressed again on a vote, he said, ""No, because we did our job, and I'm not part of the negotiation.""

""The House did its job on Sept. 19. I'm not promising anybody anything. I'm going to let this process play out,"" Johnson said.

The issue of enhanced Obamacare subsidies has been a matter of debate within the GOP, with some Republicans in more moderate districts calling for at least a year-long extension to give lawmakers time to create a new healthcare deal in its place.

But House conservatives are rejecting any such extension out of hand. Fox News Digital first reported that leaders of the 189-member Republican Study Committee issued an official position earlier Thursday demanding the credits not be extended.

It's been a key ask for Democrats, however, that such an extension be paired with any federal funding bill before they agree to help end the shutdown.

Senate Democrats are huddling on Thursday afternoon to discuss what they could and could not accept out of a deal to end the government shutdown.

There are a dozen in the caucus who have been meeting to find a way out of the shutdown, but following Democrats' Tuesday night election sweep, many in their caucus feel emboldened that their shutdown strategy is working and don't want to let up yet.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he believed Tuesday's election was ""having an impact"" on the caucus.

""It would be very strange for the American people to weigh in, in support of Democrats, standing up and fighting for them, and then within days, for us to surrender without having achieved any of the things that we've been fighting for,"" Sen. Chris Murphy said.

The majority of the caucus demands a guarantee on a deal rather than the promise of a process, given that a proposal to extend the expiring subsidies from Democrats without major reforms to the program would likely fail in the Republican-controlled chamber.

But Thune has remained adamant that he can't promise anything more than a vote and can't predict an outcome.

""I made this very clear to them, I can't guarantee them an outcome,"" Thune said. ""I can guarantee them a process, and they can litigate the issue, get the vote on the floor, and presumably they have some way of getting a vote in the House at some point, but I can't speak for the House.""

Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of ISIS murder victim Kayla Mueller, exclusively spoke with Fox News Digital on their endorsement of Kash Patel to lead the FBI.

EXCLUSIVE: The parents of slain American aid worker Kayla Mueller, Carl and Marsha Mueller, have written an emotional open letter to President Donald Trump, asking him to use his upcoming meeting with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to bring their daughter's remains home 10 years after she was killed by ISIS.

The letter, shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, comes just days before al-Sharaa's first visit to Washington since taking power following the collapse of the Assad regime. The Muellers called the encounter ""a providential opportunity"" to close one of the most painful chapters of the war in Syria.

SYRIA'S NEW PRESIDENT TAKES CENTER STAGE AT UNGA AS CONCERNS LINGER OVER TERRORIST PAST

American Kayla Mueller, 26, was killed while in the hands of ISIS, her family said Tuesday. 

""Ten long years have passed since our daughter's body found its resting place, unmarked and unknown, somewhere in the crimson folds of Syria's hills,"" the Muellers wrote. ""Kayla's body has not been returned home to us; her story remains incomplete.

Kayla Mueller was a 26-year-old humanitarian aid worker from Arizona who was kidnapped by ISIS in 2013 while helping Syrian refugees near the Turkish border. She was enslaved by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who reportedly abused and murdered her in 2015. Her body was never recovered.

The family's letter recounts how, in 2019, Operation Kayla Mueller — ordered by President Trump — led to the death of al-Baghdadi in northern Syria. Standing with Trump at the 2020 Republican National Convention, the Muellers credited him for ""delivering the iron fist of justice against unspeakable evil.""

RUBIO, HUCKABEE MEET WITH FAMILIES OF US CITIZENS WHOSE REMAINS ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE IN GAZA

With Assad's ouster and Syria now under an interim government, the Muellers say the political landscape has shifted dramatically. They praised growing regional cooperation to locate missing Americans and cited Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., who has personally visited Damascus to advocate for her return.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Hamadeh said, ""I was sworn into Congress with my hand resting on Kayla Mueller's Bible, with my family and Kayla's parents standing by my side. I vowed to them that I would do everything I could to bring her home. In their letter to President Trump, Kayla's parents wrote about how Kayla was killed attempting to ‘bring light to the darkest corner of the earth — and in her own darkest hour her spirit refused to break.' That is why I refuse to give up on bringing this remarkable young woman home to her family.""

""The Assad regime has fallen, and with new leadership brings new opportunity to write the final chapter on Americans still missing in Syria,"" the Muellers wrote. ""Through your leadership, we believe the torch Kayla was forced to drop has roared back to life.""

The Muellers described Trump's meeting with al-Sharaa as a defining moment — both for U.S. foreign policy and for their family's decade-long quest for closure.

They ended the letter with a plea: ""Your meeting is sure to inspire real hope across Syria's war-torn streets. Bringing Kayla's body home will do the same for every American heart, and together we will slam shut the era of terror's reign in Syria and finally bring closure to Kayla's story. This is a moment to reaffirm America's resolve: that we never abandon our own. One more push could bring Kayla home.""

On Wednesday's episode of ""Straight Shooter,"" host Stephen A. Smith asked where the money to fund New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's initiatives will come from, arguing his biggest fans aren't ""people who pay bills every day.""

FIRST ON FOX: A House GOP lawmaker is proposing to block federal funds from New York City for as long as Zohran Mamdani is mayor.

Forthcoming legislation led by Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., is called the Moving American Money Distant from Anti-National Interests Act, or the ""MAMDANI Act"" for short.

The two-page bill text stated that ""notwithstanding any other provision of law, during any period in which Zohran Mamdani is mayor of New York, New York"" that ""any unobligated Federal funds available"" for the city ""are hereby rescinded"" and that ""no Federal funds may be obligated or expended for any purpose to New York, New York.""

It is expected to be introduced on Friday, Fox News Digital was told.

The 34-year-old socialist won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.

His victory was not a surprise to election watchers; New York City has not elected a Republican mayor since Michael Bloomberg won a second term in 2005.

While Carter's bill is not likely to be taken up in the House, it's a symbol of how the GOP has been hyper-focused on Mamdani's win, with Republican leaders in the House positioning him as the new leader of the Democratic Party.

A House Republican campaign operative signaled to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the GOP would seek to tie vulnerable Democrats across the country to Mamdani and his far-left platforms.

Carter, who is running for U.S. Senate in Georgia, said taxpayer dollars from his state ""should not be wasted on programs that will bankrupt the financial capital of the world.""

""If New Yorkers want communism, we should let them have their wish and not artificially prop them up with our successful capitalist system,"" Carter said. ""Any New Yorker with common sense is welcome to move to the great, FREE state of Georgia.""

Historically, New York State has sent more taxpayer dollars to the federal government than it takes in federal dollars.

A federal judge in Illinois ordered authorities at an ICE facility near Chicago to improve the living conditions for detainees following complaints this week.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman ordered the facility to ensure that detainees have access to a clean bedding mat and sufficient space to sleep, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste, menstrual products and prescribed medications.

""People shouldn't be sleeping next to overflowing toilets,"" Gettlemen wrote. ""They should not be sleeping on top of each other.""

The ruling comes after detainees filed a lawsuit last week. They complained at a Tuesday hearing of crowded sleeping conditions, non-functioning toilets and water that tasted like ""sewer.""

Gettlemen's order further requires that detainees' living facilities must be cleaned twice per day and that detainees be given the chance to shower at least once every other day. They must also have access to three meals a day and bottled water upon request, according to NBC News.

DOJ attorney Jana Brady, who represented the government at Tuesday's hearing, argued that conditions at the facility had already been improving for several months. She said the lack of bed space is a result of the facility not being intended for long-term housing.

""You have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers.

The Miami-Dade Sheriff's Office recently announced a bold experiment that could redefine the future of law enforcement. The department introduced the Police Unmanned Ground Vehicle Patrol Partner, or PUG, which it claims is America's first fully autonomous patrol vehicle. 

Developed with the nonprofit Policing Lab and Perrone Robotics, the SUV can drive itself, detect suspicious activity through artificial intelligence-powered cameras and even deploy drones for aerial surveillance.

According to the Sheriff's Office, the year-long pilot program is designed to explore how advanced technology can improve public safety, extend deputy resources and increase efficiency. The vehicle will initially operate on predetermined patrol routes and will have a deputy seated in the front during testing. Sheriff Rosie Cordero Stutz called it a way to ""set the standard for what will be the future of law enforcement in this country.""

The PUG Patrol Partner is packed with high-tech features. It integrates with police databases, license plate readers and crime analytics software in real time. Its 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging sensors allow it to identify people or vehicles in restricted areas, even in low-light conditions. The vehicle can also launch drones equipped with thermal cameras to monitor larger areas or assist in active incidents.

The PUG represents a new approach to community safety. Advocates call it a ""force multiplier"" that automates routine patrols, increases situational awareness and frees deputies to focus on complex human interactions. The Miami-Dade Sheriff's Office sees it as a partner, not a replacement, for human officers.

Still, questions remain about privacy, data collection and long-term costs. Although the first unit was donated, future vehicles could cost between $150,000 and $200,000 each. The trial period will measure the vehicle's impact on response times, deterrence, officer safety and public confidence. If the results are positive, Miami-Dade could become a national model for autonomous policing.

For people in Miami-Dade County, the arrival of the PUG could reshape how everyday policing looks and feels. You may soon see the self-driving vehicle patrolling neighborhoods, monitoring events and collecting information through its network of cameras and sensors. Its AI systems can process and respond to situations faster than human officers, raising new questions about transparency, accountability and how data from public spaces will be managed.

However, this project reaches far beyond Miami-Dade. Other law enforcement agencies are paying close attention to see whether the program succeeds. If it performs well, similar vehicles could begin appearing in major cities across the country. Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.

As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency. The results from Miami-Dade could influence how police departments nationwide use automation in the years ahead. This is a moment to pay attention, ask questions and help guide the direction of modern policing before it becomes standard practice everywhere.

Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's effort to denuclearize Russia, how Putin has responded to the remarks and him presenting the first-ever Honor Award at the Patriot Awards.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his country will draw up plans to conduct nuclear tests after President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would do the same last week.

The Kremlin leader said he has asked relevant departments to ""submit coordinated proposals regarding the possible commencement of work to prepare for nuclear weapons testing.""

""Russia has always strictly adhered and continues to adhere to its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and we have no plans to deviate from these commitments,"" Putin said at a meeting of the Russian national security council.

The treaty was signed but never ratified by the U.S.

If the U.S. or other signatories of the treaty begin nuclear testing, ""Russia would also have to take appropriate and proportionate responsive measures,"" Putin added.

In the past week, Trump has both announced the U.S. will reignite nuclear testing and suggested he is working on a deal to denuclearize with Russia and China.

""We redid our nuclear — we're the number one nuclear power, which I hate to admit, because it's so horrible,"" Trump said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami.

TRUMP STUNS WITH CALL TO RESUME NUCLEAR TESTS — WHY NOW, AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN

""Russia's second. China's a distant third, but they'll catch us within four or five years,"" he added. ""We're maybe working on a plan to denuclearize, the three of us. We'll see if that works.""

Last week, Trump announced on Truth Social, ""because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.""

The War Department handles the testing of nuclear-capable weapons, while the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) would be responsible for testing explosives.

Some 1400 workers, 80% of the NNSA, are currently on furlough due to the government shutdown.

The U.S. regularly tests nuclear-capable vehicles, missiles and rockets, but the U.S. has not conducted an explosive nuclear test since 1992. Russia's last known test was in 1990.

Russia last week did claim to test two delivery vehicles: an undersea torpedo known as Poseidon and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.

The U.S. conducted a nuclear-capable weapon test on Wednesday, launching the intercontinental ballistic missile Minuteman III into the air from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. It landed 4,200 miles away at a U.S. test site in the Marshall Islands.

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president who holds a top post on its security council, wrote on X that ""No one knows what Trump meant about ‘nuclear testing',"" adding, ""he probably doesn't himself.""

""But he's the president of the United States. And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself,"" Medvedev added.

Russia's defense minister, Andrey Belousov, said Wednesday that he believes the U.S. in general is ""actively increasing its strategic offensive capabilities.""

""We must, of course, focus not only — or even primarily — on statements and remarks made by American politicians and officials, but above all on the actual actions of the United States of America.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Tension flares between Trump officials Pam Bondi and Kash Patel","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3876142/tension-builds-between-trumps-top-officers-following-months-of-bonehead-screwups/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Concerns are brewing among Trumpworld insiders about an escalating feud between two of the president's top law enforcement officers.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have found themselves the focus of increased scrutiny in recent months, from both the media and President Donald Trump's base, on a host of issues ranging from the Jeffrey Epstein files to law enforcement's handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination. 

And following Patel's latest string of negative headlines, which involved taking an FBI jet to Pennsylvania to watch his girlfriend sing at a wrestling match and jumping the gun on announcing FBI actions to foil an alleged terrorism plot on Halloween, two other senior Trump administration officials told the Washington Examiner that they have heard “rumors” that Bondi is exploring ways to replace Patel atop the FBI.

“I don't want to say it's exactly saving her own skin, because I do think [Bondi] has a very good personal relationship with President Trump, but these repeated, just bonehead screwups from the FBI director reflect poorly on her and the entire department,” one senior Trump official explained. “So I'm not surprised that she wants him gone. To be honest, I would have been a little shocked to hear the opposite.”

The second Trump official pointed to Bondi's appointment of former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to serve as co-deputy director of the FBI in August. Bailey took office in September and shares duties with co-Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a close ally of Patel who himself has feuded with Bondi over the Epstein case.

“Kash barely squeaked through this spring,” that person said. “Getting another FBI director confirmed doesn't seem likely ahead of the midterms, and it seems to me that Bailey was brought in to be the guy, not Bongino, to take over on an acting basis if Patel gets fired.”

One longtime, out-of-government Trump adviser told the Washington Examiner that they had not specifically heard about any attempts by Bondi to undermine or oust Patel but confirmed that the pair have “never been tight” and that their relationship has devolved since the spring.

That person stated that Bondi “isn't a f***ing intellectual heavyweight,” but remains an “adept operator.”

“She was, obviously, [Florida's] attorney general for a long time. Pam knows [chief of staff] Susie [Wiles] very well. Pam has a good relationship with POTUS, and oftentimes, the ‘small-P' internal politics is more important than the broader politics, and Pam's always been good at that, so I would not want to be on the other side of a fight against her,” they continued. “The problem with Kash is, it's not like he has a real base of support. I feel like he sort of squandered all the goodwill he had with MAGA personality types with Epstein and just general weirdness. I mean, ‘I'll see you in Valhalla, brother?‘ That was the cringiest thing ever. Just, holy s***.”

The Valhalla comment was in reference to Patel's tribute to Kirk upon announcing the arrest of the man accused of murdering the Turning Point USA co-founder.

White House officials told the Washington Examiner that Bondi has not approached the president about replacing Patel but did not answer questions about whether any White House advisers have had to step in to mediate between the attorney general and FBI director recently.

“President Trump has full faith and confidence in both Attorney General Bondi and FBI Director Patel,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. “The Attorney General is doing a tremendous job leading the DOJ and making America Safe Again, and Director Patel is restoring integrity to the FBI. The entire Trump Administration will continue working closely together to implement the President's agenda, despite nonsense gossip amplified by the media.”

Justice Department officials chose not to comment on this story. Ben Williamson, the FBI's assistant director for public affairs, told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “grateful for Attorney General Bondi's leadership of the Justice Department, and our teams are working day and night together to deliver on President Trump's agenda and keep Americans safe.”

Persons familiar with both the main DOJ and the bureau, granted anonymity to discuss internal matters freely, sought to downplay the apparent feud.

“AG Bondi has bigger things to worry about, like running the DOJ and defending the administration's agenda in court, which she's doing with a remarkably high success rate,” a DOJ source stated. “The FBI is part of DOJ, and the most important thing above all is to ensure that no disclosure of information imperils a conviction.”

An FBI source claimed to have “been told that [Bondi] has been annoyed [by Patel] many, many times,” and pointed to the messaging dynamics between the FBI and the wider department as a root cause of the tension.

TRUMP CONCEDES GOP HAD BAD ELECTION NIGHT AND DEMANDS SENATORS TURN PAGE, NUKE FILIBUSTER, AND END SHUTDOWN

“We do something, arresting 50 people in a nightclub, for example, and then we're done,” the source said. “And then, basically, DOJ is the one that puts out the press release, puts out all the statements, runs the entire [messaging] operation. I can see an argument for that to some level, but at the same time, if you've got 30 FBI agents out there doing the work, then I can also see why somebody like Kash would come in and be like, ‘That's bulls***. We're going to announce and give credit where [it's due] to the people that did the job.' So that certainly has ruffled some feathers.”

“She had a lot of early missteps to put her in hot water fully, and she feels like, every time the FBI comes out and announces something and does work, that it kind of takes away an opportunity for her to kind of rebound fully,” the source added. “I'm not even faulting her for that part of it. I understand. It's just this is the first time where the FBI itself has touted the work that they're doing, versus letting DOJ come out and announce it and take all the credit.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Off the road and up in flames: Inside Winsome Earle-Sears's losing campaign","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3876966/inside-winsome-earle-sears-losing-campaign/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

LEESBURG, VIRGINIA — When Winsome Earle-Sears's campaign bus caught fire on a Virginia highway days before the election, it offered a fitting metaphor for a gubernatorial bid that never found its footing and ultimately went up in flames.

Earle-Sears, the Republican lieutenant governor who once made history as the first Black woman elected in Virginia, lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger by nearly fifteen points on Tuesday. Earle-Sears's blowout even stunned veteran operatives accustomed to Virginia's blue tilt. What began as an attempt to extend Gov. Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) conservative blueprint ended in disarray, undone by weak fundraising, muddled messaging, and a candidate critics say never fully engaged the grind of a modern statewide campaign.

Virginia Republican strategist Brian Kirwin said Earle-Sears faced “the wind in her face the entire time,” noting that off-year elections typically punish the party in the White House. But he said her problems went far beyond the political environment. “Her campaign was pretty haphazard,” he said. “She ran a social-issues campaign on transgenders and bathrooms when everybody in the world is screaming [about the] economy.”

As of October 23, Spanberger had raised $65.6 million to Earle-Sears's $35.5 million, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. That gap shaped everything while Spanberger flooded the airwaves with ads on affordability and later tied Republicans to the October government shutdown. Earle-Sears stayed focused on cultural fights, spending more than $2 million in September alone on commercials about transgender athletes and school bathrooms, more than on any other topic.

The shutdown, which began just two weeks before Election Day, shuttered parts of the federal government and left tens of thousands of Virginians temporarily out of work or without pay. It became a rallying cry for Democrats, especially in Northern Virginia, where Spanberger blamed Republican dysfunction in Washington, D.C., for the disruption. 

Republican operatives say it was nearly impossible for Earle-Sears to blunt the impact. One strategist described it as “a perfect storm that juiced Democratic enthusiasm in exactly the parts of the state she needed to win.”

Rather than closing the race with a forward-looking pitch to voters, Earle-Sears poured millions into ads defending herself.  One of her final statewide spots, a six-figure buy, tried to reframe a viral moment when she told hecklers, “I'm speaking now.” Spanberger's campaign had looped the clip in a string of attack ads painting her as combative and unprepared. Earle-Sears's response, opening with, “They pick your worst day,” sought to cast the moment as proof of her grit as a Marine, but it only reinforced the image of a candidate more focused on explaining herself than persuading voters.

Kirwin said Earle-Sears's message never adjusted. “You can be a victim of your own polling,” he said. “You come off as tone-deaf when people are worried about paying their mortgage or being able to afford rent.”

Behind the scenes, Earle-Sears's campaign never gained traction. Even before the general election began, her candidacy showed signs of strain. In the spring, she narrowly avoided a primary challenge from former state Sen. Amanda Chase, a staunch Trump ally whose fiery brand of politics threatened to pull the race further right. Party officials ultimately ruled that Chase failed to submit enough valid signatures to make the ballot, sparing Earle-Sears a costly fight, but exposing early fractures among Virginia Republicans. 

By April, those divisions had deepened. Earle-Sears and her running mate, lieutenant governor hopeful John Reid, stopped speaking for weeks after Gov. Glenn Youngkin privately urged Reid, a Richmond radio host and the state's first openly gay statewide nominee, to suspend his campaign. The request came after allegations surfaced that Reid had reposted nude photos of men years earlier on a Tumblr account linked to his social media. The episode left the Republican ticket splintered for much of the spring, with candidates campaigning separately at a time when they needed to project unity.

The sense of dysfunction soon spilled into public view. In one embarrassing episode, the campaign's website featured watermarked stock photos on its issues page, prompting veteran GOP strategist Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 campaign, to deride Earle-Sears's team as “amateurs.” The blunder deepened doubts about whether Earle-Sears had assembled a team capable of running a modern statewide campaign.

Under mounting pressure from donors, Earle-Sears replaced her campaign manager, a pastor with no prior political experience, in an attempted reset. It didn't take. The shake-up did little to steady the campaign, as public events were limited, and advisers struggled to sharpen the message, with polls showing her trailing.

“She could never stay on message, could never drive a message, didn't grind it the way that you just have to in a place as difficult to win as Virginia,” said a Republican strategist based in Virginia.

Earle-Sears's aversion to fundraising added to the frustration. Several Republicans familiar with the operation said she often went days without making donor calls or holding events, instead taking “personal admin days.” By late summer, conservative radio host John Fredericks publicly urged Youngkin to “take control” of her campaign, calling its lack of visible activity “embarrassing.”

National GOP strategist Brian Seitchik was even blunter: “She was a miserable candidate. Ran a miserable campaign, and her loss was a foregone conclusion. She had no ability to connect with voters, no ability to raise the resources necessary, and was unable to win the confidence of Virginia independents.”The Washington Examiner reached out to Sears's campaign for this story.

The campaign's press operation was highly unorganized and largely unresponsive until the final stretch. Earle-Sears appeared on Fox News several times but granted few interviews elsewhere. Several Virginia outlets reported that their requests had been denied or ignored, including VPM News, which said it had reached out multiple times over two months to schedule an interview for its statewide candidate series, with no success.

Business groups had similar experiences. Cardinal News reported that Virginia FREE, a pro-business organization that meets with major candidates each cycle, tried for three months to secure a meeting with Earle-Sears while her Democratic opponent had already met with them. The pattern left reporters and business leaders uncertain about her positions on key issues as the race entered its final months.

The Earle-Sears campaign's struggles were compounded by the silence from the top of her party.

Trump's distance from Virginia politics is nothing new. In 2021, he endorsed Glenn Youngkin's campaign for governor. Still, he stayed off the trail as Youngkin kept him at arm's length, avoiding joint appearances and downplaying the MAGA agenda to win over suburban voters. The dynamic, though, was far different today. Back then, Trump was an unpopular former president. Now he's back in the White House.

Throughout this year's race, Trump kept Earle-Sears at a distance. He phoned into two brief get-out-the-vote calls for Virginia Republicans ahead of the election, urging voters to “vote Republican up and down the line” but never mentioning Earle-Sears by name. The gesture stood in sharp contrast to former President Barack Obama, who spent the weekend campaigning in person for Spanberger.

The omission appeared deliberate. Trump declined to issue a formal endorsement, referring to Earle-Sears only as “the Republican candidate” and saying he “hadn't been too involved in Virginia.” His list of social-media endorsements in the campaign's final days included dozens of other GOP hopefuls, but not her.

The distance reflected both political pragmatism and personal history. Earle-Sears drew Trump's ire in 2022 after suggesting he had become “a liability” to the party following midterm losses. Trump shot back, labeling her “a phony.” The two have maintained a polite but distant relationship ever since.

Strategists say that dynamic left Earle-Sears stranded, too cautious to embrace Trump but unable to energize his base without him. 

In the end, Earle-Sears's biggest problem wasn't money or organization; it was the message.

She built her candidacy around cultural flashpoints, devoting more time to transgender issues than to the economy, even as polls showed inflation and the cost of living were voters' top concerns. A September survey of likely Virginia voters by Christopher Newport University found that affordability was the dominant issue across the electorate, followed by threats to democracy. Democrats overwhelmingly named threats to democracy as their biggest concern, while Republicans were divided among economic pressures, immigration, and crime.

“Spanberger ran a pretty textbook good campaign,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “She didn't make any major mistakes, didn't leave a door open for Earle-Sears to get in very easily.”

“At the end of the day, people were worried about the economy,” Richards added. “It was going to be very difficult for Earle-Sears to really run on that when her party is supposedly in charge of everything.”

When Democrats called a surprise redistricting session in early October, forcing her back to Richmond just as early voting ramped up, Earle-Sears barely mentioned it on the trail, beyond holding a press conference a week before the election. 

While other Republicans running blasted the move as “election interference,” she glossed over it for days before adopting the same language, a sign, strategists said, of her difficulty adapting to fast-moving events.

The same problem surfaced with the controversy surrounding Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, whose leaked text messages appeared to reference violence toward Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. The story dominated headlines for a week, and Republicans across the state seized on it. But rather than folding the episode into a broader argument about Democratic governance or accountability, Earle-Sears and the entire Republican ticket made it their singular focus, hammering it long after voters had moved on.

“It was appropriate to call attention to something that outrageous,” said a Virginia Republican strategist. “But it shouldn't have been the centerpiece of the message. You can use it to motivate turnout, not as your entire argument for why people should vote for you.”

Earle-Sears's stump speech evolved little over the course of the race, though she frequently returned to familiar themes and routines. At many campaign stops, she performed a recurring bit in which she mimed speaking directly to Spanberger, responding to the Democrat's reaction to the Jay Jones controversy. She would raise her voice and imitate her opponent's tone, “Abigail, all she said was unhappy, she was disgusted. Oh, so it's all about you, Abigail,” drawing laughter from loyal supporters. The act became a regular feature of her rallies in the campaign's final weeks.

To many strategists, that moment summed up the problem. “It's not that voters disagreed with her,” said a separate GOP operative in Virginia. “It's that she wasn't talking about what they cared about. When people are worried about paying their bills, they don't want a lecture on bathrooms or a comedy bit onstage.”

The fallout extended beyond her own race. “This could have been a closer contest,” the operative added. “But the margin that she lost by isn't just the wave; a good chunk of that percentage is her campaign messaging and her actual campaign organization. That margin brought other Republicans down with her.”

For Virginia Republicans, the scope of Earle-Sears's defeat was devastating. Her fifteen-point loss to Spanberger didn't just end a campaign; it wiped out the gains the party made under Glenn Youngkin and left Republicans without a single statewide officeholder for the first time in nearly a decade. 

“It's a low point right now for sure,” said Zack Roday, a Republican strategist based in Virginia. “We were at rock bottom in 2017 and 2019, then Youngkin came along and the pendulum swung back. It can happen again, but only with great candidates, real money, and flawless campaigns.”

DEMOCRATS WIDEN MAJORITY IN VIRGINIA STATE HOUSE TO MAINTAIN LEGISLATIVE CONTROL

Roday said the party's challenge now is rebuilding credibility in a state that has steadily trended blue. “There absolutely could be a snapback election,” he said. “But you need to run really good campaigns with really good candidates that are really well funded. There aren't a lot of Glenn Youngkins out there.”

The Department of Transportation announced on Wednesday that the government shutdown was resulting in a 10% reduction in flights at 40 airports across the United States. 

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy made this revelation at a press conference announcing the cuts, as previously reported by the Washington Examiner. It was a precautionary measure to avoid any disasters or emergencies, given the effect the shutdown has had on air traffic controllers. Duffy explained that reducing the number of flights was necessary to “reduce the risk profile in the national airspace.” 

Among the airports reportedly affected by the reduction are Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. According to ABC News, here is a list of the 40 airports that will see a reduction in flights:

The reduction in flights is scheduled to begin on Friday morning, according to reports. It will commence with a 4% reduction and ramp up to the 10% total, ABC News reported. One exception is that international flights are not included in the cuts, and at least one airline company announced that “hub-to-hub flights will not be impacted.”

DUFFY SAYS ‘CERTAIN PARTS' OF AIRSPACE MAY BE CLOSED NEXT WEEK DUE TO PROLONGED SHUTDOWN

“Our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. Reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations. This is not based on light airline travel locations. This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure,” said Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford, who joined Duffy at the press conference on Wednesday.

“I anticipate there will be additional disruptions, there will be frustration,” Duffy said on Wednesday. “We are working with the airlines. They're going to work with passengers, but in the end, our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. The administrator is going to talk about all of the tools we're going to deploy. One of them, though, is going to be that there is going to be a 10% reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump declared Friday that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” and designated Nigeria “a country of particular concern.” Such attention to the plight of Christians in Nigeria is decades overdue.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio's staff has been working for several months on a Horn of Africa strategy that grew out of a review of the State Department's Somaliland policy. To shake loose ossified U.S. policy is as important in West Africa.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is a regional behemoth. Rubio should use Trump's renewed focus to launch a comprehensive review. For decades, Nigerian leaders have tested the country's social fabric. During the 1967-70 Biafran genocide, the Nigerian military deliberately starved 2 million civilians, mostly Christians. Its perpetrators not only escaped accountability but remained empowered. Muhammadu Buhari, a Nigerian army officer who participated in the massacres, rose twice to the presidency.

Racist ideologies never delegitimized fester. Buhari nurtured Islamist extremism and tolerated violence perpetrated against Nigeria's Christians. Often, Buhari and his successor, Bola Tinubu, demanded Western money to fight the Boko Haram menace, only to divert those funds to fan anti-Christian violence. Buhari unleashed Fulani militias to target Christians in the oil-rich and largely Christian southeast. The Biden administration dismissed the obvious, suggesting the slaughter of Christians was due to climate change migration. Global warming, however, does not charter buses to bring armed gangs into Nigeria's Christian heartland — Islamist politicians do.

When Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Nigeria in 2021, he removed Nigeria from its religious freedom watch list, shocking the U.S. Commission on Religious Freedom, which had documented massacres in Christian villages and the abduction and execution of Christians. “The Nigerian government has routinely failed to investigate these attacks and prosecute those responsible,” the commission's 2021 report found.

The atrocities soon accelerated as Buhari interpreted the end of Nigeria's designation as a green light to ramp up persecution of Christians. The resumption of Biafran separatism is a direct result.

There are other reasons to reconsider Nigeria policy. While a U.S.-led naval coalition extinguished piracy off the Horn of Africa a decade ago, pirates made the Gulf of Guinea their new epicenter. Nigeria suppresses its numbers by reclassifying some attacks as occurring within its 12-mile territorial waters to label them falsely as “armed robbery at sea” rather than piracy, a distinction that obscures the severity of the problem.

Rubio's State Department has tweaked visa reciprocity to show unease at Nigeria's behavior, but that is like fighting a forest fire with a water pistol. Just as Rubio oversees a Horn of Africa review, he should now direct a Gulf of Guinea review asking the questions his predecessors have swept under the rug: Is there a Christian genocide? Just as Somaliland's independence has become a U.S. national interest, would Biafran independence also augment regional security? Should the United States commit to Nigerian unity, or is Nigeria simply a colonial vestige whose size and diversity condemn it to failure?

LOOMING SNAP DEADLINE AMPS UP SHUTDOWN PRESSURE ON BOTH TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS

Being secretary of state is the job of a lifetime. Too many of Rubio's predecessors prioritized its perks. Hillary Clinton's leaked emails show her more concerned with beating her predecessors' mileage-flown and countries-visited records rather than helping besieged Christians or counter Islamist, Chinese, or Russian encroachment. John Kerry used tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to take his office staff on a tour of Antarctica, a territory over which the National Science Foundation, not the State Department, directs policy. Blinken treated Christians with disdain.

Rubio can do better. Precedent does not lead to policy perfection — it often represents a doubling down on failure. Neither U.S. security nor Christians in Nigeria can any longer afford such laziness. It is time to order a top-to-bottom Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea review. Christians inside Nigeria and beyond will depend on the outcome.

Gerrymandering efforts look different after Election Day.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

President Donald Trump's gerrymandering war has never looked riskier for his party.

Prodded by Trump, Republicans earlier this year launched an audacious plan to entrench their congressional majority by redrawing House-district maps to squeeze out Democrats—anywhere and everywhere they could. The gambit was an exercise in political power and, coming outside of the traditional decennial redistricting process, without precedent in modern history.

Yet if Democrats feared not long ago that they would be locked out of a House majority, their decisive victories across the country last night have made them, arguably, the favorites heading into next year's midterm elections.

In California, an overwhelming majority voted to redistrict, essentially canceling out the five House seats that Republicans had thought they gained through redistricting in Texas over the summer. The GOP's steep losses farther east cast even more doubt on the wisdom of its redistricting push. Voters repudiated Republicans virtually across the board, handing Democrats convincing victories for the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia, important judicial and legislative races in Pennsylvania, and, for the first time in two decades, a pair of statewide elections in Georgia. In Virginia, the breadth of the Democrats' win gave them their largest majority in the state House of Delegates since 1989.

For Democrats, the results were reminiscent of—and in many cases stronger than—the victories they posted during the 2017 elections, in Trump's first term, which presaged the wave that delivered them the House majority a year later. Even if the GOP's gerrymandering advantage nets the party a few additional seats, Democrats will have a narrower gap to overcome next year than they did eight years ago.

Among the constituencies that swung the hardest toward Democrats yesterday were Latinos, who helped power Trump's presidential win last year and were key to the GOP's redrawn congressional map in Texas. The Republicans' chances of flipping five additional House seats there rest in part on their holding Trump's gains among Latino voters. That was a questionable assumption from the start, the longtime GOP strategist Mike Madrid told me. It appears even shakier in light of Tuesday's election results; in New Jersey, for example, the state's three most heavily Latino counties moved sharply back to the left after swinging toward Trump in 2024.

“None of this is good for Republicans. It's all their own doing, though,” Madrid said. Latinos in Texas border towns may vote differently in 2026 than Latinos in New Jersey did this year. But the anti-GOP shift in this week's elections could boost the Democrats' chances of winning two and possibly three of the five Texas seats that Republicans redrew in their favor, Madrid told me. It could also open up even more opportunities for Democrats, because to create the additional red-leaning seats, Republicans had to cut into previously safe GOP districts. “The problem is they're spreading their other districts thin as they're getting greedy,” Madrid said.

Yesterday's election results could complicate both parties' plans to escalate their gerrymandering tit-for-tat across the country. In addition to their Texas effort, Republicans have enacted newly drawn congressional maps in Missouri and North Carolina that could yield them an additional House seat in each state. Florida legislators are eyeing a gerrymander that could boost the GOP's chances in multiple seats, although the state's significant proportion of Latino voters could pose similar redistricting challenges for Republicans there as those in Texas saw.

Internal opposition, however, has slowed the GOP's drive elsewhere. Ohio Republicans cut a deal with Democrats on revised districts that are more favorable for the GOP but not nearly as aggressive as some party leaders had advocated for. In Indiana, Republicans remain short of the votes they would need in the state legislature to gerrymander both of its House Democrats out of their seats, despite an intense pressure campaign from the White House. And just as polls were closing in eastern states last night, Kansas Republicans announced that they lacked support to call a special legislative session to redraw the House seat of Representative Sharice Davids, the lone Democrat in the state's congressional delegation.

Some Democrats, meanwhile, were emboldened by the success of California's Proposition 50, the ballot measure devised by Governor Gavin Newsom that temporarily redraws the state congressional map to target five Republican-held House seats and strengthen five additional swing districts represented by Democrats. With 75 percent of precincts reporting today, the referendum was leading by more than 25 points. (Republicans immediately filed a lawsuit to block the new California maps, as they had promised to do if Prop 50 passed.) The GOP's “biggest strategy for trying to steal the 2026 election is falling apart before their eyes,” Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, told reporters on a conference call trumpeting the party's electoral wins.

Even before Democrats swept Virginia's elections last night, the party's state legislative majorities began a two-year process to gerrymander two or three Republicans out of their House seats in the 2026 elections. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has pushed Democratic leaders in Illinois and Maryland to similarly redraw their state's congressional maps. But the effort has met resistance from some Democratic lawmakers.

In Maryland, the state Senate president, Bill Ferguson, used the party's electoral success yesterday to argue against an attempt to draw a new map that would likely give Democrats all eight of its House seats. (Republicans currently hold one.) “Tonight's resounding Democratic victory shows we don't need to rig the system to win,” Ferguson wrote on X. His comment earned a sharp rebuttal from his counterpart in neighboring Virginia, the state Senate president pro tempore, L. Louise Lucas. “Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points,” she posted this afternoon. “Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just embarrassing.”

Martin said he hoped Tuesday's election results, and especially the Prop 50 vote in California, would “send a chilling effect to Republicans” who are trying to gerrymander more states. “It's not going to net you enough seats to guarantee that you're going to control the U.S. House next year,” he said. “So knock it off now.”

There was no signal from Republicans that they planned to abandon their efforts. Although Trump voiced disappointment in the election results, other party leaders dismissed them. “There's no surprises. What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters outside the Capitol. “Off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come.” (The speaker had a different interpretation of the off-year elections four years ago, when they went the GOP's way: “RED WAVE is coming,” Johnson posted then.)

One GOP strategist, who was granted anonymity to candidly assess the party's performance, told me that yesterday's results were “a wake-up call.” But the strategist said Republicans remained “full-steam ahead” on their redistricting push in Florida.

Madrid said the elections should send each party a message on redistricting. Republicans should “pause and stop and contemplate. Say, ‘Wait a second. Maybe we made a mistake here.'” At the same time, Democrats should understand, he said, that they can win elections at the ballot box without sacrificing the moral high ground on gerrymandering. Madrid wasn't optimistic, however: “There's a lesson for both parties in this, and neither one of them will learn it.”

A short story

Listen to more stories on hark

When it came into view, Doctor Rustin was struck by its size. The platform rose on six-by-six wooden posts at least 12 feet off the ground, with enough room up top for a small deck party, and the staircase from the sidewalk was a steeply pitched ladder. This gallows had been raised to last—built not only by children but for them, since few adults would have the agility and daring to reach the top. Its height and solidity gave the sense of a play structure, the crossbar that loomed above the platform a climbing feature for the truly fearless, and the rope noose perfect for swinging and letting fly if only the gallows had been built over water.

A drop by the neck from 12 feet into midair would not be play. The designers of the Suicide Spot had been impressively serious. Rustin ran his hand over his own neck and forgot his mission.

About 30 people were gathered around the base, spilling from the sidewalk into the street. Most were teenagers skipping school, though there was a scattering of grown-ups and a couple of families with younger children. High up on the platform, two girls in yellowish-gray clothes stood on either side of a boy. He looked a year or two older than Rustin's daughter, Selva, with a wild thicket of hair and a tough face. He was tugging at the rope as if to test its strength, eyes narrowed, lower lip jutting out in a kind of defiance, while the two girls leaned close and spoke to him in voices so quiet that Rustin, keeping back and half concealed under the red awning of a tavern called the Sodden Spot, couldn't make them out.

But he knew they were Guardians—specially trained peers, there to help confused young people break free from life as they'd known it before the Emergency, in particular from their parents, and become unconflicted agents of Together. Mere weeks after the empire had collapsed, that word appeared on posters glued to the walls of public buildings and on banners strung from lampposts along the central avenues. What Together meant as a philosophy or program, Rustin wasn't sure, but as a passion, it had quickly spread among the city's Burghers, especially its youth, and created hairline fractures in his family. The Rustins were no longer the tight foursome that played word games at dinner. Selva no longer returned on the tram after school, but instead disappeared into the city, attending the daily gathering in the main square called We Are One, staying out for hours. This morning, Rustin—marooned at home since being exiled from the hospital in disgrace—had followed her through the streets until he lost her in the Market District.

In front of him a bickering couple, huddled under an umbrella—though it wasn't raining—made it even harder to hear what was happening on the gallows.

“You didn't have to come,” the woman said. “I could have come by myself.”

“You were afraid to. ‘What if one of them really does it?' ” the man said, mimicking her panic.

“I never said that.”

“Shh!” Rustin hissed. The Suicide Spot belonged to the young, and he didn't want to be associated with the disrespect of the middle-aged.

The boy's shoulders rose and fell. He looked down to check the position of his feet over the trapdoor, then draped the noose around his neck. A murmur that sounded almost like satisfaction passed through the audience.

A Guardian placed her hand on the lever connected to the trapdoor. In a voice clear enough to carry over the crowd, she asked: “Do you want to leave this world?”

Rustin saw the boy's face tighten. His eyes twitched in rapid blinks, his lips disappeared as if cold fury were coursing through his body. Then his features crumpled and he exploded in tears. He sobbed openly, without shame, like a little child, his whole body shaking. Several times he tried to master himself, but he couldn't stop.

Keeping a hand on the lever, the Guardian reached with her other and touched the boy's heaving shoulder. “Hey—we're here with you. We're suffering with you. We love you.”

The boy buried his face in his hands, and the thick nest of hair shook as if in a wind, and the sobs, though muffled, grew louder. Sighs of pity rose around the gallows.

“What do you want to say to your parents?” the other Guardian asked.

The boy looked up mid-sob, startled. “My—I—”

“If they were here, what would you say to them?”

He opened his mouth but no words came out, only a stuttering sob.

“This is pointless,” the woman under the umbrella said.

“You were the one that wanted to come,” the man said.

“Why don't you both leave?” Rustin asked. They turned around to glare, but their talking stopped.

“Mama!” the boy suddenly cried out. “I'm sorry!”

“You have nothing to apologize for,” said the first Guardian, her hand still gripping the lever.

“Do it!” the boy wailed.

The Guardian didn't move.

“Talk to us,” the other Guardian said. “We don't want to lose you.”

“Shut up and do it!”

“Talk to your parents. Why are you sorry? They should be sorry.”

“Mama will be when I do it!”

The Guardian on the lever, who seemed to be leading the session, nodded.

“Oh, Mama will be sorry. But what about us? You're gone, and we needed you. Do you know what's on the other side of that door?”

The boy looked down at his feet. He shook his head.

“A great big empty hole. When you went through that door, the hole got bigger than you can imagine. That hole is bigger than this city.”

The crowd drew in its breath as if the boy was already dangling broken-necked from the noose.

Rustin tried to imagine this girl and boy talking in someone's bedroom, which was where teenagers used to have difficult conversations. Talking face-to-face in private was supposed to allow you to open up, but maybe it wasn't true. Maybe it was easier to say everything like this, with a crowd at your feet and a rope around your neck.

“Please just do it,” the boy said in a voice strained from sobbing, but softer, losing conviction.

“And we were about to try something that has never happened before,” the Guardian went on. “We were going to make a new city! Make ourselves new, too! We were young and dumb enough to think we could do it. How can we now without you?”

The boy murmured something Rustin couldn't hear.

“And what about your Better Human? All that work you did. What's going to happen to him now that you're gone?”

The woman under the umbrella tugged at the man's coat sleeve. “What did she say? Better what?”

“How the hell should I know?”

Rustin didn't understand either.

The Guardian went on talking while the boy listened. He began to nod, and after a few more minutes he lifted the noose off his neck. She let go of the lever, and the crowd broke out in cheers and applause, as if its team had scored a winning goal. Startled, the boy looked down at his new fans. No adolescent defiance or child's anguish was visible on his face now. Wide-eyed, grinning, he climbed down the ladder like a boy who never in his life had expected to win first prize.

The ground was undulating under Rustin's feet, the tavern awning about to collapse on his head, the gallows the only fixed thing in sight. He had seen enough.

As he turned to go, a girl began to mount the scaffold. She wore the same clothes as the Guardians, with a bag slung over her shoulder and goggles dangling from her neck.

Found you! was his first thought, and then: She's going to replace a Guardian. That's how it works—short shifts. He watched his daughter come out onto the platform. She took her place between the two girls and planted her feet apart. Then, with the same decisiveness he'd seen from the moment she left the house, Selva reached for the noose and draped it over her head.

His stomach dropped as the trapdoor opened beneath him, plunging him into a void of air. No! He must have said it aloud, because the couple under the umbrella turned around: “Shh!” His neck was tingling, his knees barely held him upright.

﻿“Do you want to leave this world?” the Guardian asked.

No! This time a silent cry. He would run to catch her legs before the rope went taut, but she would be just out of reach, her head listing forward in the choke hold of the noose.

“Possibly,” Selva said.

“What do you want to say to your—”

“Listen, Papa,” Selva said before the Guardian could finish. “The other night you asked why I'm angry.”

She was speaking in her debate voice—quick, strong, a little tremulous with effort. He knew that she had carefully prepared what she was going to say, and from his hiding place under the awning, he was listening. He had never listened so closely to anyone.

“As usual, I didn't think of an answer fast enough. Well, here's my answer, Papa: because you never believed the world could be better or worse than the one you gave me. And that breaks my heart.”

A rumble of approval from the crowd.

“Oh, this one's good,” the woman under the umbrella said to the man.

That's my girl up there, Rustin wanted to tell her. Our pride and joy. It had been a favorite phrase of his, until Pan came along and Annabelle asked him to stop using it, but sometimes he couldn't help himself, because even Selva with the noose around her neck was exactly that. Those eyes! Their intelligence shone all the way from the gallows. And didn't she have a point? Even here at the Suicide Spot he couldn't imagine any life for his daughter other than the one that had always awaited her under the empire.

“The world was worse than you ever knew, Papa. Remember the exams?”

He would never forget them. Every year in May the whole empire came to a stop for three days while 14-year-old Burgher kids sat for their comprehensive exams. In the city by the river the authorities raised banners across buildings and lampposts to proclaim pride in their children and wish them luck. The rituals were ancient, unchanged since Rustin had sat for his. The night before, Annabelle had made the traditional meal of baked rabbit, asparagus, and custard. Rustin drilled Selva one last time on complex equations and imperial history. Pan touched his sister's forehead with a sprig of rosemary, and the family held hands around the table and solemnly recited the Prayer for Wisdom and Success: “If it cannot be me, then let it not be me. But let it be me.”

The next morning, Burgher parents—oblivious to the fighting that had broken out in the capital—had lined the walkways and cheered as their children filed into schools with pencils and notebooks and tense faces, some bravely managing a smile, others rigid with fear. A few of Rustin's colleagues were on hand in their professional capacity in case a child fainted. As Selva walked past her parents, she kept her eyes fixed straight ahead. “Look at her,” Rustin whispered to Annabelle. “She's going to murder it.”

“I had to place in the top 5 percent,” Selva went on from the gallows. “Not just to qualify for provincials and have a shot at the Imperial Medical College. But for you to still love me.”

Someone in the crowd loudly booed.

Selva, no! Not true! 

“I didn't look at you, because I was afraid I'd see it in your eyes. Being your daughter, I did what I had to.”

As always, the results had been announced in the main square two days after the last exam, with practically the entire city in attendance. It was a gorgeous spring day, dry and fragrant, lilac and chestnut trees coming into bloom. One of the old councilors mounted a temporary stage erected in the middle of the square, next to the statue of a historic Burgher that stood on a pedestal surrounded by a gushing granite fountain, and for an hour he read from a long scroll of paper, while the children who had taken the exams lined up at the foot of the stage facing out toward the crowd. When they heard their name called, they stepped forward and shouted, “Here for city and empire!”

The names were read out in order from first rank to last. The family of Selva Rustin did not have long to wait. Out of 179 children, she was third.

“You beat your papa and your grandpa,” Rustin had said that night over the most expensive bottle of wine he owned. “What a day for the Rustins.” On their coat of arms, in the quadrant with the caduceus, next to his own initials he carved SR, welcoming his daughter into the family guild. She was set for life. And as he stood now in the shadow of the gallows, he thought: We sat around the kitchen table and sang our favorite songs. You pretended Zeus was your patient. Was that world so bad?

“The next day, the boy who sat beside me in class wasn't there,” Selva continued. “We all knew why. He was down around 170.”

Everyone in the square had been keeping a rough count as the councilor approached the bottom of the list. Burghers with no family interest in the results were there just to see who had fallen into the bottom 10 percent—that was a bigger draw than honoring the top 5 percent, who would sit the following month for the provincial round. Even if you lost track of the count, the cutoff point became clear as soon as the shouts of “Here for city and empire!” started to come out weak and choked. A few children didn't even answer when their names were called.

“Iver was an Excess Burgher.”

Everyone knew what future lay in store for the bottom 10 percent. They, too, were set for life. No prohibition had been announced, but they would never be allowed to join a guild. They would finish the school year and then look for work. The lucky ones would find a job in one of the markets, or learn a trade in the Warehouse District, or, with the right family connections, go to work for the city as a street sweeper or trash collector. Some of the girls were hired as servants in the homes of higher-status Burghers, though Rustin refused on principle to consider it. A few sank into the underworld of prostitution.

But the great majority of Excess Burghers would end up like the ones who drank and fought all night at the Sodden Spot, lay around the main square asleep at midday, and spent most of their foreshortened adulthood in the city prison. Rustin's next-door neighbor thought they should be sent directly from school to compulsory work gangs. Some disappeared from the city and were swallowed up in the Yeoman hinterland. Most Burghers considered it more respectable, more in the natural order of things, to be a Yeoman than an Excess Burgher.

When Rustin was a boy, there had been no such people as Excess Burghers. Every child in the city was admitted into a guild—of course, some at lower status than others. But around the time he was studying at the Imperial Medical College, he'd heard that children who had not done well on their exams were leaving school and falling out of view. No ordinance was passed that declared the bottom 5 percent of Burgher children (later raised to 10) superfluous, but this was the beginning of a long period of economic contraction throughout the empire, and competition for a dwindling supply of guild positions became intense. That was when the practice began of parents withholding food from children who performed badly on their pre-exams as an incentive to study harder. (Rustin personally thought this was taking things too far, though he kept the opinion to himself.) The first accounts of cheating and payoffs during exam week surfaced—a blow to the belief in fairness on which the whole system of guilds depended. Excess Burghers became a fixture of imperial life, the answer to a chronic social problem, the unfortunate result of simple arithmetic.

“Do you remember what you said that night?” The tremble in Selva's voice was thickening; she was coming to her purpose. “I told you about Iver, and you said—”

That's just the way it has to be, Sel. She had come home from school troubled, and he'd wanted to comfort her. He hadn't wanted poor Iver's fate to take away from her magnificent achievement. She hadn't replied, but a cloud had passed over her face.

“That's just—the way—it has—to be.” Selva raised her chin, causing the length of rope above the noose to go slightly slack. She closed her eyes and shook her head and stamped her foot on the platform just as if she'd reached the end of endurance during one of their arguments that had escalated far beyond his wishes. When she opened her eyes, they pierced his chest. “Why?” she cried. “Why was that just the way it had to be? Why in the world did you ever think that was just the way it had to be?”

More approval from her audience, shouts of “Why? Why?”

“Here's what you should have said, Papa: ‘I'm sorry, sweetheart, but our whole life is a stinking pile of shit, that's how it is, we live on it, we eat it, we fuck on it, we'll be buried in it, but I love you so let's not talk about it anymore.' ”

The shouting grew wild. Even the two Guardians were shouting—they had become part of Selva's audience. Her color rose and her throat quivered inside the noose and her lips tightened in expectation of a response that he wasn't there to give. He felt as if he were letting her down by not standing beside her on the platform to receive the full force of her indignation, to coax out the last glimmer of her brilliance. One word of his and she'd finish him off, cut him to pieces. He was witnessing one of the greatest moments of her life, as great as that morning in the main square. That's my girl, he thought again—but also: It wasn't just me! Everyone believed it. In the old days beggars were drawn and quartered in that square. It sounds terrible now, but four months ago Excess Burghers were normal. You'd be surprised what people can get used to.

“If you'd said that, it would have helped me. But you didn't have the courage.” Selva dropped her chin and lowered her voice. “So I kept going. I started cramming for provincials. My dream was to reach the imperial round. Instead, we had an Emergency.”

A cheer rose, half-heartedly—they weren't sure where she was headed.

“That was the end of exams. To be honest, it felt like the end of me. I actually, literally, didn't know who I was. Without the next round, why get up in the morning?” She gave a hollow laugh. “Then Together came, with the six principles. Suddenly people seemed happier, they started talking louder and laughing, even with strangers. The rules of Good Development came from the empire, from on high, but Together was our own creation. I thought: Okay, I'll do that. I'll join a self-org committee—even Iver's in one. I'll be the best damn Together girl in the city.”

Someone laughed too loud. Rustin knew from the tremolo in Selva's voice that things were going wrong.

“Except Together wasn't about that—it was the opposite of that. ‘I am no better and neither are you'—that's the second principle!” Selva brought her hands to her forehead and squeezed her eyes shut as if a massive headache had just come on. “So here I am. I don't have the right thoughts, I keep thinking things I don't want to think, they go around and around and I can't make them stop. I can't stop being your girl!”

The woman punched the air with her umbrella. “Oh my God, she's great!”

The Guardians spoke to Selva as they'd spoken to the boy, telling her what it would mean to leave the world, reminding her to think of her Better Human, but none of it worked, her silence was too strong for them. She stood there in the grip of unuttered answers that would have defeated their philosophy, and her father knew that she was struggling with the decision. But before she reached it, the Guardian released the lever and the second Guardian embraced Selva. She removed the noose from her own neck and descended the ladder into a swarm of cheers with failure in her eyes.

Municipal bonds have become an unavoidable part of local governance—and their costs divide rich towns from poor ones.

One Sunday morning in March 1949, a group of nearly 300 people, clutching deck chairs and sleeping bags, lined up to buy new homes in what had, until recently, been a stretch of potato fields in central Long Island. They hoped to move to “fabulous Levittown,” as its developer, William J. Levitt, had branded his creation: more than 17,000 gleaming houses in an all-white community with freshly dug wells and newly paved roads. But that was the extent of the neighborhood—Levitt's profits were in home sales, not city planning. In fact, his namesake had hardly any public infrastructure, and Levittown's new political leaders needed to come up with money for maintenance, trash, and schools. So they took a gamble and decided to enter the municipal-bond market.

Selling bonds—essentially issuing buyers an IOU, plus interest—is a quick way for a government to raise funds. You, or someone you know, probably own a U.S. Treasury bond. But institutional investors—a mix of insurance companies, mutual funds, and private-equity firms—buy bonds too, including from local governments and school districts. Cities get money up front, and buyers are assured that they'll turn a profit; this win-win proposition made many postwar suburbs take the plunge into the bond market. Throughout the 1950s, as private developers rapidly constructed new suburbs, school districts in Nassau County, where Levittown is located, increased their debt load by sixfold to meet the needs of their new residents. The problem was: Not every town and city was treated the same. Credit-rating agencies saw richer locales as very likely to repay their debts and gave them sweet deals on interest rates, which meant that these towns owed less to those who'd bought their bonds. The poorer places got shortchanged.

Municipal debt is a secret American pastime, defining—and dividing—suburbs across the United States. In his new book, Cracked Foundations: Debt and Inequality in Suburban America, the urban historian Michael Glass looks behind the marketing that attracted flocks of Americans to places like Levittown and uses debt as a lens through which to understand suburban disparities. The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world where municipalities raise money primarily through bonds, and their differential treatment on the private market has quietly driven inequality across the nation. Saddled with higher interest rates on their bonds, people in poor cities and towns today pay double the amount in property taxes, often suffer higher home-foreclosure rates, and wield paltrier education budgets compared with their wealthier counterparts. Major cities face the consequences of municipal bonds, too—Chicago famously leased its parking meters to investors in order to pay off its debts—but they employ teams of bond experts to negotiate the best terms. Small cities and towns, whose bond coordinator is often a single financial manager juggling dozens of other tasks, can do less to protect themselves from high interest rates.

Read: Liberal suburbs have their own border wall

America's cities have been taking on debt for more than 200 years. New York City issued one of the first municipal bonds in 1817 in order to bankroll the construction of the Erie Canal. Soon after, selling bonds became a popular way for new cities to attract railroads: They would offer to subsidize the cost of building a new train stop, but they needed cash to do it. By the 1950s, as Glass shows, neglectful developers left new suburbs with little choice but to fund their expansion via the bond market. Cities have only become more reliant on that debt since—especially after President Richard Nixon slashed federal aid to cities in the early 1970s. Although municipalities in other countries can borrow from their national government—Canada regularly provides localized loans to stimulate housing construction—American cities and towns usually don't have that luxury. Instead, they have found themselves playacting as entrepreneurs, courting private investment to fund basic services.

Over the course of a 30-year term, Glass estimates, the fees and interest on bonds add 30 to 60 percent in costs beyond the original borrowed amount. Every town pays extra, but some pay more than others. The math is both simple and opaque. Whenever a local government offers a bond for sale, the three major credit-rating agencies—Moody's, S&P, and Fitch—assess the government's likelihood of repayment. A municipality that seems certain to repay gets a high score; one with shakier prospects gets a weaker score. Investors then set interest rates based on these assessments. Think of the grade as a credit score for your city: The worse it is, the higher your interest rate, and the more you end up paying for pretty much everything.

Credit-rating agencies claim that they measure objective conditions, but they base their grades on factors—including median household income, tax revenue, and homeownership rates—that reward already-wealthy communities, and can create disparities based on the demographics of their residents. The UCLA professor Justin McBride, for example, recently sampled the credit ratings of small cities and towns across California, and concluded that the larger the white population was in a municipality, the better the credit rating that municipality received. Back in 1949, when Levittown first issued municipal bonds to fund its school system, Moody's analysts dismissed it as an “unseasoned residential area” with “an element of insecurity,” Glass writes. Moody's assigned Levittown a “Baa” rating, which meant that the city was a “lower-medium grade” risk that warranted a 2.7 percent interest rate.

Meanwhile, Glass goes on to show, Moody's assigned nearby Great Neck, a wealthy enclave and the site of a major manufacturing plant, an A rating, resulting in an interest rate of 2.3 percent. Nearly a decade later, when Levittown officials issued bonds yet again, Moody's warned investors that the city was a “hazardous investment environment,” and Levittown bonds were purchased at 4.3 percent. A few months later, Great Neck once again got a better deal—bonds at 3.5 percent. These minor rate differences continued to grow over time. On, say, a 10-year, $5 million bond, Levittown might theoretically end up paying close to $600,000 more to its creditors than Great Neck would.

Levittowners weren't naive. School officials wrote to the state of New York to request public aid for construction, Glass discovered in the state's education-department archives, but they received little support, which pushed them toward selling bonds to private buyers. By 1957, Levittown was spending 16 percent of its annual school budget on debt service, more than the salaries of all of its junior-high and high-school teachers combined. As Glass writes, “With each bond issue, Levittown and Great Neck grew further apart.”

Read: What the suburb haters don't understand

In Long Island, Levittown—a mostly white, middle-class area—was far from the worst off. In 1976, the majority-Black hamlet of Roosevelt issued bonds to fund its schools. Roosevelt agreed to pay 11.25 percent in annual interest at a time when the median interest on other bonds was less than 7 percent. The money was a lifeline in the short term and devastating over time. To meet its debt payments, Roosevelt expected to raise its property taxes by 10 percent over the following decade. Many residents were forced to move out. Others, unable to pay, defaulted on their home. By 1980, people in Roosevelt were paying 11 percent more in property taxes than their neighbors in Great Neck were, even though Great Neck had four times more wealth. Persistent debt has only widened this gap in the decades since. Today, Glass notes, Great Neck has eight times more wealth than Roosevelt has, yet its residents pay 51 percent less in property taxes.

Debt is still quietly shaping the fortunes of small cities and towns across America. Public schools in particular have become so reliant on bond sales to fund salaries and services that overall school debt more than doubled from 2002 to 2019, rising to $500 billion. These bonds can take decades for a district to pay off: In one extreme case, a California school district ponied up $34.3 million in lifetime payments on a $16.7 million bond that it had taken out in 2005—more than double the amount it originally borrowed.

Disproportionately high property taxes are one telltale sign of a city trapped in a cycle of municipal debt, and so are weak public services—underfunded schools, underpaid teachers, aging recreation centers, sewer systems in need of an upgrade. Even overpolicing is downstream of these bonds. Consider, for instance, Ferguson, Missouri, which took on millions of dollars in debt in the 1960s and '70s to fund new infrastructure projects. Those payments proved incapacitating, and within a few decades, many of Ferguson's white citizens had fled, leaving a cohort of newly arrived Black residents to foot the bill. The city soon relied on a new revenue stream—aggressive ticketing, which so disproportionately affected Black residents that the Department of Justice investigated and, in 2015, found the practice discriminatory.

Read: The suburbs have become a Ponzi scheme

This bond debt is part of an American tradition of leaving public-service funding to private actors—and has become a primary vehicle of suburban inequality. In Disillusioned, published last year, the journalist Benjamin Herold tracks how the school district in his middle-class Pennsylvania suburb of Penn Hills ended up $172 million in debt, leading to mass furloughs, service reductions, and, inevitably, higher property taxes. Although Herold blames, in part, the “magical thinking” of the school board that approved the huge bonds in the first place, these administrators had only so many choices: Private debt has become an unavoidable part of local governance. As a solution, some advocates have suggested that the Federal Reserve lend money to school districts and municipalities at no interest (the Fed has, in the past, said it doesn't have the authority to do this). But until other options become available, poor cities and towns will just end up further and further behind, making bets they can never win.

Tradwives are everywhere on social media. Their allegedly dominant spouses are invisible.

Daniel and Brianna Bell met as college students near Toronto. Brianna, especially, had embraced traditionalist messages about family from her conservative Christian church. So when they married, Daniel became a pastor and Brianna became a stay-at-home mom.

Brianna lived what was essentially a “tradwife” lifestyle — the trend popularized by online influencers in which women embrace conservative gender roles in their families. For her, that meant making her own laundry detergent, being gentle and meek, and prioritizing her husband, kids, and God over herself at every turn, she told me. For Daniel, the traditional life was a little more complicated.

On the one hand, “I felt like I never had to cook,” he told me. “I barely had to clean.”

On the other, he was faced with the task of providing for his entire household on a pastor's salary, sometimes as low as $9,000 a year. He described the intense pressure of “feeling like I want to give my family the life they desire” but knowing that was “impossible on one income in the world that we lived in.”

The financial struggles were just one aspect of trad life that began to chafe at the Bells over time. “A big perspective of that subculture is that men have the final say and the authority,” Bell said. “I never really felt like that was practical.”

Bell's experience reveals some of the contradictions inherent in being a “trad husband” — a role that receives little public discussion despite the visibility of online tradwives. The idea of the tradwife doesn't exist without a husband; he's the head of the household, the one to whom everyone else is supposed to submit. Yet the husbands of popular tradwife influencers typically trail their wives in popularity, and almost all discourse around “traditional” gender roles focuses on the decisions and activities of women. “Trad husbands” are so invisible that even the term demands quotation marks. In interviews for this story, I often had to explain what I meant by it.

The invisibility of the trad husband reflects a larger vacuum when it comes to men's roles in debates about family policy and culture. In an era of declining birth rates, conservative politicians and activists (most of them male) have put a lot of energy into influencing women's behavior. It's less clear, however, what these new traditionalists believe men are supposed to do — especially in an era when being a sole breadwinner is more difficult than ever. In 2025, do young men even want to be trad husbands? And if not, what do they want to do instead?

Tradwife content is often ostensibly aimed at women, with some influencers offering explicit tips for life as a stay-at-home wife and mother. Indeed, it's hard to exist as a woman on the internet without being served a tradwife video at some point, and the footage of relaxed moms and cute children performing photogenic chores in beautiful, curated spaces can draw in even the least trad-aligned viewer.

These videos make an implicit promise to the women watching them — a promise that a life of calm and beauty is available to them, if they only make the right choices. Marriage is part of that promise. One message of tradwife content is, “if you look a certain way, if you prioritize domesticity, children, and traditional feminine pursuits, you will be gifted a supportive husband who provides for you and who cherishes you,” said Sara Petersen, author of Momfluenced: Inside the Maddening, Picture-Perfect World of Mommy Influencer Culture.

But the husbands themselves are secondary characters. When they appear in their wives' online posts, it's usually as a kind of “beneficent background figure,” there to show how blissful traditional marriage can be without drawing too much attention to themselves, Petersen said.

As influencers in their own right, trad husbands typically come in a distant second to their wives. Hannah Neeleman (@ballerinafarm) has more than 10 million followers on Instagram as of this writing; her husband Daniel, son of JetBlue founder David Neeleman, has more than 650,000. If tradwives are talking to women about how to live their lives, their husbands aren't really talking to men — or, at least, men aren't listening.

Some of that is probably because the men are all watching tradwife videos. Jessica Grose at the New York Times has wondered whether the main audience for these influencers is actually conservative-leaning men, and a lot of tradwife content — videos depicting women getting ready for their husbands to come home, for example — feels calibrated for the male gaze.

“The tradwife is such a visual artifact. She really exists to be looked at and to be perceived.” 

“The tradwife is such a visual artifact,” Petersen said. “She really exists to be looked at and to be perceived.”

The labor these influencers perform is also deeply visual, from picking flowers to making DIY versions of popular processed snacks. As with home canning influencers, their work is hands-on and analog in a way that's appealing to a lot of viewers in an economy that increasingly revolves around screens.

Where does the work of the trad husband fall in all this? Being a breadwinner isn't as aesthetically pleasing as being a bread-maker — tradwives and the Trump administration's rhetoric alike hark back to a fantasy of the 1950s, but some of the most famous art of the 20th century is about how dull and soul-destroying the life of the 1950s “company man” could be. Nobody really wants to watch a dad come home from the office and smoke his pipe.

Physically demanding jobs in agriculture, construction, or manufacturing are probably the closest analogue to the highly gendered domestic work tradwife content creators perform. The trad husbands who do maintain Instagram presences often chronicle their lives as farmers or homesteaders. Daniel Neeleman (@hogfathering on Instagram) posts a lot of videos of cows, sheep, and pigs, for example. Singing the praises of the blue-collar man is also a perennial trend on TikTok.

But the kinds of male-coded jobs that make good content are exactly the kinds of jobs that are rapidly disappearing in America, or that have already disappeared.

“The male breadwinner has been declining for a long time,” said Pamela Aronson, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan Dearborn and the author of Gender Revolution: How Electoral Politics and #MeToo Are Reshaping Everyday Life. Whereas in the 1960s many men could support a family with a job in manufacturing, today “that's completely gone.”

Manufacturing jobs in America have been on a decades-long decline, one exacerbated rather than stemmed in recent months by President Donald Trump's trade policies. Agricultural jobs have been on a similar slide, and it's incredibly difficult to support a family as a small-scale farmer in the United States today.

Today, young men, especially those without a college education, often end up in low-skilled service sector jobs, which provide little stability, Aronson said. These are jobs that make being the sole breadwinner for a family nearly impossible.

Even for men who can make the sole-breadwinner model work, doing so in a deeply uncertain economy involves enormous pressure, said Aliya Rao, a professor of methodology at the London School of Economics who has studied gender and employment. That's pressure many men may not want, “even if it comes with patriarchal benefits.”

Being a trad husband, in this era and perhaps in any era, can actually be extremely taxing both physically and emotionally. Petersen pointed to a 1963 marriage manual called “Fascinating Womanhood,” which argues that “one of the reasons a wife should be submissive and devote herself to the emotional needs of her husband and everyone in her family, is because his life is so difficult.”

More appealing for young men, perhaps, are “manosphere” influencers like Andrew Tate, men who talk about violence against women and sexual conquest, not domestic life and fatherhood. Compared with the more outrageous personalities of the manosphere, trad husbands might just be boring, said Adam Stanaland, a psychology professor at the University of Richmond who has studied gender norms.

“They're going to work,” Stanaland said of the trad husband ideal. Someone like Tate, by contrast, is “angry and yelling and raging. Hate is super appealing in terms of clicks.”

Still, some young men do aspire to be trad husbands, especially in Christian circles, though they might “use language more like, I'm gonna be a real man; I'm gonna be a godly husband,” Daniel Bell, who still works as a pastor, told me. Young men today are increasingly embracing “conservative values while women are fleeing them,” he said, referencing recent polling.

At the same time, young Americans' family goals are “very much inflected by the financial insecurity of our time, which has really hit young adults hard,” Aronson said. Members of Gen Z are increasingly pessimistic about their ability to achieve what were once seen as markers of adulthood, like marriage, kids, and homeownership. “It's just really hard to plan for what you want for your family when you're still living in your parents' house,” Aronson said.

Perhaps as a result, Americans have come to rank career and friendship ahead of marriage and family as the most important components of a fulfilling life. In particular, “people are much less likely to consider marriage as important to becoming an adult,” Aronson said.

These attitudes, though, vary widely by political party and by gender. Men are more likely to prioritize having children than women are, with male Trump voters listing it as their top priority in a recent NBC News Decision Desk poll of Gen Z Americans. Interestingly, these men ranked being married fourth on their list, with marriage falling behind achieving financial independence and having a fulfilling career as well.

The fact that young men really want to be fathers is notable in a time of concern about both falling birth rates and a lack of direction among men. Yet existing “trad” narratives don't offer much for men who want to be involved dads; who has the time when they're busy on the farm? Instead, tradwife content typically centers a mother alone with young children while their father is offscreen somewhere, working.

For some young men today, a more relevant role model than the trad husband might be the dadfluencer, several of whom have amassed followings by chronicling their effort to take care of their children and their homes. Joey Foo, for example, posts videos of himself cleaning up after his three kids or making chocolate cake for his wife, with more than 210,000 Instagram followers.

So far, the audience for these accounts is mostly women, and no dadfluencer is as prominent as the most famous online tradwives, whose accounts reach millions. But in an era when male-coded jobs are disappearing and men are eager to have kids, the stay-at-home dad could be an archetype whose time has come.

The Bells, for their part, have reversed their roles in recent years. Brianna Bell began to pull away from traditionalist Christianity after reading Christian child-rearing books that advocated beating kids. Today, she is a journalist and author of the forthcoming memoir God Lover and makes more money than her husband. “We've been allowed so much more freedom because of that,” Daniel Bell said.

For the Bells, the desire to parent their three daughters well played a big role in changing their lifestyle. “What kind of example do I want to set for the person who I want to love them one day?” Daniel Bell asked.

“I think if you love someone, you live in equality; you value what they have to say,” Bell said. “It's seeing the humanity and love in your spouse, instead of seeing them as a certain role that has to be fulfilled.”

Federalism: It matters!

So far, the biggest successes against President Donald Trump's second-term assault on democracy have come not from Congress and the Supreme Court, but more unusual sources: lower-court judges, “No Kings” protests, a Disney+ subscriber boycott, and Trump's own indiscipline and incompetence.

After the 2025 elections, we can add the states to the list. And in some ways, this avenue of resistance may prove to be the most consequential one (at least until the 2026 midterms).

Tuesday's election results have, specifically, created a major barrier to one of Trump's most dangerous authoritarian ambitions — an attempted one-sided national gerrymander. But this major development should also be an opportunity for most people, who focus on national politics, to evaluate the power of state governments. The United States is unusual among backsliding democracies in the strength of its federal system, and that creates some major opportunities for institutional pushback that may not have been possible elsewhere.

This is somewhat ironic: For most of American history, states (most notably in the South) have been places where pockets of authoritarianism could exist in a nationally democratic society.

Yet today, as the national government moves in an authoritarian direction, the comparatively major powers invested in states — like control over election administration — are now creating opportunities for small-d democratic to resist a national authoritarian power grab.

For much of his second term, Trump has been preoccupied with the threat of losing the midterm elections. Convinced that such a defeat would spell disaster for his presidency, he has pushed state-level Republicans to engage in a highly unusual round of mid-cycle redistricting: basically, a nationwide attempt to rig the maps in the GOP's favor.

Of all the many anti-democratic things Trump has been doing, from illegally taking Congress's power of the purse to abusing regulatory powers to try to silence late-night comedy hosts, this was probably the greatest immediate-term threat to the integrity of the electoral system itself.

Because election administration is almost entirely devolved to the states in the American system, Trump has very limited powers to actually try and rig elections from DC. Instead, gerrymandering at the state level — threatening and cajoling governors and state legislatures into drawing as many safe seats for Republicans as possible — is his best shot at actually stacking the deck in the GOP's favor in 2026.

There is precedent for this abroad. After coming to power in 2010, Hungary's Viktor Orbán created a series of single-member districts that were drawn specifically to give disproportionate power to his Fidesz party's voters. This was a key reason he could maintain power despite rising unpopularity: In the 2014 election, Fidesz maintained over two-thirds of seats in parliament, a majority large enough to amend the constitution at will, despite winning only 44 percent of the national vote.

After last night's elections, Trump's pathway to a similarly unfair victory in 2026 got a lot dicier.

The most obvious reason is that Democrats gained new powers to counter-gerrymander. California voters endorsed a ballot referendum in support of Gov. Gavin Newsom's mid-cycle redistricting plan. And Virginia voters handed Democrats a super-majority in the statehouse, giving them the numbers they needed to pass their own new map. The Democratic gains in the two states put together could, per one calculation, cancel out or even exceed GOP gains from currently proposed gerrymanders in states like Texas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri.

This is hardly an ideal solution to the problem of gerrymandering. As my friend Kelsey Piper writes in The Argument, gerrymandering in any sense is bad for democracy: It decreases voters' ability to make meaningful political choices. The best-case scenario would be a national ban on partisan map-drawing, one that would allow Republicans in blue states and Democrats in red ones equally fair levels of representation in the House.

But in criticizing counter-gerrymandering, Piper misses two other important factors: national representativeness and power.

If only one party gerrymanders, then the effect is to give that party an unfair advantage relative to their true level of national support. If both parties gerrymander in ways that cancel each other out, then the results of the national House election look a lot more like the will of the national electorate as a whole. That makes the outcome meaningfully more democratic than a one-sided gerrymander, even if on a district-by-district level it is far less fair and representative than it should be.

More fundamentally, though, counter-gerrymandering is necessary to put a break on Trump's authoritarian ambitions.

In competitive authoritarian systems like Hungary's, no individual move is decisive in ending democracy. Democracy instead dies from an accumulation of incremental advantages, each working in tandem to make it nearly impossible for the opposition to win fairly. Of those, gerrymandering is among the most singularly important weapons. It directly raises the threshold of national unpopularity that the incumbent party needs to reach to lose the legislature, and thus lose its power to pass legislation empowering an authoritarian executive.

Preventing the party from attaining that advantage, then, is a direct blow to their attempt to stay in power indefinitely and undemocratically. If Democrats had not won approval for counter-gerrymandering in California and Virginia, Trump would be meaningfully closer to creating a system like Hungary's.

There is, internationally, a fairly well-worn playbook for an elected leader who wishes to seize autocratic control. They consolidate formal power in their own hands, neuter independent checks on their authority, undermine the fairness of election administration, and impose political constraints on civil society and big business.

In Trump's second term, he has attempted to check every box — helped along by a completely pliant GOP majority in Congress and a Supreme Court that has only rarely ruled against him on executive power. On paper, this seems like a recipe for democratic failure. In recent cases of resistance, such as Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro failed to consolidate power and lost his 2022 reelection bid, and South Korea, where activists and legislators stopped President Yoon Suk Yeol's overnight coup attempt in 2024, presidents lacked meaningful control over the other two branches of government.

But in the American system, control over the federal government isn't the entire ball game. Many of the key functions of state, like election administration and policing, are handled at the local level. That has, as my colleague Ian Millhiser points out, presented significant legal barriers to Trump's authoritarian consolidation. It is much harder to rig elections or successfully prosecute your political opponents when a real measure of power in those areas is delegated to localities that you do not control.

That being said, federalism is not a panacea against authoritarian takeovers. A recent study by three political scientists found four cases of countries with federal systems where the national leadership attempted an authoritarian power seizure: the US during Trump's first term, Brazil, India, and Venezuela. In Brazil and the United States, they found that states posed a major barrier to said takeovers. By contrast, states in India and Venezuela were less effective in stymying national backsliding.

In their view, the key differences were the balances of formal and partisan power. In the US and Brazil, states have greater control over core government functions than they did in India and Venezuela. Moreover, the opposition had control over greater numbers of states in the first pair of countries than in the second.

It's not that strong federalism guarantees democracy: Any look at American history shows that, in fact, federalism can allow authoritarianism to rise and thrive at the local level. Rather, it's that the US federal system creates opportunities for contestation when the national government is moving in an authoritarian direction — one that people in non-federal collapsed democracies, like Hungary and Turkey, simply didn't have.

These fights do not just matter for the state in question, but rather directly implicate the powers available to the executive branch. It's possible to think of states as a kind of “fourth branch” of the federal government, one imposing constraints on the executive's efforts at power consolidation even when the federal firewalls are failing.

We can see this at work, very obviously, in the 2025 Virginia election results. But there will be many fights to come in statehouses and governors' mansions, ranging from red-state decisions on complying with Trump's demands to gerrymander to blue-state decisions over checking abusive federal law enforcement, that can serve as a crucial backstop in the year-plus before the midterm elections provide an opportunity to stiffen federal resistance.

It's easier than ever to stop doomscrolling.

For the past few months, a shadowy company called Dumb and Co. has been convincing people in Washington, DC, to ditch their smartphones for a month. It's part of a project called Month Offline, where participants get a flip phone and access to a support group to talk about algorithms, doomscrolling, and why smartphones make us feel so lonely.

This isn't just another digital detox retreat. To me, it sounds more like a hip social club. The home base is a bar called Hush Harbor, the first phone-free bar in DC, and early on, the experience of joining involved calling a 1-800 number and leaving a voicemail application.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

The local movement is going national. There's now a website and an option to join a cohort from anywhere in the United States. For $100, you get the Dumb Phone 1, which is really just a TCL flip phone; a new phone number with a 404 area code; and a curriculum of sorts to guide you through the month. There are also weekly dial-in radio programs that take the place of the in-person meetings. The first in-person cohort outside of DC is also accepting applications: Month Offline Brooklyn starts in January 2026.

It all smacks of the same nostalgia that led to the resurgence of CDs and the return of compact digital cameras. The idea of a piece of technology that does one thing and does not take over our entire attention span is appealing.

“The phone certainly amplifies some of our avoidant tendencies,” said Grant Besner, one of the co-founders of Month Offline. “Just replacing it even for a little bit and needing to sit with your own thoughts to be bored can be a transformative and really positive experience in someone's life.”

Month Offline is part of a new generation of solutions to your smartphone-addled existence. These include carefully designed smartphone alternatives, like the Light Phone 3. There's also the Brick, an NFC-enabled magnet that blocks access to certain apps when you tap your phone against it. You can also find plenty of apps, like Freedom, One Sec, or Forest, that will accomplish similar ends. The overarching concept is that hiding from your phone for a weekend won't do much to change your habits long-term. You need to learn how to be more intentional about your phone use.

I first learned about Month Offline from Brittany Shammas, a Washington Post reporter who participated in one of the DC-based cohorts and wrote a feature about the experience. Something that stood out in her coverage was the extent to which people weren't just looking for a phone fast. They wanted community and connection.

“It definitely had elements that made it feel like a support group,” Shammas told me. “People in the group sometimes would say, ‘This is AA for smartphones.'”

After talking to several other people who did the Month Offline program, it was clear that some did want to go full flip phone, while others just needed a break from their iPhone. One of them, Lydia Peabody, said she quit her smartphone for a month because she was struggling with her mental health and “scrolling [her] life away.” Then she switched to a flip phone, and everything changed.

“I didn't know life could feel this way,” said Peabody, who now works for Month Offline. “I didn't even know I could exist in this type of way.”

For those who don't want to do the whole month-long challenge, the organizers of Month Offline will sell you a Dumb Phone 1, with the new phone number and cell service, for $25 a month. They also make an app, Dumb Down, that makes it easier to sync calls and texts between an iPhone and a flip phone. Even without the support group component, switching to a flip phone can deepen your existing friendships and improve your attention span.

For about as long as smartphones have existed, there have been programs designed to help us stop using them. More than a decade ago, you could spend hundreds to go to Camp Grounded, an adult summer camp in California where all digital devices were banned. The organization that sponsored it, Digital Detox, inspired groups worldwide to help people disconnect. The Offline Club, for example, hosts phone-free events and retreats all over Europe. There's even a special festival that happens annually on the first weekend of March called the Global Day of Unplugging. Verizon is a corporate sponsor.

But what was once a wellness trend is quickly turning into a full-blown social movement. After Jean Twenge asked “Have smartphones destroyed a generation?” in The Atlantic in 2017, the idea that tech use had created a youth mental health crisis went mainstream. It didn't help, when, a few years later, the Wall Street Journal reported that Instagram knew its product was harmful to teens, citing internal documents. That was around the same time that the Wait Until 8th pledge to keep smartphones out of kids' hands until they're 13 or so popped up, and some families even hired consultants to help them ditch their smartphone habits. Then came the pandemic, when everyone's lives became even more mediated by screens.

Now, school phone bans are a major legislative priority. Florida became the first to push phones out of classrooms in 2024, and there are now 35 states with laws or rules restricting or outright banning phones in schools. We don't know all the ways this will transform education, but at least in one Kentucky school district, the statewide phone ban correlated with a spike in the number of books checked out of the library.

You have to wonder what a school phone ban for adults would look like. Over half of US adults are worried about being addicted to their smartphones, according to a 2024 Harris Poll, but it seems unlikely they all want to throw them into the sea. Spending a weekend on a digital detox retreat can be relaxing, and research even suggests that these kinds of interventions can help reduce the time people spend on their phones when the program is over. Staying off social media definitely seems to be good for your mental health.

“Overall, there is now emerging evidence that digital detox can and does work,” said Kostadin Kushlev, a Georgetown psychology professor who leads the Digital Health and Happiness Lab. But much of the research focuses on quitting a single feature, like social media, Kushlev added.

Let me confess: I haven't done the Month Offline. I didn't last a week using just a Light Phone 3. A big reason why is just that it's not a good time for me to reorganize my digital life. Even though the Month Offline organizers have made it easier, switching to a flip phone is hard.

But I did get a Brick. Anytime I want to prevent myself from reflexively scrolling through Reddit at night, I just tap my phone on a little grey square and the app stops working. To get it working again, I have to get up, walk across my apartment, and tap it again. It sounds simple, just a little bit of friction to snap me out of stupor. And that's all I need right now to feel more present.

Google is in early discussions to deepen its investment in Anthropic, Business Insider has learned.

The new round of funding could value Anthropic at more than $350 billion, according to one source familiar with the matter. The potential new deal, which is still being negotiated and is in flux, could also take the form of a strategic investment where Google provides additional cloud computing services to Anthropic, a convertible note, or a priced funding round early next year, according to sources familiar with the matter.

It's unclear how much Google would invest in this round or if there would be additional investors in this latest funding.

Anthropic and Google declined to comment.

Google has invested more than $3 billion in Anthropic, giving it a 14% stake in the company, according to The New York Times, which cited legal filings in March. In September, Anthropic raised $13 billion at a $138 billion valuation, while OpenAI reached a $500 billion valuation last month in a secondary sale that allowed employees to sell shares.

The latest talks come as Anthropic and its main rival, OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, are in a multitrillion-dollar race to dominate the models that power AI. At the same time, Big Tech companies are taking sides, with Amazon and Google backing Anthropic, while Microsoft and Nvidia have invested billions in OpenAI.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, and is best known for its Claude family of large language models.

Google and Anthropic announced a massive cloud computing deal in October worth tens of billions of dollars that gives Anthropic access to up to one million of Google's custom-designed Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which are designed to accelerate machine learning workloads.

Amazon has also invested $14 billion in Anthropic, which uses AWS custom chips to build and deploy its AI models.

Anthropic said last month it remains ""committed to our partnership with Amazon, our primary training partner and cloud provider.""

Amazon's Project Rainer, one of the world's largest AI compute clusters with nearly half a million Trainium2 chips, recently came online to power Claude.

Anthropic also uses NVIDIA's GPUs to train and power its models.

Business Insider Edition 

South Africa's government says it has received distress calls from 17 citizens who joined mercenary forces fighting in the Russia–Ukraine war, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation into how they were recruited.


        South Africa's government said on Thursday it has received distress calls from 17 of its citizens who joined mercenary forces fighting in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation into their recruitment.
    


        According to Reuters, The men, aged between 20 and 39, are reportedly stranded in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region. “President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the recruitment of these young men into these seemingly mercenary activities,” the government said in a statement.
    


        Officials said the group contacted South African authorities after finding themselves trapped in combat zones with limited means to return home.
    


        Earlier this year, reports emerged that Russia was recruiting citizens from several African nations, including Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and South Africa; to support its war efforts in Ukraine.
    


Bloomberg reported that the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, one of Russia's flagship industrial hubs and a key producer of Shahed-type drones used in combat, was among the main recruiters of foreign labour.
    


        The recruitment drive, now under South African investigation, is believed to be part of Moscow's wider efforts to address a labour shortage worsened by demographic decline and wartime mobilisation.
    


        It is reportedly being coordinated through the BRICS framework, particularly via the South African chapter of the BRICS Women's Business Alliance.



        According to report, the alliance signed an agreement in May to supply more than 5,600 workers to Alabuga and Russian construction firm Etalonstroi Ural.
    


In South Africa, the BRICS Student Commission promoted employment opportunities in Russia's construction and hospitality sectors, targeting women aged 18–22.
    


        These positions were advertised on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok as well-paid international placements.
    


        Lebogang Zulu, chair of the BRICS Women's Business Alliance in South Africa, told Bloomberg the initiative was designed to “match Russia's labour demand with South Africa's unemployment crisis.” Nearly a third of South Africans are unemployed, with youth and women disproportionately affected.
    


        However, links between these placements and Russia's military-industrial complex have raised concerns over potential exploitation.
    


Research by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) alleged that many women recruited through the Alabuga programme were unknowingly assigned to drone assembly plants rather than the construction or hospitality roles they were promised.
    


        The Alabuga facility has been targeted several times by Ukrainian forces, including one strike in August, underscoring the risks faced by those working there.
    


ISIS estimates that around 90% of the women who travelled to Russia under the programme ended up in drone production.
    


        South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has confirmed a formal investigation into the recruitment activities. “The government is actively probing reports of foreign programmes that recruit South Africans under false pretences,” DIRCO said in a statement.
    


        The latest distress calls from 17 citizens reportedly trapped in Ukraine have intensified scrutiny over these operations and raised questions about Pretoria's prior awareness.
    


        Russia's labour market is under severe pressure, with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko estimating a shortage of 4.8 million workers following large-scale mobilisation and population decline.
    


        The Kremlin has increasingly turned to friendly and neutral nations, including African countries to fill the gap.
    


        For Pretoria, the controversy poses a diplomatic challenge. South Africa has maintained a policy of non-alignment in the Russia–Ukraine conflict but now faces growing domestic and international pressure to respond to allegations of recruitment and deception involving its citizens.

Snapchat users will soon be able to use the app as an AI search tool.

On Wednesday, the social media platform announced a deal to integrate Perplexity AI into Snap's search engine. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million in cash and equity over a year.

""Perplexity's AI-powered answer engine will let Snapchatters ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat,"" Snap said in the Wednesday press release.

The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release.

A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI.

""Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun — woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations,"" Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release.

On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million.

Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year.

The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces.

In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience.

In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a ""politically incorrect"" alternative to other chatbots.

The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an ""engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight.""

Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's ""For You Page,"" or Instagram's Reels.

The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users.

A company linked to Hussain Sajwani, a Dubai-based billionaire and associate of President Donald Trump, bought the Amadea, the superyacht auctioned off by the US government in September.

The sale of the Amadea, a 106-meter luxury yacht that the government said it seized from sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov in 2022, was finalized in October, Business Insider previously reported.

New registration documents reveal that an entity linked to Sajwani and his Damac Group is behind the purchase.

As of October 10, the owner of the yacht was listed as Beyond Holdings Group Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands — a popular flag for superyachts, given its favorable tax policy and strict confidentiality rules.

Beyond Holdings Group's headquarters is located in Dubai, on the 20th floor of the Executive Heights tower, according to Bloomberg's Legal Entity Identifier. That exact address is the headquarters of Damac, the conglomerate owned by billionaire Sajwani.

The entity's former name, AHS Four Company Limited, also connects to Sajwani. His son Abbas Sajwani's yacht is named AHS, after his initials, and is owned by a company called AHS One Company Limited. Both yachts, AHS and the Amadea, are managed by the Monaco-based firm Superyacht Partners, which charters out the former for as much as $600,000 a week.

Hussain Sajwani, Abbas Sajwani, and Superyacht Partners did not respond to requests for comment. The United States Marshals Service declined to comment.

The Amadea was believed to be worth at least $300 million at the time of its seizure, the Department of Justice said in a press release. A later appraisal put its value closer to $230 million, court documents said. The price fetched at auction has not been publicly revealed.

The yacht's maintenance costs — including crew salaries, fuel, insurance, and more — reached nearly $1 million a month for US taxpayers at one point, according to court filings, so the government was eager to offload it. That said, seized yachts are complicated assets, as their true ownership can be contested.

Hussain Sajwani, who is worth $13.3 billion, according to Bloomberg, has several ties to the president.

Pinned to the top of Hussain Sajwani's Instagram account is a video taken in January at Mar-a-Lago, where he and Trump said that Damac subsidiary Edgnex Data Centers would invest $20 billion in the US. Soon after, Hussain Sajwani and Abbas Sajwani attended events around Trump's 2025 inauguration, including an official inaugural ball.

Other posts from the past year include photos of them together in the Oval Office, in the UAE, where Hussain Sajwani was invited during Trump's official visit, and in Scotland, where Hussain Sajwani visited Trump's Turnberry Golf Course.

It's a partnership that extends back more than a decade, when Damac signed on to codevelop two Trump-branded golf courses in Dubai.

Trump has also turned down deals with Hussain Sajwani.

When Trump was first elected in 2016, the elder Sajwani, who attended a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago that year, said he wanted to form a closer relationship with Trump's businesses, NBC reported. A few months later, Trump said he had declined a $2 billion deal with him.

More recently, Trump and Hussain Sajwani have continued to do personal business together. Trump earned more than $6 million in fees from transactions related to Damac from January 2024 to June 2025, according to a disclosure report filed in June.

The Federal Aviation Administration is cutting flights across 40 of its busiest markets to maintain safety in American airspace amid the ongoing government shutdown.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said during a press conference on Wednesday that the FAA was reducing flight capacity by 10% at 40 high-volume locations starting Friday.

Duffy said it was a ""proactive"" measure in response to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, who he said are under increasing pressure and will soon go a month without pay.

""This is about where is the pressure and how do we alleviate the pressure,"" he said.

Since the government shutdown on October 1, there has been an increase in staffing shortages and a rise in delays and cancellations at airports across the United States.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said the agency would be working with airlines to determine how the flight reduction would be implemented. He said if there are additional staffing issues, additional measures would be taken.

""The data is telling us we need to do more, and we are going to do more,"" he said at the press conference. ""I want to reassure the American travelers that it is absolutely safe to fly in the American skies.""

Bedford also said that, in his 35 years in the industry, he was not aware of a similar measure ever being taken, adding, ""We're in new territory"" in terms of the government shutdown.

The shutdown, which has lasted for 36 days, is the longest in American history.

""The decision to reduce scheduled flight capacity, while necessary to keep our skies safe, will inevitably affect the travel experience, leading to fewer flights, longer delays, and more disruptions for travelers,"" Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said in a statement provided to Business Insider. ""All government shutdowns are irresponsible, and this decision underscores the urgent need to reopen the government.""

Duffy reiterated that flying is still safe.

Still, aviation safety consultant Anthony Brickhouse told Business Insider on Wednesday that controllers are highly skilled individuals, but humans can be stretched too thin.

""We design systems to minimize the impact of human mistakes, but when we add financial stress and fatigue to an already high-stress job, we could be looking at something a lot more serious than a two or three-hour delay,"" he said.

When emailed for comment, the FAA sent an auto-reply with the following statement on air traffic controller staffing: ""As Secretary Duffy has said, there have been increased staffing shortages across the system. When that happens, the FAA slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations.""

Sean Cudahy, an aviation reporter at The Points Guy, said because this will likely impact 40 of the busiest airports, which include major airline hubs, ""you're going to feel this impact across the entire country because these are going to be hubs that have flights going to every city imaginable.""

According to data compiled by Cirium, the aviation analytics company, a 10% reduction in flights at the 40 busiest airports could result in as many as 1,800 flights and 268,000 seats cut.

At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, for instance, if 10% of flights on Friday are cut, that would impact 121 flights and 14,524 seats, according to Cirium.

""If I have a flight this weekend or next week, I would definitely be concerned about whether that's going to take off and especially take off on time,"" Cudahy said.

Cudahy said he expects more specific information to be released in the coming days, but recommended that travelers keep up to date with their airlines and check their apps regularly for updates.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with He Jiabin, 35, the CEO of Ropeta, a Beijing-based robotics startup. His words have been translated and edited for length and clarity.

When it comes to decisions, I follow my instincts.

I grew up in Zhuzhou, Hunan, in central China. At 17, I left home to study product design at Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, where I started researching wearable hardware. In my third year, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia, where I helped scientists turn lab prototypes into products that people could actually use.One project explored whether a watch screen could be touch-sensitive — before the Apple Watch even existed. That inspired my graduation project: a line of smart backpacks. One tracked location for parents, another recorded video for cyclists, and a third powered a phone for seven days. The project earned national TV coverage.

One of my professors encouraged me to pursue academia, saying China needed more people developing a homegrown design discipline, rather than continuing to follow practices imported from foreign institutions.

But I was curious about how large companies scale and how their management methods drive tens of thousands of people to innovate. I wanted to approach things from a market perspective.

After graduation, I joined Baidu's learning lab as an interface designer, working on smart bicycles, self-driving cars, and smart glasses before moving to its research institute. While autonomous driving succeeded, other promising projects weren't pursued. I wanted to create products people could actually use.

So I joined the founding team of Ling Technology, which built Luka — an owl-shaped robot that reads to kids. We sold 4 to 5 million units. I was promoted to partner, overseeing product, design, production, and marketing. I stayed for five years, until intense competition drove down prices, and China's ""Double Reduction"" policy — which curbed after-school tutoring — cut investor interest in education tech.

We couldn't raise more funds, so I left.

In 2021, I joined Bytedance, as the leader of its industrial design department. I believed that among all the major tech companies, Bytedance was the most profitable, most aggressively innovative, and the one with the greatest potential for growth.

I worked on the leading brand of VR headsets in China. At our peak, the team had more than 2,000 people. But with such a big team, I didn't always feel involved or impactful.

At the same time, investors were looking for potential entrepreneurs.

Having spent a decade in human-computer interaction, I saw how ""weak AI"" products often disappointed users — and how the new AI wave could change that.

At a big company, the business is often quite vertical, leaving little freedom to explore.

I'm now the cofounder and CEO of Ropet, where I lead business management and product direction. I felt that making companion robots was a great direction. They require emotional subtleties in product development, not just a tech-oriented approach.

The company was founded in 2022 by Zhou Yushu, and I joined a year and a half later.

We secured $3 million in our first funding round, 10 million yuan in the second, and most recently, in August, we raised 30 million yuan, or about $4.2 million.

I've realized I'm not suited for big companies. I prefer working in a small team that innovates quickly. In a startup, I get direct market feedback. My goal is to sell 20,000 units by the end of the year.

We want to become the leading brand for cute pet robots globally.

Microsoft taught me how foreign companies operate. At Baidu, programmers led innovation, more than designers. Bytedance paid well but set tough goals, so people were very competitive.

At a big company, I could clock out at the end of the day. Now, there's no room to hide. No one else is there to solve problems. I think about the product and company issues 24/7. When I'm creating value, I don't see it as ""work.""

This feature is part of Lonely at the Top, a series that examines the link between wealth and loneliness.

When Lisa Johnson launched her business strategy career eight years ago and suddenly became a millionaire, many things in her life vanished. Her £35,000 debt (around $44,800). Her need to meticulously budget or worry about childcare costs for her twins. And, mysteriously enough, some of her friends, too.

""They just ghosted me — disappeared,"" Johnson told Business Insider. Johnson, who grew up in a housing development in England, said she hadn't changed how she treated the people around her, so ""it was a shock. No one ever spoke to me about it. I just felt dropped.""

Johnson isn't the only one whose wealth has gotten in the way of her lifelong relationships. It's happening across the pond as well. While America's millionaire class continues to grow, making up over 6% of the country's population, some self-made millionaires experience a more bittersweet taste of success: losing their old friends and family.

Some might work longer hours or have different spending habits than their social circles — habits that contributed to their wealth in the first place. Over time, they said they've felt judged for living differently, a topic that feels impossible to address and can drive a wedge even further between the closest bonds.

To add insult to isolation, no one wants to hear rich people complain. Nepo babies are frequently reviled, whether they're Hollywood-dominating celebrity children or New York City homeowners buying their apartments through trust funds. In the entertainment world, TV shows and films like ""The White Lotus,"" ""Succession,"" and ""Parasite"" have dominated culture for years, skewering the ultrawealthy to consistent acclaim (often from the well-to-do themselves).

This story is part of a series, ""Lonely at the Top,"" which examines the impact of wealth on the relationships of millionaires. Read more:

Still, millionaires aren't devoid of relationship issues. In some ways, they can experience wholly unique ones, because ""the world is not very compassionate to that kind of trouble and pain,"" Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist who hosts Fresh Produce Media's Audible series ""Emotional Investment,"" told Business Insider.

Loneliness is something not even the wealthy can buy their way out of. If anything, understanding how money changes relationships is the first step to keeping them.

Self-made millionaires tend to have a few distinct qualities. For one, their relationship with money can differ from that of their friends. They might focus more on long-term financial goals and be more stringent about saving.

When Lane Kawaoka became a millionaire by buying rental properties, he realized his newfound wealth was making him feel lonely. Much of it had to do with differing mindsets.

""My coworkers didn't understand things I found important,"" Kawaoka told Business Insider. ""It wasn't because those people were less intelligent than I am; we were just concerned about different things.""

Eventually, he stopped talking about his goals because he worried it sounded like he was bragging. He also didn't want people to assume he had lots of money to spare: ""Still being frugal at the time, I didn't want any excuse for me to have to pick up the bill all the time for my buddies.""

The millionaire can find themselves siloing off into a new class bubble because ""it's hard to plan and stay in touch with people who just can't do the same things that you can do,"" Clay Cockrell, a licensed clinical social worker focusing on high-net-worth individuals, told Business Insider.

Sometimes, the work schedule required to stay wealthy is what drives away old friends and family. Jeremy Barker, a millionaire CEO of a company that sells unique doors, was a firefighter. Starting his own company meant working longer hours on the side.

""My colleagues at the firehouse started teasing me more and more about how hard I was working,"" Barker told Business Insider. ""I wasn't spending as much time with them because I had different priorities — they wanted to hang out on days off, while I was always working on the business."" Soon, they stopped inviting him.

His attempts to split his time between both jobs left him distracted and distant. On the day his fire chief encouraged him to resign from the firehouse to better prioritize his company and family, Barker remembered coming home to near silence.

""Only my dog greeted me — my wife and daughter didn't even look up,"" he said. ""My wife noticed I was frustrated and told me if I wanted to be treated like a dad, I needed to start showing up like one.""

Even if millionaires believe their feelings — and potential judgments — aren't obvious, the truth usually comes out. Johnson remembers sharing her thoughts on money via social media, how she was working hard to move away from debt.

""I often felt like that irritated a few of my friends,"" she said. ""There were lots of comments that felt passive-aggressive, like: 'It's alright for you,' 'It's OK for the lucky ones,' and 'It's how the other half live.'""

Over time, the long working hours, declined invitations, and distinctly different financial goals can lead to schisms in millionaires' relationships. Tensions can especially come to a head when lending money is concerned.

""A family member recently asked me for money after telling me he'd been 'lounging' lately,"" Barker said. ""I just wish I could teach that guy — who is smart and physically capable — to work hard.""

""I've seen too many family rifts erupt when expectations aren't clearly spelled out,"" Joy Slabaugh told Business Insider. A millionaire and financial therapist, Slabaugh, asked her relative to sign an agreement to monthly interest-only payments of $100, with the principal due three months after the initial payment, for a $1,000 loan.

Privately, Slabaugh questioned if loaning a relative money, even with a repayment plan, was the right move: ""I was afraid that giving them money — even as a loan — might be more harmful than helpful,"" potentially enabling her relative.

The relative kept up with the payments at first, but then there were months of silence. Slabaugh later learned that they were going through some personal issues and ""felt so much shame"" about not paying the money back right away that they didn't reply.

""If I had been clearer and more emotionally honest from the beginning, we could've avoided months of silence and perhaps reduced their emotional strain,"" Slabaugh said.

For some millionaires, downplaying or even hiding their wealth feels like a Band-Aid to the problem. Over time, the omissions can stiffen relationships.

""It is a barrier to intimacy, in the sense of true knowing and connection for each other's unique set of experiences,"" Clayman said.

To be a healthy, well-rounded person, you need community, Cockrell said. Millionaires, who are still in the vast financial minority, ""just happen to have a complicating factor.""

He said the first step is to slowly open up to people, knowing that some may struggle with the truth — or try to take advantage of it — but that it's not one's job to manage other people's reactions. Cockrell said being wealthy is a lot like being exceptionally beautiful. ""People are going to be attracted to you for different reasons,"" he said, ""and it's important for you to own that, but then not let that necessarily cloud your judgment.""

Kawaoka said meeting other millionaires, particularly fellow first-generation ones, made him feel less alone. ""These people — many of them with seven- and eight-figure net worths — weren't arrogant or flashy,"" he said. ""They were people who had lost money, made it back, learned lessons, and kept moving forward.""

Befriending others like him was a huge relief and a moment of self-discovery. ""I wasn't introverted like I thought; I was just an extrovert who'd never found his tribe,"" he said.

Connections, of course, don't have to be limited to people with the same net worth. A great way to meet people is through volunteering and giving back, Cockrell said, but beware the impulse to just give away your money.

""Don't just write the check,"" Cockrell said. ""Go pick up a hammer, ladle some soup, get out there and meet people so that it's not just about the money. It's having relationships and contributing.""

Barker is still a part-time firefighter, picking up shifts every few months. ""I take a lot of ribbing; they'll call me Mr. Millionaire, or ask for business or life advice,"" he said. Still, it's a way to stay connected to his old friends.

Sometimes, giving back can mean treating your lifelong crew. Johnson said she takes about 20 of her long-term friends on a yacht trip around Greece every year. ""I didn't realize how much I took them for granted, but I'm so grateful for them now,"" she said. ""I know I can trust them because they liked me before I made my money.""

Roomba once reigned supreme in the world of robotic vacuums, conquering both dirty living room floors with its advanced tech and the marketplace it helped create.

But iRobot, the maker of the iconic self-cleaning disc-shaped vacuum, is now finding itself left in the dust as it teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. The Massachusetts-headquartered company, a pioneer in the robotics industry, has warned that it's running out of options — and cash.

iRobot has grappled with mounting financial strain in recent years, and the collapse of Amazon's planned $1.4 billion acquisition of the Roomba maker in early 2024 has only exacerbated the company's troubles.

After months of trying to find a new buyer, iRobot said in a regulatory filing last month that its last remaining potential acquirer pulled out ""following a lengthy period of exclusive negotiations.""

The possible iRobot buyer offered a price per share that was ""significantly lower than the trading price"" of its stock over recent months, the company said in the October 22 Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The debt-burdened iRobot warned in the filing that if it can't find fresh funding soon, it ""may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection.""

An iRobot spokesperson told Business Insider that, consistent with its policy, it does not comment ""on matters of this nature beyond our public disclosures.""

With the holiday season approaching, the spokesperson said the company remains ""focused on executing our strategy and delivering for our valued customers, partners, and consumers.""

iRobot first publicly warned investors that there was ""substantial doubt"" about its ability to continue ""as a going concern"" in a March earnings report.

That same month, the company rolled out a new fleet of Roomba vacuums and mops, which CEO Gary Cohen said was aimed at ""better positioning iRobot as the leader in the category that we created.""

""There can be no assurance that the new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies,"" the company said at the time.

iRobot's current financial position marks a stunning fall for a company that introduced the world to the Roomba vacuum more than two decades ago and has sold over 50 million models globally since.

Before there was Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, there was iRobot.

iRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — who had a ""vision of making practical robots a reality,"" the company says on its website.

Before iRobot had its consumer breakthrough with the launch of the Roomba vacuum in 2002, the company focused on designing robots for space-related research and military use.

In 1998, iRobot won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, to build a tactical mobile robot. This led to the development of iRobot's PackBot, which was later used in search operations at Manhattan's Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

iRobot boasts on its website that its robots have ""revealed mysteries of the Great Pyramid of Giza, found harmful subsea oil in the Gulf of Mexico, and saved thousands of lives in areas of conflict and crisis around the globe.""

When iRobot went public in November 2005 at an initial share price of $24, it was already known for its innovative robot vacuums.

By 2013, iRobot had sold over 10 million home cleaning robots, vastly outnumbering the more than 5,000 defense and security robots it had delivered to military and civil defense forces worldwide the year before.

The company sold its defense and security business to the private equity firm Arlington Capital Partners in 2016 for up to $45 million.

Over the past decade, iRobot's annual revenue peaked in 2021 at $1.56 billion, but sales have been falling ever since.

iRobot — which today slings models ranging in price from $269.99 to as high as $1,299.99 — may have set the standard for home robot vacuums, but competition has surged from Chinese rivals like Dreame, Roborock, and Ecovacs, and other brands like Shark and Samsung.

In an August SEC filing, iRobot acknowledged that it has, in recent years, ""seen increased competition with new product offerings in the robotic floorcare segment and have conceded some market share.""

Amazon agreed to buy iRobot in 2022 for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, but the deal fell apart two years later with the companies saying there was ""no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.""

The failed deal was a major blow to iRobot. The same day the companies announced that the proposed merger was off, iRobot said it would lay off 350 employees, or about 31% of its workforce. Angle, iRobot's cofounder and longtime CEO, also stepped down as part of the restructuring.

As the cash-strapped iRobot awaited the completion of the Amazon deal that never came, it took out a $200 million loan from the private equity firm Carlyle Group in July 2023.

iRobot said in last month's regulatory filing that it had further extended its loan waiver period to December 1 as its financial outlook darkens.

""We are currently in discussions with the Lenders to provide the additional capital we require to fund our ongoing business operations,"" iRobot wrote, adding that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection if the lenders ""do not provide this necessary funding and we are unable to find other sources of capital in the near term.""

The iRobot spokesperson told Business Insider, ""As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC, we have reached an agreement with our primary lender to extend our covenant waiver under our loan agreement through December 1, 2025, in order to continue our active and ongoing review of strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, exploring a potential sale or strategic transaction and refinancing our debt.""

Meanwhile, iRobot's shares — priced at $2.70 as of Wednesday's market close — have plunged about 65% year-to-date.

Sierra Campbell has four key necessities she won't leave home without: her phone, her keys, her wallet, and a small tote bag.

The first three she uses only for practicalities, like paying for things and looking up directions. The bag is the source of all her entertainment: Loaded with portable activities like crossword puzzles, knitting needles, and watercolor paints, it's a deliberately screen-free way for Campbell to spend her in-between moments.

The 31-year-old has dubbed this her ""analog bag,"" and considers it a key weapon in her constant battle against doomscrolling and brain rot.

""I firmly believe you cannot live a full life while unknowingly addicted to your phone,"" Campbell told me. ""You might be missing really wonderful opportunities to have a fun and deep life. The analog piece is such a cornerstone of that.""

When Campbell introduced the analog bag concept to her TikTok followers in August, she said the video's views and likes spiked well beyond her norm.

""It struck a nerve,"" she said.

In the two months since, a flock of young women have followed her example, with many showing off their own versions of Campbell's whimsical packing list: Disposable camera? Check. Needlepoint set? Check. Puzzle book? Check.

It may seem counterintuitive for a trend that celebrates screen-free life to resonate on TikTok, a platform that feeds on the exact habit these bags are fighting against. But all the women I spoke to for this piece said the appeal of the analog bag isn't anti-technology or anti-social media. Rather, it's part of a wider effort to use modern tools with care and intention — especially during the in-between moments of life, like when you're taking the train to work or waiting for a friend at a restaurant.

Too often, these analog bag carriers say, we squander this time by ceding our attention to the algorithm.

""My parents would always say, 'Count the cost,' and they were never talking about money,"" Campbell said. ""The cost for the convenience of our phones has gotten too high.""

Emily Karst, a 32-year-old school principal in Ohio, saw Campbell's video and instantly felt inspired. She, too, believes the key to using technology is moderation, and was looking for small ways to make that middle ground more attainable.

""What can I do to make it just as easy to pick up something that isn't my phone?"" she said. ""Sometimes it's because I want to check the time or I need to look at my directions or whatever. But more often, it's because there's been some sort of break in the action, and I've conditioned myself. I'm so uncomfortable being bored that I'm just going to instantly get that dopamine hit and watch a couple of TikToks real quick.""

""Instead, if there's something else that we can grab,"" she continued, ""it allows us to make a better decision.""

Since she began carrying her own analog bag, which she loaded with a watercolor kit, ""memory collecting"" book, and needlepoint set, Karst said the number of times she picks up her phone every day has plummeted.

""I've been so serious about this, mostly because I was alarming myself,"" Karst said. ""I don't want to live my whole adult life losing my ability to engage with good art and long books and novels and movies because I'm ruining my attention.""

Campbell cites ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg as a major inspiration for the concept of an analog bag. The popular self-help book, published in 2012, argues that replacing one habit with another is more effective than quitting cold turkey.

As someone with a self-described ""addictive personality,"" Campbell brings her analog bag everywhere because it ensures that phone alternatives are always within reach; the bag's contents offer easy substitutes when she feels that instinctive itch to pick up her phone, like a cigarette smoker who's trying to cut back might reach instead for a stick of gum.

Digital content is designed to be addictive, so Campbell's precautions are carefully considered. She packs a physical planner in her analog bag so she doesn't feel tempted to scroll if she needs to check her calendar. She even carries a Polaroid camera so she can interrogate whether she really needs a photo of something, or if it's just going to be snapped and then lost in the cloud, never to be seen again.

""If it's you versus your phone, the phone's going to win,"" Campbell said. ""Willpower alone won't work.""

Plenty of tech insiders and researchers have echoed Campbell's observations. The psychological concept of ""technostress"" has been in the public lexicon since at least 2018. Tim Kendall, a former executive at Facebook and Pinterest, told Yahoo Finance in 2020 that phone overuse is a stealthy phenomenon, describing it as a serious health issue.

""Most people think they spend two hours a day on their phone,"" Kendall said. ""When we look at the data, it's four and a half. So there's a disconnect between reality and your awareness.""

Indeed, recent studies have found that heavy consumption of short-form media is bad for your brain — it's linked to anxiety, depression, and shorter attention spans — and that even AI models can deteriorate when exposed to low-quality internet junk.

Still, the internet has become embedded in our daily routines and work lives. Being totally offline is a lofty and, for many, unappealing goal. Instead, those who carry analog bags or romanticize their #AnalogLife on TikTok simply strive to be mindful about their screen time — actively choosing when and why to engage with their devices, rather than scrolling mindlessly.

""We reach for our phones without really thinking first,"" Hannah Hofstetter, a 23-year-old healthcare worker based in Alabama, told me. ""A lot of times, it's because we're thinking we want to rest. We want it to give our brains a moment to rest. Well, that is the opposite of what's happening.""

When Hofstetter first saw an analog bag on her feed, she said she was struck with sudden clarity. Why had she even picked up her phone in the first place? Why had she opened the TikTok app? She couldn't remember the answers.

Now, when she's out with friends and she feels a lull in the conversation, Hofstetter doesn't reach for her phone — she reaches for her handy analog bag and pulls out a stack of Tarot cards.

""My first reaction was kind of an 'aha' moment,"" Hofstetter said. ""Like, wow, I'm not using my free will like I could be.""

The first time I saw that ICE was investing up to $2 billion in Polymarket, I did a double take. What do the immigration police want to do with a prediction market? I quickly realized the ICE in question was actually Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. That makes more sense, I thought — but also, only slightly? I thought the stock exchange guys were supposed to be the serious ones in the room, helping companies grow and people save for retirement, not teaming up with the guys who let you guess when the US government will admit aliens exist. But thus is reality in the year of our Lord 2025: Americans have a growing appetite for leaving their fortunes to the fates, and businesses are eager to capitalize.

""When people are given the means to bet, they're going to bet,"" says Jordan Bender, an equity research analyst at Citizens JMP.

The modern explosion of gambling in America began with the Supreme Court's 2018 decision to strike down a federal law prohibiting sports betting, leading to its proliferation across dozens of states. Now, much of the conversation is being dominated by another type of wagering: prediction markets. These platforms, which allow people to put money on a wide range of outcomes, from election results to natural disasters, have long been limited in the US. But recently, they've taken advantage of lax federal regulators and what they say are legal loopholes to offer their services in a growing number of states.

""It definitely looks, smells, and feels like gambling,"" says Steve Ruddock, a gambling-industry analyst and consultant and the author of Straight to the Point, a newsletter about the sector.

So do a lot of things these days. The lines between gambling and investing are increasingly blurred, from the crypto market to the stock market to sports, and, increasingly, everyday events. Arguments that this type of activity is beneficial because it shows us something about the wisdom of crowds, market inefficiencies, price discovery, or capital allocation are becoming harder and harder to buy. And businesses, even stodgy incumbents and unexpected players, are increasingly willing to capitalize on Americans' urge to risk their hard-earned cash. Everything's casino, and you're either getting in on the action or getting left behind.

I think a lot about a conversation I had a few years ago with Chris Grove, a sports-gambling-industry investor at Acies Investments, about the growth of sports betting apps such as DraftKings and FanDuel. He made a point that I discounted at the time: Once people get a taste for betting on one thing, they'll bet on a lot of things. This kind of gateway gambling represented a major opportunity not only for sportsbooks but also for investing apps and cryptocurrency platforms. When I relayed this to people, it felt like I was wearing a paranoid little tinfoil hat, but that case has quite clearly borne out in reality.

The recent hotspot has been prediction markets, most notably Kalshi and Polymarket, which match users willing to wager on either side of a discrete event. Kalshi has made a major push into sports, including in states such as California and Texas, where traditional sports betting is illegal. And as part of its push to become a ""financial super app,"" investing platform Robinhood has started branching into betting markets in partnership with Kalshi. ICE has invested in Polymarket and will distribute the prediction market's data to investing customers trying to gauge sentiment on issues such as politics, business developments, and current events. Polymarket, once blocked for users in the US, is on the verge of becoming available nationwide. The NHL has signed licensing agreements with both Kalshi and Polymarket.

More traditional sportsbooks, which set the odds and against which gamblers bet, aren't only expanding their offerings with things like online casino apps, they're also taking a page out of their new competitors' book, too. FanDuel is partnering with CME Group, a derivatives marketplace, to build an events contracts platform in the US that will let customers put money on where the price of gold and oil are headed, as well as economic indicators such as GDP and inflation. DraftKings has acquired the predictions platform Railbird.

When reached for comment, a FanDuel spokesperson pointed to a press release about the CME deal. DraftKings pointed to comments its CEO, Jason Robins, made at a gaming conference in October, downplaying concerns about competition from prediction markets, saying that sports betting apps are a ""vastly superior experience."" Polymarket didn't respond to a request for comment.

If your head is spinning at all of this, it's understandable — this is all fast-moving and precarious. For one thing, it appears to be a reversal of previous regulatory approaches. Gambling has historically been regulated by states in the US, and at the heart of the matter now is whether prediction markets are considered gambling and, therefore, whether states should regulate them. Prediction markets say they're OK because they're simply offering contracts on the outcomes of future events and aren't on the other side of the trade. Since these are futures contracts, like those offered for gold or oil, the theory — and current reality — is that prediction markets should be federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not by individual states. The CFTC may be going along with this for the time being, but there's a lot of gray area. Basically, an 18-year-old in California can bet on a Dodgers game on Kalshi now, if it's considered a federally-regulated event contract. If it's sports gambling, that's illegal in California, and even if it were allowed, most states put the age limit at 21. Sportsbooks have state tax obligations that prediction markets avoid. Winnings are taxed differently, too.

""The vast majority of people that I deal with in this industry look at this and say, 'This is gambling, it's insane that we're having this conversation,'"" Citizens JMP's Bender says.

Multiple states, including Massachusetts and Nevada, have sued or sent cease-and-desist letters to prediction markets, alleging they're offering illegal sports gambling. Native American tribes that operate casinos and sports betting operations in certain states have made similar claims. The answer to, ""Hey, is all of this activity on prediction markets kosher?"" seems to be ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

""The big question is, do these contracts violate all of the sports betting regulations? And that's kind of where things are right now,"" says Chad Beynon, an equity analyst at Macquarie. ""It's tricky investing a lot of money in this space right now, because it might completely go away.""

In an emailed statement, a Kalshi spokesperson told me the company is ""confident"" in its legal standing. ""Federal and state turf wars over commodities markets have been going on for decades in America, and the law is clear — Kalshi exists under the sole jurisdiction of the CFTC."" they said.

All the trickiness hasn't stopped some major players from getting involved. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund has invested in Polymarket. Donald Trump Jr. is involved with both Kalshi and Polymarket. The president's social media company, Trump Media, is planning to allow its Truth Social users to jump into prediction markets.

""You look at the money that is lined up behind these two names, and that's not money that has historically been involved with regulated gambling,"" Grove says.

To be sure, what counts as gambling has always been hazy to define, says Peter Malyshev, a partner in the financial services group at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. What constitutes a legitimate commodity futures contract is something regulators and courts battled over in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and when they arrived at their current definition, they couldn't have envisioned a world of sports betting taking place on mobile phones.

""The whole notion of what gambling is, what is not, is very, very loosey goosey and it's arbitrary,"" he says.

It's almost astounding to think about how commonplace speculation has become across the economy. A survey by the American Gaming Association found that 55% of US adults gambled in 2024, and Americans bet almost $150 billion on sports alone. That doesn't include activities that very much resemble gambling, such as exotic stock options, crypto, and prediction markets. I recently discovered members of my family are crossing the Wisconsin-Illinois border to place sports bets on NFL Sundays, as gambling is legal in the latter state but not the former. And I have not been immune to the allure. On a recent trip to Chicago, I stopped at a DraftKings bar outside Wrigley Field, where I could place bets. During a pre-season Bulls game, I checked out a FanDuel lounge to catch some contemporaneous baseball and hockey games and placed a few small bets from my phone. This is all stuff that would have been unimaginable five years ago.

""Once upon a time, you had to know a bookie or a broker or go to a casino, that's a lot more steps, and now it's just a few taps away,"" Parker Bach, a Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, who is studying digital political culture and prediction markets.

The less-than-ideal possible outcomes of gambling's expansion were put on full display in recent days with the NBA betting scandal. Federal prosecutors allege that current and former basketball players, as well as people in their orbit, passed along insider information about players ahead of games to place bets on them. Sportsbooks are the victims of the alleged crimes — they're the ones that were defrauded. However, the case has made clear opportunities for funny businesses that widespread gambling affords.

Consumer protection and legal issues aside, it's worth considering how some of this activity is distorting the economy and blurring the lines between investing and pure speculation. Investing is intended to drive capital allocation in ways that foster good businesses, good services, and good products, and, ultimately, grow the economy. Gambling is entertainment. But when money from the former pot goes into the latter pot, that could become a problem — it's not capital that's going toward creating anything, it's just a transfer of wealth. Tyler Gellasch, the president and CEO of the Healthy Markets Association, a nonprofit focused on increasing transparency for investors, says that the drive to funnel more money into speculative activities isn't just a concern for individual bettors or investors. ""It also takes real money out of the real economy and into essentially side bets,"" he tells me.

Proponents of prediction markets say they have real value. They tap into the ""wisdom of the crowd"" and, in elections, may rival polling in predicting who will come out ahead. They can be used as a hedge against the possibility of different events — you place a little money on something that would hurt you, like your house burning down in a California wildfire, so that if the worst comes to pass, you'll make money to offset the loss. These arguments can be shaky: Pretty much everyone on prediction markets was wrong about the 2025 papal conclave.

I don't want to say everything's casino, but a lot of things are casino.

""I mean, if we're just being completely honest, it's all gambling,"" Ruddock says.

It speaks to a sort of nihilism within the American public — this idea that the system's flawed, so you may as well go for it with a gamble. It also says something about just how alluring speculation can be; people do it because it's exhilarating and fun and, for most, not a problem. We can quibble over legal and regulatory definitions all day, but the demand for speculation is there, and the supply is ever-expanding to meet it.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Eric Sim, 55, a former UBS banker who became a published author, professional speaker, and career coach. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his education and employment history.

When I was a young banker, I often heard my more successful colleagues bragging about their new watches or latest sports cars.

It wasn't long before I gave in to peer pressure. I bought myself a $3,000 watch. That made me happy for a few weeks, but the novelty of owning the watch faded quickly.

I stopped wearing that watch and switched back to my Timex, which I continue to wear.

Needless to say, I didn't follow my colleagues' footsteps when they bought their exotic cars or private wine cellars. I began to realize that instead of spending my money frivolously to impress others, I was better off using it to buy my freedom.

When you are working a regular job, you have to work with people that you may or may not like. You don't get a choice. But if you have freedom, then you can choose what you want to work on and who you want to work with. That's far more invaluable.

That mindset allowed me to retire eight years ago, when I was still in my forties.

Holding back on big-ticket expenditures during my banking days has given me the freedom to pursue my passions and interests in retirement.

In 2005, I contemplated going back to school to get an architecture degree. I eventually dropped the idea once I factored in the costs of switching careers. Besides having to study for five years, I would also miss out on the income and bonuses I could have gotten if I had just stayed in banking. It just didn't make sense to do it.

Now, in retirement, I could finally scratch that itch without any financial worries. I recently attended a six-week summer course on landscape architecture at UC Berkeley.

Of course, attending summer school at UC Berkeley isn't cheap. The fees, flights, and accommodation add up to around $20,000. That's on top of the six-week duration, which would be hard to make time for if I were still working a full-time job.

Going to UC Berkeley was only possible because I wasn't tied to a job. Most of my peers in banking still have to work because they stretched themselves financially with their expensive purchases.

By not splurging on sports cars or wine cellars, I had the flexibility to pursue the experience of being a student again. That's priceless.

We often spend a lot of time and energy worrying if people will look down on us based on the type of house we live in or the car we own.

Since leaving banking, I have been driving the smallest car I have ever owned. At first, I wondered how people would perceive that. Would they think I was no longer successful after quitting banking?

Surprisingly, no one cared. I have given people lifts in my car, and no one has ever treated me differently because of my car. These worries are usually all in our heads. Most people are more worried about their own image and reputation than about other people's.

There are three stages in your life.

In stage one, when you are about to join the workforce, you have time and health, but no money. Then, in stage two, when you are in your prime, you have money and health, but no time because you have to work and take care of your family.

Finally, when you are in stage three and have retired, you might find that your health has deserted you. Yes, you have time and money, but you can't really enjoy it.

I believe there's a magical stage between stages two and three, where you have time, health, and money.

My goal has always been to prolong that period, which usually lasts less than five years for most people. Some may even jump from stage two to three without enjoying the magical stage.

If you can rein in your spending in stage two, you can stretch the magical stage to 10 and 15 years. That's the real sweet spot we should all aim for.

Surveillance footage showed the UPS cargo plane that crashed near a Louisville airport lost its left engine just before takeoff, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said.

During a press conference on Wednesday, J. Todd Inman, an NTSB member, said that the CCTV security footage reviewed by the agency showed ""the left engine detaching from the wing during the takeoff roll."" Takeoff roll is the distance an aircraft travels on the runway just before it goes airborne.

""This and other videos, along with evidence we are finding, are very valuable assets to our investigators,"" Inman said.

The UPS plane, a 34-year-old widebody jet manufactured by McDonnell-Douglas, which merged with Boeing Company in 1997, was headed to Honolulu on Tuesday when it crashed near the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday evening.

The tail number was N259UP. It was first delivered to Thai Airways in 1991, before being acquired by UPS in 2006.

A screengrab of a social media video that was posted by Reuters showed the cargo plane banking hard left in the moment of the impact before the aircraft was engulfed in flames.

It's very rare, but engines can shear off at high vibrations. Mark Stephens, a former Delta MD-11 pilot and instructor, described it to Business Insider as a washing machine that spins out of control.

""The most dangerous time to lose an engine is right after takeoff,"" he said. ""They would have very little time to react.""

Louisville Fire Department chief Brian O'Neill said on Tuesday that the aircraft had around 38,000 gallons of fuel on board.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in an X post on Wednesday evening that the death toll had reached at least 11 people and expected it to be 12 ""by the end of the day.""

The crash caused UPS to halt package sorting operations at Worldport, the company's automated package sorting facility near the Louisville airport. UPS said in an updated statement on Wednesday that it canceled Second Day air shipping services from the facility.

A Boeing spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider that its technical team is supporting the NTSB's investigation in the matter.

""We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this accident,"" the spokesperson said.

There are about 60 MD-11 aircraft flying worldwide for cargo airlines UPS, FedEx, and Western Global, per Cirium. It has not flown passengers since 2014.

This is the second major cargo airline crash in a month. On October 20, an Emirates SkyCargo plane killed two people on the ground after it ran off the runway in Hong Kong.

Bend the knee, or go work somewhere else.

That's the message a growing number of company leaders are preaching, now that a leaner workforce is in and DEI is out.

Palantir is ""the first company to be completely anti-woke,"" chief executive Alex Karp said on an earnings call this week. AT&T's John Stankey warned employees this summer that an ""'employment deal' rooted in loyalty"" is dead. Also this summer from GitHub's Thomas Dohmke: ""Either you have to embrace the Al, or you get out of your career.""

The rhetoric represents a stark shift in tone from a few years ago, when CEOs such as Jamie Dimon and David Solomon voiced support for diversity in the wake of the #MeToo movement and George Floyd's death. At the time, employees could job-hop like jackrabbits, and bosses had to play nice.

Now, white-collar layoffs are on the rise, workers are job-hugging, and CEOs are investing in AI tools to automate work.

""It's all about control,"" said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. ""People in leadership positions are feeling like they finally have the upper hand again.""

There's strength in numbers. As CEOs see their peers let it rip, seemingly without consequences, they're emboldened to do the same, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

""Follow-the-leader happens in part because people who have been holding back from saying what they want feel more empowered once they are not the first to say it,"" he said. ""Expect more get-tough talk in the next few weeks.""

Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions.

Leaders are generally free to mold their workforces however they believe is best for their companies, and their employees can either play ball or move on, said Jennifer Deal, a senior research scientist at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.

""Most organizations are not democracies,"" she said, adding, ""If you don't like it, you need to go somewhere else.""

This isn't just Big Tech going hardcore, pushing workers to do more with less, even if that means longer hours and fewer perks. Leaders are also demanding that employees align with their views on matters such as remote work, AI usage, and even politics.

President Donald Trump cancelled DEI initiatives at federal agencies shortly after taking office in January and lambasting ""woke-ism."" In the months since, the same blunt language has been appearing in bosses' rhetoric.

On the earnings call, Karp noted that Palantir's software powers ICE and boasted that the company supports the Trump administration's stance on Israel. Palantir is ""fighting for the right side of what should work in this country — meritocracy, lethal technology,"" Karp said. ""I don't know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial.""

In his letter to shareholders published the same day, Karp penned a screed against multiculturalism, calling for a ""rejection of a vacant and neutered and hollow pluralism.""

AT&T's Stankey didn't touch on politics, but in a memo to managers, he made clear he would no longer tolerate remote work or prioritize tenure as a reason for advancement.

""We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements and towards a more market-based culture,"" he wrote.

Some CEOs are also drawing a hard line on AI policies. In an employee memo last spring, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said AI usage is now ""a baseline expectation"" for all employees of the e-commerce company. ""Before asking for more Headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI,"" Lütke wrote.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong went even further. In August, he mandated AI onboarding for engineers at the cryptocurrency exchange and fired some who didn't comply.

Not everyone is feeling empowered. Some CEOs are staying tight-lipped because their values don't align with those of the Trump administration — or because they're afraid of drawing critical attention.

""They're afraid of getting flagged or on a list that would imply they shouldn't be engaged by the government,"" Marin Richardson, CEO of Disrupt PR, previously told Business Insider. ""It's just such a polarizing climate.""

Some of the CEOs now openly embracing Trumpian views once struck a different tone, presenting themselves as politically neutral or even progressive.

Palantir's Karp, for instance, backed former Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign last year. Still, he describes himself as ""left of center,"" as he said in an interview on CNBC on Tuesday.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who has championed liberal causes in Silicon Valley such as public education, recently called on Trump to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco to address crime in the city. He later walked back his comments and apologized for them.

And just days before Trump started his second White House term in January, Mark Zuckerberg changed Meta's content-moderation policies to more closely reflect the priorities of the incoming administration. Four years earlier, at the end of Trump's first term, Zuckerberg blocked Trump from Facebook indefinitely, stating in a post on the social media site that ""Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.""

Even Jensen Huang, who in over 30 years of running Nvidia has remained largely apolitical and didn't endorse a candidate during the 2024 election, thanked the audience at a company conference on Monday for ""making America great again.""

Hardline values may be here to stay, with business leaders who now have the upper hand reluctant to give up what they've gained. Some experts think they'll face pressure to soften if the economy shifts.

""Right now, they're in a good position because lots of companies are laying off workers,"" said Wayne Cascio, a management professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. ""The pendulum will swing back as it always does.""

At that point, the hardliners will have a choice: Change their tune to keep or recruit workers with different values or stick to their guns and pay the consequences, if there are any.

One thing they won't be able to do, Cascio said, is undo the past.""These words will be available for people to see in the future,"" Cascio said. ""There is no eraser with the internet.""

It's been a little over a month since Meta launched Vibes, the all-AI video feed inside its stand-alone Meta AI app. I regret to inform you that it seems to be full of what I'm calling boomerslop.

And in particular, it's full of politically charged boomerslop about President Donald Trump.

First, let me explain boomerslop: It's AI slop that's particularly appealing to a Facebook-loving boomer. I say this with love and affection for baby boomers. Time comes for us all, and every generation gets roasted for its digital foibles.

Boomerslop isn't even necessarily made by boomers. (Meta told me that boomers aren't the majority of Meta AI users.) But, let's say, this stuff is spiritually boomerish — it appeals to a boomer sensibility.

What makes this stuff boomerslop isn't just that it might be fooling older people into thinking it's real. I'd argue that OpenAI's Sora or other AI tools are much better at making highly realistic AI videos that could actually fool people (Meta's own head AI scientist, Yann LeCun, recently seemed to fall for an AI video of police interacting with ICE).

It's that this is the kind of video that boomers enjoy — specifically, jokey memes of Donald Trump. Whether the videos are pro-Trump or anti-Trump depends on the audience.Meta didn't quite buy my vibe about Vibes.

""The vast majority of Vibes content viewed is focused on lifestyle and entertainment topics like sci-fi, fashion, motivational themes, and pets,"" Faith Eischen, a Meta spokesperson, told Business Insider. ""In other words, while Business Insider may find this interesting, this content is not representative of the Vibes vibe.""

Indeed, I do find it interesting! And I don't disagree that it's not all Trump, Obama, and Biden videos. But there were enough to make it noticeable — especially compared to how the feed looked when it first launched.

Let's recall the mid-to-late aughts, when Facebook was known as ""the place where uncles yell at each other online."" The news feed at the time rewarded highly divisive content that stirred negative emotions.

Back in 2016, people were posting ""Lock her up"" memes on Facebook, which flooded everyone's feed. After realizing this was a problem, Facebook did a variety of things to try to correct this, including limiting the reach of political posts in 2024 (it has since eased up on that).

Now in 2025, you have people on Vibes posting divisive Trump videos made with AI. Maybe it's like carcinization, where eventually all Meta products evolve into magnets — at least in some cases! —for boomer ragebait.

There's also something depressing here.

In theory, AI video is a magical tool that could create all sorts of wonderful, creative things. But we ended up instead with anodyne boomerslop that vibrates on the same wavelength as tiresome jokes like ""Cheeto-in-chief"" or ""Let's go Brandon.""

To use a tired joke here, the Vibes are off.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tatiana Teppoeva, a 49-year-old entrepreneur in Redmond, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I'm an entrepreneur with a Ph.D. in economics and two master's degrees, and I'm currently pursuing an MBA. I'm also a US patent holder in predictive AI, a certified personality profiler, and certified in nonverbal communication, voice, and speech analysis.

At the start of my career, I worked at Boeing as a business analyst, where I led global customer satisfaction initiatives and internal employee engagement analytics.

In May 2011, I joined Microsoft as a senior research manager. From 2015 to 2025, I transitioned into a senior data and applied scientist role, where I developed and patented an AI model for predicting hardware failures.

When I was laid off from Microsoft after 14 years, I started a company, One Nonverbal Ecosystem, rather than seeking a new corporate job. Now I teach executives how to command the room and project the presence they want.

My first reaction was disbelief and pure happiness. I picked up the phone and called a friend to share the news.

For more than a year, I had been thinking about leaving to start my own company, but it was not an easy decision after a 17-year stable career at Boeing and Microsoft.

I even had a resignation letter saved in my drafts, waiting for the right moment. When the layoff happened, I felt it was a green light, and I was grateful.

Microsoft provided me with clarity and a financial cushion with severance and medical coverage, which allowed me to start building my business without the immediate pressure of financial concerns.

I watched him start from nothing and build something impressive as a business owner in the construction space. He wasn't interested in college, and I didn't know how it would turn out, but I told him it was the perfect time to experiment. If it worked, wonderful. If not, he would still gain valuable experience. I've always believed we either win or we learn; there are no failures.

Watching his journey encouraged me to take the same leap. I had wanted to start my own business since I was 30, but life circumstances made me put that dream on hold.

But now, my kids are older, and I have my degrees and experience. I know I could always return to employment if I want to.

One time while at Microsoft, we were in the middle of a high-stakes incident review, the kind where everyone is under pressure because millions of users could be affected.

On the surface, the team looked motivated and fully engaged, but when we talked privately afterward, many colleagues admitted they were working out of fear of being blamed if something went wrong.

That moment showed me how often performance in corporate settings is powered by fear rather than real drive. Fear can create short bursts of results, but it's not sustainable in the long run. I learned that people do their best work when they feel trust and clarity, not when they're trying to avoid punishment.

I officially launched my business in spring 2025. Some days I work 16 hours and I love it, and other days I might work zero. I decide when and what I do. I really enjoy learning new things, and this is a completely new world for me.

At times, it feels overwhelming because I have 100 ideas competing in my head, so I have to work on focusing.

I've been published in the media, spoken on podcasts, created my first online course, trained small business teams, and worked with high-level individuals — all things I had never done before. Recently, I hired my first employee part-time.

For me, it's actually the opposite. I'm part of many communities and groups, so I often have to step back to focus on my top priorities.

The real difference from corporate life is that now, even when I feel overwhelmed, it's because of my own choices — and that feels like freedom.

In this article

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of some of their obesity drugs, including upcoming pills, in a landmark effort to expand access to the costly blockbuster treatments.

The agreements will cut prices of so-called GLP-1 drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026 and offer the treatments directly to consumers at a discount on a website the Trump administration is launching in January called TrumpRx.gov.

That means Medicare will start covering obesity drugs for some patients for the first time starting mid-2026, a long-awaited move that could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.

Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month for everyone getting them through Medicare, Medicaid or TrumpRx, a senior administration official who declined to be named told reporters during a briefing Thursday. Novo Nordisk's oral version of its obesity injection Wegovy could enter the market by year-end, while Eli Lilly's pill orforglipron could launch next year.

Starting doses of existing injections like Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRX, but will ""trend down"" to $245 per month over a two-year period, another senior administration official said during the briefing.

Wegovy and Zepbound have not been covered by Medicare for weight loss, ""and they've only rarely been covered by Medicaid,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""They've often cost consumers more than $1,000 per month, some a lot more than that. ... That ends starting today.""

The deals are among the most politically significant announcements to date in the Trump administration's push to rein in high U.S. drug costs by tying them to the lowest prices abroad. As part of the president's ""most favored nation"" policy, he has announced deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from planned pharmaceutical tariffs.

""This is the biggest drug in our country, and that's why this is the most important of all the [most favored nation] announcements we've made,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the briefing. ""This is going to have the biggest impact on the American people. All Americans, even those who are not on Medicaid, Medicare, are going to be able to get the same price for their drugs, for their GLP-1s.""

Kennedy claimed the American public will lose 125 million pounds by this time next year, saying the expanded access will have ""dramatic effects on human health"" in the U.S.

The list prices of existing obesity drugs – roughly $1,000 to $1,350 per month before insurance – are a huge barrier for patients, many of whom could benefit from their ability to promote weight loss and ease other related health complications such as cardiovascular risks and sleep apnea. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk already have programs to sell their weight loss drugs at a discount directly to cash-paying consumers, but the new agreements appear to take those efforts to boost access a step further. 

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have agreed to cut the price Medicare pays for GLP-1s it already covers for diabetes and other indications, along with those drugs for obesity, to $245 per month. The companies agreed to extend lower government pricing for their GLP-1 drugs – $245 per month across all other nonstarting doses – to all 50 Medicaid programs for all covered uses. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not.

But Medicare coverage could have a bigger impact on who gets the drugs because the program covers about 66 million people, and is the primary source of insurance for people ages 65 and above. The new obesity drug coverage will be enabled through a pilot program designed to cover a majority of beneficiaries under Medicare Part D, which are the program's prescription drug plans.

Another senior administration official said around 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Eligible patients will fall into three cohorts. The first includes those who are overweight, with a body mass index greater than 27 or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.

The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure. The third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35.

GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a much broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. The administration official said, ""We are constraining the access for patients that will benefit clinically from it, we've worked very hard to strike a balance between broad access that just makes sure to capture patients that will benefit clinically.""

As part of the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk also made similar pledges to the ones other drugmakers have made as part of Trump's most favored nation agreements. The companies will guarantee most favored nation pricing on all new medicines they bring to market, provide that pricing to every state Medicaid program, offer at least U.S. net prices or most favored nation pricing on nearly all primary care drugs on TrumpRx and share savings from foreign drug price increases on existing products, one senior administration official said. 

Also on Thursday, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. 

Eli Lilly's pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per month. 

In a statement Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the deal marks ""a pivotal moment in U.S. health care policy and a defining milestone for Lilly,"" which is focused on ""improving outcomes, strengthening the U.S. healthcare system, and contributing to the health of our nation for generations to come.""

In a separate statement, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said, ""today's announcement will bring semaglutide medicines to more American patients at a lower cost."" Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic.

It's not the first time the government has floated Medicare coverage of obesity drugs. Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule at the end of his term that would have allowed the program to cover those treatments, but the Trump administration in April declined to finalize the measure. 

Biden's proposal would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries. But it was controversial at the time, as it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over nine years, a congressional analysis found.

But some health experts contend that covering the drugs could eliminate the downstream costs involved with treating obesity-related conditions. 

Semaglutide is also included in the next round of Medicare drug price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. Trump is expected to unveil the new prices of the 15 drugs selected for those talks by Nov. 30. 

Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro, likely won't be eligible for those negotiations until the end of the decade.

Airlines rushed to provide travelers updates after the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it would reduce flights across 40 airports as the longest government shutdown in history continues to drag on.

Many major airlines said they would waive cancellation fees for even their most basic tickets, which often come with penalties for changes.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said he would reduce flight capacity by roughly 10%, affecting 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.

The FAA has not yet announced which ""high traffic"" airports would be affected.

These are the airports that are expected to be impacted, based on preliminary information before the agency meets with airlines to finalize cuts, CNBC's Phil LeBeau reported. The preliminary list includes some of the country's largest airports and major international hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City.

Preliminary list:

On Wednesday, Duffy said the reduction was a ""proactive"" measure due to the delays and cancellations already occurring due to the shutdown. Air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees required to work during a shutdown, have missed paychecks, and the FAA has said the closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among controllers.

Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time.

""We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing,"" Duffy added.

Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he could ""shut the whole airspace down"" if the shutdown drags on.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday that additional measures may be implemented after the reduction, which he said he has never seen before in his time in the industry. The officials said they were planning to meet with airlines to discuss which flights would be cut.

In a Wednesday memo to United Airlines employees, CEO Scott Kirby said the airline will not be reducing long-haul international flying and hub-to-hub flying, instead reducing regional and domestic flights that do not fly between hubs.

The airline also offered all customers refunds even if their flights are not impacted. Kirby said that included ""non-refundable tickets and those customers with basic economy tickets.""

In a statement, Delta Air Lines said it expects to operate the ""vast majority"" of its flights as scheduled and will offer changes, cancellations or refunds for customers' flights during the impacted period. Delta also said that would include basic economy fares, without penalty.

Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said he highly recommends travelers flying Friday or in the next 10 days book a backup ticket on another carrier as the flight reductions begin to avoid getting stranded due to flight cancellations.

""I'm sorry this is happening. Hopefully the shutdown is over soon,"" Biffle wrote on LinkedIn. ""Just giving everyone practical travel advice.""

American Airlines said it expects the ""vast majority of customers' travel will proceed as planned,"" adding that the airline will reach out to travelers proactively as schedule changes occur.

The airline also said it will offer immediate rebooking options for all impacted travelers and that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason will be able to change their flight or request a refund without penalty. As of Thursday morning, the airline was still awaiting clarifying information from the FAA about which of its flights will be impacted.

Southwest Airlines also released a statement saying that the majority of its flights will not be impacted and that its international flights should operate as usual. The airline said it will ""proactively communicate well in advance and will offer flexibility in travel plans.""

The Association of Flight Attendants, representing 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, released a statement Wednesday urging Congress to end the shutdown so air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers can get paid.

""The false narrative that this shutdown is a choice of either paying federal workers or protecting affordable healthcare is outrageous when both crises were manufactured by the exact people who can fix it,"" the statement read.

Experts recommend consumers who are set to travel in the next week stay on top of flight cancellations and delays through the websites and apps.

Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at travel site The Points Guy, said flexibility ""is going to be key"" as travelers rush to rebook, adding it's important to download each airline's mobile app and enable all notifications.

""A lot of the times, you have to actually enable notifications on individual trips or in your account to text you if there are changes or disruptions,"" Ewen told CNBC.

He recommended anyone with non-urgent travel reschedule their trips, though that likely only applies to a small number of travelers, and consider choosing other forms of transportation instead. For essential trips, Ewen said passengers should be prepared for long wait times, use self-service rebooking tools and be aware of the fact that many other people will also be rebooking and scrambling for limited seats.

Ewen said he has been covering the industry for many years, and the last time he and his colleagues saw a major, national disruption in air travel like this was 9/11.

""The biggest thing is a lot of kindness goes a long way,"" he said. ""So if you're at an airport and you find out that your flight is canceled, I promise you screaming at that airline employee is not going to get you rebooked any faster — in fact, it's probably going to make them less likely to be willing to help you. So recognize that everyone is in this together.""

AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the company recommends arriving at the airport extra early to avoid long lines and avoid checking in a bag if possible in case flights get canceled.

""Ultimately, there's a lot that's out of travelers' control — so control what you can, and be as flexible as possible,"" Diaz said.

Travel insurance can reimburse consumers for certain costs and inconveniences incurred from a trip disruption, like flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or unforeseen costs for lodging and meals.

Consumers have been buying travel insurance at an elevated rate amid the government shutdown, but travel and insurance experts warn that such policies don't offer blanket protection for shutdown-related travel snafus, and a lot depends on the fine print.

For example, a policyholder generally can't get insurance benefits if they choose to cancel their travel plans to avoid any headaches. Cancel-for-any-reason coverage is an exception, though it also comes with its own caveats.

Whether or not a policyholder gets compensated may come down to the rationale an airline provides for a delayed or canceled flight.

Many insurers only pay benefits if a delay or cancellation is attributable to a ""common carrier"" disruption like a mechanical failure, travel experts said.

""Airlines typically won't cite causes other than operational terms like 'mechanical issues' or general delays, cancellations, or lost belongings, even during a government shutdown,"" Lauren McCormick, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, wrote in a recent blog post. ""So, these are generally still covered under most comprehensive travel insurance plans.""

In this article

Duolingo's stock cratered 27% on lighter-than-expected guidance as the language learning platform zeroed in on user growth in lieu of near-term monetization.

""We have made a slight shift over the last quarter in how we invest, and we're investing a lot more in long-term things because we see that as such a big opportunity ahead of us,"" CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn told CNBC's Jon Fortt.

For the current quarter, Duolingo expects bookings to range between $329.5 million and $335.5 million, falling short of a $344.3 million estimate from FactSet. Adjusted EBITDA was forecasted to range between $75.4 million and $78.8 million, versus the $80.5 million expected.

Duolingo grew paid subscribers to 11.5 million and topped the 11.38 million expected by StreetAccount. But daily and monthly active users came up short at 50.5 million and 135.3 million, respectively. Analysts polled by StreetAccount had forecasted 51.2 million daily and 137.4 million monthly users.

Over the last several months, Duolingo has implemented a slew of new artificial intelligence tools, including an interactive video call feature to try and lure more paying subscribers. The company has also rolled out more language courses in record time with the help of AI.

""There are experiments that put monetization and user growth at odds, and part of my job has been, always, arbitrating between these two,"" von Ahn told CNBC.

Over the last few months, he said the company has been ""really shifting that trade off to be much more towards user growth.""

Duolingo's revenues grew 41% during the quarter to $272 million, surpassing the $260 million estimate from analysts polled by LSEG. Total bookings jumped 33% year over year to about $282 million and also beat estimates.

Net income grew to $292.2 million, or $5.95 per share, up from $23.4 million, or 49 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said net income was helped by a one-time tax income benefit of $222.7 million.

Duolingo also boosted its full-year revenue guidance to between $1.0275 billion and $1.0315 billion. That's up from its previous guidance of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion.

KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson downgraded shares sector weight from an overweight rating as the company's focus on long-term product initiatives weighs on near-term growth and valuation.

He wrote that ""meaningful financial benefits"" from these initiatives could take ""several quarters"" to materialize.

In this article

A federal judge in Texas on Thursday dismissed a criminal conspiracy case against Boeing over two crashes of its 737 Max jetliner that killed 346 people, despite expressing sharp skepticism about the wisdom of the Department of Justice's request that he toss the case.

Some families of victims of the crashes had strongly opposed the DOJ's move in May asking Judge Reed O'Connor to dismiss the case in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth.

The DOJ, which had accused Boeing of deceiving federal regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes, at the time of the dismissal request said Boeing had agreed to pay or invest $1.1 billion in fines and compensation for victims' families.

The dismissal comes more than a year after Boeing and the DOJ said they had reached an agreement that required the company to plead guilty and serve a term of probation.

The first crash, of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia occurred in late October 2018, and the second crash, of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, occurred nearly five months later, in March 2019.

O'Connor, in his dismissal order, said that victims' families who opposed the dismissal ""are correct"" that a nonprosecution agreement that the DOJ reached with Boeing ""fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public.""

O'Connor agreed with them that the agreement ""disregards the need for Boeing to be subject to independent monitoring.""

But the judge wrote that he did not have authority to deny the dismissal request even though he ""disagrees with the Government that dismissing the criminal information in this case is in the public interest.""

""The Court recognizes that 'in every political institution a power to advance the publichappiness involves a discretion that may be abused.,'"" O'Connor wrote, citing one of the Federalist Papers.

""Nevertheless, poor discretion may not be countered with judicial overreach,"" he said.

Boeing on Wednesday reached settlements in three lawsuits filed by families of victims of the second crash, after a jury had been selected for the trial of one of those cases in Chicago federal court.

In a statement Thursday about the dismissal of the criminal case, Boeing said, ""We are committed to honoring the obligations of our agreement with the Department of Justice.""

""We are also committed to continuing the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs,"" the company said.

The DOJ criminally charged Boeing in January 2021 with conspiracy to defraud the United States for the company's alleged obstruction of the Federal Aviation Administration's evaluation of the Max's maneuvering characteristics augmentation system.

At the same time that case was filed, the DOJ said it had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing, which effectively suspended the case's prosecution.

But in May 2024, the DOJ told O'Connor that Boeing had breached the deferred prosecution deal by ""failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.""

In July 2024, the DOJ and Boeing submitted a plea agreement to O'Connor that called for the company to plead guilty.

O'Connor rejected the plea agreement because its terms ""were not in the public interest,"" the judge noted in his order Thursday.

In May, months after President Donald Trump entered the White House for a second term, the DOJ asked O'Connor to dismiss the case altogether.

O'Connor in his order questioned the DOJ's rationale for the nonprosecution agreement that was part of the dismissal request.

""The Government now believes that Boeing can be trusted to select a compliance consultantbecause Boeing has made 'meaningful progress in improving its anti-fraud compliance and ethics programs,'"" O'Connor wrote.

""In summary, the Government's position in this lawsuit has been that Boeing committed crimes sufficient to justify prosecution, failed to remedy its fraudulent behavior on its own during the [Deferred Prosecution Agreement] which justified a guilty plea and the imposition of an independent monitor, but now Boeing will remedy that dangerous culture by retaining a consultant of its own choosing.""

""Given Boeing's history related to this case (and the Government's continued failure to gain Boeing's compliance), the Movants are correct that this agreement fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public,"" O'Connor wrote.

The judge also wrote that he found the DOJ's claim that there was ""uncertainty and litigation risk"" from going to trial in the case to be ""unserious.""

""The Government has a confession from Boeing, signed by the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, admitting to all the elements of the conspiracy charge against it in the DPA,"" O'Connor said. ""As such, the assertion that there is a legitimate risk that Boeing would be acquitted at a trial lacks support.""

Google is making its most powerful chip yet widely available, the search giant's latest effort to try and win business from artificial intelligence companies by offering custom silicon.

The company said on Thursday that the seventh generation of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), called Ironwood, will hit the market for public use in the coming weeks, after it was initially introduced in April for testing and deployment.

The chip, built in-house, is designed to handle everything from the training of large models to powering real-time chatbots and AI agents. In connecting up to 9,216 chips in a single pod, Google says the new Ironwood TPUs eliminate ""data bottlenecks for the most demanding models"" and give customers ""the ability to run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.""

Google is in the midst of an ultra high-stakes race, alongside rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, to build out the AI infrastructure of the future. While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), Google's TPUs fall into the category of custom silicon, which can offer advantages on price, performance and efficiency.

TPUs have been in the works for a decade. Ironwood, according to Google, is more than four times faster than its predecessor, and major customers are already lining up. AI startup Anthropic plans to use up to 1 million of the new TPUs to run its Claude model, Google said.

Alongside the new chip, Google is rolling out a suite of upgrades meant to make its cloud cheaper, faster, and more flexible, as it vies with larger cloud players Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

In its earnings report last week, Google reported third-quarter cloud revenue of $15.15 billion, a 34% increase from the same period a year earlier. Azure revenue jumped 40%, while Amazon reported 20% growth for AWS. Google said it's signed more billion-dollar cloud deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the previous two years combined.

To meet soaring demand, Google upped the high end of its forecast for capital spending this year to $93 billion from $85 billion.

""We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions,"" CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call. ""It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that.""

In this article

DETROIT – Shares of CarMax Inc. fell more than 12% during morning trading Thursday after the used car retailer announced a weak preliminary outlook for its current fiscal quarter and said CEO Bill Nash would be unexpectedly stepping down.

The preliminary outlook for its third fiscal quarter includes an 8% to 12% decrease in comparable store used unit sales and net earnings per diluted share of between 18 cents and 36 cents, including 9 cents in non-recurring expenses related primarily to the leadership shakeup and other workforce reductions.

Regarding its CEO, the company said board member David McCreight, a retail clothing executive who has served as CEO of Lulu's Fashion Lounge Holdings and president of Urban Outfitters Inc., will replace Nash on an interim basis until a permanent replacement has been found.

CarMax also said Chair Tom Folliard, an executive with a 30-year history with the company, including as CEO from 2006 to 2016, has been appointed interim executive chair.

""The Board has decided that more direct involvement from David and me will help strengthen the business in this transitional period. During this time, we are focused on driving sales, enhancing profitability and reducing cost,"" Folliard said in a release, adding that the company's recent results ""do not reflect that potential and change is needed.""

The announced changes are effective Dec. 1, according to CarMax.

In connection to the announced changes and outlook, William Blair downgraded CarMax stock to market perform from outperform.

CarMax has struggled this year, with its stock price down roughly 50% in 2025. That compares with other car retailer stocks being up double digits, including a 52% increase this year for online used car retailer Carvana.

Nash on CarMax's most recent quarterly earnings call in September admitted that results that ""fell short"" of the company's expectations, as well as Wall Street's. The results included notable declines in nearly all key earnings including sales, net earnings and gross profit.

Those September results led to a significant decline in shares of the company and negative analyst reactions, including a $24 price cut by Morgan Stanley.

CarMax is scheduled to report its current fiscal quarter results on Dec. 18.

Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who made history as the first female speaker of the House of Representatives, said Thursday she will not seek reelection to Congress next year.

Pelosi, 85, has served in the House for nearly four decades, presiding over the passage of major legislation and serving as a leading opposition figure against President Donald Trump.

""There has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, 'I speak for the people of San Francisco,'"" Pelosi said in a video posted on social media.

""I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress,"" she said. ""That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know: I will not be seeking reelection to Congress.""

""With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,"" Pelosi said.

Pelosi became the most powerful woman in congressional history in 2002, when she was elected House minority leader by her fellow Democrats.

When the party took majority control of the chamber in 2007, Pelosi became the first — and so far only — woman to wield the speaker's gavel.

She held the title until Democrats lost their House majority in 2011. When the party won the chamber back in 2019, Pelosi served as House speaker for a second time.

After Republicans regained majority control of the House following the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi stepped aside as the Democrats' leader. But she remained in Congress, and was referred to as speaker emerita.

""Nancy Pelosi has inspired generations,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an X post later Thursday morning.

""Her courage and conviction to San Francisco, California, and our nation has set the standard for what public service should be. Her impact on this nation is unmatched,"" Newsom said.

Trump slammed Pelosi following her retirement announcement, calling it ""a great thing for America.""

""She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country,"" Trump told a Fox News reporter. She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I'm very honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician.""

Under Pelosi's leadership, the House passed seismic bills that created sweeping change across the country.

Perhaps most notably, she was instrumental to the passage in the House of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. The health care law, which has survived numerous attempts by Republicans to repeal it, is now at the center of an ongoing government shutdown.

During her second stint as speaker, Pelosi clashed openly with Trump — inside and outside the White House.

In a heated clash at a White House meeting in 2019 on the administration's withdrawal of troops from Syria, Pelosi stood up and raised a finger to Trump. The then-president released a photo of the moment, claiming Pelosi had an ""unhinged meltdown"" — but Pelosi embraced the image, displaying it atop her Twitter profile.

Pelosi also presided over the first impeachment of Trump in the House in December 2019. The charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemmed from accusations that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president to launch investigations into his political foes.

Trump was acquitted in the Senate.

Pelosi has remained a vocal Trump critic. In a recent CNN interview, she called Trump a ""vile creature"" and ""worst thing on the face of the Earth.""

Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in the House.

Cybersecurity startup 1Password, backed by Ryan Reynolds, Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson, has topped more than $400 million in annual recurring revenue, the company said Thursday.

""We believe we're at a pretty significant inflection point in our journey,"" CEO David Faugno told CNBC. ""We're set up for this next wave of disruption, which I think is an even bigger opportunity for us.""

Faugno said he expects the company to surpass a billion dollars in ARR over the next ""several years,"" benefiting from a shift in the threat landscape due to artificial intelligence and more complex protection needs.

In 2023, 1Password announced that it had surpassed $250 million in ARR.

AI innovation has accelerated demand for better cybersecurity tools to counteract sophisticated and complex cyberattacks. Big deals from Palo Alto Networks and Alphabet, and initial public offerings from Netskope and SailPoint have also put the sector in the spotlight.

Toronto-based 1Password was founded in 2005 and counts IBM, Perplexity AI, Salesforce and the Golden State Warriors among its customers, and it's also signed a multiyear deal with Formula 1 team Oracle Red Bull Racing. The company says it secures more than 1.3 billion human and machine credentials and works with 180,000 business customers.

Additionally, 1Password on Thursday announced it is bringing on former ChargePoint and Barracuda Networks executive Michael Hughes. Former Qualtrics and SAP executive John Torrey will join as chief business officer.

Faugno said both executives complement the company's strategy to lure larger enterprise customers.

Over the last year, 1Password has undergone a major C-suite shake-up.

Longtime leader Jeff Shiner, who ran 1Password for 13 years, transitioned into executive chair of the board in July. Faugno, who had been promoted to co-CEO a few months earlier, took over the role solely at that time. Faugno joined 1Password in 2023 as president and operating chief.

To date, 1Password has raised about $950 million and is valued at $6.8 billion, according to Pitchbook data. Other investors include actor Justin Timberlake, comedian Trevor Noah, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz and investment firm Iconiq, according to Pitchbook.

Faugno told CNBC that the company is weighing a possible IPO in 2026 or 2027, but isn't ""rushing out to go public."" He said 1Password remains focused on providing the best tools for its customers.

""We control our own destiny,"" he said. ""From a profitability perspective, we have investors that are playing the long game with us.""

In this article

Peloton is recalling its original Bike+ after receiving reports that the seat post broke and detached from the equipment during use, leading to two injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a news release Thursday. 

The recall impacts 833,000 units, touching every original Bike+ the company sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022. The bikes were sold between January 2020 and April 2025, but Peloton stopped manufacturing them in 2022. 

The recall comes after Peloton received two reports of injuries ""due to a fall"" after the post broke off, the CPSC said in its release. It received three reports in total about the issue.  

The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using the bikes and contact Peloton for free repair. The company is offering a free seat post that users can install at home, the agency said. 

In a statement Thursday, Peloton said, ""The integrity of our products and our Members' well-being are our top priorities."" The company encouraged users to request the new part ""as soon as possible.""

The notice Thursday marks the second time Peloton has had to recall one of its bike models due to issues with the seat post. 

In May 2023, the company recalled every base Bike model that it ever sold, totaling 2.2 million units, after receiving 35 reports of the seat post breaking and detaching during use. The issue led to 13 injuries, including a fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises.

At the time, the company said the recall led to higher-than-expected membership churn, as between 15,000 and 20,000 people paused their monthly subscriptions while waiting for the seat post to be replaced. Replacing the parts cost at least $40 million during its fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, the company said at the time. 

The recall Thursday, the fifth since Peloton's founding, comes as CEO Peter Stern looks to get the fitness company back to growth and move past the many issues it has faced since its founding. 

Changing consumer dynamics have plagued the company since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, but so have its recalls, including one for its Tread+ treadmill in 2021 after a child was killed. 

Just over a month ago, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, raised prices and unveiled new features ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. 

The current quarter is Peloton's biggest for hardware sales. 

The company is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings after the bell on Thursday.

Clarification: This story was updated to clarify that the recall affects every original Bike+ sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022.

In this article

Tesla is expected to announce on Thursday the results of a shareholder vote determining whether CEO Elon Musk should receive a pay package of nearly $1 trillion worth of stock over the next decade.

There's little mystery to the outcome.

The electric vehicle company has suggested that shareholders approve the plan. Between Musk's substantial ownership and a hefty base of retail investors who almost always vote with the CEO, the numbers are difficult for the opposition, even though top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against the package.

Results of the vote are expected to be shared after Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas.

Board Chair Robyn Denholm, and other Musk fans, have argued that the outsized pay plan would keep Musk at the helm of the company, and that he's critical to Tesla's future and its ability to compete in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Baron Capital's Ron Baron said in a lengthy post on X, Musk's social network, that he's supporting the Tesla CEO.

""Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk,"" Baron wrote. ""Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.""

But there are some vocal opponents. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said it would vote no. Norges is one of Tesla's top shareholders.

""While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk — consistent with our views on executive compensation,"" NBIM said in a statement this week.

Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases.

""Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,"" McRitchie said. ""There's a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.""

Tesla shares are up 14% this year after a steep third-quarter rally lifted the stock into the green following a brutal start to 2025. Musk's purchase of $1 billion worth of stock aided the rebound.

Tesla introduced the new pay plan in September. The package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2024.

""If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?"" Musk said to analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call last month. ""I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.""

The full award would give Musk, who holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

Musk would receive the first tranche of stock if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla's current market cap is $1.54 trillion.

The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla's value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package.

Other goals tied to the pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD subscriptions​, 1 million bots delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement.

The proposed plan doesn't specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as ""FSD Supervised"" in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don't require human supervision on board.

Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion.

As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals.

There are also a list of ""covered events"" in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones.

Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to ""international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction,"" that could hamper the company's ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line.

There are other benefits to Musk.

The pay plan doesn't require him to dedicate a minimum amount of time to Tesla, nor does it at all limit his involvement in politics.

In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company.

He's also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper last month estimating that Tesla sales from October 2022 through April of this year in the U.S. would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's ""polarizing and partisan actions.""

Shareholders are voting on the plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk's earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.

Nell Minow, a corporate governance expert and chair of ValueEdge Advisors, said she would vote against the new pay plan for Musk, describing him as a ""part-time CEO"" today.

""If they said we're going to pay him a trillion dollars, but he's going to give up all of his outside activities, he's going to shut up about politics, and really spend all this time making this a great company, then I'd say, OK, let's talk about it,"" Minow said. ""But he's not doing any of those things.""

Metropolis, which uses AI and computer vision to identify vehicles and take parking lot payments without any physical transaction, has raised $1.6 billion in combined debt and equity in a new fundraising round at a $5 billion valuation.

Already the largest parking lot network in the U.S., handling more than 7% of licensed drivers (nearly 20 million people) across over 4,000 locations, the Santa Monica, California-based company is planning to use the capital for a major expansion across the retail sector, including gas stations and quick-service restaurant drive-thru windows, as well as into hotels and office buildings.

""With this new capital, we're continuing to scale our platform and forge the foundation of the Recognition Economy, building a new paradigm for how AI is deployed in the real world,"" said Alex Israel, CEO and co-founder of Metropolis, in the deal announcement.

The $1.6 billion capitalization includes a $1.1 billion senior secured loan and $500 million in Series D equity funding, led by a fund managed by existing investor LionTree. Additional investors included Eldridge, SoftBank, DFJ, Tekne Capital, Vista and BDT & MSD Partners' affiliated credit funds. It's the largest round that the company has raised across its $2 billion in deals not specifically tied to an acquisition — Metropolis took parking lot operator SP Plus private in 2024, the largest private M&A deal of 2024. The company doubled the debt it was able to raise since its last credit market deal in 2024 in a new financing led by J.P. Morgan, which the company attributed to its expanding gross margins.

""Metropolis is demonstrating that AI can be thoughtfully commercialized at real-world scale,"" said Ramin Arani, head of investments at LionTree, in the deal announcement.

Metropolis ranked No. 13 on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

Any driver that has used a Metropolis parking lot knows that the payment can be conducted with no waiting, no tickets, machines, credit cards, or apps. The company's proprietary computer vision platform recognizes a ""vehicle fingerprint"" based on their unique characteristics. Users do have to first set up an account in the company's app or on its website with basic profile information including a license plate number, though its technology is not limited to license plate scanning.

The company says it has been growing by one million members per month and sees a total addressable market of at least 50 million individuals. Across its current operations, Metropolis is handling $5 billion in annual transactions.

""The physical world remains hopelessly analog,"" said Courtney Fukuda, chief integration officer and co-founder of Metropolis, at the recent CNBC AI Summit in Nashville. ""We started by fixing parking, partially because it's ubiquitous and because it's a nightmare,"" she added.

As the company expands into retail locations including fueling and drive-thrus, it will be focused on a software-as-a-service model, with retail and real estate owners benefitting from offering the technology to their consumers. ""We're not going to go and buy 1,000 McDonald's and suddenly franchise McDonald's with our computer vision technology,"" Fukuda said. ""We're going to be licensing our technology to those operators.""

While the parking lot experience is more limited to making the payment transaction frictionless, Metropolis is betting that as it moves deeper across retail and the physical world, its ability to gather and analyze data on individuals will lead to a level of personalization that consumers prefer and that increases revenue opportunities for businesses, ushering in a ""post-device world.""

""We know where people are actually moving in the real world, and we can start to put together essentially a member graph of their physical world footprint and insights,"" Fukuda said, data analysis that will be valuable to commercial real estate owners, and hotel companies. ""It gives them information about what used to be a black box and used to just be kind of cash collections,"" Fukuda added.

In this article

Charles Schwab on Thursday agreed to buy private shares platform Forge Global in a deal valued at $660 million as Wall Street firms seek to meet growing investor demand for access to high-growth startups.

Major financial institutions are expanding services that give clients access to private companies and liquidity in pre-IPO shares, seeking to tap rising investor demand for early exposure to fast-growing startups.

The per-share deal value of $45 represents a premium of roughly 72% over the stock's last closing price. Shares of Forge Global surged 65% in premarket trading on the news.

Some of the world's most valuable startups are choosing to stay private for longer, raising capital in private markets rather than pursuing initial public offerings.

Companies such as ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok-parent Bytedance now hold valuations that rival or exceed several major S&P 500 companies, narrowing the gap in influence between public and private markets.

Investors are seeking exposure to these fast-growing companies, and financial services firms are moving to cater to that demand.

Last month, Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley agreed to acquire private shares platform EquityZen, a rival to Forge Global.

Forge Global went public in 2021 through a blank-check deal with a special purpose acquisition company. Its stock has jumped 87% this year amid media reports that the company had put itself up for sale and received takeover proposals.

It operates a trading marketplace through which investors have bought and sold more than $17 billion in private company shares.

Charles Schwab offers wealth management, securities brokerage, banking and financial advisory services to customers. It has a market capitalization of roughly $170 billion and manages around $11.6 trillion in client assets.

The companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2026.

In this article

Datadog shares jumped 20% on Thursday after the software company reported third-quarter revenue that topped Wall Street estimates and issued a strong forecast for the fourth quarter.

The company reported revenue of $885.7 million, which was up 28% year over year, and topped the $852.8 million expected by LSEG analysts.

The cloud software company expects fourth quarter revenue to reach between $912 million and $916 million, far surpassing Wall Street's projections of $887 million.

As artificial intelligence-driven demand for cloud-security products has continued to increase, Datadog has been rolling out multiple AI technologies and security tools over the past year.

""The Datadog R&D team is innovating rapidly to help our customers solve problems in the AI space,"" CEO Olivier Pomel said in a release.

The company launched in June Bits AI Agents for SRE, an AI assistant that immediately investigates alerts and drafts incident responses and status updates. Datadog also added multiple new features to its LLM Observability over the summer, including agentic AI monitoring and expanded LLM experimentation.

In June, Datadog also released its MCP Server, which connects AI agents with data sources, and its foundation model TOTO.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at 55 cents, which beat FactSet analyst expectations of 45 cents.

The number of customers with at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue grew 16% for the quarter.

Datadog reported net income of 33.9 million, or 10 cents per share. Last year, the company had $51.7 million in net income, or 14 cents per share.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told the Financial Times on Wednesday that ""China is going to win the AI race,"" only to release a notably softer statement soon after. 

The prolific tech leader was speaking on the sidelines of the FT's Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the U.S. in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations.

The comments, which CNBC could not verify independently, would represent Huang's starkest warning yet that the U.S. is at risk of losing its global lead in advanced AI technologies. 

However, several hours after the FT published its report, Nvidia issued a separate statement from Jensen on an official X account. 

""As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,"" he added.

Huang has long stated that the U.S. can stay ahead in the AI race if it keeps developers reliant on Nvidia's leading AI chips — an argument the CEO has used to lobby against export restrictions on his company's sales to China. 

Following meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump in July, it seemed that Huang's efforts had paid off, with Washington agreeing to ease some of its chip curbs. 

Under the plan, Nvidia and competing AI chip company AMD had agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their Chinese revenues from sales of existing AI processors tailored for the market.

However, Beijing has since shut Nvidia out of the market as it conducts a national security review of its chips, with Huang stating that the firm's market share has been reduced to zero. 

It remains unclear whether China will allow any of Nvidia's chips to return, as officials push domestic tech companies towards its domestic AI chip alternatives. However, some experts have speculated that Beijing is using Nvidia's market access as leverage in trade negotiations or to push Washington for wider access to advanced semiconductors.

Huang was in South Korea last month, during Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Highly anticipated trade talks between the two leaders did not yield any concessions from either side on chip policy. 

According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump had initially sought to discuss a request by Huang to allow sales of a new generation of AI chips to China. However, top officials rallied against the idea, the Journal reported, citing anonymous current and former administration officials familiar with the matter.

Now that Nvidia's access to China remains frozen, it appears Huang is shifting his attention to other matters he considers essential to Nvidia's growth and the AI race. 

In the interview with the FT, Huang reportedly expressed concerns that the West, including the U.S, was being held back by ""cynicism"" and excessive regulation — contrasting that with China's energy subsidies aimed at lowering costs for local developers using domestic chips.

Oops, something went wrong

Robinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD) is actively looking at the Bitcoin (BTC) treasury plan, a company executive said during the earnings call on Nov. 5.

A Bitcoin treasury plan is a corporate strategy where a company holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, similar to how most companies hold traditional assets like cash.

Robinhood launched as a commission-free stock and ETF trading brokerage app in 2015 and introduced crypto and options trading in 2018. A favorite among the younger, mobile-native demography, Robinhood went public in 2021.

It didn't take long for the trading firm to secure an inclusion in the S&P 500 index, hitting the milestone in 2025.

Robinhood has an extraordinary track record of beating analyst expectations when it comes to earnings and revenue. When it came to the firm's third-quarter results, it was no different.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.61, against the estimated $0.53, and

Record revenue of $1.274 billion, against the estimated $1.21 billion.

unveiled an ambitious revenue generation plan for the next 10 years during the earnings call on Nov. 5.

During the earnings call yesterday, Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev said the company is eyeing over 50% of its revenue from non-U.S. markets and institutional segments within a decade.

""So ten years from now, the aim is to have over half of our revenue be outside the US, and also cut another way, right now we're majority retail. We think we can get to over half being non-retail, institutional.""

Though Tenev admitted these are ""tough goals,"" he said it's an opportunity.

""And we're going after it.""

Robinhood is growing ""nicely"" in the UK and EU, and the plan is to build the number one global financial ecosystem, he added.

Tenev said prediction markets “are really on fire” as customers “really love the product, and we're bringing them even more.”

Prediction markets are platforms where traders bet on the outcome of real-world events. Robinhood lists more than 1,000 live contracts across sports, economics, politics, etc.

Robinhood also announced the appointment of Shiv Verma as the company's new CFO who will replace Jason Warnick.

Verma is an old-timer at Robinhood, having spent seven years at the firm. He said the company's goal is to grow EPS and compound long-term shareholder value.

""Plain and simple.""

During the earnings call, an audience member asked about adopting Bitcoin or other digital assets as part of the company's corporate treasury strategy. Verma said the company always thinks about whether a decision would be right for shareholders.

Though adding BTC to the balance sheet has its positives, the strategy takes up capital, he added.

""And I think the short answer is we're still thinking about it. There's pros and cons to both of it. And it's one that we're gonna keep actively looking at."" 

Despite recording blockbuster earnings, the company's stock is lying in the red zone in pre-market hours. HOOD, which closed at $142.48 yesterday, was exchanging hands at $141.30 before market opening today.

Reports have disclosed that crypto entrepreneur and Tron founder Justin Sun moved a sizable amount of Ethereum into a liquid-staking service this week.

According to on-chain data, about 45,000 ETH — worth roughly $154.5 million at the time — was shifted from the lending protocol Aave into the Lido Finance staking pool.

The transfer was public and traceable on the blockchain. It drew quick attention because of its scale and timing.

Sun's Public Wallets Grow

The funds had been sitting on Aave before the move. They were then deposited into Lido, which issues staked-ETH tokens that let holders keep a form of liquidity while their ETH is staked.

Based on reports, Sun's public wallets now show around $534 million in ETH holdings. That figure has reportedly surpassed his holdings in TRON's native token, TRX, which are estimated near $519 million.

Market watchers say the swap signals a shift in how some big holders are allocating capital.

JUSTIN SUN JUST STAKED OVER $150M OF ETH [ARKHAM INSIGHTS]

Justin Sun just withdrew $154.5M of ETH (45,000 ETH) from AAVE and deposited it to Lido Staking. He currently holds $534M of ETH in his public wallets, even more than he holds in TRX ($519M).

Bigger Stakes, Bigger Questions

Analysts reacted fast. Some see the action as a vote of confidence in ETH's yield options and protocol security. Others raised the point that large sums routed into single liquid-staking providers can add to centralization risks on the network.

Price remains unpredictable. Also, staking carries its own risks — smart contract bugs, validator downtime, and slashing events are possibilities that investors must weigh.

 Market Context And Price Action 

Based on reports, ETH was trading near $3,389 when this movement was noted. The token had slipped about 12% in the previous week, which makes big staking flows more visible because large buys or internal transfers stand out against falling prices.

In the broader crypto landscape, institutional and whale moves into staking have been increasing over the past months.

Lido remains one of the largest liquid-staking providers, and its market share is watched closely by both traders and protocol researchers. Signals Versus Motive 

Actions by the Tron boss Sun could be long-term, aimed at yield, or at a broader portfolio shuffle.

There is something notable in the transfer, but it is only a piece to a bigger picture— including holdings, trading, and trends beyond the broader indirect markets.

When crypto meets the courtroom, everyone speaks in food metaphors — and nobody leaves full

“In the courtroom, the facts are often less important than how the story is told.”

— Alan Dershowitz

Any moment now, 12 jurors in the Southern District of New York will tell us whether blockchain code is law in America.

Anton and James Peraire-Bueno were arrested in May of last year on accusations of “stealing” $25 million in ETH by exploiting Ethereum's intricate system of building blocks.

Closing arguments in their trial ended yesterday. 

Southern District prosecutors told the court the Peraire-Bueno brothers used “tricks and deception” to execute a “bait and switch” exploit that lured a group of lovable, unsuspecting MEV sandwich bots into being sandwiched themselves.

The defense says the brothers were simply playing by Ethereum's rules: “This is like stealing a base in baseball,” they told the jury.

Technically, the jury will return a verdict on charges of wire fraud and money laundering. But both sides have framed the case as a judgment on whether code is law in the world of decentralized blockchains. 

Coin Center persuasively argues that it should be: “Validators compete under a mathematically explicit and self-executing rule set,” it wrote in an amicus brief. “Those rules alone define both the boundaries of permissible conduct and the penalties for deviation.”

The prosecution fundamentally disagrees: “Just because something is possible doesn't make it legal,” they told the court.

Both sides did their best to translate the arcane art of Ethereum block-building into something a jury could follow well enough to pass judgment on the defendants' actions.

The defense thinks that's to their advantage: “If you understand how Ethereum works,” they told the jury, “Anton and James are innocent.”

But anyone who's read Presumed Innocent or watched 12 Angry Men will know that nothing as complicated as Ethereum should be decided by a jury of normal people.

As recorded by Inner City Press, defense attorney Katherine Trefz tried to make Ethereum block-building relatable to jurors with a cooking analogy:

That's a pretty good start, for sure, and probably good tactics.

As a defendant, I'm not sure I'd want my actions judged with food analogies, but what's the alternative?

In a case this bewilderingly technical, the best that lawyers can probably do is tell a story.  

An expert witness asked to explain MEV arbitrage also resorted to analogy, again with food:

Next time you trade on Ethereum, remember: You're the salami.

Cleverly, the prosecution tried to make the food analogies less appetizing:

“Salmonella” is a kind of “poisoned” crypto token used to trap sandwich bots on Ethereum, so a mini-trial might have helped the jury understand the larger trap the defendants had set.

Some highly technical things were explained; some pretty obvious things were not:

Anyone who needs a definition of “bot” would presumably need one for “atomic arbitrage,” too; but the defense quickly moved on.

Judge Jessica Clarke seemed similarly eager to move on from technical details:

There were a lot of breaks — way more than in the movies.

More importantly, there was much technical substance in between. 

The prosecution seemed to recognize that in their closing argument, which resorted once again to analogy: “If you go overweight with your bag on Jet Blue, you pay a penalty, you don't go to jail. That's not the way rules work in our world.”

I don't know what that means — is Jet Blue Ethereum? Are the defendants passengers? Who's flying the plane? Block-builders?

Hopefully someone on the jury puzzled it out, because there's a lot riding on the outcome of The United States of America v. Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno — for crypto as well as for the defendants.

For crypto, a guilty verdict would make it look like Ethereum's code is so unable to keep things orderly that it needs the US courts to come in and police what happens on its network.

Or, since we're doing analogies: like a kid on a playground who needs his big brother to keep him safe from bullies. 

In this case, literally Big Brother: The plaintiff here is not the MEV sandwicher who got sandwiched, but the United States of America.

More importantly, a guilty verdict would likely mean many years in prison for the two defendants.

“This is a hugely consequential decision in the lives of two young men,” the defense concluded. “Not guilty. Thank you.”

Bitcoin miners are entering a structural transformation as power replaces hashrate as the key driver of value. Following the latest halving and record network difficulty, margins have compressed sharply, accelerating a pivot towards high-performance computing (HPC). Miners controlling cheap, scalable, grid-connected megawatts are evolving into critical infrastructure providers. This shift is redefining valuations, from legacy EV/Hashrate multiples to EV/MW and HPC cash-flow potential. Leaders such as IREN, Core Scientific, TeraWulf, and Cipher are capitalizing through colocation and cloud contracts, positioning the sector at the intersection of AI infrastructure

Bitcoin's shaky October extended into the first week of November, as the broader outlook for crypto appears to be souring. On Tuesday, Bitcoin's price dipped about 21% since its all-time high last month to roughly $99,000, while other cryptocurrencies fell even more sharply. And while Bitcoin has since clawed back over the key psychological $100,000 mark, some think the crypto sector's remarkable run may be over for the time being.

The declines for Bitcoin and for other cryptocurrencies have been especially sharp over the past week. As of Thursday, Bitcoin slightly recovered to just under $103,000 but is still down roughly 5% in the last week. Ethereum is down roughly 12% to just under $3,372, and Solana is down about 19% to just under $158 during that time. 





Ethereum and Solana—the most prominent non-Bitcoin currencies known as alt-coins—hit record prices earlier in the year but have come down significantly. The former has plummeted roughly 30% since August, while the latter is down about 41% since January.





Bitcoin boosters like to tout the asset as an independent gold-like store of value but, as it has in the past, the price has softened along with the rest of the economy. In the last week, the crypto market's stumble has coincided with uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's direction, and a decline in the S&P 500. 





Meanwhile, the crypto market is still recovering from a flash crash on October 10 where traders experienced the worst crypto liquidation event in history, according to the analytics company CoinGlass. That day, exchanges liquidated more than $19 billion in leveraged positions. The flash crash followed Trump's Truth Social post in which he said the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China, “over and above” any tariff they were already paying.




“The current weakness reflects a mix of [an ongoing effort by markets to digest] 10/10, slightly more hawkish Fed tone, and a broader risk-off across assets,” said Jasper De Maere, an OTC Trader at Wintermute. 





Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also affected crypto markets. At the end of last month, he hinted that the October rate cut could be the last one of the year. He said his colleagues had “strongly differing views” about future rate cuts and that, “there's a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle.” In the 24 hours following those comments, Bitcoin and Ethereum dipped about 1.6% and 2%, respectively. 





On Tuesday, when Bitcoin slipped under $100k, many on social media were quick to voice their concern.

Some analysts also believe that crypto might be struggling for a while, “[Many long-term holders] who adhere to the four-year cycle theory…are selling positions, convinced that we are at or near the cycle top,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. 





Then there's those in the crypto world who view Bitcoin dropping as just a reason to buy more of it.

Fact checked

By Sam Cooling

As Bitcoin continues its struggle to stay above $ 100,000, the altcoin market has seemingly found a temporary bottom, with the likes of 1INCH, TEL, and XPL providing respite to the broader market. With positive sentiment slowly returning to the space, many are wondering what the next crypto to explode will be.

XPL is a strong contender, as the Tether-backed stablecoin Layer-1 project seemingly found its bottom at around $0.22 and has since bounced to $0.265. However, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) could be set to rival XPL as a Bitcoin Layer-2 protocol that has now raised over $26M in its presale thus far.



(SOURCE: CoinGecko)

1INCH is up +20% today, currently trading for around $0.18 as Ethereum's forgotten DEX steps back into the spotlight. Even going multi-chain and opening its services up to Solana earlier this year couldn't stem the bearish price action, which now sees the token down -97% from its all-time high of $8.65 reached in October 2021.

However, today's pump is a good start for a token that has seemingly fallen by the wayside in recent years. It is now stabilizing near $0.1783 after a lengthy decline. The weekly chart hints at a potential bottoming. A break above $0.2500 could trigger a rally to $0.80.

Psychological resistance at $1 remains key for 1INCH. Watching for increasing volume and a daily close above $0.20 would confirm a bullish reversal. Failure to hold current levels risks a drop toward $0.12.



(SOURCE: TradingView)

Another altcoin displaying bullish tendencies is Telcoin (TEL). While down 1% today, TEL surged 12% yesterday and is currently trading at around $0.0033 with a market cap of $316M.

TEL launched back in 2017 and has long been plagued by aggressive token emissions, which have suppressed the price throughout the years. The recent bullish outlook on Telcoin primarily stems from the token now being fully in circulation, with 96 billion of its 100 billion supply now unlocked.

Another aspect contributing to the renewed positive sentiment for Telcoin is the firm's recent securing of $25M in funding for its regulated digital banking initiative, which aims to operate under US regulations.

From a technical analysis perspective, TEL has seemingly bounced from a critical support level at $0.00328 and is 25% up from yesterday's lows, outperforming most of the market over the past few days. Even with its recent resurgence, Telcoin is unlikely to be considered the next crypto to explode anytime soon.

DISCOVER: The 12+ Hottest Crypto Presales to Buy Right Now 

Plasma, a Layer-1 blockchain backed by USDT issuer Tether, aimed to be the ‘stablecoin blockchain', has enjoyed a rare few consecutive green days after weeks of bearish price action since the launch of XPL in September 2025.

TVL (Total Value Locked) for Plasma continues to soar on the network, and although DefiLlama data shows it being -14% down today, it has quickly cemented itself as a top 10 blockchain by TVL, currently sitting at 8, with $2.93Bn.



(SOURCE: DefiLlama)

The platform also shows that the number of active addresses jumped by +327% in the last 30 days to over 1.79 million. Its fees jumped by over 84% to $88,000 during this period. This growth makes it one of the fastest-growing players in the crypto industry.

XPL has broken above the October 10 low and is now forming a clear bullish divergence on the RSI. It has shown its first meaningful impulse off the lows, breaking through the 4H OB cluster, clearing the downtrend, and shifting short-term structure.

This is the first sign of strength after a prolonged period of bleeding. With that breakout confirmed, price has reclaimed structure and left the breaker zone behind. Now we wait for the retest.

Price has now returned to the 4H breaker zone, meaning XPL is now at a make-or-break level. If buyers step in to defend it, that confirms the shift in momentum and opens room for a swing continuation. If the retest fails, the breakout becomes a deviation, and a long setup becomes invalidated.

If this setup stays intact, XPL is well-positioned to be the next crypto to explode, but if it rejects, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) will quickly take that mantle from Plasma.



(SOURCE: TradingView)

Bitcoin Hyper isn't just another Layer-2 launch; it's the first system to deliver Solana-class performance while remaining secured directly by Bitcoin's base layer.

Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper supports parallel execution, enabling the processing of thousands of transactions per second without compromising the integrity that has established Bitcoin as the world's most robust settlement layer.

This is where Bitcoin Hyper outperforms Base, Blast, and all EVM Layer 2 solutions. While those platforms scale Ethereum, Bitcoin Hyper is designed to scale Bitcoin.

Users can lock their BTC into the network's canonical bridge to mint a wrapped version that can be used across high-speed decentralized applications (dApps). This wrapped Bitcoin remains fully backed 1:1, is completely transparent, and can be redeemed at any time.

Publishing date

Seven leading blockchain infrastructure providers–Fireblocks, Polygon Labs, Mysten Labs, the Monad Foundation, the Solana Foundation, the Stellar Development Foundation and the TON Foundation– announced the formation of the Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC), an initiative to enable frictionless, compliant transactions across networks and borders.

Global onchain payment volume exceeded $15 trillion in 2024 and stablecoins now settle more value than Visa and Mastercard combined. Despite this, blockchain payments remain fragmented, with each network operating under different technical and compliance standards. The Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC) brings together leading infrastructure providers to enable frictionless, compliant transactions across networks and borders, laying the foundation for a unified global payments system, for businesses and consumers alike.

Stellar has facilitated billions in payments, proving blockchain's ability to move value efficiently at scale. But true global adoption requires more than just speed and low costs—it demands trust, interoperability, and clear standards. The Blockchain Payments Consortium represents a critical step forward in maturing our industry. We've always believed that financial infrastructure should be open and accessible to all, and BPC's mission to establish common frameworks across networks aligns perfectly with that vision."" 

Raja Chakravorti, Chief Business Officer, Stellar Development Foundation

Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC) is a new industry consortium uniting leading blockchain networks. Our mission is to define safe, common standards that can shape better payment experiences for everyone.

Blockchain rails are reshaping the global payments landscape. But for blockchain payments to reach full potential, we must address the inconsistent and fragmented experiences individuals and institutions face when moving between traditional payments and blockchain.

BPC will define a common framework that enhances blockchain transactions with data requirements of traditional payments. This will enable financial institutions, enterprises, and other organizations to build systems that work seamlessly across networks and borders.

We will act as a bridge between blockchain ecosystems, regulators, and traditional financial institutions — offering a consistent, interoperable framework to enhance compliance across jurisdictions.

Together, we can lay the foundation for blockchain payments to operate on a global scale: fast, trusted, and truly interoperable.

                            Ryne Saxe on Stablecoins                        

In an exclusive interview with CCN, Ryne Saxe, CEO of Eco, discussed how stablecoins are reshaping the flow of money on a global scale. 

Saxe explained why the rise of blockchain-based dollars has reached a turning point, how traditional finance helped drive their legitimacy, and why interoperability across blockchains remains one of the industry's biggest challenges.

He also reflected on the deeper meaning of this technological shift, describing stablecoins as the foundation of a new digital economy powered by transparency, liquidity, and borderless movement of value. 

For Saxe, the future of digital finance is not just technical, it's philosophical. And his boldest statement is:

 “Money is a choice.”

See the full interview here:

Saxe says the turning point for stablecoins came “pretty clearly over the last 12 to 18 months,” when traditional finance began to endorse blockchain-based dollars as legitimate digital instruments.

“Initially, it was like an organized lobby by payment companies, financial institutions, increasingly important crypto companies,” he explains. 

“They started to advocate not only for regulatory tolerance, but regulatory endorsement of this technology as literally just a better dollar.”

He adds that adoption accelerated when major firms such as Stripe and Visa began building around stablecoin infrastructure. 

“It's just a dollar that moves more freely, devoid of banks and borders,” he says. “And there's huge demand for that.”

Despite strong growth, liquidity fragmentation across blockchains continues to slow stablecoin scalability. “We have really good interoperability tech that's come along quite a bit over the last couple of years,” Saxe says. 

“But new chains, new stablecoins, new protocols are spreading faster than the interoperability tech connected to it.”

He explains that the issue is not conceptual but structural: 

“As this market explodes, the extensibility of current interoperability tech to pass data and move liquidity across all of those in-demand routes is lagging. That's okay. We just need to grow up and scale into this use case.”

Saxe believes the missing piece is a shared incentive layer among major blockchain networks and stablecoin issuers. 

Drawing an analogy to Visa's early history, he says,  Visa got a hundred banks, who were otherwise competitors, to subscribe to the same payment network. 

He envisions a similar mechanism for blockchains and decentralized finance protocols: 

“What's missing is effectively an incentivized liquidity layer that they all subscribe to in trust that if they're easing money movement kind of across that network, they're growing the pie for everybody involved by improving user experience and user trust.”

Asked how Eco stands out, Saxe highlights two factors: positioning and performance.

“We are full-stack, opinionated for the stablecoin use case,” he explains. 

“Most people that we are maybe competitive against, it's usually kind of like an adjacency right now, are generalized protocols or generalized platforms, whereas we only care about moving stablecoins, which today is just moving digital dollars.”

He adds that Eco's system is optimized “from the user tap all the way down to the liquidity orders on the protocol,” allowing transfers “at size across blockchains in one tap in two seconds.”

Saxe describes the stablecoin economy as the foundation of today's tokenized financial system. “A stablecoin is the numeraire or the common denominator between the various tokenized use cases,” he says. 

“It's the only asset that's going to get you anywhere on chain.”

He predicts that on-chain dollar movement will one day “dwarf the U.S. economy” because it is “unbounded by banks or borders.” 

Stablecoins, he adds, form “the critical infrastructure of the plumbing to the tokenized use cases that are going to develop down the road.”

When asked how to prevent a few issuers or liquidity hubs from concentrating power, Saxe compares the future landscape to the long-running dynamic between centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEX).

“You can imagine a closed-loop provider, a SaaS business building API, or a more decentralized alternative, a protocol aggregating liquidity in a permissionless and transparent way,” he says. 

“I would give the advantage to the open protocol because it can distribute and grow much more quickly.”

For stablecoins to scale globally, he insists, “it calls for a protocol, not a company.”

The race to aggregate liquidity, Saxe admits, it feels a little bit zero-sum right now. He sees an emerging “standards war” among issuers and protocols but believes collaboration will eventually win.

Reflecting on the hardest trade-offs in building a universal liquidity layer, Saxe calls them “philosophical.”

He explains that you could choose to build an API layer as a SaaS business, or you could build an open protocol that incentivizes idle liquidity to supply capacity and ensure performance. The difference, he says, lies in values. 

“It's about where value should flow”, toward a singular company or a network of participants.

That decision, he adds, is “a values-driven philosophical trade-off” tied directly to how freely money should move on-chain.

Looking at the next five years, Saxe sees both promise and tension in the spread of digital dollars. 

“Right now, 99 % of stablecoin demand is demand for digital U.S. dollars,” he notes. “If it scales too quickly, smaller economies might find 50 % of their currency flow in dollars, not local currency.”

He predicts that this could lead to new “capital controls versus stablecoins,” forcing governments to decide how much on-chain money they can tolerate.

Still, Saxe remains optimistic. “Crypto is going to demonstrate to billions of people that money is a choice,” he says. 

“If enough people make the same choices about what money should be, then a new meme for money is created, and money evolves in that way. That's either incredibly equalizing and like optimistic for the world, or it's very destabilizing past a certain point.”

Vancouver, BC November 5th 2025

In a bold move to reinvigorate the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Strategic Crypto Reserve (SCR) has officially launched its platform at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca, aiming to restore meaning and value to digital whimsical artwork. Founded by a prominent large family from British Columbia, the initiative seeks to address what its creators see as a stagnation in the NFT space, introducing fresh perspectives and community-focused innovation to an asset class poised for resurgence.

The origins of the Strategic Crypto Reserve trace back to a multi-generational family based in Vancouver with deep roots in technology, art, and entrepreneurship. Led by the family patriarch, a former warehouseman turned venture capitalist, and supported by extended relatives—including artists, developers, and financial experts—the group identified a gap in the NFT ecosystem during the market downturn of 2022-2023. “We saw the NFT boom of 2021 as a revolutionary moment where digital art gained real-world value, but it quickly became oversaturated with speculative projects lacking substance,” the patriarch said in an exclusive interview. “Our family believed it was time for new players to step in, ones that prioritize creativity, whimsy, and long-term cultural significance over hype.

“The family, which numbers over 20 active members across three generations, drew inspiration from their own experiences in collecting traditional art and memorabilia. Growing up in British Columbia's vibrant creative scene, influenced by the province's natural beauty and indigenous artistic traditions, they envisioned NFTs not just as investments but as digital heirlooms. “Whimsical artwork—think playful illustrations, surreal animations, and imaginative designs—has always brought joy to our family gatherings,” explained the patriarch's daughter, the platform's chief creative officer. “But in the NFT world, that whimsy got lost amid rug pulls and celebrity endorsements. We wanted to bring it back, making digital art meaningful again by tying it to real stories and communities.” Among the key family members driving the vision is Dark Underlord, a tech-savvy relative known for innovative blockchain ideas, who contributed to the platform's core architecture.

Launched after two years of development, the Strategic Crypto Reserve platform offers a curated marketplace for NFTs that emphasize originality and narrative depth. Users can mint, trade, and collect pieces from emerging artists, with a focus on themes like fantasy worlds, environmental whimsy, and cultural folklore. Unlike many platforms, SCR incorporates blockchain technology to ensure provenance and scarcity, while integrating features like virtual galleries and augmented reality previews. The site, accessible at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca, also includes educational resources for newcomers, demystifying NFTs and highlighting their potential as stable digital assets.

At the heart of SCR's mission is the conviction that NFTs represent the next great asset class for investors. As traditional markets face volatility from inflation, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty, digital assets like NFTs offer diversification with unique advantages. “NFTs aren't just JPEGs; they're verifiable ownership of intellectual property in a borderless economy,” noted a financial analyst from the University of British Columbia, who consulted on the project after working the sociological ramifications of returning emails. “With blockchain ensuring transparency and immutability, holding NFTs can provide a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, much like gold or real estate in previous eras.

“Experts point to several factors positioning NFTs for growth. First, the maturation of Web3 infrastructure has reduced barriers to entry, with lower gas fees on networks like Ethereum and Polygon making transactions more affordable. Second, institutional adoption is rising: Major corporations, from sportswear giants to coffee chains, have integrated NFTs into loyalty programs, signaling mainstream acceptance. Third, the scarcity model inherent in NFTs—limited editions backed by smart contracts—creates intrinsic value, especially for collectibles with cultural resonance.

Investing in NFTs through platforms like SCR could yield substantial returns, proponents argue hesitant in buying SCR tokens. Historical data shows that blue-chip NFT collections have appreciated significantly over time, outperforming some stock indices during bull markets. For instance, a 2024 report by a leading consulting firm estimated the global NFT market could reach $35 billion by 2027, driven by metaverse integration and digital ownership rights. “The key is selectivity,” advised the patriarch. “By focusing on whimsical, story-driven art, we're creating assets that hold emotional and financial value. Imagine passing down a digital family portrait that's also an appreciating investment.

“SCR's family-centric approach sets it apart. The relatives have committed personal funds to seed the platform, ensuring artist royalties of up to 3% on secondary sales—a higher rate than industry averages. They've also support BC-based charities, pledging a portion of proceeds to political causes, aligning with the province's sustainability ethos. Early adopters praise the platform's user-friendly interface and emphasis on community events, such as virtual art auctions and creator meetups.

Challenges remain in the NFT space, including regulatory scrutiny and environmental concerns over blockchain energy use. However, SCR addresses these by utilizing proof-of-stake protocols and advocating for clearer guidelines from bodies like Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. “We're not just building a marketplace; we're fostering a movement,” the patriarch emphasized. “For families like ours, this is about legacy—digital art that endures.

“As the crypto winter thaws, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 in recent months, the timing for SCR's launch appears fortuitous. Investors eyeing the next wave of digital innovation may find NFTs, particularly those with whimsical appeal, as compelling holdings. “In an increasingly virtual world, owning a piece of digital culture is akin to holding shares in the future of creativity,” the analyst added.

The Strategic Crypto Reserve invites artists, collectors, and investors to explore its offerings at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca. With its family-founded roots and forward-looking vision, SCR positions itself as a beacon for meaningful NFT revival.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Why UK businesses are paying ICO millions for password mistakes you're probably making right now","https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/06/why_uk_businesses_paying/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Partner Content UK GDPR Article 32 mandates ""appropriate security measures"". The ICO has defined what that means: multi-million-pound fines for password failures. The violations that trigger them? Small, familiar, and happening in your organization right now.

Your sysadmin shares SSH keys via WhatsApp in ""defnotsshkeys.txt"". Your HR manager stores employee ID scans in Gmail. Your intern has admin access because it was easier than configuring permissions. And your former contractor from 2017 still receives reports with client data because his email was never removed from the distribution list.

These scenarios range from the simplest to more complex, like misconfigured cloud storage with cascading access rights across departments. But they share a common outcome: this is exactly how cybersecurity breaches happen.

And when they do, ICO responds with fines that can cripple businesses. Capita plc just learned this expensive lesson — unsecured AWS buckets and extractable passwords cost them £14 million.

The pattern continues across industries: Advanced Computer Software received a £3.07 million fine for incomplete MFA coverage. 23andMe paid £2.31 million after credential stuffing attacks exploited password reuse. Even small firms like DPP Law Ltd faced a £60,000 penalty when a brute-force attack breached an admin account that lacked MFA protection.

The statutory maximum? Four percent of worldwide annual revenue. For a mid-sized UK business with £10 million turnover, that's a potential £400,000 fine. For larger operations, the exposure scales into millions.

Recent ICO enforcement actions under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 show a pattern: password failures cost UK businesses millions. Poor credential management, missing MFA, delayed breach notifications — the same fundamental errors appear across companies of vastly different scales, and the ICO is holding all of them accountable.

From FTSE 100 outsourcing giants to small law firms, the penalties tell the same story:


Capita plc (£14 million)


The outsourcing behemoth's breach in March 2023 exposed the cascading failure mode of poor password security at scale. Attackers exploited an unsecured AWS S3 bucket to gain initial access, then used privilege escalation to move laterally across systems.

They extracted unencrypted passwords directly from server memory. The ICO's message was clear: if you're handling data at this scale, there's no excuse for basic authentication failures.


Advanced computer software (£3.07 million)


Advanced had implemented multi-factor authentication across much of its infrastructure. But much isn't all. Attackers found a single customer account without MFA protection and used it as an entry point for a LockBit ransomware attack that disrupted NHS services.

£3 million fine. The ICO's John Edwards was blunt: ""I urge all organisations to ensure that every external connection is secured with MFA today… there is no excuse for leaving any part of your system vulnerable.""


23andme (£2.31 million)


Threat actors launched a credential stuffing attack, using passwords leaked from other breaches to access 23andMe accounts. They compromised 6.9 million user profiles. The ICO's verdict? ""23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond.""


Interserve group (£4.4 million)


Interserve, a major support services and construction firm, suffered a phishing attack that compromised employee credentials. Once inside, attackers accessed systems containing personal data for thousands of employees and service users.

The breach revealed a critical vulnerability: without centralized credential management, a single compromised password can provide attackers with unrestricted access to the entire infrastructure.

Don't assume the ICO only goes after big targets. This small law firm learned that lesson when a brute-force attack compromised an administrator account that had no MFA protection. The attackers accessed sensitive legal client data.

The fine was proportionate to their size, but the reputational damage and legal implications were devastating. The message? UK GDPR applies equally to a five-person law firm and a major corporate player.

Credentials are scattered across business infrastructure in ways that would horrify any IT-security officer:

Only 23% of UK businesses have a formal incident response plan. Most organizations have no systematic approach to credential management: no visibility into who has access to what, no process for generating strong passwords, no method for secure sharing, and no way to revoke access when employees leave.

Reminders don't change password behavior. Human memory has limits. Human behavior follows patterns. You need a system that works with human nature, not against it.

The UK Government's Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 shows the scale of the problem: 43% of businesses suffered a breach in the last year, rising to 74% for large organizations. Phishing attacks were identified by 85% of breached businesses.

Despite 73% of businesses having password policies, adoption of advanced controls remains dismal: just 31% use VPNs for remote access, 30% have user monitoring, and only 29% conduct cyber security risk assessments. A mere 19% provide staff training on cyber security.

Most organizations lack systematic credential management – no visibility into access, no secure sharing process, and inadequate offboarding procedures. Password policies exist on paper, but enforcement and monitoring remain the exception.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) official guidance on password security has abandoned complexity theater for something that actually works: three random words. ""CoffeeTrainFish"" is both memorable and secure — far better than ""P@ssw0rd123!"" which appears in every breach database.

But strong passwords alone aren't enough. The regulatory message is unambiguous: without MFA on every external connection, you're violating Article 32 of UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, which mandate ""appropriate technical and organisational measures.""

With the ICO wielding fines up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover, ""appropriate"" has suddenly become very well-defined.

Enforcing strong, unique passwords across 50, 500, or 5,000 people without a centralized system? You can't. Or rather, you can try, but you'll fail in predictable ways. Users will write passwords in notebooks or simply reuse them, because remembering 47 different ""three random words"" combinations is cognitively impossible.

Your security policy will be perfect on paper and worthless in practice. This is where enterprise password management becomes non-negotiable under UK GDPR requirements. But here's the problem the vendors don't advertise: most enterprise password managers are awful to actually use.

They're technically robust. They tick all the compliance boxes. But they require three-day training sessions, have interfaces designed by people who've never watched a normal human try to log into something under time pressure, and come with support teams that respond in 48-72 hours with links to documentation.

So IT departments deploy them, users hate them, and within six months everyone's back to saving passwords in Chrome and sharing credentials via WhatsApp.

The problem isn't that organizations lack password management tools — it's that nobody uses them. Complex deployment. Unintuitive interfaces. So people revert to old unsecure ways.

Effective credential management requires quick implementation and intuitive design for end users, supported by advanced capabilities for technical teams. IT, DevOps, and sysadmins need secret storage, API integration, and automation. Regular employees need something that works without a manual.

Passwork was designed around this balance. Its features address the specific failures from those ICO cases: role-based access controls prevent the lateral movement that burned Capita, policy enforcement ensures passwords meet NCSC standards, and comprehensive audit logs provide evidence of compliance when the ICO comes asking questions.

But the real differentiator is this: Passwork has a high adoption rate because users don't hate it. That matters more than any technical specification, because security that people actively avoid using isn't security at all.

Implementation speed matters. Interface simplicity matters. Features depth matters. Support quality matters. (Read The Register's review to see how these factors play out in practice).

The ICO has made its position crystal clear: basic password security failures are no longer forgivable. The fines are real, they're large, and they're accelerating.

You can't fix this with a strongly worded email about password hygiene. You can't fix it by telling people to be more careful. The statistics show that individual users, left to their own devices, will reuse passwords and choose weak passwords.

What you can do is implement systems like Passwork that make secure behavior the default. Centralized password management, role-based access controls, and audit trails aren't nice-to-haves anymore. They're the minimum standard the regulator expects.

After Capita, Advanced, and 23andMe, you need to ask whether your business can absorb the financial and reputational damage of a preventable breach.

Africa's largest currency union will pilot a retail central bank digital currency in early 2026, pressing on with a centralised strategy even as momentum shifts increasingly in favour of stablecoins as an alternative. 

“We are at the proof of concept [stage] now, and after that we will move to the pilot stage,” Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, governor of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), told The Banker, with the pilot due to begin in the new year.

Oops, something went wrong

Digital currencies have long carried both promise and controversy, hailed as a breakthrough for financial independence yet criticized for their heavy toll on the planet. Now, a project is looking to change how cryptocurrency operates in a world increasingly defined by climate awareness.

As detailed by the International Business Times, entrepreneur John Ortmann and his team introduced bitcoin.ℏ in 2024 as a sustainable alternative designed for the next generation of eco-conscious investors. Built on the Hedera Hashgraph network instead of a traditional blockchain, bitcoin.ℏ processes transactions quickly without the massive energy demands that have defined early cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Traditional crypto mining, which relies on a proof of work consensus mechanism, consumes enormous amounts of energy. One of the most resource-intensive cryptocurrencies used 154.9 billion kilowatt-hours in 2013 alone, more than the annual energy use of 167 countries combined. This environmental strain has driven innovators to explore cleaner approaches to digital finance.

Ortmann's team designed bitcoin.ℏ with this goal in mind. ""We want to give people an opportunity for growth that does not destroy the planet in the process,"" Ortmann told the Times.

Hedera's governance system is decentralized like that of other cryptocurrencies, but it is not anonymous. Instead, it is overseen by institutions around the world, which provides added credibility and transparency. Its hashgraph consensus algorithm allows thousands of transactions per second while maintaining security through a ""gossip about gossip"" protocol and virtual voting. ""We have a 39-member governing council. It is one of the most unique features of the Hedera,"" Ortmann said.

Another defining feature: predictable, low-cost transactions. While many cryptocurrencies fluctuate in price depending on network activity, bitcoin.ℏ maintains a fixed translation fee of just $0.001.

Though its name echoes the original bitcoin, Ortmann stressed that bitcoin.ℏ is not ""associated with any cryptos that still rely on the energy-consuming PoW method."" He described it as ""common sense cryptocurrency,"" per the Times.

As the crypto industry addresses its environmental issues, bitcoin.ℏ shows that digital currencies can combine efficiency, transparency, and predictable costs while reducing their impact on the planet.

President Donald Trump called for the United States to become the world's leading bitcoin nation during his speech at the America Business Forum in Miami on November 5, 2025.

Speaking to business leaders, Trump framed his administration as reversing federal hostility toward bitcoin, stating:

“I've also signed historic executive orders to end the federal government's war on crypto. Crypto was under siege. It's not under siege anymore.”

He emphasized the sector's size and reach, noting that many top business figures are involved in bitcoin.

Trump also argued that the growth of digital assets eases pressure on the dollar and supports American financial strength.

Trump warned that if the U.S. does not act decisively, other nations could seize leadership in the bitcoin sector. He specifically pointed to China's ambitions:

“And don't forget, if we don't do the crypto properly, China … China wants to do it. They're starting it, but they want to do it. Other countries want to do it. If we don't do it properly — it's a big industry.”

While Trump's remarks were largely about vision, his administration has taken concrete steps.

In 2025, the White House established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile using coins from federal seizures, though there have been no direct government bitcoin purchases (details here).

Additionally, the GENIUS Act, signed on July 18, advanced stablecoin regulation, and broader digital asset legislation continues to progress in Congress.

Trump's team has also formally rejected a central bank digital currency, positioning bitcoin policy as supportive of dollar primacy.

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II,

Senior Contributor.

Bitcoin's price movements have generated significant visibility lately, and the $100,000 level is acting like a “massive” “magnet” that is drawing in the market, said analyst Tim Enneking. 

“Everything else is dwarfed by the support of $100k,"" Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, claimed via email, emphasizing this level's crucial nature. 

He made this statement during a time when the world's most prominent digital currency has repeatedly fallen below $100,000, but has managed to quickly recover, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. Today, the cryptocurrency traded north of this level, flirting with $104,000. 

The digital asset has been trading close to this level after suffering significant losses over the last several weeks. Bitcoin prices reached a fresh, all-time high of more than $126,000 early last month, but have declined close to 20% since then. 

As the digital currency trades near $100,000, market observers have identified several key levels of support, areas where a concentration of buy orders could either slow or stop the digital asset's descent. 

Going forward, “It would be most constructive if BTC held the zone between 101k and 103k,” said William Noble, an independent crypto analyst, through emailed comments. 

“If there is a major stock market disturbance, there could be a drop to 95k-98k,” he stated. “If that is created by problems in the banking system or repo market, then I would expect a massive reversal higher whether stocks continue lower or not,” added Noble. 

Interestingly enough, several other market observers mentioned the $98,000 when identifying levels of key support. 

“Bitcoin is consolidating after a sharp pullback from the $110,000 area, and traders are watching to see whether it can hold key support near $98,000–$100,000,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, stated via email. 

David Brickell, head of international distribution for FRNT, also weighed in, indicating that “Key support lies near $98,000, with a break below that level potentially opening a move toward the $88,000 area — the breakout zone following the sharp sell-off in April."" 

Several other analysts who offered input for this article also highlighted key price levels to watch should current support fail. 

“The first lower support level stands at mid $98k, if breached, the following support level stands at high $96k, followed by low $94k,” said independent cryptocurrency analyst Armando Aguilar. 

Enneking also shed some light on what could happen if support near $100,000 fails to hold up. 

“Looking lower, there is some support at $94k, but if that breaks, BTC will probably fall to the mid-80s. Below that, there is truly solid support at $74k,” he stated. 

“For the record, I don't see us testing any of those levels,” Enneking emphasized. 

Analysts also pinpointed important areas of resistance, which are price levels where a concentration of sell orders either slow down or prevent upward price movement. 

“A sustained move above $105,000 would suggest renewed momentum, with resistance around $110,000–$112,000 as the next major hurdle,” said DiPasquale. 

Aguilar offered a similar take, stating that “The upper resistance level stands at low $105k, followed by high $106k, then mid $108k.” 

Enneking also weighed in, specifying that “Moving up, BTC will face strong resistance at $107k, $112k, $116k and $123k.” 

“Of course, pushing to a new ATH (in this case, above $126k) is always a challenging proposition,” he noted. 

Brickell highlighted some similar levels, stating that “On the upside, a recovery above $107,000 would remove immediate downside pressure, while a sustained break above the $115,000–$117,000 region would put new all-time highs back into view.” ","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Investing


					Sending You to Google News in 3


If you're a cryptocurrency believer but don't want to bother with cold wallets and crypto exchanges, there's an indirect way to invest in  Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). You can get immediate exposure to Ethereum's price movements with shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN:BMNR) stock.

Although it's a relatively new company, Bitmine Immersion Technologies is definitely making waves in the crypto-sphere. The chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies is none other than Thomas “Tom” Lee, a co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and a loud-and-proud Ethereum cheerleader.

Lee and Bitmine Immersion Technologies are highly ambitious, and getting BMNR stock back to $100 isn't out of the question. At the same time, investors don't need to over-allocate into Bitmine Immersion Technologies shares as the path to fabulous wealth isn't assured and probably won't be easy.

It's not difficult to summarize the business model of Bitmine Immersion Technologies. The company is an Ethereum treasury company, which is a fancy way of saying that it stockpiles large quantities of Ethereum.

It seems that Lee and Bitmine Immersion Technologies don't just want to stockpile Ethereum; they may also seek to influence the Ethereum market to a certain extent. Already, Bitmine Immersion Technologies controls around 2.8% of the circulating supply of Ethereum.

Lee's objective for Bitmine Immersion Technologies' is to control 5% of Ethereum's circulating supply. “We are now more than halfway towards our pursuit of 5% of ETH,” Lee proudly declared.

At the company's current rate of Ethereum acquisition, Bitmine Immersion Technologies could easily reach that 5% goal. Just recently, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased 82,353 ETH, thereby bringing the company's total position to 3.4 million ETH.

The math on this is mind-blowing. If the Ethereum price is around $3,350, then Bitmine Immersion Technologies' 3.4 million ETH would have a dollar value of around $11.39 billion.

The company also recently had unencumbered cash holdings totaling $389 million, but that's a drop in the bucket when compared to Bitmine Immersion Technologies' cryptocurrency position. So clearly, the fate of Bitmine Immersion Technologies and of BMNR stock will largely depend on the price performance of Ethereum.

If you prefer to invest in stocks rather than cryptocurrency, BMNR stock is a pretty good proxy for directly owning Ethereum. Owning an ETH proxy is a double-sided coin, though, as Ethereum can crash as fast as it can rally.

Holding Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock surely felt good a month ago as the ETH price headed toward $4,750 and looked ready to break above $5,000. At that time, BMNR stock traded near $63.

Yet, just as the crypto market can be generous, it can also be harsh. In what has been described as a crypto flash crash, the Ethereum price recently pulled back below $3,350.

Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock crashed to the $40 area. This harrowing price action prompted the question of whether the crypto flash crash signals the start of a long, painful crypto winter.

Lee doesn't seem to be overly concerned. He believes that the cryptocurrency liquidation event “reset the market” and created new accumulation opportunities, and calmly assured that the crypto “market is consolidating.”

Only time will tell whether the price “reset” is the start of a cold, bitter winter. Lee's calm confidence may feel reassuring, but sensible investors should view Ethereum, and hence BMNR stock, as a speculative asset that's prone to bouts of volatility.

For what it's worth, Lee called for Ethereum to potentially rally to $7,000 before the end of the year. A price run-up of this magnitude would certainly help Bitmine Immersion Technologies, as the company reportedly paid $4,037 per ETH token on average.

Furthermore, according to 10x Research via Bloomberg, Bitmine Immersion Technologies is “sitting on over $1.3 billion in unrealized losses with no dry powder left.” I already mentioned Bitmine Immersion Technologies' $389 million in cash holdings, which may be considered “dry powder” but that's debatable.

When all is said and done, there are too many moving parts to easily predict the future price path of Ethereum. Since Bitmine Immersion Technologies' success or failure depends on how Ethereum performs, only stalwart cryptocurrency optimists should consider owning BMNR stock.

Additionally, given Ethereum's price volatility, it's wise to stay small in your position if you choose to buy Bitmine Immersion Technologies shares. It's fine to hope that BMNR stock will reach $100, but bullish Ethereum predictions can only carry so much weight in an often unpredictable cryptocurrency market.

California has long maintained a firm grasp on technology, upholding expertise in both strategic innovation and business transformation. From the nucleus of Silicon Valley to the corridors of Los Angeles and San Diego, the Golden State has nurtured an ecosystem where ideas mature into global revolutions. Companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet are esteemed as ruler archetypes by virtue of their long-standing dominance, control, and influence. Stanford and UC-Berkeley serve as incubators for breakthrough discoveries, whereas venture capital flows very freely and abundantly into startups daring to change the world for the better. 

As per a report from March 2025, roughly 8.2 million residents own cryptocurrency, which is about 27% of California's adult population. Cryptocurrency ownership is notably youthful, with roughly 40% of holders aged between 18 and 34, widely regarded as the most tech-savvy and forward-thinking. These HODlers actively explore the best cryptocurrency options. By and large, California craves the economic benefits of being a cryptocurrency leader, but it operates one of the most rigorous state-level regulatory programs in the United States to guarantee stability and public trust. In what follows, we'll explore how the Golden State is positioning itself as a potential architect of the next financial frontier. 

In October 2023, California enacted the Digital Financial Assets Law (DFAL), making it a binding law with legal force. This legislation inaugurated a compendious framework governing the issuance, circulation, custody, and exchange of digital equivalents of financial assets. At the same time, it confronts the challenges posed by an industry that has historically lacked stout oversight, exposing markets to threats such as fraud, money laundering, and systemic instability. As cryptocurrency goes mainstream, DFAL compels FinTechs to operate with the same level of rigor expected in traditional financial services. 

In September 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom signed amendments that postponed the implementation deadline for licensing to July 1, 2026. For the sake of clarification, the law requires companies to obtain a license from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The process, managed via the National Multi-State Licensing System (NMLS), calls for ongoing compliance with rules such as Know Your Customer (KYC). Operators on digital financial assets kiosks – i.e., cryptocurrency ATMs – must report all locations to the DFPI. Individuals and businesses can accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services, making its use in private transactions valid.

For every decade since the early 1990s, Silicon Valley has spawned or nurtured inventions that shaped our world, such as the microprocessor, which paved the way for the personal computer. Silicon Valley has served as a key catalyst for the growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency, contributing in several key ways: 

The pervasiveness of technology and identity diversity defines California's strong and influential culture. Silicon Valley has grown to include nearby San Francisco, perpetually cooler, younger, and more free-spirited than its buttoned-up neighbors to the south. The local culture stresses disruption, fast failure, and rapid scaling. This environment provides a fertile ground for cutting-edge technology like blockchain and actively fosters innovation, prompting startups to explore decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), emerging DeFi protocols, and a wide range of Web3 applications that challenge conventional financial and governance structures.

To remain well-informed about the latest developments in the realms of cryptocurrency and blockchain, individuals take part in both physical and virtual conferences. NFT LA is one such example. Popularly recognized as Outer Edge|LA, it's a multi-day conference that takes place in downtown Los Angeles, zeroing in on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and technologies that go hand-in-hand. It's also worth mentioning ETHGlobal, a community-driven platform that focuses on growing the Ethereum ecosystem by organizing hackathons, summits, workshops, and other developer-focused activities. At these events, participants are granted access to mentorship, tooling, educational talks, and networking opportunities. 

The use of cryptocurrency presents some real challenges in California. The Golden State treats digital assets like Bitcoin much the same as cash, which means that any profit from selling or trading them gets taxed as regular income. On the flipside, Californians can use their capital losses to offset their gains, which helps lower their overall taxable income. Cryptocurrency owners must report their holdings, either through the FBAR annual report, due April 15, or FATCA reporting. Though discussions around zero capital gains tax for cryptocurrency have attracted interest, no official policy has been advanced. 

Cryptocurrency mining is legal in California, and mining-related activity is present in the San Diego and San Francisco Bay area, where miners can capitalize on renewable energy sources or negotiate lower rates through industrial zones. Additionally, they benefit from the coastal climates, which help reduce cooling costs for mining rigs. The process through which computers generate cryptocurrency tokens exposes us to harmful air pollution, which is linked to a higher risk of cancer, heart disease, dementia, and so on. 

California is balancing precariously between encouraging creative thinking and novel solutions and making sure the rule of law is followed. On the one hand, it flaunts an unrivalled technology infrastructure, world-class universities, and a lively startup ecosystem that make significant contributions to the field. On the other hand, the Golden State's high taxes, complex licensing requirements, and cautious regulatory stance have alienated some cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, now seeking friendlier environments. Nevertheless, caution doesn't necessarily translate into stagnation. ","{'href': 'https://easyreadernews.com', 'title': 'Easy Reader News'}","cryptocurrency"

Stablecoins are often heralded as potential pathways toward faster and cheaper payments, but the Payments Association cautions that innovation alone will not be enough without strong oversight.

“Stablecoins promise faster, cheaper, programmable money — but they're not a silver bullet,” said Dr. Ruth Wandhöfer, industry expert and author of the white-paper.

Adding: “Without harmonized regulation and trusted infrastructure, innovation risks rebuilding on shaky ground.”

While stablecoin adoption was initially driven by crypto trading, its use in cross-border payments has emerged as one of the sector's most promising real-world applications.

Remittance providers and fintech startups alike have begun seizing the technology's potential to make international money transfers faster and cheaper.

A recent survey of U.S.  remittance customers found that 26% had used stablecoins for sending money abroad.

Many fintech companies are now building cross-border payment platforms based on stablecoins, while traditional players such as Western Union are moving to integrate the assets to remain competitive.

However, the Payments Association claims that more regulatory trust and clarity are needed before they can truly succeed.

The paper finds that long-standing challenges such as FX volatility, restricted liquidity, and regulatory fragmentation continue to weigh on global transactions.

According to the association, inefficiencies in the global cross-border payments market reached nearly $1 quadrillion in 2024.

One of the most significant obstacles, the paper notes, is the decline in correspondent banking relationships, a trend also documented by researchers  at the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR).

Over the past decade, the number of active correspondent banking ties has fallen by roughly 20–25%, driven by “de-risking,” according to the Payments Association.

This retrenchment, which sees global banks scale back relationships deemed too risky to maintain, has direct consequences for trade and economic growth, according to the CEPR.

“Once a firm's main bank loses a correspondent relationship, its likelihood to continue exporting declines significantly,” the CEPR analysts said.

Adding: “Affected firms often cannot fully replace lost export revenues, leading to lower total turnover and job losses.”

The resulting gaps in cross-border access have driven up costs and restricted financial inclusion, issues the Payments Association says must be addressed before solutions like stablecoins can succeed.

The report proposes a “Global Single Shared Platform” to integrate existing bank systems and currencies, enabling cross-border transactions for both traditional and digital assets.

Gary Palmer, CEO of Payall, stressed that trust must underpin any future payment system.

“Trust must be the first mission of any cross-border payments technology,” he said.  “A Global Single Shared Platform can uphold that trust, working with existing bank systems while empowering innovators to protect banks and preserve confidence across the ecosystem.”

Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi, Director of Policy and Government Relations at the Payments Association, stated that the industry's priorities should focus on resolving the issues related to “limits and backing assets.”

“The Bank of England has taken significant steps forward, but still the proposed regime is the most punitive for stablecoin issuers and not in line with regulatory global best practice and industry trends,” he said.

With the federal government continuing in shutdown mode, there continues to be a dearth of official economic statistics, including the all-important monthly Nonfarm PayRolls Report, which plays a large role in informing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

It's thus elevated the status of some lesser-followed reports and at least one is flashing a major red signal for the labor market.

That would be the monthly job cuts report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The October data released Thursday morning showed 153,074 layoffs last month — that's almost triple the amount seen in October of 2024 and the highest print for any October going back to 2003.

""This comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,"" said Challenger. ""Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.""

Zooming out paints just as grim of a picture, with job cuts year-to-date now topping 1 million, up 65% from the year-ago level and the highest amount since the Covid panic of 2020.

The October print for hiring is similarly weak, with just 372,520 hiring plans for the month, the smallest number since Challenger began tracking that data in 2012.

Crypto markets continue to reel from last week's hawkish surprise from the Fed, in which the central bank trimmed its policy rate (as expected), but Chairman Jerome Powell used his press conference to suggest market participants were highly mistaken in assuming another rate cut in December.

Since, a number of Fed speakers have followed suit, with at least two saying that had it been up to them, they wouldn't have even cut rates last week.

The news was surely among the factors that sent crypto plunging over the past eight days, with bitcoin BTC$103,064.19 falling below $100,000 before its small bounce this morning back to $103,000.

Yes, inflation was among the Fed worries, but the revitalized hawks are also suggesting the employment market is in solid shape and thus in no need of monetary stimulus. Powell also pointedly noted the government shutdown and lack of official statistics means the central bank is mostly flying blind as it tries to decipher the economy.

The Fed's reaction to today's shocking Challenger data will be interesting to note. For now., traditional markets aren't waiting. The 10-year Treasury yield has tumbled six basis points to 4.10% and market-based odds of the Fed cutting in December have risen to 69% from 60% earlier in the week.

Call it some air slipping out what might be an AI bubble, or the Fed engineering a tightening in liquidity into a growing economic slowdown, or some combination of the two, but markets are pulling back again on Thursday.

Just before the noon hour on the east coast, the Nasdaq is lower by 2% and the S&P 500 down 1.2%.

Crypto prices — in the unfortunate position these past weeks of being uncorrelated with stocks when they were rising every single day, but perfectly correlated when stocks sell off — are again taking it on the chin. Bitcoin is lower by 3% over the past 24 hours and threatening to tumble back below $100,000. Ether ETH$3,372.41, XRP$2.3321, solana SOL$158.93 and doge (DOGE) are lower by 2%-6%.

Crypto-related stocks are having an even harder time of it. Robinhood (HOOD) is down 8.5% one day after reporting a sizable earnings beat, in part due to surging crypto trading. Among other exchanges, Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 5.6% and Gemini (GEMI) by 3%. Bullish (BLSH) is down 8% and Galaxy Digital (GLXY) by 5.1%.

Capital continues to flee to digital asset treasury sector, led by a 5.9% decline in pioneer Strategy (MSTR). At $238, MSTR is now lower by 6.8% year-over-year and down by 56% since soaring to $543 in the days following President Trump's 2024 election victory.

Bitcoin mining stocks — many of which have soared this year thanks to a pivot to becoming AI infrastructure providers — aren't being spared. Hut 8 (HUT), IREN (IREN), and Cipher Mining (CIFR) are among those down more than 8%.

Markets continue to reel from the Fed's surprise hawkish pivot last week at which Chairman Jerome Powell threw a big bucket of cold water on the settled-idea that the central bank would cut rates at its December meeting.

Powell's sentiments have since been echoed by numerous other Fed members. Worried about flying blind as the government shutdown means no official economic statistics, the central bank might be missing or choosing to ignore what's now become a string of other data pointing to underlying weakness.

The latest came Thursday with one of the worst Challenger job layoff reports in more than two decades, along with a troubling outlook from used-car sales bellwether CarMax (KMX). That company's CEO also unexpectedly stepped down — shares are lower by 20%. One day ago, McDonald's warned on the economic pressure being felt by its customers, sentiments echoed previously by chains like Chipotle and Cava.

The continued federal government shutdown also looks to be extending far further than most previously expected, according to the latest Polymarket odds. Folks can carp about deficits and bloated government all they want, but the shutdown means many billions of dollars that would otherwise by flowing through the economy (and markets) are not doing so.

A newly created high-resolution map of the roads that threaded across the Roman Empire charts the ancient network from Great Britain to North Africa and has added more than 60,000 miles of roads that were never recorded before. “For the first time, we have a good, Empire-wide overview of almost the complete Roman road network with main and secondary roads,” says archaeologist Adam Pažout of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, a co-lead author of a new study describing the research that was published on Thursday in Scientific Data.

The new map—an online database dubbed Itiner-e—was compiled from several sources, including earlier databases, satellite photographs and archaeological reports. It reveals the true extent of the crucial road network as it was in the year C.E. 150—a time of prosperity in the Roman Empire—including highways between settlements, military roads for Roman soldiers and local routes that were overlooked in earlier research. The map will help scientists better understand issues such as mobility, trade and the spread of diseases, the study's authors say.

Many Roman roads are now modern roads between cities, such as the section of the U.K.'s A5 highway between London and Wroxeter, England, near the Welsh border, which was built along the route of a major Roman road that was later called Watling Street. But others were only local. “The roads are anywhere that the Romans walked,” says archaeologist and co-lead author Tom Brughmans of Aarhus University in Denmark. “There were villas and towns and farms all over the Roman Empire, and every one of them was reachable by a road.”

The greatest Roman roads, such as the Appian Way, which led south from Rome, were built well with layers of sand, gravel and stone. First Italy and then Rome's more distant territories were transformed by a web of roads that connected settlements and let Roman armies move where they were needed, says historian Ray Laurence of Macquarie University in Australia, who was not involved in the study. “Fundamentally, the road system underwrote the development of a Roman empire,” he says.

The Itiner-e dataset details more than 185,000 miles of Roman roads—nearly double the length reported by earlier studies. But Brughmans cautions that only a few percent of this length is known with certainty, whereas almost 90 percent is “conjectured” based on good evidence. For example, in what is today Israel, a road that ran between the coast and a military camp appeared in Roman records. And about 7 percent of the more than 185,000 miles of roads is “hypothetical”—that is, it represents where roads are expected to have existed but where there isn't good evidence of their exact locations. “Thanks to our work, we know that localizing Roman roads precisely requires more research attention,” Brughmans says. “It's a ‘call to action' that gives us a precise confidence map of what we don't know and where to look next.”

Seeking Profits, Private Companies Look to Light up the Night Sky

Reflect Orbital's plan to deliver “sunlight on demand” using thousands of giant orbital mirrors is just the latest in a growing list of disruptive commercial activities in space

By Ramin Skibba edited by Lee Billings

For astronomers, the sky isn't exactly falling—yet the sky-high ambitions of tech companies seeking profits in Earth orbit and beyond are becoming too disruptive to ignore. SpaceX's Starlink Internet service, built with thousands of telescope-photobombing satellites, is the poster child for this problematic trend, but it's not alone. The latest start-up with brash out-of-this-world plans is Reflect Orbital, which has built a business case for beaming sunlight from orbit to power solar farms after dark. The company, based in Hawthorne, Calif., next to SpaceX's former headquarters, recently sought a license from the Federal Communications Commission to launch its first satellite in 2026 and plans to put thousands more in orbit.

Maybe that could work. But experts have technological, environmental and safety concerns. Marketed as “sunlight on demand,” Reflect Orbital's high-frontier initiative is just one among many; other companies in the proliferating space industry want to launch space advertisements, human remains and made-to-order artificial meteor showers. Such wide-ranging—and, to some, objectionable—projects are part of an ongoing shift from government-sponsored science or defense-focused missions to a new, commerce-dominated space era.

The satellite that Reflect Orbital aims to loft in 2026 is a test spacecraft dubbed EARENDIL-1—a Lord of the Rings–inspired name that, like many other tech companies and products that reference the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, would probably make the anti-industrial author roll in his grave.

Once the satellite reaches its approximately 600-kilometer-high orbit, it will deploy a giant 18-by-18-meter mirror to redirect sunlight down to targets on Earth. (The mirror's area is twice the size of a volleyball court.) In addition to describing the solar-power-boosting benefit of the technology, the company's website advertises other applications, too, such as “unforgettable” sunlit evenings at “entertainment venues, corporate events, and urban public spaces.” Reflect Orbital is financed by investors, including Sequoia Capital and the billionaire Baiju Bhatt, and is supported by a $1.25-million Small Business Innovation Research contract from the U.S. Air Force as well.

Reflect Orbital's project comes with many engineering challenges, however. “It's simple but not easy,” says Darren McKnight, a systems engineer and senior technical fellow at LeoLabs, a spacecraft- and debris-tracking company based in Menlo Park, Calif. “People look at each individual technology and say, ‘See, it's possible,' but don't put it all together.”

Overheating and station-keeping could be big problems for the sprawling, sunbathed satellite, as could the precise control required to pinpoint a reflected beam onto targets far below. The beam would also shed some of its energy in the atmosphere, with the potential for clouds and inclement weather to dramatically degrade its intensity. Overcoming these overlapping challenges would be a tall order, and the transmission losses alone could be astronomical across such vast distances, McKnight says. Reflect Orbital isn't the first organization to attempt giant mirrors in space for the purpose of beaming sunlight onto Earth: Russian space agency scientists pursued and even launched a prototype spacecraft in the 1990s before ultimately abandoning the effort.

Reacting to the company's announcements, a group of astronomers produced a fact sheet on October 6. It stated, “There are already solutions right here on Earth to many of the problems ‘sunlight as a service' purports to solve. This approach is simply a reckless and inefficient use of Earth orbit, a precious and finite resource.” In a statement to Scientific American, Reflect Orbital's chief strategy officer Ally Stone said the company “is committed to protecting dark skies,” and that its first missions would involve “tightly controlled light spots steered well away from observatories and sensitive areas.”

If the company's plans come to fruition, following its tests next year it will begin launching more mirror-toting satellites, ultimately building a mega constellation of 4,000 by 2030. Each would be capable of casting a 5 km-wide beam about four times brighter than the full moon down to Earth. But atmospheric scattering would ensure that some light escapes each beam, says John Barentine, a Tucson, Ariz.–based astronomer and executive officer of Dark Sky Consulting, which advises companies and city officials on outdoor lighting use. “We've calculated that, even relatively far from the beam, the [satellites] would still have an apparent brightness that would make them among the brightest objects in the night sky,” he says.

Large numbers of satellites in low-Earth orbit are crucial to Reflect Orbital's plans because a daisy-chain approach is required to consistently illuminate a target on the ground. A single satellite there could only beam sunlight to a surface target for some four minutes before flying out of range, whereupon another satellite would take over with its own beam. This process could continue for an hour or two during twilight and dawn. In addition to the potential effects on ground-based astronomical observatories, which already struggle to study the universe through existing levels of light pollution, Barentine fears the beaming could also have dire consequences for nocturnal wildlife—as well as the celestial views of everyday stargazers.

Besides Reflect Orbital's planned fleet of satellites, he cites other companies' bright spacecraft—not only SpaceX's Starlink mega constellation, which now includes more than 8,000 among its ranks, but also Amazon's growing Project Kuiper satellite fleet. Other problematic projects are AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird satellites and its BlueWalker 3 prototype, which Barentine and his colleagues have shown to be exceptionally bright.

Reflect Orbital's plan isn't an isolated phenomenon, says Jordan Bimm, a space historian and an assistant professor of science communication at the University of Chicago. “Humans have been sending weird stuff to space for a while,” he says. Numerous times, NASA astronauts have brought up various trinkets or smuggled items to space, including an unauthorized corned beef sandwich taken on the Gemini III mission in 1965 and a gorilla suit brought to the International Space Station in 2016. Furthermore, robotic missions have often included “festooning,” stowing or bolting small, nontechnical elements that don't directly involve the mission on landers and rovers, often for public engagement or other purposes.

“But there's zany, and then there's deeply concerning,” Bimm says. The past few years have brought multiple contentious space projects and concepts: For the first test flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket in 2018, SpaceX launched an entire Tesla Roadster into space, where the gradual, chaotic effects of orbital mechanics could eventually push it on a collision course with Earth or Mars. The following year live tardigrades were crash-landed on the surface of the moon via the Beresheet spacecraft, operated by the Israel-based nonprofit SpaceIL, which may have constituted a technical breach of planetary protection protocols. And not one but two companies had “lunar memorial services” (that is, cremated human remains) as payloads onboard last year's Astrobotic lunar lander, which failed in Earth orbit. In addition, a Russian company, Avant Space, seeks to launch space ads into orbit, where they would also contaminate the night sky. And the Japanese company ALE wants to deploy spacecraft that would generate high-visibility artificial meteor showers on demand.

The trend extends into proposals for commercial space infrastructure as well. Tech companies such as Nvidia and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have begun exploring the feasibility of launching solar-powered space-based data centers, and space-tech titans Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have each recently voiced vigorous support for the idea. And of course, billionaires themselves have traveled to space, including founders of companies that are leading efforts to design the first commercial space stations, which may gain prominence when government facilities such as the International Space Station cease operations.

For most of the 20th century, space activities remained largely the purview of powerful nations, with an initial emphasis on cold-war-era military applications, followed by more science-centric “soft power” feats such as moon landings, interplanetary missions and orbital telescopes, Bimm points out. But in the 21st century, lower launch costs and better spacecraft designs have allowed myriad commercial schemes and a host of new opportunities and controversies.

There's currently limited national and international oversight of many of these commercial space projects, but it doesn't have to be that way, argues Aaron Boley, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and co-founder of the Outer Space Institute, a network of space experts. “In general, nation states remain responsible for authorizing and supervising their respective commercial space activities,” but some regulations need updating, he says. For U.S.-based companies, that means oversight is critical from regulatory agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, and other countries should make similar efforts, he says. In addition, the bedrock of space law, the Outer Space Treaty, states the overarching principle that countries must have “due regard” for others, which ultimately means that it's everyone's shared responsibility to protect Earth orbit and the moon as a common heritage for humanity.

Boley and other experts don't oppose companies pursuing far-out proposals per se. Investing “strategic R&D” in an ambitious idea that might not pan out anytime soon sometimes yields unexpected science and technology breakthroughs, McKnight says.

But potential innovations can't be the only consideration, Bimm says. “I'm not against being bold in space,” he says. “I think being bold is important, but you must also be thoughtful.”

Why Drugs Like Ozempic Can Make People Drink Less Alcohol

A small study helps explain why some people taking Wegovy and similar weight-loss drugs cut back on alcohol, offering insight into potential new addiction therapies

By Lauren J. Young edited by Tanya Lewis

Some people taking popular new diabetes and weight-loss drugs including Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro have reported reduced cravings for substances besides food. The medications seem to dampen the effects of drugs ranging from nicotine to alcohol—but scientists haven't been able to fully figure out why.

A recent preliminary study in Scientific Reports offers clues to how the new class of drugs may make people drink less alcohol—and feel less drunk when they do. The study authors suggest that understanding the drugs' mechanism in the entire body—not just the brain—could open up avenues for treating alcohol use disorder.

“There's a lot of action in the brain, but what we were trying to argue in our paper is that there also is probably action in the gut,” says study co-author Alex DiFeliceantonio, an appetitive neuroscientist at Virginia Tech. “We need to look at both to really fully understand how these drugs are working to reduce the intake of substances with abuse liability.”

The drugs promote the release of insulin and make people feel full by mimicking the natural gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Scientists largely agree that the primary way GLP-1 drugs cause weight loss is through their effects on feelings of satiety in the brain—causing people to feel full faster and ultimately eat smaller meals. Past evidence suggests the brain's pleasure and satiety pathways overlap, which has spurred researchers to propose that the GLP-1 drugs may be also quieting reward signals key in certain addictive behaviors, such as drinking alcohol.

But the drugs also cause a physiological reaction in the gut: they slow down the movement of food and liquids from the stomach into the small intestine, a process known as gastric emptying.

People taking these drugs “can't eat quite as much, because the food is staying in their stomach longer,” DiFeliceantonio says. “The interesting thing about alcohol is it is not well absorbed in the stomach. It needs to empty into the intestine to be absorbed and for you to feel the effects.”

If the GLP-1 drugs delay gastric emptying, alcohol may take longer to reach the brain. “We know that slowing down a drug makes it less rewarding,” DiFeliceantonio says—and reducing reward may help treat addiction. “The substance matters, yes, but the speed at which it gets to your brain also matters,” she says.

DiFeliceantonio and her colleagues set out to test this hypothesis. In a makeshift bar in their lab, they gave vodka mixed in orange or cranberry juice to 10 people who were taking one of the GLP-1 medications for weight loss and a similar number of people in a control group. None of the participants had alcohol use disorder. In the span of an hour, all participants drank three vodka doses, calculated based on their body size, to increase their breath alcohol content (BrAC) to 0.08 percent. This is equivalent to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.1 percent, past the legal limit for driving in the U.S.

The researchers surveyed the participants about how drunk they felt and took several breath alcohol measurements over four hours, or until the participants' BrAC levels dropped below 0.02 percent.

“What we found was that, especially in the first 20 to 30 minutes after drinking the alcohol, there was a lower breath alcohol content in the group taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and they reported that they felt less drunk,” DiFeliceantonio says. All the participants reached similar BrAC levels after about an hour, but slowing the alcohol's effect on the brain made people feel less intoxicated, she says.

Neither changes in blood glucose nor nausea (a common side effect of GLP-1 medications) explained how intoxicated people felt, the researchers found.

The study has several limitations. The sample size was small, and different participants were taking different weight-loss medications, which act on different gut hormone receptors or are prescribed at varying dosages. Ideally in drug studies researchers would keep the medication and dose consistent, but this study is a good start, says Carolina Haass-Koffler, an addiction researcher and associate professor of psychiatry at Brown University, who was not involved in the study.

“Alcohol use disorder is a complex, systemic disease and involves not only brain dysfunction but also a metabolic component,” Haass-Koffler says. “I really like the integration of the whole-body concept in this study.”

She notes, however, that introducing GLP-1 medications to a new population requires careful evaluation of the risks and benefits. “Safety data are out there for people with diabetes and now people taking the medication for obesity,” but the clinical presentation could be completely different in people with alcohol use disorder, Haass-Koffler says. DiFeliceantonio wouldn't recommend GLP-1 drugs as future frontline treatments for someone with alcohol use disorder who is underweight.

Randomized controlled trials of these drugs have shown some promise in treating alcoholism. A 2022 clinical trial found that the early-generation GLP-1 medication exenatide lowered alcohol cravings in people with alcohol use disorder, and another trial published in February found that people with obesity and alcohol use disorder drank less when treated with semaglutide, the generic name for Wegovy and Ozempic.

“It seems like a really small thing, to just slow down [alcohol reaching the brain] a little,” DiFeliceantonio says. “From this study, we can't definitively say this is the reason that people taking GLP-1 medications drink less, but it's adding to this body of evidence of what the mechanism is.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Satellite Spotted a Lump in the Ground. It Was the Grave of an Ancient Warrior.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69206614/warrior-grave-satellite/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The grave held the warrior's remains and a curved blade that likely meant the deceased was among the elite class.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Robbers may have stolen some exciting artifacts from a seventh-century Avarian warrior's grave, but they didn't take everything. Fortunately, among what they had left behind was a stunningly rare, curved iron saber—a 1,300-year-old find that, after its recent discovery, has gone on display in a Hungarian museum. 

The Szent Istvan Kiraly (King Saint Stephen) museum announced the August discovery of the grave, the impressive sword, and additional grave goods when they recently went on display. The find came thanks to the Hungarian National Museum's Cemeteries from Space program, which uses satellite imagery to pinpoint potential archaeological sites worth exploring. This site, roughly 30 miles southwest of Budapest, was first seen in the project's satellite images before excavation of the location unveiled the grave with its ancient warrior tucked inside.

Within the grave, which had already been at least partially looted, the team found the skeleton of what they are calling an Avar-era warrior—likely coming from the Avar kingdom in Central Europe, centered in modern-day Hungary. The bottom half of the skeleton was left untouched, while the abdomen and everything above it were scattered, likely by looters. In addition to the sword, those looters also left behind arrowheads, a silver belt, earrings with glass pearl studs, decorative metal hair braids, and a knife. The grave dates to between 670 and 690 C.E.

“These cemeteries prove that Fejer County was an important center 1,400 years ago,” said historian Gyorgy Szabados in a translated statement from the museum, according to Heritage Daily. “The saber discovery adds weight to that claim, offering both a tangible artifact and a symbol of the region's place in early medieval history.”

Retrieving the rare saber was tricky. Though still fully intact, with a decorative blade and hilt, the piece was rusted and brittle. A volunteer crafted a type of wooden cradle to help lift the saber, along with some of the surrounding soil, from the grave, allowing for enough restoration to be completed on the saber that it could be showcased by the museum. 

The curved nature of the blade, according to Live Science, was a common style used for warriors on horseback. Just who this particular warrior was, though, remains a mystery. The type of saber suggests that the individual was of a high social rank, and other expensive grave goods back that theory up. 

According to Live Science, historians aren't certain on the true beginning of the Pannonian Avar people, nor whether they were connected to the Turkic or Mongolian elite. With no known written language, the culture's history has been tricky to trace. 

Roughly 80 potential graves remain unexplored at the site, and from them, experts hope to gain more insight into Avar history. Maybe they'll find another saber along the way.

A new study suggests that, at least mathematically speaking, the idea doesn't hold up, as some facets of reality can't be explain purely algorithmically.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Is the universe a simulation? At first glance, the idea seems preposterous. Then again, within just a few decades, we've created entire digital worlds, AI has started to blur the line of what is real, and scientists have continued to probe the fabric of reality down to the quantum level. Factor in centuries or even millennia of similar technological progress—multiplied by the two trillion or so galaxies in the universe—and the idea that maybe our lived experience is simply a hyper-realistic simulation by some ultra-advanced alien species can feel a bit less like pure speculation and more head-scratchingly plausible. 

The idea isn't new—everything from Plato's “Allegory of the Cave” to the Wachowski sisters' The Matrix ponders the concept. But this simulation theory has taken on some seriousness within the relatively new field of information physics, which aims to explore the role that information plays in the machinations of our universe. Some scientists have proposed that gravity arises from computation rules, while others suggest that information could explain things like dark matter and dark energy. But the team of researchers behind a new study from scientists at the University of British Columbia (UBC) now claims that they've mathematically proven that simulation theory is impossible. Their work is published in the Journal of Holography Applications in Physics.

“This idea was once thought to lie beyond the reach of scientific inquiry,” Mir Faizal, the lead author of the study from UBC, said in a press statement. “However, our recent research has demonstrated that it can, in fact, be scientifically addressed.”

The question explored at the heart of this study is whether or not all facets of reality can be described in algorithmic means. Any simulation, no matter how sophisticated, would rely on algorithms. So, if you can prove that certain fundamental principles are non-algorithmic in nature, that would suggest we're all flesh-and-blood-real after all. Using advanced mathematical concepts—including Godel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness—the study identifies limitations on what algorithms can describe. 

“Together, these results imply that a wholly algorithmic ‘Theory of Everything' is impossible: certain facets of reality will remain computationally undecidable and can be accessed only through non-algorithmic understanding,” the authors wrote. “Because any putative simulation of the universe would itself be algorithmic, this framework also implies that the universe cannot be a simulation.”

To take things one step further, the authors invoke the metaphysical idea of the “Platonic realm” of mathematics—a realm that's more “real” than our own and from which space and time itself emerge.  Could it be possible that the rules in this realm could be, in and of themselves, algorithmic?

“Drawing on mathematical theorems related to incompleteness and indefinability, we demonstrate that a fully consistent and complete description of reality cannot be achieved through computation alone,” Faizal said in a press statement. “It requires non-algorithmic understanding, which by definition is beyond algorithmic computation and therefore cannot be simulated. Hence, this universe cannot be a simulation.”

This isn't likely to be the definite last word on the simulation hypothesis, especially since the idea conjures up such great sci-fi fodder. But it does provide a compelling piece of metaphysical evidence that we might be living in universe prime after all.

Scientists have developed a new material that forms a gel capable of repairing and regenerating tooth enamel, paving the way for more effective and longer-lasting dental care.

Researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Pharmacy and Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering created a bioinspired compound designed to restore enamel that has been eroded or demineralized. The same material can also reinforce existing enamel and help prevent future decay. Their findings were published on November 4 in Nature Communications.

Mimicking Nature to Heal and Strengthen Teeth

This innovative gel can be quickly applied to teeth in much the same way as standard fluoride treatments. Unlike traditional products, it contains no fluoride. Instead, it is made from proteins that imitate those naturally responsible for guiding enamel formation early in life.

Once applied, the gel forms a thin yet durable layer that seeps into the surface of the teeth, filling in tiny cracks and holes. It then acts as a scaffold that captures calcium and phosphate ions from saliva. These minerals are carefully organized into new enamel through a process known as epitaxial mineralization. This allows the regenerated enamel to integrate seamlessly with the existing tooth structure, restoring both strength and appearance.

The material can also be used on exposed dentine, creating an enamel-like coating that helps reduce tooth sensitivity and improves how restorations, such as fillings or veneers, bond to the tooth surface.

Enamel damage plays a major role in tooth decay, which affects nearly half of the global population. When enamel is lost, the teeth become more vulnerable to infections, cavities, and even tooth loss. These issues have also been linked to broader health conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Because enamel cannot naturally regenerate once it is lost, dental care has long focused on prevention or temporary protection. Existing treatments like fluoride varnishes and remineralization products can help relieve symptoms but do not actually rebuild enamel.

Restoring the Structure of Natural Enamel

Dr. Abshar Hasan, a Postdoctoral Fellow and lead author of the study, explained: ""Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical, and thermal insults. When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel. We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating 'real-life situations' such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel.""

Professor Alvaro Mata, Chair in Biomedical Engineering & Biomaterials and lead investigator on the project, emphasized the technology's practical potential: ""We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable. Also, the technology is versatile, which opens the opportunity to be translated into multiple types of products to help patients of all ages suffering from a variety of dental problems associated with loss of enamel and exposed dentine. We have started this process with our start-up company Mintech-Bio and hope to have a first product out by next year; this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide.""

Toward the Future of Self-Healing Teeth

With its ability to mimic natural enamel formation and strengthen teeth without fluoride, this new gel could redefine modern dentistry. If commercialized successfully, it may offer a simple, safe, and lasting solution for restoring enamel and preventing decay -- helping people maintain stronger, healthier teeth for life.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find hidden brain source that fuels dementia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251106003155.htm","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:09:26 GMT","

Scientists at Weill Cornell Medicine have identified a surprising culprit that may contribute to dementia: free radicals generated in a particular region of brain support cells known as astrocytes. The study, published Nov. 4 in Nature Metabolism, found that blocking this specific site reduced inflammation and protected neurons. The results point toward a promising new strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

""I'm really excited about the translational potential of this work,"" said Dr. Anna Orr, the Nan and Stephen Swid Associate Professor of Frontotemporal Dementia Research in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and member of the Appel Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute at Weill Cornell, who co-led the study. ""We can now target specific mechanisms and go after the exact sites that are relevant for disease.""

How Mitochondria and Free Radicals Affect the Brain

The research focused on mitochondria, the cell's energy-producing structures that convert food into usable energy. In the process, mitochondria release reactive oxygen species (ROS) -- molecules commonly known as free radicals. At normal levels, ROS help regulate essential cell functions, but excessive or poorly timed production can damage cells.

""Decades of research implicate mitochondrial ROS in neurodegenerative diseases,"" said Dr. Adam Orr, an assistant professor of research in neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell, who co-led the work.

Because of this connection, scientists have long tested antioxidants as a potential way to neutralize ROS and slow neurodegeneration. However, these clinical trials have largely failed. ""That lack of success might be related to the inability of antioxidants to block ROS at their source and do so selectively without altering cell metabolism,"" Dr. Adam Orr explained.

A New Way to Stop Harmful Free Radicals

As a postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Orr developed a drug discovery platform designed to find molecules that specifically suppress ROS at individual mitochondrial sites while leaving normal functions intact. Through this approach, the team identified a group of compounds called S3QELs (""sequels""), which showed potential to block harmful ROS activity.

The researchers focused on Complex III, a mitochondrial site known for producing ROS that can leak into the rest of the cell, potentially causing damage. To their surprise, the excess ROS did not originate from neurons, but from astrocytes -- non-neuronal cells that provide structural and metabolic support to neurons.

""When we added S3QELs, we found significant neuronal protection but only in the presence of astrocytes,"" said Daniel Barnett, a graduate student in the Orr lab and the study's lead author. ""This suggested that ROS coming from Complex III caused at least some of the neuronal pathology.""

Further experiments showed that when astrocytes were exposed to disease-related factors such as inflammatory molecules or proteins linked to dementia (including amyloid-beta), their mitochondrial ROS production increased dramatically. Treatment with S3QELs suppressed much of this rise, while blocking other ROS sources did not have the same effect.

Barnett discovered that ROS oxidized certain immune and metabolic proteins involved in neurological disease, altering the activity of thousands of genes tied to inflammation and dementia.

""The precision of these mechanisms had not been previously appreciated, especially not in brain cells,"" said Dr. Anna Orr. ""This suggests a very nuanced process in which specific triggers induce ROS from specific mitochondrial sites to affect specific targets.""

Promising Results in Animal Models

When the team administered the S3QEL compound to mice engineered to model frontotemporal dementia, they observed reduced astrocyte activation, lower levels of inflammatory gene expression, and a decrease in a tau modification linked to dementia. Remarkably, these effects appeared even when treatment began after symptoms had already started.

Extended treatment improved lifespan, was well tolerated, and produced no significant side effects. Dr. Anna Orr attributes this to the compound's highly targeted action.

The team plans to continue developing the S3QEL compounds in collaboration with medicinal chemist Dr. Subhash Sinha, professor of research in neuroscience in the Brain and Mind Research Institute and member of the Appel Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute at Weill Cornell.

They also intend to investigate how disease-associated genes influence ROS production and whether certain genetic variants that raise or lower dementia risk might do so by altering mitochondrial ROS activity.

Changing How Scientists Think About Free Radicals

""The study has really changed our thinking about free radicals and opened up many new avenues of investigation,"" said Dr. Adam Orr. The potential of these findings to open new research approaches to inflammation and neurodegeneration is highlighted in the journal.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists may have found how to reverse memory loss in aging brains","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251105050720.htm","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 03:58:06 GMT","

Memory problems may not be an unavoidable part of getting older. New findings from Virginia Tech reveal that age-related memory loss stems from specific molecular changes in the brain, and that fine-tuning these processes can help restore memory function.

In two complementary studies, Timothy Jarome, an associate professor in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences' School of Animal Sciences, and his graduate students used advanced gene-editing tools to target these molecular changes and improve memory performance in older rats. Rats are commonly used as models for understanding how memory declines with age.

""Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it's a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease,"" said Jarome, who also serves in the School of Neuroscience. ""This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied. If we can understand what's driving it at the molecular level, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment.""

Adjusting Memory Pathways in the Hippocampus and Amygdala

In the first study, published in Neuroscience and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the researchers investigated a molecular process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts like a tagging system that directs proteins inside brain cells on how to behave. When it functions properly, it helps neurons communicate effectively and form memories.

The researchers discovered that aging alters this process in two important brain regions. In the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming and retrieving memories, K63 polyubiquitination levels rise with age. Using a gene-editing system called CRISPR-dCas13, the team lowered those levels and observed improved memory in older rats.

In contrast, in the amygdala -- a region crucial for emotional memory -- K63 polyubiquitination decreases with age. When the researchers further reduced this activity, memory performance also improved.

""Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain's aging process,"" Jarome explained. ""In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory.""

Reactivating a Dormant Gene to Improve Memory

The second study, published in the Brain Research Bulletin and led by Jarome and doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene known to support memory formation. As the brain gets older, IGF2 activity declines as the gene becomes chemically silenced within the hippocampus.

""IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that's imprinted, which means it's expressed from only one parental copy,"" Jarome said. ""When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit.""

The team found that this silencing occurs through DNA methylation, a natural process that adds chemical tags to DNA, turning the gene off. Using the CRISPR-dCas9 gene-editing system, they removed these tags and successfully reactivated IGF2. Older rats showed significant memory improvement once the gene was turned back on.

""We essentially turned the gene back on,"" Jarome said. ""When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn't yet have memory problems weren't affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong.""

Multiple Molecular Systems Influence Brain Aging

Together, these studies reveal that memory loss during aging doesn't result from a single cause. Instead, it involves several molecular systems that change over time.

""We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once,"" Jarome said. ""If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer's disease, we have to look at the broader picture.""

Collaborative Research Led by Graduate Scientists

Both projects were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome's lab and carried out with collaborators at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State. Yeeun Bae led the K63 polyubiquitination study, while Shannon Kincaid led the IGF2 project.

""These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, collaborative research that defines our work,"" Jarome said. ""Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue.""

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the American Federation for Aging Research.

""Everyone has some memory decline as they get older,"" Jarome added. ""But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer's disease rises. What we're learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected -- and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Astronomers discover dying stars eating their planets","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251106003158.htm","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 09:35:57 GMT","

A new study from astronomers at UCL (University College London) and the University of Warwick suggests that aging stars may be destroying the giant planets orbiting closest to them.

When stars like the Sun exhaust their hydrogen fuel, they begin to cool and expand, transforming into red giants. For our Sun, this dramatic phase is expected to occur in roughly five billion years.

The research, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, analyzed nearly half a million stars that had recently entered this ""post-main sequence"" stage of evolution.

Searching for Planets Around Evolving Stars

The team identified 130 planets and potential planet candidates (i.e., that still need to be confirmed) orbiting closely around these aging stars, including 33 new candidates never detected before.

They found that such planets were far less common around stars that had expanded and cooled enough to qualify as red giants (i.e., those further along in their post-main sequence evolution). This pattern suggests that many of these planets may already have been destroyed.

Evidence of Planetary Destruction

Lead author Dr. Edward Bryant (Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL and the University of Warwick) explained: ""This is strong evidence that as stars evolve off their main sequence they can quickly cause planets to spiral into them and be destroyed. This has been the subject of debate and theory for some time but now we can see the impact of this directly and measure it at the level of a large population of stars.

""We expected to see this effect but we were still surprised by just how efficient these stars seem to be at engulfing their close planets.""

According to Dr. Bryant, the destruction occurs through a powerful gravitational struggle known as tidal interaction. As a star grows and expands, these forces intensify. ""Just like the Moon pulls on Earth's oceans to create tides, the planet pulls on the star,"" he said. ""These interactions slow the planet down and cause its orbit to shrink, making it spiral inwards until it either breaks apart or falls into the star.""

What It Means for the Solar System

Co-author Dr. Vincent Van Eylen (Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL) added perspective: ""In a few billion years, our own Sun will enlarge and become a red giant. When this happens, will the solar system planets survive? We are finding that in some cases planets do not.

""Earth is certainly safer than the giant planets in our study, which are much closer to their star. But we only looked at the earliest part of the post-main sequence phase, the first one or two million years of it -- the stars have a lot more evolution to go.

""Unlike the missing giant planets in our study, Earth itself might survive the Sun's red giant phase. But life on Earth probably would not.""

To carry out their research, the team used data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). They employed an algorithm to identify small, repeated dips in starlight caused by planets passing in front of their stars. Their focus was on giant planets with short orbits (i.e., taking no more than 12 days to circle their star).

Starting with more than 15,000 possible signals, the researchers used rigorous checks to eliminate false positives, ultimately narrowing the list to 130 confirmed or candidate planets. Of these, 48 were already known, 49 were known candidates awaiting confirmation, and 33 were completely new discoveries.

Fewer Planets Around Older Stars

The researchers found that stars further along in their evolution were significantly less likely to host nearby giant planets. The overall occurrence rate was just 0.28%, with younger post-main sequence stars showing a higher rate (0.35%) comparable to main sequence stars. The most evolved stars -- those classified as red giants -- showed a sharp drop to 0.11%. (For this analysis, the smallest 12 of the 130 identified planets were excluded.)

Using TESS data, astronomers can estimate a planet's size (radius). To confirm whether these objects are true planets or low-mass stars or brown dwarfs (""failed stars"" that never ignited nuclear fusion), their mass must be determined.

This is done by measuring the tiny shifts in the motion of the host star caused by a planet's gravitational pull. These ""stellar wobbles"" allow scientists to infer the planet's mass.

Dr. Bryant added: ""Once we have these planets' masses, that will help us understand exactly what is causing these planets to spiral in and be destroyed.""

The research was supported by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

In a major step toward improving cancer treatment, researchers at Northwestern University have redesigned the molecular structure of a widely used chemotherapy drug, making it far more soluble, potent, and less toxic to the body.

The scientists built a new form of the drug using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), a type of nanostructure that embeds the drug directly into DNA strands coating tiny spheres. This re-engineering turned a weak, poorly dissolving chemotherapy drug into a highly targeted cancer-fighting agent that spares healthy tissue.

A Dramatic Boost Against Leukemia

The new therapy was tested in animals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a fast-growing and hard-to-treat blood cancer. Compared with the standard chemotherapy version, the SNA-based drug entered leukemia cells 12.5 times more efficiently, destroyed them up to 20,000 times more effectively, and slowed cancer progression 59-fold -- all without detectable side effects.

This success highlights the growing promise of structural nanomedicine, a field that precisely controls the composition and architecture of nanomedicines to improve how they interact with the human body. With seven SNA-based treatments already in clinical testing, researchers believe this approach could pave the way for new vaccines and therapies for cancers, infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.

The findings were published on Oct. 29 in ACS Nano.

""Stopping Tumors in Their Tracks""

""In animal models, we demonstrated that we can stop tumors in their tracks,"" said Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin, who led the research. ""If this translates to human patients, it's a really exciting advance. It would mean more effective chemotherapy, better response rates, and fewer side effects. That's always the goal with any sort of cancer treatment.""

Mirkin is a leading figure in chemistry and nanomedicine, serving as the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Medicine at Northwestern. He also directs the International Institute for Nanotechnology and is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Rethinking a Classic Chemotherapy Drug

For this study, Mirkin's team revisited 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), a long-standing chemotherapy drug known for its limited efficiency and harsh side effects. Because it affects healthy cells as well as cancerous ones, 5-Fu can cause nausea, fatigue, and in rare cases, heart complications.

Mirkin explained that the issue lies not in the drug itself but in its poor solubility. Less than 1% dissolves in many biological fluids, meaning most of it never reaches its intended targets. When a drug cannot dissolve well, it clumps together or remains solid, preventing the body from absorbing it effectively.

""We all know that chemotherapy is often horribly toxic,"" Mirkin said. ""But a lot of people don't realize it's also often poorly soluble, so we have to find ways to transform it into water soluble forms and deliver it effectively.""

How Spherical Nucleic Acids Transform Drug Delivery

To overcome this limitation, the researchers turned to SNAs -- globular nanoparticles surrounded by dense shells of DNA or RNA. Cells readily recognize these structures and pull them inside. In this case, Mirkin's team chemically incorporated the chemotherapy molecules into the DNA strands themselves, creating a drug that cancer cells naturally absorb.

""Most cells have scavenger receptors on their surfaces,"" Mirkin explained. ""But myeloid cells overexpress these receptors, so there are even more of them. If they recognize a molecule, then they will pull it into the cell. Instead of having to force their way into cells, SNAs are naturally taken up by these receptors.""

Once inside, enzymes break down the DNA shell, releasing the chemotherapy payload directly into the cancer cell. This structural redesign completely changed how 5-Fu interacted with leukemia cells, dramatically increasing its effectiveness.

Precision Targeting With Minimal Harm

In mouse models, the new therapy nearly eliminated leukemia cells in the blood and spleen while significantly extending survival time. Because the SNAs selectively targeted AML cells, healthy tissues remained unharmed.

""Today's chemotherapeutics kill everything they encounter,"" Mirkin said. ""So, they kill the cancer cells but also a lot of healthy cells. Our structural nanomedicine preferentially seeks out the myeloid cells. Instead of overwhelming the whole body with chemotherapy, it delivers a higher, more focused dose exactly where it's needed.""

Next Steps Toward Clinical Trials

The research team now plans to test the approach in a larger group of small animal models before advancing to larger animals and, ultimately, human clinical trials, once additional funding becomes available.

The study, titled ""Chemotherapeutic spherical nucleic acids,"" was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, with further support from the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.

Radical chain initiation strategies are fundamental to the synthesis of small molecule drugs and macromolecular materials. Modern methods for initiation through one-electron reduction are largely dominated by photo- and electrochemistry but the large-scale industrial application of these methods is often hampered by scalability challenges. Here we report a general, thermally driven and scalable method for the reductive initiation of radical chains that involves reacting an inexpensive azo initiator with a formate salt to form a carbon dioxide radical anion. Substoichiometric quantities of this initiator system were used to form C(sp2)–C(sp3), C(sp2)–S, C(sp2)–H, C(sp2)–B and C(sp2)–P bonds from complex (hetero)aryl halides, with high chemoselectivity and under transition-metal-free conditions. The developed initiator system was also used to probe the mechanism of other radical reactions.

The controlled initiation of radical chains is a subject of fundamental importance to polymer science1, organic synthesis2,3, atmospheric chemistry4 and biochemistry5. In the context of synthetic organic chemistry, a substantial proportion of radical reactions are driven by chains6,7, but this aspect is often obscured—especially if the length of the chain is short. If the chain length is short, the reaction must be continuously reinitiated for its duration8. This is a major reason why photo- and electrochemistry have emerged as leading methods of initiation: they provide flexible and programmable frameworks to promote electron transfer and generate radicals at a controllable rate9,10,11,12,13. One drawback of photo-/electrochemical initiation strategies is their non-trivial scalability in a process development and manufacturing setting (beyond the milligram to gram scales used in earlier stages of medicinal chemistry)14,15. Indeed, both strategies require specialist reactor technologies, which may increase process development times and costs, limiting applications on the industrial scale when compared to standard manufacturing techniques (Fig. 1a). However, for chains driven by one-electron reduction (electron-catalysed and electron-transfer chain processes)16,17 photo- and electrochemical methods still far surpass the general utility of chemical/thermal initiation strategies using ground state electron donors18,19. Considering this current state-of-the-art, we sought to develop a general reductive initiation system with the following characteristics: (1) strongly reducing (\({{E}_{1/2}^{\circ}} < -2\,{\rm{V}}\) versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)); (2) usable in substoichiometric quantities; (3) thermally controlled; (4) does not form chain-terminating persistent radicals (a traceless one-electron reductant); (5) compatible with a broad range of substrates; (6) applicable to a wide range of reactions; and (7) inexpensive and scalable using standard manufacturing vessels.

a, One-electron reduction initiation strategies. b, Proposed thermal strategy using azo initiators to generate carbon dioxide radical anion. PC, photocatalyst; D, donor; \({E}_{1/2}^{\circ}\), half-wave potential.

In this study, we describe the realization of this goal by heating inexpensive azo initiators commonly used in the polymer industry20 in the presence of formate salts to generate a strong one-electron reductant, carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2·−, \({{E}_{1/2}^{\circ }}=-{2.22}\,{\rm{V}}\) versus SCE)20,21. Inspired by advances in the photochemical generation of CO2•− (refs. 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30), we hypothesized that electrophilic α-cyano alkyl radicals (derived from the thermal decomposition of an azo initiator) would readily abstract hydrogen atoms from formate salts to from CO2·− in a polarity-matched process (Fig. 1b). The proposed combination of an azo initiator and formate salt would provide an operationally simple ‘dump and stir' thermal method of initiation, which would satisfy the aforementioned criteria and be widely applicable across synthetic chemistry.

To evaluate the feasibility of our mechanistic proposal, we monitored the reaction of an azo initiator and sodium formate by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in the presence of the spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). 4,4-Azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ACVA) was selected as the azo initiator, as unlike azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), ACVA is not classified as an explosive. When reacting ACVA, HCO2Na and DMPO, a species matching previously reported data for a DMPO–CO2·− adduct was detected (Fig. 2a)31. To verify if this species was indeed a CO2·− adduct, these experiments were repeated using H13CO2Na and the expected additional 13C hyperfine coupling was clearly observed (aiso13C = 33 MHz). These results strongly suggest that CO2·− is formed from the reaction of ACVA and sodium formate. The feasibility of polarity-matched hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT)32 between the ACVA-derived α-cyano alkyl radical I and formate II was assessed by density functional theory (DFT), which indicated that HAT is both kinetically and thermodynamically viable (ΔG‡ = 14.5 kcal mol−1, ΔG = −3.6 kcal mol−1; Fig. 2b). It is possible that the distonic nature of I and interactions between the α-cyano radical and carboxylate anion may play a role in the efficiency of this electron upconversion process (the conversion of a weak/mild reductant into a stronger reductant product)17, but any such interactions are probably weakened by the highly polar dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solvent environment33,34,35,36.

Having validated our key mechanistic hypothesis, model synthetic applications were explored to determine the generality of this initiation strategy. We first targeted C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond-forming carbonyl α-arylation reactions due to the synthetic utility and prevalence of the α-aryl carbonyl motif in biologically active compounds37,38. Moreover, we posited that a general transition-metal-free radical strategy for carbonyl α-arylation would: (1) complement the scope of existing methods37,38 by providing improved compatibility with heteroaromatic systems, which are common poisons for metal catalysts; and (2) avoid issues related to the cost and toxicity of transition metals, as well as the geopolitical, ethical and environmental concerns regarding their supply chains39,40. Here, we hypothesized that CO2·− could initiate the electron-catalysed unimolecular radical-nucleophilic substitution (SRN1)41,42 of aryl halides with enolate nucleophiles43,44. Indeed, CO2·− is known to readily reduce aryl halides to form aryl radicals22,23,45. Thus, aryl halide 1 was reacted with ethyl acetoacetate 2 (4.0 equiv.), Cs2CO3 (4.5 equiv.), ACVA (0.25 equiv.) and potassium formate (0.5 equiv.) in DMSO at 80 °C for 4 h (Fig. 2c). Pleasingly, following the addition of ammonium chloride (to promote complete deacetylation of the intermediate 1,3-dicarbonyl 3), this one-pot procedure produced deacetylated α-aryl ester 4 in 79% yield and hydrodehalogenated side product 5 in 10% yield (Fig. 2c, entry 1). Hydrodehalogenated product 5 is proposed to form from a slower competing HAT chain in which the aryl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the formate salt (reforming CO2·−). Other commercially available azo initiators were trialled, but none proved superior to ACVA (entries 2–5). No product formation was observed in the absence of ACVA and HCO2K (entry 6). However, some product formation was observed with HCO2K alone (entry 7); we attribute this background reactivity to inefficient spontaneous initiation events—in which the anionic nucleophile itself serves as a weak one-electron reductant45—being amplified by CO2·− formation. Repeating the optimal reaction with ACVA and HCO2K in the presence of air reduced the yield of product 4 to 54% (entry 8). Moreover, all reactivity was completely supressed in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) (entry 9). Finally, repeating the reaction in the absence of the nucleophile 2 afforded only the hydrodehalogenated product 5 in 70% yield (entry 10). These findings are all consistent with an SRN1 electron-transfer chain process. Other compatible, but less effective formate salts and reaction conditions are described in Supplementary Tables 1–3.

With optimized conditions in hand, the scope and application of this thermally initiated transformation were explored (Fig. 3a). First, the importance of the nucleofuge was examined with para-halobenzonitrile derivatives. Pleasingly, the iodo, bromo and chloro derivatives were all converted into α-aryl ester 4 in 54%, 67% and 53% yield, respectively. Conversely, only 7% of 4 was formed from the corresponding fluoride, which indicates that the contribution of a polar SNAr mechanism to these reactions is probably minimal. Moreover, efficient reactivity was observed regardless of the arene substitution pattern because the meta- and ortho-substituted products 6 and 7 were both formed in good yields. Other electron-deficient nitrobenzene and aryl sulfone derivatives were similarly compatible and converted into products 8–13 in 30–85% yield. Interestingly, the reaction of 4-iodonitrobenzene formed product 11 in 66% yield in the absence of ACVA and HCO2K. We attribute this reactivity to spontaneous initiation, which is commonly observed when reacting anionic nucleophiles with easily reduced substrates (strongly electron-deficient aryl iodides)46,47. Carbonyl and ester derivatives were also tolerated and converted into α-aryl esters 14–20 in good to excellent yields. Notably, ester 20 could be formed in 77% yield from a dihalogenated substrate, illustrating the selectivity of this method for heavier halogens. Reactivity was still observed in the absence of strong electron-withdrawing resonance effects: bistrifluoromethyl derivative 21 was prepared in 66% yield. However, less electron-deficient systems displayed lower levels of reactivity as demonstrated by the formation of 22 in 15% yield. Moreover, no α-aryl ester product was formed from electrophiles bearing strong electron-donating groups such as 4-iodoanisole, but hydrodehalogenated product 23 was formed in 42% yield. This important result indicates that while the ACVA–formate initiator system is capable of reducing challenging electron-rich systems, the model SRN1 electron-transfer chain was not viable (potentially due to inefficient radical-anion coupling). Attention then turned towards our original target of heteroaryl halides. Pleasingly, pyridine, pyrazine and pyrimidine azaarenes, including the drug etoricoxib, with varying substitution patterns were all tolerated, furnishing α-aryl esters 24–35 in 26–63% yield. Finally, a variety of fused bicyclic heteroaryl halides, including quinolines, isoquinolines, quinoxalines, quinazolines, benzothiazoles, pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyridazines, were also compatible and substituted to form products 36–43 in 13–88% yield.

Next, in collaboration with the process chemistry group at AstraZeneca, we sought to determine if the developed method and initiator system were sufficiently scalable to allow widespread use in the pharmaceutical and related industries. Therefore, the safety of the model reaction system was examined, in particular the use of ACVA, DMSO and base at elevated temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry and fall-hammer testing of ACVA, and high-rate Carius tube testing of the reaction mixture, all confirmed that the reaction can be safely performed at 80 °C. The developed reaction was further optimized via high-throughput experimentation48 and time-course analysis, before being performed on a 50-g scale, which provided product 4 in 61% isolated yield and >95% purity following a simple precipitation and filtration process (Fig. 3b). This result was particularly pleasing considering the heterogeneous nature of the reaction mixture (common to many reactions using inorganic bases in organic solvents) because a lack of reaction homogeneity can complicate scale-up49. In addition, the clean reaction profile and lack of side products was notable as azo initiators are known to also react as electrophiles with strong nucleophiles50. Thus, the low-cost ACVA–formate initiator system appears highly amenable to large-scale applications (current prices: ACVA, £1.57 g−1; HCO2K, £0.11 g−1 (Sigma Aldrich)).

Inspired by these promising findings, we sought to test the limits of the developed method and initiator system by exploring their compatibility with complex (hetero)aryl drug-like intermediates through microscale parallel screening at AstraZeneca (Fig. 4) (see Supplementary Information for more details). We had confidence in the ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (uHPLC)/mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis because four substrates previously tested showed close agreement between isolated yields and uHPLC/MS area/area%. Pleasingly, 13 of the remaining 20 complex substrates, dense with Lewis basic-nitrogen functionality, afforded the desired products in synthetically useful yields under unoptimized conditions. To further validate these results, two of these ‘hits' (49 and 59) were performed on a preparative scale and isolated in comparable yield. These results demonstrate the broad synthetic utility of the developed initiator system and α-arylation methodology, which both appear ready for immediate application in industrial drug discovery programmes.

The deacetylation step with ammonium chloride was not performed to facilitate a workflow without additional solid handling. Yields shown are combined uHPLC/MS area/area% of acetylated and deacetylated products (if applicable) at 220 nm (identified by MS analysis). Screening yields are visually summarized in a heatmap-style graphic (higher yields are brighter in colour). Isolated yields at 0.3-mmol scale for validation are reported in parentheses. aAccurate reporting of the reaction outcome was hampered by poor resolution of the reaction components across multiple analytical methods.

Having sufficiently explored the scope with respect to the electrophile, the nucleophile scope was investigated using 1 as a model substrate (Fig. 5a). First, closely related methyl and tert-butyl acetoacetates 67 and 68 were reacted to afford the corresponding α-arylated esters 69 and 70 in 77% and 42% yield, respectively. The ester functionality was not essential for reactivity because acetylacetone 71 was also converted into 72 (following a modified deacetylation protocol). Amide 73 was also tolerated and selectively converted into dicarbonyl 74 in 50% yield. More sterically congested nucleophiles such as 75 could be used to form α-methyl ester 76 in 55% yield. This result was particularly pleasing considering the prevalence of the α-methyl carboxylic acid moiety in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as exemplified by the conversion of aryl bromide 77 into suprofen ethyl ester 78 in 42% yield. Cyclic ketone 79 was also successfully arylated to form 80 with a quaternary carbon centre in 27% yield. The ketone functionality was not essential for reactivity because ethyl cyanoacetate 81 was arylated to form 82 in 66% yield. In a similar fashion, malonates 83–85 were converted into 86–88 in 24–68% yield. Pleasingly, benzophenone glycine derivative 89 could also be used to form the corresponding N-protected unnatural α-aryl amino acid 90 in 43% yield. Finally, we examined non-anionic nucleophiles such as enamines using modified conditions based on the work of Gianetti and co-workers who arylated enamines under photoredox-catalysed conditions51. Here, the pyrrolidine-derived enamine of cyclohexanone 91 was formed in situ and arylated to afford 92 in 36% yield. This result supports the mechanistic hypothesis of Gianetti and co-workers who proposed that a chain mechanism was potentially operative alongside a photoredox catalytic cycle. In addition to applications in methodology development, the ACVA–formate initiator system may therefore be used as a general mechanistic tool to probe cases in which a radical chain mechanism is suspected.

To conclude our studies, we chose to demonstrate the utility of the developed ACVA–formate initiator system beyond C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond formation. First, simply by exchanging the nucleophile for a thiol, 4-iodobiphenyl 93 was converted into diaryl thioether 94 in 62% yield (Fig. 5b). This reaction presumably proceeds via an SRN1 mechanism as thiolates are known to be excellent SRN1 nucleophiles42,52. Next, by omitting any nucleophile and increasing the equivalents of ACVA and HCO2K, aryl bromide 95 was converted into hydrodehalogenated product 96 in 61% yield. The addition of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2) enabled aryl boronic ester 97 to be formed in 51% yield. In a similar fashion, phosphonate ester 98 was formed in 50% yield when using triethyl phosphite as a radical trap. These results illustrate that the developed initiator system can be broadly applied for reaction development.

We have developed a general, scalable and inexpensive method to initiate radical chains through one-electron reduction by reacting an azo initiator with a formate salt. The power of this initiation approach was demonstrated through the development of a general carbonyl α-(hetero)arylation protocol, which enabled challenging and valuable structural motifs to be formed under remarkably simple reaction conditions. The scalability of this initiation approach and carbonyl α-(hetero)arylation protocol was demonstrated on a 50-g scale in an industrial setting. Moreover, compatibility with a range of complex substrates was illustrated through microscale parallel screening. Finally, in addition to C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond formation, the wider synthetic potential of the developed initiation system was illustrated through the development of C(sp2)–S, C(sp2)–H, C(sp2)–B and C(sp2)–P coupling reactions. Considering the multidisciplinary importance of radical chain chemistry, we anticipate that this inexpensive initiation strategy will find widespread application in both industry and academia. We also speculate that alongside large-scale manufacturing opportunities, the disclosed initiator system may serve as a valuable mechanistic tool to probe the chain character of other radical reactions.

An 8-ml screw-cap vial was charged with ACVA (25.6 mg, 75 μmol, 0.25 equiv.), HCO2K (12.6 mg, 150 μmol, 0.50 equiv.), Cs2CO3 (440 mg, 1.35 mmol, 4.5 equiv.), and if solid, the aryl halide coupling partner (1.0 equiv.). To the solids was sequentially added a magnetic stirrer bar, anhydrous DMSO (1.5 ml), ethyl acetoacetate (156 mg, 1.20 mmol, 4.0 equiv.), and if liquid, the aryl halide coupling partner through the screw-cap septa. The reaction mixture was sparged with N2 for 15 min before being sealed with parafilm. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 80 °C in a metal heating block for 4 h. To promote complete deacetylation of intermediate 1,3-dicarbonyls, NH4Cl (80.3 mg, 1.50 mmol, 5.0 equiv.) was added. The reaction was then stirred at 50 °C in a metal heating block for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature before being diluted with CH2Cl2 (10 ml) and water (10 ml). The organic phase was collected, and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 ml). The organics were combined, washed with brine (25 ml), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was then purified by column chromatography to afford the α-arylated product.

Insertions of large DNA sequences into the genome are broadly enabling for research and therapeutic applications. Large serine recombinases (LSRs) can mediate direct, site-specific genomic integration of multi-kilobase DNA sequences without a pre-installed landing pad, albeit with low insertion rates and high off-target activity. Here we present an engineering roadmap for jointly optimizing their DNA recombination efficiency and specificity. We combine directed evolution, structural analysis and computational models to rapidly identify additive mutational combinations. We further enhance performance through donor DNA optimization and dCas9 fusions, enabling simultaneous target and donor recruitment. Our top engineered LSR variants, superDn29−dCas9, goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9, achieve up to 53% integration efficiency and 97% genome-wide specificity at an endogenous human locus and effectively integrate large DNA cargoes up to 12 kb for stable expression in non-dividing cells, stem cells and primary human T cells. Rational engineering of DNA recombinases enables precise and efficient single-step genome insertion for diverse applications across gene and cell therapies.

The ability to insert multi-kilobase DNA sequences efficiently and precisely into specified sites in the human genome in a single-step mechanism would advance both synthetic biology and gene therapy, enabling integration of gene circuits, large-scale pooled libraries and entire gene replacement rather than individual correction of diverse patient mutations1. However, previous approaches have been hampered by semi-random integration2, limited efficiency3,4,5,6, ceilings on donor template size7 or complex multi-component delivery8,9,10,11.

DNA recombinases are an emerging class of genome editing systems with important mechanistic advantages for achieving precise DNA insertions into the genome. The LSR enzyme family offers high recombination efficiency and site-specificity, operates independently from host DNA repair machinery and requires only two components: the recombinase and the donor DNA12. Natively, these enzymes facilitate mobile genetic element integration into bacterial genomes by recombining two double-stranded DNA attachment sites (attP and attB). During recombination, serine recombinases simultaneously cleave all four DNA strands, creating a covalent protein−DNA intermediate, followed by controlled strand exchange via subunit rotation and rejoining of the DNA ends13. They are readily adaptable to human cell engineering, integrating at either pre-installed landing pads or endogenous pseudosites (termed attH for the human genome) that closely resemble their native integration sequence12,14,15.

The broad application of LSRs is currently constrained by the prerequisite of DNA recognition sequences within the target genome. Pre-installing landing pads can be particularly challenging in primary cells or in vivo settings. Even when suitable pseudosites exist, ensuring high recombinase specificity remains difficult. Our previous screening of more than 60 diverse LSR orthologs in human cells revealed that many integrated into genomic pseudosites but often with low specificity, targeting hundreds of sites with varying efficiencies12. Attempts to engineer LSRs and other serine recombinase systems to target endogenous sequences through mutagenesis or DNA-binding-domain fusions have historically yielded inefficient or non-specific systems3,16,17,18,19,20. Engineering tyrosine recombinases to target endogenous sequences showed greater success, yet their inherent bidirectionality limits genome integration applications21,22,23. In the present study, we developed LSRs with high efficiency and high specificity for direct human genome integration without pre-engineered landing pads.

We reasoned that three key mechanistic limitations impeding efficient and specific endogenous integrations are genome recognition and binding, donor DNA binding and recombination efficiency (Fig. 1a). To address these challenges, we developed a framework to guide recombinase engineering, using the genome-targeting LSR Dn29 as a proof of concept. We combined four strategies—directed evolution, machine-learning-guided mutation stacking, dCas9 fusions and donor attachment site sequence optimization—to create recombinases that specifically integrate DNA cargo at a single endogenous locus in the human genome. Furthermore, we demonstrate integration in stem cells and primary T cells and show that the integration site maintains similar transgene expression to validated safe harbors, such as AAVS1, while reducing transcriptome perturbation.

a, Overview of engineering strategies to improve integrations into endogenous genomic sites. By improving genome recognition and binding, recombination efficiency and donor DNA binding, we aim to enhance recombination between a plasmid containing the recombinase attachment site attP and a genomic pseudosite, attH1, by maximizing on-target integrations and minimizing off-targets. b, Genome-wide specificity profile of WT Dn29. The green dot is the on-target site, attH1 (chr10:21,130,405). The yellow dots are off-target sites, ranked by their insertion efficiency. Data shown are the same as Fig. 2i. c, Schematic of Dn29 directed evolution scheme in E. coli. An evolution backbone, pEVO, expresses a library of Dn29 variants containing NNK codons across the coding sequence (CDS) and contains attP and attH1 sites. Active variants remove the NdeI site, allowing selective PCR recovery after digestion. The active recombinase library can be shuffled to generate higher-order combinations of beneficial mutations and re-cloned into pEVO for subsequent rounds of evolution. d, Schematic of mammalian cell validation of evolved LSR variants. Colonies from the active recombinase library are randomly selected and validated in HEK293FT cells. ddPCR at the on-target (attH1), a single-off target (attH3) and a genomic reference measures the efficiency (attH1/reference) and specificity (attH1/attH3). e, Efficiency and specificity of 247 LSR library members in HEK293FT cells, shown as fold change (FC) to WT.

Data presented are the same as shown in h. j, Efficiency of integration into a single off-target (attH3) of WT (n = 10 biological replicates), superDn29 (n = 2 biological replicates), goldDn29 (n = 5 biological replicates) and hifiDn29 (n = 3 biological replicates). k, Genome-wide specificity of on-target integration compared to all genomic insertions of WT (n = 3 biological replicates), superDn29 (n = 4 biological replicates), goldDn29 (n = 2 biological replicates) and hifiDn29 (n = 2 biological replicates).

We previously reported that LSRs catalyze DNA integration directly into endogenous genomic pseudosites12, with the number and identity varying across LSR orthologs based on the sequence similarity between their native attachment site (attB) and the targeted genome (Fig. 1a). In the present study, we sought to establish engineering principles for optimizing any LSR for site-specific genome integration, choosing the genome-targeting LSR Dn29 as a proof of concept owing to its favorable specificity and efficiency profile12. Dn29 integrates into the endogenous genome at 5% overall efficiency and directs 12% of insertions into a top site (termed attH1, located within an intron of NEBL), with three prominent off-targets (attH2, attH3 and attH4) each comprising 5−10% of total insertions and approximately 80 other low-frequency off-target sites (Fig. 1b).

Our framework involves three key steps: increasing on-target integration efficiency at attH1, reducing insertion frequency at prominent off-targets and minimizing the long tail of low-frequency off-target insertions. To measure our progress toward these goals, we developed three key metrics: ‘efficiency' as the percentage of attH1 sites that receive an insertion; ‘specificity' as the ratio of insertions into attH1 versus the prominent off-target attH3; and ‘genome-wide specificity' as the ratio of attH1 insertions relative to all on-target or off-target integration events (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a and Methods).

Because the protein−DNA recognition code of LSR enzymes for their DNA target site is unknown but unlikely to be modular like zinc finger or TALE proteins24, we reasoned that Dn29 would need modification via directed evolution to improve on-target integration into attH1. To increase Dn29 insertion efficiency at attH1 and disfavor integration into off-targets, we performed deep scanning mutagenesis of Dn29 at single-site saturation and tested the variant library in an intra-plasmid recombination reporter containing the attH1 and attP sites (Fig. 1c). Successful recombinants are positively selected by removing an intervening restriction enzyme site, whereas unproductive variants are eliminated via plasmid digestion23,25. To increase library complexity beyond single mutants, which may not be sufficient for modifying LSR target site preference, we performed DNA fragmentation and reassembly to shuffle successful mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1b)26.

After 12 evolution rounds and two DNA shuffles, we sequenced the output library with short-read and long-read sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1c−f). The resulting library contained a median of three amino acid changes per variant, with 72% of the pool carrying 2−6 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Additionally, the evolution process exhibited robust selection against non-functional variants, with mutation dropout rates increasing from 0.0035% in the input library to 44.9% in the output library (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). As expected, we saw strong retention of the catalytic serine and conserved zinc-coordinating cysteines27 and depletion of stop codons (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), and we observed that phylogenetic conservation negatively correlated with mutational tolerance (Pearsonʼs r = −0.3577, two-tailed P < 0.0001) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Compared to the input library, the output library was enriched for mutations in several hotspots, particularly in the C-terminal region (Supplementary Figs. 1e and 2). We observed higher mutational sensitivity in the N-terminal domain (NTD), consistent with its important functional roles in inter-subunit interactions, subunit rotation, catalysis and ligation28.

Next, we functionally evaluated variant library members in human cells from three directed evolution timepoints: after five cycles, after seven cycles plus one shuffle and after 12 cycles plus two shuffles (the final output library). We assessed the efficiency (insertion into attH1) and specificity (attH1/attH3 ratio) of each variant (Fig. 1d), observing a shift toward higher on-target efficiency between the first and second timepoints and more variants with improved specificity after the third (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Although our selection was based solely on integration efficiency, the emergence of specificity-enhanced variants suggests that some mutations improved target discrimination without compromising recombination activity.

Because most variants exhibited either enhanced efficiency or specificity, but not both, we hypothesized that combining mutations across these two classes would achieve both desired properties (Fig. 1e). First, we combined the four mutations from variant 62 (2.5-fold wild-type (WT) efficiency) and variant 93 (8.6-fold WT specificity) into variant 127, which demonstrated 13.4-fold specificity and 1.8-fold efficiency (Fig. 1f).

The ability to simultaneously improve LSR efficiency and specificity motivated systematic exploration of all mutations in our efficiency-enhanced and specificity-enhanced variants. We sought to identify the causal point mutations and remove passenger mutations, thereby enabling higher-order mutation stacking. Individual validation of each mutation in variant 62 identified E70G and A224P as the driving efficiency mutations (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The sole amino acid mutation in variant 93, N341K, was further investigated by substituting N341 with every amino acid (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Many substitutions increased activity, with N341Q improving efficiency 2.3-fold and positively charged residues robustly improving specificity (N341K: 6.7-fold, N341R: 5.3-fold).

We next assessed all point mutations from variants with at least 1.5-fold WT efficiency (n = 47 mutations) and two-fold WT specificity (n = 28 mutations) (Fig. 1g). We also included lysine mutations at putative DNA-interfacing residues, chosen based on alignment with the crystal structure of Listeria integrase C-terminal domain bound to attP (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4KIS)29, hypothesizing that positively charged mutations could modify DNA binding (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These mutations were individually installed into variant 127, identifying 12 additional efficiency and seven additional specificity driver mutations, each contributing 1.2-fold to 2.5-fold efficiency and 1.1-fold to 6.8-fold specificity improvements over variant 127 (Fig. 1g). A final round of mutation validation (Extended Data Fig. 2f) yielded a final list of 21 efficiency and 12 specificity driver mutations for further rational engineering (Supplementary Table 1).

We optimized Dn29 variants through sequential mutation layering, introducing single mutations into the best variant(s) from the previous round. We began with two lineages: an efficiency lineage containing 341Q and a specificity lineage containing 341K (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Double mutations showed mostly additive and subadditive effects, with rare antagonistic or synergistic epistasis (Extended Data Fig. 2h). This process yielded three key variants: superDn29 (10-fold efficiency and 70-fold specificity), goldDn29 (four-fold efficiency and 44-fold specificity) and hifiDn29 that combined goldDn29 with four additional specificity driver mutations to achieve WT efficiency with high specificity that approached the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) limit of detection (Fig. 1h−j and Supplementary Table 2). These variants demonstrated a substrate preference shift toward attH1 while maintaining or reducing activity at the native attB attachment site, indicating partial substrate reprogramming rather than expansion (Extended Data Fig. 2i). Finally, we conducted whole-genome insertion profiling using an unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based integration site assay that quantifies the relative frequency of on-target versus off-target integrations (Methods). This analysis confirmed the substantial improvement in genome-wide specificity, which increased from 12% on-target integration with WT Dn29 to 40−60% with the engineered variants (Fig. 1k). Overall, we identified specific mutations driving efficiency or specificity improvements, enabling rational engineering of optimized recombinases.

We demonstrated that LSR-directed evolution with efficiency and specificity classification enables iterative mutation combinations to generate LSRs with desired functional profiles. To expedite experimental testing higher mutational loads, we developed a computational model for predicting combinatorial variant activity from single mutant data. The variants were divided into distinct rounds, with the individual mutation validation in round 1 (Fig. 1g) and the iterative mutation stacking experiments comprising rounds 2−5. We trained two linear models (linear regression and ridge regression) and two gradient boosting models (XGBoost and CatBoost)30,31 on one-hot encoded variant sequences from round 1 and then tested these models on rounds 2−5 (Fig. 2a).

CC, coiled-coil motif; RD, recombinase domain; ZD, zinc-ribbon domain.

We evaluated model performance using root mean squared error (RMSE), Spearman's rank correlation and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). NDCG was prioritized as the key evaluation metric because it emphasizes higher-activity mutants, matching our experimental validation priorities. Although all models performed well, ridge regression excelled for both efficiency and specificity, showing high accuracy (NDCG = 0.970 for efficiency, 0.971 for specificity) in predicting higher-order mutant activities (Fig. 2b−d). The performance of linear models in extrapolating single mutant activity to higher-order mutants supports our previous observations that LSR mutations are largely additive (Extended Data Fig. 2h) and aligns with previous research showing that regularized linear models perform well across mutagenesis datasets of 14 different enzymes32.

To identify key mutations, we examined regression coefficients, revealing strong concordance between computationally and experimentally identified impactful mutations (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). The model coefficients strongly correlated with experimental fold changes (efficiency: ρ = 0.623, two-tailed P = 0.0025; specificity: ρ = 0.930, two-tailed P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), demonstrating that the interpretability of linear models enables the automated identification of impactful mutations.

We outline an approach for applying regression models to predict efficiency and specificity of higher-order mutants (Fig. 2f). From individual mutations measured for specificity and efficiency by ddPCR, we generated ridge regression models, examined their coefficients to quantify the impact of key mutations and predicted activity of higher-order mutants, enabling prioritization of mutants for experimental testing. To demonstrate this approach, we predicted the activities of all double mutants added to superDn29, skipping round 6 to directly test round 7 of iteration. We tested the top 10 efficiency and top three specificity variants, finding that eight of 10 efficiency variants and three of three specificity variants performed better than superDn29 (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 3e−g). Although the three key variants (superDn29, goldDn29 and hifiDn29) that we experimentally identified served as the primary variants for subsequent characterization studies, these model-guided variants demonstrate the potential for further optimization and represent valuable targets for future investigation. Overall, we demonstrate that model-guided recombinase design across multiple activity axes can further push efficiency and specificity beyond spaces easily reachable by traditional directed evolution.

To gain mechanistic insights from our mutational landscape, we generated an AlphaFold3 structural model of Dn29 bound to the attB-R DNA half-site (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 4a)33, which showed high alignment (zinc-ribbon domain RMSD = 1.341, recombinase domain RMSD = 1.707) to the Listeria integrase C-terminal domain bound to attP (PDB: 4KIS)29 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We identified an efficiency mutation hotspot (residues 373−393 and 449) in the coiled-coil motif hinge region, with four of the eight activating mutations converting to proline residues (L388P, Q390P, L393P and L449P), suggesting that destabilization of the helical secondary structure in this region enhances activity, potentially by modifying tetramer stabilization or autoinhibitory control (Extended Data Fig. 4c)34. Despite previous work on a different ortholog that identified mutations in this region as enabling the excision reaction35, our key variants maintained unidirectionality (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Another key efficiency mutation (D503N) reduces negative charge in a tri-aspartic acid stretch (503−505), likely enhancing DNA phosphate backbone interactions (Extended Data Fig. 4e).

Many specificity driver mutations localize near the DNA-binding interface, often replacing neutral amino acids with positively charged ones, potentially strengthening DNA interactions (Extended Data Fig. 4f). This combined computational and structural analysis provides a multifaceted understanding of how specific mutations impact LSR function, informing rational engineering to enhance LSR performance.

We reasoned that the LSR protein and target DNA interaction could be further enhanced by developing LSR−dCas9 fusions that facilitate LSR recruitment to the genomic target site, as demonstrated in other recombinase systems3,4,6,19,22. We first optimized the fusion design, observing that an N-terminal dCas9 fusion abolished Dn29 activity, likely due to steric hindrance of tetramerization as the N terminus is located at the tetrameric complex core29,36. By contrast, C-terminal fusions supported robust recombination and were used for further experiments (Fig. 3a).

We next evaluated the impact of dCas9-mediated genomic recruitment using single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting regions near attH1 or attH3 (Fig. 3b,c). This single-guide approach increased integration efficiency 2.7-fold at attH1 and six-fold at attH3 compared to non-targeting guides (NTGs) (Fig. 3d,e). We further improved efficiency by optimizing the ratio of donor, effector and guide components (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and confirmed the importance of direct tethering of Dn29 to the genomic target site, as linker replacement with a P2A peptide to induce ribosomal skipping abolished the effect37,38 (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Interestingly, we could manipulate the natural integration preference of Dn29 using dCas9 recruitment. Although WT Dn29 naturally integrates into attH1 with two-fold frequency over attH3, dCas9-based recruitment to attH1 amplified this preference to 14-fold. Conversely, attH3-targeting sgRNAs reversed this bias, resulting in 11-fold higher integration at attH3 compared to attH1 (Fig. 3f). Combining dCas9 fusions with our optimized Dn29 variants further improved on-target efficiency. SuperDn29−dCas9 achieved 50.8% integration at attH1, whereas goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9 reached 44.5% and 39.1%, respectively, representing up to an 11.8-fold efficiency increase (Fig. 3g).

Next, we tested if dCas9 fusions enhanced specificity by biasing insertion toward the desired pseudosite. Whole-genome insertion profiling showed that on-target integrations improved from 12% with WT Dn29 to more than 60% with Dn29−dCas9 targeted to attH1, although rare off-target sites persisted. SuperDn29−dCas9 maintained a similar insertion profile but moderately increased rare off-targets due to higher overall activity. Notably, goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9 achieved 91% and 97% genome-wide specificity to attH1, with significantly fewer off-target loci (average 35 and 12 sites, respectively) (Fig. 3h,i and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). For Dn29−dCas9, 20−35% of off-target sites were shared between replicates, decreasing to 6−12% for superDn29−dCas9 and to 0% for goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9 (Supplementary Fig. 5a−d and Supplementary Table 3). Off-target site concordance across variants was low, with only 15 sites appearing in more than one sample (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Furthermore, these off-target sites did not overlap with predicted guide RNA off-target sites, indicating that they are not dCas9 mediated (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Taken together, these results suggest that specificity engineering has effectively eliminated reproducible off-target activity, with the low reproducibility potentially reflecting both rare genuine events and technical artifacts previously reported for this off-target detection method39.

We assessed the generalizability of our fusion approach across three additional LSR orthologs (the genome-targeting LSRs Pf80 and Nm60 and the landing pad LSR Si74), demonstrating up to 10-fold improved efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 5c−i). To elucidate optimal sgRNA design parameters, we analyzed integration efficiencies across all fusion variants and orthologs and determined optimal sgRNA placement to be approximately 40 bp from the attachment site core, agnostic of guide orientation (Extended Data Fig. 5j).

We next explored three orthogonal strategies to further improve efficiency—using dCas9 variants with alternative PAM recognition40, multiplexing sgRNAs and incorporating sgRNA binding sites on donor plasmids. dCas9 variants with increased PAM flexibility can expand pseudosite-proximal guide options. Using dCas9−HF1−SpG (NGN PAM), we achieved 22% insertion efficiency at the best NGH guide compared to 15% with the best NGG guide (Extended Data Fig. 5k−m). Multiplexed sgRNAs targeting upstream and downstream of the attachment site could further improve genome search and binding (Fig. 3j). At the attH3 site, the H3-g3 and H3-g7 combination achieved 13% integration versus 6.6% and 5.6% efficiencies individually (Fig. 3k). Finally, we tested the ability of an sgRNA-binding sequence on the donor plasmid to facilitate donor recruitment, across four orientations flanking the minimal attP site (top and bottom strand, upstream and downstream) (Fig. 3l). All four configurations improved integration efficiency for Dn29−dCas9, reaching up to 40% integration compared to 23% with the WT donor (Fig. 3m). Similarly, incorporating the Nm60-g1 sequence on the donor plasmid improved Nm60 attH2 integration from 61% to 73% (Extended Data Fig. 5n).

Our results show that LSR−dCas9 fusions can substantially enhance both efficiency and specificity of cargo DNA insertion by improving LSR recruitment to target and donor DNA. The positive correlation between efficiency and specificity (Extended Data Fig. 5o) suggests that optimizing and multiplexing guide RNAs are crucial for maximizing both parameters simultaneously. This approach, combined with engineered LSR variants and dual-targeting guides, achieves up to 97% specificity or over 73% efficiency at a single genomic locus.

Beyond dCas9 fusions, we explored enhancing donor DNA recruitment by optimizing the attP sequence. We created two Dn29 attP donor plasmid libraries, each with one constant half-site and the other mutated using custom mixed base oligos for an average of approximately 5.5 mutations per 26-bp half-site (Methods). Transfecting these libraries into cells expressing WT Dn29−dCas9 and H1-g3 guide, we sequenced attH1 integrants and calculated nucleotide enrichment scores (Fig. 4a−c). Although the WT nucleotide was generally preferred, we identified six positions where non-WT nucleotides showed moderately higher enrichment. Combining all six substitutions into an optimized e-attP sequence improved integration efficiency by 1.3-fold (Fig. 4d). Applying this strategy to Nm60 with Nm60−dCas9 and Nm60-g2, we identified an e-attP with seven mutations that improved efficiency by 1.1-fold (Fig. 4e,f).

Our library enrichment approach provides a high-resolution view of DNA specificity and recombination efficiency determinants. For both Dn29 and Nm60, native attachment sites appear highly evolutionarily optimized, with only a few positions showing incremental efficiency improvements through mutation.

We identified core-distal regions of outsized importance for functional recombination: positions 16−23 and 16'−23' for Dn29 (Fig. 4C) and 13−23 and 13'−23' for Nm60 (Fig. 4e). These findings are consistent with previous reports on other LSR orthologs that show stronger zinc-ribbon domain binding requirements and more relaxed sequence specificity in the recombinase domain41,42. Dn29's position 17/17' showed particularly high enrichment, strongly preferring A and T, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of depleted nucleotides reveals selection against attB-like sequences, particularly A/T at position 12/12' for Dn29 and A/T at position 14/14' for Nm60, which correspond to critical attB nucleotides (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b)12. This depletion suggests evolutionary pressure to maintain discrimination between attB and attP sites via previously described ‘discriminator bases'41. By analyzing dinucleotide normalized to single-nucleotide abundance, we identified preferential RY dinucleotides at positions 17/18 and YR dinucleotides at positions 22/23, suggesting that DNA flexibility as well as sequence contributes to protein recognition of the attachment site43,44,45,46 (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

Given the numerous DNA-binding domain mutations in our variants, we applied this approach to identify optimal attP substrates for each recombinase. The engineered variants preferred attP sequences with 7−9 mutations relative to WT Dn29 e-attP, predominantly favoring guanine/cytosine bases (Supplementary Fig. 7a−c). This G/C bias likely reflects enhanced lysine−guanine interactions resulting from the numerous specificity-enhancing lysine residues incorporated into the DNA-binding regions during protein engineering47. Although variant-specific e-attPs demonstrated modest improvement over the WT e-attP sequence (Supplementary Fig. 7d), we used the WT e-attP for all subsequent studies to maintain a standardized donor template across all variants.

Although LSR attachment sites are canonically imperfect inverted repeats, the importance of this asymmetry remains unclear42. Our data reveal that the most strongly enriched nucleotides are symmetrical across the core, aligning with previous Bxb1 studies48,49. However, for Dn29 and Nm60, we observed five and eight nucleotides with subtle preferences for asymmetric nucleotides at corresponding half-site positions. This suggests that slight attachment site asymmetry may be a deliberate feature of the recombination mechanism rather than a consequence of mutations or phage genome sequence constraints. Overall, this attachment site exploration deepens our understanding of LSR target site recognition and advances our ability to design optimal DNA donors.

Next, we aimed to create optimal LSR tools for large DNA cargo integration by combining our orthogonal engineering efforts. Armed with directed evolution variants, dCas9 fusions with sgRNA design rules and optimized donor DNA substrates, we assessed combining these features into a single system (Fig. 5a,b). Overall, our combined engineering strategies substantially improved recombination efficiency: the variants fused to dCas9 with the optimized donor achieved 41−53% efficiency, a 9.6-fold to 12.3-fold improvement over the WT enzyme (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 4).

Dots and error bars represent the mean ± s.d. of samples with n ≥ 3 biological replicates. d, Specificity analysis of edited HEK293FT single-cell clones engineered with Dn29 and hifiDn29, with and without dCas9 fusions. Number (n) of clones analyzed per sample is indicated on the x axis.

Using hifiDn29−dCas9, our most specific configuration, we measured 97% genome-wide specificity by bulk integration site sequencing (Fig. 5c). To better understand the single-cell variation of insertional mutagenesis, including on-target/off-target co-occurrence and integration copy number, we mapped integrations in approximately 50 clonal HEK293FT populations edited with hifiDn29 or WT Dn29, with and without dCas9 fusions (Fig. 5d). dCas9 fusion dramatically improved performance for both Dn29 and hifiDn29, resulting in over 95% of clones containing on-target edits. However, the most striking difference was observed in off-target insertions: 91% of Dn29 clones contained off-target insertions compared to 46% of hifiDn29 clones. Ultimately, with dCas9 fused to hifiDn29, off-target insertions were reduced to only 9% of clones compared to 52% for Dn29–dCas9. These single-cell specificity measurements closely mirrored the bulk genome-wide specificity results (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Beyond targeting accuracy, measuring the number of integrations per cell is crucial for fully understanding editing outcomes. Because dCas9 increases efficiency, it also increases the rate of multiple on-target insertions. HifiDn29 showed the highest rate of single on-target insertion events, with half of the clones exhibiting this genotype. By contrast, dCas9 fusions decreased single on-target insertion events to 38% and increased the rate of multiple on-target insertions from 4% to 53% of clones (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Due to the pseudo-triploid genome and copy number variation/instability of HEK293FT cells50, on-target insertions ranged from zero to five per cell, with a median of two for both hifiDn29−dCas9 and Dn29−dCas9 clones (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Overall, these single-cell results demonstrate the enhanced precision and efficiency of hifiDn29−dCas9, nominate hifiDn29 for generating clonal cell lines containing single on-target integrations and highlight the value of single-cell analysis in evaluating gene editing outcome heterogeneity.

Genome editing can pose safety risks through unintended outcomes, including insertion and deletion (indel) formation, cytotoxicity and genomic rearrangements. Because the recombinase mechanism involves coordinated cleavage of all four DNA strands, abortive recombination could potentially lead to double-stranded break (DSB) formation, causing indels at the attachment sites51,52,53. We identified rare but significant indels at attH1 (0.01−1.4%), with indel frequency correlating with recombination efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 6d). This trend parallels observations in small serine recombinase systems, where activating mutations that increase synapse formation also demonstrate higher rates of DSB generation54. As a proxy for genome-wide DSB formation or DNA damage response (DDR) activation, we employed phosphorylated-H2AX (γ-H2AX) staining and flow cytometry. Dn29 and superDn29 showed low but significant γ-H2AX, whereas specificity-enhanced variants (goldDn29 and hifiDn29) reduced damage to background levels (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Notably, these variants also generated less γ-H2AX than Bxb1, previously reported as the highest-fidelity recombinase51 and commonly used in attachment site prime editing approaches such as PASTE and PASSIGE8,10,39. Interestingly, delivering catalytically dead LSR also produced γ-H2AX, suggesting that non-catalytic mechanisms such as DNA binding may damage DNA (Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 5).

Cytotoxicity can arise from multiple mechanisms, including off-target effects, DDR activation, immune activation, protein burden and genomic instability. Cell viability assays revealed no significant toxicity in HEK293FT cells when transfecting LSR variants and donor plasmid (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Measuring genome-wide junctions with attH1 by NGS, we detected genomic rearrangements ranging between 0% and 2% within chromosome 10 and 0−0.3% inter-chromosomal translocations (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). Most junctions occurred within 50 kb of attH1, potentially reflecting a preference for recombining with nearby sequences or resulting from DSB-induced large deletions (Extended Data Fig. 6i). Overall, our comprehensive safety assessment demonstrates that Dn29-mediated editing, particularly with our specificity-enhanced variants, offers a favorable safety profile with minimal cytotoxicity, rare genomic rearrangements and reduced DNA damage compared to existing recombinases, positioning this system as a promising option for precise genomic integration.

Next, we sought to benchmark our engineered LSRs in a diverse set of genome insertion tasks across various cell types. LSRs offer an advantage in genome engineering applications, including robust insertion efficiency in non-dividing cells10. We treated HEK293FT cells with aphidicolin to induce cell cycle arrest and observed that Dn29 and key variants showed largely equivalent integration rates to untreated cells. dCas9 fusions had decreased integration efficiency by 35−50%, but still achieved up to 30% integration (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

We then tested DNA cargo installation in H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and observed that on-target integration efficiency with engineered recombinases increased up to six-fold relative to WT Dn29, from 4.1% to 24.5% (Fig. 6a). These improvements are 25−50% of HEK293FT integration efficiencies, likely due to the 50−80% reduction in plasmid transfection efficiency in stem cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Insertion specificity also significantly improved, as off-target integration at attH3 for the engineered variants approached the ddPCR detection limit (Extended Data Fig. 7c).

Bars and error bars represent the mean ± s.d. of samples with n ≥ 3 biological replicates (each an average of two technical replicates), with each originating from a different blood donor.

To evaluate larger cargo installation and enable functional genomics applications, we designed a 12-kb CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) construct encoding the ZIM3−dCas9 fusion and multiple regulatory elements and marker genes, including blue fluorescent protein (BFP), neomycin resistance marker, Woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE). We achieved robust insertion efficiencies up to 13% and verified transgene expression after selection in both bulk and clonal lines (Fig. 6b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7d). Genotyping of goldDn29−dCas9-edited clones revealed that 95% of clones possessed precise heterozygous attH1 insertions, with only one homozygous clone and one clone showing both on-target and off-target integrations (Fig. 6d). These results underscore the high clonal consistency achieved, demonstrating a predominance of accurate, single-copy integrations and strong maintenance of cargo gene expression in H1 stem cells.

To assess CRISPRi functionality and safety across different genomic loci and editing tools, we compared knockdown efficiency and transcriptome perturbations in H1 hESCs and WTC-11 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We tested cells edited at attH1 using either hifiDn29−dCas9 or Cas9 with homology-directed repair (HDR) and at established safe harbors AAVS1 and CLYBL using Cas9 HDR55,56,57,58. CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of target genes demonstrated similar and robust efficiency across all loci (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that hifiDn29−dCas9 produced the fewest differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to Cas9 editing at all loci in both cell types (Fig. 6f and Extended Data Fig. 8a). The DEGs in hifiDn29−dCas9 samples demonstrated the strongest safety profile, with no disruption of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes or essential genes (Extended Data Fig. 8b−d). Critically, NEBL expression showed no significant change across all edited cell lines, confirming that attH1 integration does not disrupt the endogenous locus (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Transgene silencing is a persistent challenge in stem cell engineering, likely due to extensive chromatin restructuring that occurs during differentiation59. To assess whether attH1 supports stable cargo expression during differentiation, we differentiated the CRISPRi-edited hESCs into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) under neomycin selection. After differentiation, edited HPCs maintained robust cargo expression (approximately 70% BFP+) with approximately 80% of cells expressing canonical HPC markers, such as CD34 and CD43 (Extended Data Fig. 7f−h). Next, we transduced sgRNAs targeting CD63, CD81 and CD147 into the edited HPCs and observed 82−96% knockdown of these cell surface markers compared to a non-targeting control, with knockdown rates similar to AAVS1 and CLYBL sites (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Taken together, we demonstrate that engineered recombinases efficiently produce bulk hESC lines with near-clonal genotypes, minimal transcriptomic perturbation and stable large cargo expression throughout hESC-to-HPC differentiation, making them suitable for generating stable cell lines for CRISPR screens or potentially introducing therapeutic genetic cargoes.

Site-specific transgene insertions show great promise in immune cell engineering, enabling integration of functional cargos such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and additional immune regulators for therapeutic applications. Although primary T cells can be sensitive to high doses of nucleic acid delivery (Extended Data Fig. 9a), we developed multiple effective strategies for LSR-mediated integration. We first explored viral delivery strategies, electroporating T cells with effector mRNA and synthesized sgRNAs and delivering donor templates via single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) or self-complementary AAV (scAAV) (Fig. 6g and Extended Data Fig. 9b−d). LSR−dCas9 fusions achieved up to 17% AAV integration efficiency, which maintained high cell viability even at the highest doses. The scAAV donor yielded 2.3-fold to 3.3-fold higher integration rates compared to the ssAAV donor, likely due to double-stranded DNA requirements for LSR-mediated integration. Sequencing confirmed that more than 98% of integrations were genuine LSR-mediated events rather than non-specific AAV capture (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Because LSR-mediated integration of linear AAV genomes creates DSBs requiring cellular repair mechanisms to rejoin the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) ends, future applications could benefit from circular AAV donor templates to eliminate this repair requirement60.

To expand cargo capacity beyond AAV genomes and circumvent DSB repair requirements, we optimized the electroporation protocol for efficient plasmid integration (up to 14.8%) while balancing reductions in cell viability across variants (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g and Methods). These findings suggest that in more sensitive cell types, the most active recombinases (superDn29) may exhibit increased toxicity, whereas the dCas9-fused recombinases showed minimal toxicity. We integrated a 5.8-kb plasmid expressing a CD19-targeted CAR into primary T cells at up to 11% efficiency, which demonstrated robust cytotoxicity against Nalm6 cells in an in vitro cancer target cell-killing assay (Fig. 6h,i and Extended Data Fig. 9h,i). This delivery format versatility provides flexibility for different applications and manufacturing contexts, strongly supporting further development of this approach for engineering primary T cells for therapeutic applications.

Finally, we investigated the cross-reactivity of our engineered LSRs across model organisms, including mice and various non-human primates. An attH1-like sequence is present in the NEBL intron in marmosets, rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys, with 1−2 point mutations compared to attH1, and is located intergenically in the mouse X chromosome with six point mutations. Dn29 and goldDn29 could robustly recombine attP with the model organism pseudosites in a plasmid recombination assay in HEK293FT cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j−l), enabling future advancement in preclinical animal studies that bridge the gap between laboratory research and human clinical trials.

In this study, we combine directed evolution, protein engineering and machine learning models to engineer DNA recombinases to efficiently and specifically insert large genetic cargos directly into the human genome, overcoming the need to pre-install attachment site landing pads. As a proof of concept, we integrated into a single genomic locus using optimized Dn29 LSRs, achieving 13-fold to 17-fold improvements in insertion efficiency. Combining mutants with dCas9 fusions and optimized donor sequences (e-attP and sgRNA target sites) yielded recombinases with 40−53% efficiency and 90−97% genome-wide specificity for an endogenous locus.

Our engineering efforts provide numerous mechanistic insights into LSR function during genome integration. Notably, our dCas9 fusion experiments demonstrate that improved genome search and DNA binding are crucial areas for increased integration efficiency. To further interrogate DNA binding, we employed structural modeling and attachment site screening to identify specific protein and DNA regions critical for target recognition. Directed evolution revealed a general tradeoff between efficiency-improving and specificity-improving mutations for Dn29, which we overcame by strategically pairing mutations across distinct LSR domains and increasing the protein−DNA interface through fusions with DNA-binding proteins.

Our current system incorporates CRISPR components, which include both protein (dCas9) and RNA (sgRNA) elements. Although this design improves efficiency by seven-fold and specificity by five-fold, it also increases the overall size of the system and introduces an additional RNA component, which increases the manufacturing and formulation complexity. In future iterations, these CRISPR components could be replaced with smaller, protein-only DNA-binding domains, such as zinc fingers22. Such modifications would preserve the delivery advantages of these compact recombinases and maintain a streamlined system of a single protein and single DNA donor.

Further studies of LSR safety should be conducted to advance the translational potential of these tools. Many off-target sites exhibit minimal sequence similarity to the target site, complicating off-target locus prediction. Our most highly active variant (superDn29) also exhibited higher rates of indels or chromosomal rearrangements, and lower T cell viability, than the more balanced goldDn29. LSR−dCas9 fusions also exhibited reduced efficiency in cell-cycle-arrested cells, suggesting the need for further studies to understand potential cell cycle dependence or improve the nuclear delivery of larger fusion constructs. Finally, improved methods for off-target prediction, detection and validation will be needed to assess and overcome these challenges.

During the preparation of this paper, independent efforts to engineer the Bxb1 LSR were reported39,61,62,63. These studies focused on improving Bxb1 targeting of its natural attB site to enhance integration rates into landing pads or retarget Bxb1 to endogenous sites. However, these approaches require pre-installation of the landing pad or concurrent delivery of multiple Bxb1 variants, increasing delivery complexity and increasing the space of potential off-target sites. By contrast, our study presents multiple orthogonal engineering strategies to enhance the ability of an LSR to recognize and integrate at endogenous genomic sequences. We further demonstrate the generalizability of these approaches beyond Dn29 to Nm60, improving on-target genomic insertion efficiency to 73%.

These advancements have use across diverse research and therapeutic applications of LSRs. Current research uses lentiviral engineering of cell lines and single-copy installation of pooled libraries, which can lead to unpredictable effects on gene expression, potential insertional mutagenesis and silencing of transgenes64. Our engineered recombinases overcome these limitations by targeting a defined integration locus at high efficiencies, which are essential for large-scale and uniform functional genomics studies. In hESCs, we demonstrate that 95% of cells have single-copy, on-target insertions, enabling the generation of homogenous bulk cell populations without single-clone selection. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated the use of LSRs for virus-free library screening in landing pad cell lines12. We extend this capability, showing the feasibility of integrating RNA or protein libraries directly into an endogenous human genomic locus. In hESCs, these integrations occur at copy numbers similar to low multiplicity of infection (MOI) lentivirus (MOI = 0.1), well within the standard guidelines for approximating one integrant per cell65.

In the therapeutic space, this approach offers advantages over prevailing CRISPR-based gene therapies, which require a guide RNA to target a distinct disease-causing mutation. By contrast, multi-kilobase insertions enable replacement of entire corrective open reading frames, providing a ‘one-size-fits-all' approach for correcting genetic diseases with mutational heterogeneity across patient populations. Additionally, these corrective transgenes can include critical non-coding regulatory elements for enhanced control of gene expression. Furthermore, Dn29 can cross-reactively integrate into attH1-like sequences in diverse model organisms, an important consideration for future Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies.

The strategies outlined in this work can be adapted to target diverse genomic loci beyond Dn29 attH1. To target a different locus, such as validated genomic safe harbors such as AAVS1 or therapeutic targets such as TRAC, LSRs can be mined from the thousands of naturally occurring orthologs to find a recombinase with a closer match to the desired target sequence. These candidate LSRs can then be subjected to our joint optimization approach, combining directed evolution, machine learning predictions and DNA-binding protein fusions to enhance both efficiency and specificity.

Our research complies with relevant ethical regulations. Experiments using hESC lines were performed under an allowance granted by the Arc Institute Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee.

Experiments were conducted in HEK293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R70007, female), H1 hESCs (WiCell Research Institute, male), WTC-11 iPSCs (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, GM25256, male) and primary human T cells (STEMCELL Technologies, 200-0092) from deidentified healthy donors. HEK293FT cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1× penicillin−streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dissociated using TrypLE Express (Gibco). H1 hESCs and WTC-11 iPSCs were maintained in mTeSR Plus (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cultured on Cultrex (Bio-Techne) or Matrigel (Corning) coated plates. For routine passaging, hESCs and iPSCs were dissociated with ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies). For 96-well plating prior to transfections, single-cell dissociation was performed using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies). hESCs and iPSCs were supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor for 24 hours after dissociation. Primary human T cells were cultured in complete X-VIVO 15 (cXVIVO 15) (Lonza Bioscience, 04-418Q), which consists of 5% FCS (R&D Systems, M19187), 5 ng μl−1 IL-7 and 5 ng μl−1 IL-15. For the cell cycle arrest experiment, HEK293FT cells were treated with 5 μM aphidicolin at the time of transfection. HEK293FT, WTC-11 and H1 cells tested negative for mycoplasma, tested monthly.

An NNK deep mutational scanning library of the entire Dn29 coding sequence (CDS) was generated using NNK oligos and overlap extension PCRs. First, forward and reverse oligos with NNK mixed bases at each codon were designed with a melting temperature of 65 °C. Each NNK forward primer was paired with Dn29 DMS_universal_reverse that binds downstream of the CDS and each NNK reverse primer with DMS_universal_forward primer, generating amplicons flanking the mutated codon. PCR reactions contained 2.5 µl of Q5 Master Mix (New England Biolabs (NEB)), 0.01 µl of Dn29 plasmid template (100 ng µl−1), 0.025 µl of universal primer (100 µM), 1.465 µl of water and 1 µl of unique NNK primer (2.5 µM). Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 30 seconds and 72 °C for 1 minute; final extension of 72 °C for 2 minutes.

Upstream and downstream amplicons (2.5 µl each) were pooled and cleaned with 2 µl of ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.5 µl of DpnI (NEB), incubating at 37 °C for 30 minutes and then at 80 °C for 15 minutes. For the overlap extension PCR, 1 µl of cleaned PCR pool was mixed with 2.5 µl of Q5 2× Master Mix, 0.025 µl of each universal primer (100 µM) and 1.45 µl of water, using the same cycling conditions.

The full mutant pool was created by combining 2.5 µl of each overlap extension PCR. The full-length Dn29 fragment was gel extracted (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit; NEB). The library and pEVO backbone were digested with XbaI and HindIII-HF (NEB). Ligation used 100 ng of total DNA (3:1 molar ratio of library to backbone), 2 µl of T4 ligase (NEB), 4 µl of 10× T4 ligase buffer (NEB) and water to 40 µl. The reaction was split into two 20-µl reactions, ligated for 30 minutes at room temperature, inactivated at 65 °C for 10 minutes and purified (Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit; Zymo Research).

The ligation product was electroporated into XL-1 Blue cells (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions, recovered for 1 hour at 37 °C in 1 ml of SOC medium and plated onto four 245-mm × 245-mm BioAssay dishes. Approximately 1 million colonies were obtained. Plasmids were purified using a NucleoBond Xtra Midi EF Kit (Macherey Nagel) and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 2000 600-cycle P1 Kit (Supplementary Fig. 1c) using the NextSeq 1000/2000 Control Software Suite version 1.7.1.

For library transformation, induction and growth: 4 µl of pEVO plasmid library was electroporated into 50 µl of XL-1 Blue competent cells (Agilent Technologies), recovered in 1 ml of SOC medium (37 °C, 1 hour) and then seeded into 100 ml of LB medium with carbenicillin and L-arabinose (10 µg ml−1 or 0 µg ml−1). Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C. Library coverage (>1 million colonies) was confirmed by plating serial dilutions. Plasmids were extracted using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (0.3 g of wet bacteria pellet per column).

Selection of active variants: 500 ng of plasmid was digested with NdeI (NEB) to eliminate inactive variants. Active variants were amplified using 25 µl of 2× Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 19 µl of water, 2 µl each of SLiDE_recovery_forward and SLiDE_recovery_reverse primers (10 µM) and 2 µl of NdeI-digested material. PCR conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 52 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 55 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The correct size band was gel extracted (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit).

Cloning for next evolution cycle: Amplified active variants and pEVO backbone were digested with XbaI and HindIII-HF (NEB) at 37 °C for 30 minutes and then heat inactivated at 80 °C for 20 minutes. Digested variants were purified using DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research) and backbone with DNA Clean and Concentrator-25 (Zymo Research). Five ligation reactions (20 µl each) were set up using 100 ng of DNA (3:1 ratio of library to backbone) and T4 ligase (NEB). Ligation occurred at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 10 minutes. Pooled reactions were purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit), eluted in 6 µl of water and electroporated into XL-1 Blue cells to start the next evolution cycle.

Shuffling the active variants between rounds of cycling involved a uridine exchange PCR to partially exchange thymidines for uridine, USER Enzyme fragmentation at uridine sites, primerless PCR fragment reassembly and PCR for full-length gene recovery.

Uridine exchange PCR: Fragment size and yield was optimized by modifying dUTP/dTTP ratio, with the optimal ratio being 3/7. PCR mixture: 5 µl of 10× Thermopol Buffer, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 µl each of SLiDE_recovery_forward and SLiDE_recovery_reverse primers (10 µM), 1 µl of plasmid library, 1 µl of Taq Polymerase and 40 µl of water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 seconds; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 20 seconds, 60 °C for 30 seconds, 68 °C for 1 minute per kilobase; final extension at 68 °C for 5 minutes. Full-length gene band was gel extracted (Monarch Gel Extraction Kit).

USER Enzyme digestion: 500-ng aliquots were digested with 2 µl of USER Enzyme (NEB) at 37 °C for 3 hours. Gel electrophoresis confirmed fragment distribution (100−1,000 bp).

Fragment reassembly: Fragments were purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5) and reassembled in a primerless PCR reaction using the following conditions: 25 µl of purified fragments and 25 µl of 2× Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB). Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 30−50 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 30 °C for 30 seconds (+1 °C per cycle), 72 °C for 1 minute (+4 seconds per cycle); final extension at 72 °C for 10 minutes. A final PCR was performed to recover only the full-length Dn29 CDS for further rounds of directed evolution. The following conditions were used for full-length gene recovery: PCR mixture: 25 µl of Platinum SuperFi II 2× Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 µl of reassembled fragments, 2 µl each of DMS_universal_forward and DMS_universal_reverse primers (10 µM) and 11 µl of water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 55 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes.

The gel-extracted, shuffled and reassembled genes were cloned into the plasmid backbone using XbaI and HindIII digest and T4 ligation as previously described.

Six primer sets (DMS_NGS primers; Supplementary Table 8) were designed to amplify approximately 260-bp segments of the Dn29 CDS with Illumina adapter overhangs. Two rounds of PCR were performed to add P5/P7 adapters and i5/i7 indexes (FLAP2 primers). Amplicons were cleaned with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) between PCR rounds and after the final PCR. Amplicons were pooled in equimolar ratios, quantified using Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 (600-cycle kit). Full overlap between read 1 and read 2 was ensured for higher confidence in mutation calling.

Paired-end reads were merged using BBMerge (version 39.06) and analyzed with a custom Python script. The script converted Phred quality scores to error probabilities using the formula \(P=1{0}^{(Q/-10)}\), where P is the probability of error and Q is the Phred quality score. Reads with a summed error probability greater than 0.5 or containing frameshifts were filtered out. Nucleotide and amino acid mutations at each position were then counted and plotted. Enrichment for each amino acid (AA) between the input and output libraries was calculated using the following formula: ((%AAoutput) / (1 − %AAoutput)) / ((%AAinput) / (1 − %AAinput)). To distinguish library construction-based dropouts from selection-based dropouts in the enrichment heatmaps, any amino acids with zero reads in the output library were assigned a single read.

Variants were cloned into a vector containing a 100-nucleotide (nt) random unique molecular identifier (UMI) barcode with a BHVD repeat pattern. The plasmid library was linearized by Eco105I digestion. Nanopore libraries were prepared using a barcoded nanopore sequencing kit (SQK-NBD114.24) with 1 µg of linearized plasmid library and sequenced on a MinION flow cell (R10.4.1) for 72 hours using MinKnow UI control software version 6.5.15.

Sequencing reads were filtered using nanoq (version 0.9.0) with settings –min_len 4500–max_len 5500–min-qual 10 (that is, minimum q score of 10, a minimum read length equivalent to 90% of the expected read length and a maximum read length equivalent to 110% of the expected read length). The UMI sequence was extracted using Cutadapt (version 1.18) with settings –g ‘GGCGGTCACCATCACCACCACCACGCTACACG;max_error_rate = 0.2…ACTGTAC;max_error_rate = 0.2'–trimmed-only–revcomp–minimum_length 95. All UMI sequences were trimmed to 95 nt using seqkit (version 1.3-r106) with the command seqkit subseq -r 1:95.

Reads were clustered by UMI with mmseqs easy-linclust (version 14.7e284) with setting –min-seq-id 0.5. For each UMI cluster bin with at least 15 reads, a representative cluster sequence was generated by using usearch (version 11) with settings -cluster_fast -id 0.75 -strand both -sizeout -centroids and taking the first representative sequence of the output66. A final consensus sequence was generated by one round of polishing with Medaka (version 1.9.1) with settings -m r1041_e82_260bps_hac_g632. Counts for each unique variant were determined by tallying the total consensus sequences.

Primers (DE_mammalian_forward and DE_mammalian_reverse) were designed to amplify the Dn29 CDS from the active variant PCR library, adding overhangs for Esp3I-compatible Golden Gate cloning. PCR conditions were as follows: 25 µl of 2× Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 19 µl of water, 2 µl of purified active variant library and 2 µl each of primer. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 60 seconds; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 55 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The product was purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5) and quantified by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher).

A mammalian expression vector was designed with the EF1α promoter upstream of an Esp3I Golden Gate landing pad, used as the destination for the protein variant library. The landing pad was followed by a T2A self-cleaving peptide sequence and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) CDS.

Golden Gate reaction mixture: 75 ng of mammalian expression vector, amplified variant library (3:1 molar ratio to vector), 1 µl of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (NEB), 0.5 µl of T4 DNA Ligase (NEB), 0.5 µl of Esp3I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and up to 10 µl of nuclease-free water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 37 °C for 1 minute, 16 °C for 1 minute; 37 °C for 30 minutes; 80 °C for 20 minutes. Five Golden Gate reactions were performed, pooled and purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5). The library was transformed into Mach1 Escherichia coli and plated for overnight growth. Random colonies were picked, grown in 4 ml of TB-Carbenicillin and miniprepped (NucleoSpin Plasmid Transfection Grade Mini Kit; Machery-Nagel).

One day before transfection, 12,000−18,000 HEK293FT cells were plated per well of a 96-well plate, aiming for 60–80% confluency at the time of transfection.

Standard LSR + donor transfection: for transfections containing an LSR effector plasmid and a donor plasmid, each well was transfected with 725 ng of DNA, containing a 5:1 molar ratio of donor plasmid to effector plasmid, using 0.5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per well.

Standard LSR-dCas9 + donor + guide transfection: LSR−dCas9 effector plasmid, donor plasmid and guide plasmid were transfected with 725 ng of total DNA, containing a 5:1:1 molar ratio of donor:effector:guide plasmid with 0.5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well, unless specified otherwise in the figure legends.

Modified transfection conditions: Experiments shown in Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5b were transfected with 375 ng of effector plasmid, 100 ng of sgRNA plasmid and 250 ng of donor plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. Experiments shown in Figs. 3g, 5 and 6 used a consolidated plasmid expressing both the effector and guide RNA. In HEK293FT experiments, this consolidated plasmid was transfected at a 5:1 ratio of donor:effector/guide plasmid with 0.585 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well. For transfections containing two gRNA plasmids (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 5h), each well was transfected with 375 ng of effector plasmid, 75 ng each of gRNA plasmid and 250 ng of donor plasmid.

The cells were incubated and monitored for 3 days for mCherry (donor plasmid) and GFP (effector plasmid) expression. Cells were then harvested for flow cytometry (Attune NxT Flow Cytometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or genomic DNA extraction for downstream analyses.

Three days after transfection, cells were trypsinized with 50 µl of TrypLE (Gibco) for 10 minutes and then quenched with 50 µl of Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences). The 100-µl cell suspension was split into two 50-µl aliquots in U-bottom 96-well plates and centrifuged (300g, 5 minutes), and the supernatant was aspirated. One plate was resuspended in 200 µl of Stain Buffer and analyzed with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer with autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The other plate was resuspended in 50 µl of QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies), vortexed for 15 seconds and thermocycled: 65 °C for 15 minutes, 68 °C for 15 minutes, 98 °C for 10 minutes. DNA was cleaned with 0.9× AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) beads.

To assess integration efficiency and specificity, qPCR/ddPCR primers and probes were designed to span the left integration junction of attH1 and attH3, using a constant primer that binds to the donor plasmid sequence (ddPCR_donor_reverse_1), a genome binding primer near the pseudosite (ddPCR_attH1_forward_1, ddPCR_attH3_forward) and a FAM probe within the amplicon (ddPCR_attH1_probe_1, ddPCR_attH3_probe). For attH1, a second set of primers/probes was designed to target the right junction to verify measurement accuracy (ddPCR_attH1_2 primers/probe). Genomic reference primers and probes located nearby each attachment site were designed to measure pseudosite copy number for efficiency percentage calculations.

ddPCR reaction mix (22 µl total): 11 µl of ddPCR Supermix for Probes (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad), 1.98 µl of each primer (10 µM), 0.55 µl of each probe (10 µM), 1.65 µl of cleaned gDNA, 0.22 µl of SacI-HF (NEB) and water to volume. Each reaction contained primers and probes for the target site (FAM probe) and a nearby reference locus (HEX probe). Reactions were run on a QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) using Bio-Rad QX Manager Software version 2.1.0, and data were analyzed and visualized using Microsoft Excel (version 16.89.1) and GraphPad Prism (version 10.3.0). For off-target detection or low-concentration samples, primers were increased to 20 µM and volume halved, and gDNA volume was increased to 4.95 µl.

qPCR reaction mix (40 µl total): 1 µl of each primer, 0.8 µl of each probe, 20 µl of TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.4 µl of genomic DNA and 12 µl of water. The master mix was split into three 10-µl technical replicates in a 384-well plate and run on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) using LightCycler 480 software version 1.5.1.62. Primer pairs for ddPCR and qPCR are provided in Supplementary Table 8.

A fluorescent reporter assay was used to assess episomal plasmid recombination in HEK293FT cells. One day before transfection, 12,000−18,000 HEK293FT cells were plated per well of a 96-well plate, aiming for 60−80% confluency at the time of transfection. Three plasmids at a 1:1:1 molar ratio were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000: (1) 200 ng of the effector plasmid expressing the Dn29 variants and GFP; (2) 50.5 ng of the donor plasmid containing the attP attachment sequence and mCherry; and (3) 70.6 ng of the acceptor plasmid containing an EF1α promoter and the cognate attB attachment sequence. Upon recombination of the two attachment sequences, the EF1α promoter will drive expression of the mCherry CDS, which is read out by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 4d). To assess the excision reaction, the attP in the donor plasmid is replaced with the left post-recombination attachment site (attB-L:attP-R), called attL, and the attB is replaced with the right post-recombination attachment site (attP-L:attB-R), called attR. To assess attP recombination with model organism pseudosites, the attB sequence is replaced with the pseudosite sequences. Mismatching LSR (Bxb1) controls with each donor and acceptor plasmid is used to correct for the leaky mCherry background expression, defining the flow cytometry gating boundaries. Three days after transfection, the cells were trypsinized with 50 µl of TrypLE (Gibco) for 10 minutes, quenched with 50 µl of Stain Buffer, transferred to U-bottom 96-well plates and centrifuged (300g, 5 minutes), and then the supernatant was aspirated. Plates were resuspended in 200 µl of Stain Buffer and analyzed with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer with autosampler.

Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) primers were designed using the script from Bi et al.67, selecting primers with melting temperature closest to 65 °C. For each mutation, a forward and reverse primer were generated, each containing the desired mutation at the center. PCR reactions were set up combining forward SDM primer with DMS_universal_reverse primer or reverse SDM primer with DMS_universal_reverse primer. The PCR mixture (12.5 µl total) contained 6.25 µl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 0.5 µl each of primer (10 µM), 1 µl of plasmid template DNA (1 ng µl−1) and water to volume. PCR was run using the standard Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix protocol with annealing temperature at 65 °C. Products were cleaned with 0.5× AMPure XP beads. For Gibson assembly, 1 µl each of cleaned PCR product, 5 µl of Gibson master mix and 3 µl of water were incubated at 50 °C for 15 minutes and then transformed into Mach1 E. coli and plated. For simultaneous cloning of two or more mutations, universal primers were replaced with other mutationsʼ forward and reverse primers. Two mutations required a two-piece Gibson assembly, three mutations required a three-piece assembly and so forth.

A Tn5 tagmentation and PCR amplification-based assay was used to unbiasedly measure the relative efficiency of all integration sites, as described in Durrant et al.12. In brief, extracted genomic DNA is tagmented with Tn5 transposase to randomly add adaptors throughout the genome. Then, two nested PCRs are performed, with primers that bind the donor plasmid and the Tn5 adaptor to amplify the donor−genome junction and add Illumina sequencing adaptors. UMIs on the donor plasmid enable counting of the relative frequencies of integration events at each genomic locus.

HEK293FT cells were transfected as previously described, with a non-matching LSR (Bxb1) plasmid replacing the effector plasmid as a control for donor plasmid dilution. Cells were cultured for 2−3 weeks, passaging and analyzing by flow cytometry every 2−3 days at 80% confluency, until the non-matching LSR control was less than 1% mCherry+, indicating that the plasmid had nearly completely diluted out. Genomic DNA was extracted using a Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research), quantified by Qubit HS dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 µg of gDNA per sample was DpnI digested (NEB) to remove residual donor plasmid.

Tn5 transposase was purified following the Picelli et al.68 protocol. Tn5 adaptors were prepared by annealing top and bottom oligos (100 μM each) at 95 °C for 2 minutes, followed by slow cooling to 25 °C over 1 hour. The transpososome was assembled by combining 85.7 μl of purified Tn5 with 14.3 μl of pre-annealed oligos and incubating at room temperature for 1 hour. Tagmentation reactions contained 150 ng of gDNA, 4 μl of 5× TAPS-DMF, 1.5 μl of transpososome and water to 20 μl total volume. Samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated at 55 °C for 20 minutes. Reactions were placed on ice and purified with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrate Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, eluting in 11 μl of nuclease-free water. Sample quality was confirmed by Bioanalyzer to verify fragmentation of approximately 1.5−2.5 kb.

For round 1 PCR, each reaction contained 12.5 μl of 2× SuperFi II Master Mix, 1.5 μl of TMAC (0.5 M), 0.5 μl of outer nest donor-specific primer (PR_N165, 10 μM), 0.25 μl of outer nest i5 primer (PR_N163, 10 μM), 1.25 μl of DMSO and 9 μl of tagmented DNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 2 minutes; 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 68 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 90 seconds; followed by 72 °C for 5 minutes. Products were purified using 0.9× Agencourt AMPure XP SPRI beads and eluted in 11 μl of water.

For round 2 PCR, each reaction contained 25 μl of 2× SuperFi Master Mix, 3 μl of TMAC (0.5 M), 2.5 μl of DMSO, 2.5 μl of i5 primer (PR_N149, 10 μM), 5 μl of i7 donor-specific primer (PR_N184-PR_N204, 10 μM), 2 μl of water and 10 μl of purified round 1 PCR product. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 2 minutes; 18−20 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 68 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 90 seconds; followed by 72 °C for 5 minutes.

For size selection, approximately 40 μl of round 2 PCR product was loaded on a 2% agarose gel, and the smear between 300 bp and 800 bp was excised. DNA was extracted using the Monarch Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pooled at equimolar ratios. Final library quality and molarity were assessed using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche). Pooled libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 or Illumina MiSeq with 2 × 300-bp paired-end reads, using Nextseq 1000/2000 Control Software Suite version 1.7.1 or MiSeq Control Software version 4.1.0 and Illumina BaseSpace Software version 7.38.0. Raw sequencing data were processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline as described in Durrant et al.12.

To reduce occurrence of index hopping, unique dual i7 and i5 barcodes were used for the attH1 targeted samples in Fig. 3. To directly compare specificity of samples with different numbers of measured integration events, samples were downsampled to the same total UMI count.

Fusion proteins consisting of a catalytically dead Cas9 fused to an LSR and a P2A−GFP were constructed by Gibson assembly into a pUC19-derived plasmid containing the EF1α promoter and a SV40 poly(A) tail. Variable flexible linkers, including (GGS)8, (GGGGS)6 XTEN16, XTEN32-(GGSS)2 and XTEN48-(GGSS)2, were used to link the dCas9 and LSR. Spacers targeting loci proximal to the LSR integration site and non-targeting controls were cloned into an sgRNA-expressing plasmid via oligo ligation and Golden Gate cloning. Spacer selection was based on PAM sequence and pseudosite proximity.

Two plasmid libraries (attP-L and attP-R) were constructed to determine nucleotide preference within the attP, with each 26-bp half-site mutagenized separately. Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)-synthesized oligo pools contained 79% WT base and 7% each of the other bases at each position. Single-stranded oligo pools were subjected to second-strand synthesis. First, an oligo anneal reaction containing 2 µl of Library Oligo (100 µM), 4 µl of Klenow primer (100 µM), 3.4 µl of 10× STE Buffer and 24.6 µl of water was heated at 95 °C for 5 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. Next, a Klenow extension reaction containing 34 µl of annealed libraries, 8 µl of water, 5 µl of 10× NEBuffer2, 2 µl of 10 mM dNTPs (NEB) and 1 µl of DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB, 5,000 U ml−1) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes, purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5) and eluted in 20 µl of nuclease-free water.

The purified product was cloned by Esp3I Golden Gate cloning into the donor plasmid backbone: 75 ng of pre-digested backbone, 3:1 molar ratio of attP library to backbone, 0.5 µl each of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) and Esp3I (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 µl of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (NEB) and water to 10 µl were incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour, purified and eluted in 6 µl of nuclease-free water. Then, 1 µl of purified library was electroporated into Endura Electrocompetent Cells (Biosearch Technologies) at 10 μF, 600 Ω, 1,800 V, recovered in 2 ml of Lucigen Recovery Medium (37 °C, 1 hour), plated on 245-mm × 245-mm BioAssay dishes and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Final libraries were scraped, purified (Nucleobond Xtra Maxi EF Kit) and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 2000.

Next, 2.2 × 106 HEK293FT cells were plated on 10-cm dishes 1 day before transfection to achieve 70% confluence at transfection. Then, 24 μg of total plasmid DNA was prepared at a 5:1:1 molar ratio (attP library:LSR effector:sgRNA). DNA and 72 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were separately mixed with 1.5 ml of OMEM, incubated for 5 minutes and then combined and incubated for 10 minutes before adding dropwise to cells. After 3 days, cells were harvested with TrypLE (Gibco), and genomic DNA was extracted using a Quick-DNA Midiprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research).

Integration events were amplified by single-step PCR with i5/i7 index-adding primers using all available genomic DNA. Biological replicates had 1-bp staggered amplicons to increase nucleotide diversity. PCR conditions were as follows: 25 μl of NEBNext High Fidelity PCR Master Mix, 2.5 μg of genomic DNA, 1.25 μl each of the attL or attR i5 or i7 primers (Supplementary Table 8) and water to 50 μl. Cycling conditions were as follows: 25 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 63 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 25 seconds. PCR products were pooled and run on 2% agarose gel, and correct size bands were extracted (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit). Libraries were quantified (Qubit 1× dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay; Thermo Fisher Scientific), pooled equimolar with 35% PhiX spike-in and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 (150-bp paired-end reads).

Libraries were demultiplexed using Illumina BaseSpace automatic demultiplexing workflow. Paired-end reads were merged using BBMerge (version 39.06) and analyzed with a custom Python script. Reads were filtered for exact amplicon length and QScore ≥ 30. Next, percent abundance of each nucleotide at each attP position was calculated for input and output libraries. Enrichment scores were computed using the following equation: \(r=\frac{{A}/1-A}{B/1-B}\), where A and B represent the read counts for selected nucleotides in output and input libraries, respectively, normalized to the total number of reads. Enrichment scores were converted to sequence logos, generated using Logomaker69 and matplotlib packages.

Unique library members recovered as integration events were assessed by generating the set of unique reads. The number of unique integration events from NGS analysis was compared to ddPCR analysis of bulk genomic DNA for validation.

Dinucleotide enrichment analysis was performed by first counting individual nucleotide frequencies at each position across all reads, followed by counting all possible dinucleotide combinations using a 2-bp sliding window at consecutive position pairs. Raw counts were normalized to total reads to calculate probabilities for both single nucleotides and dinucleotides at each position. To assess deviation from independence, observed dinucleotide probabilities were divided by the product of their constituent single-nucleotide probabilities: P(dinucleotide) / (P(nucleotide1) × P(nucleotide2)).

Enrichment scores were calculated by comparing output to input library frequencies using \(r=\frac{{A}/1-A}{B/1-B}\), where A represents output library frequency and B represents input library frequency for each dinucleotide. Final values were log2 transformed and averaged across dinucleotide categories based on purine (R: A,G) and pyrimidine (Y: C,T) classification: RR (purine−purine), YY (pyrimidine−pyrimidine), RY (purine−pyrimidine) and YR (pyrimidine−purine).

H1 hESCs and WTC-11 iPSCs were cultured in mTeSR Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies) on Cultrex-coated (Bio-Techne) or Matrigel-coated (Corning) six-well plates. Cells were routinely subcultured at a 1:12 ratio using ReLeSR Passaging Reagent (STEMCELL Technologies) every 4 days or at 70−80% confluency. Three days after splitting (60% confluency), the cells were dissociated for 10 minutes with Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies) and plated in Cultrex-coated 96-well plates at 25,000−30,000 cells per well with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor. The next day (at 70% confluency), media were changed to include 50 µM ROCK inhibitor 2 hours before transfection. Then, 3 µg of plasmid DNA containing a 1:1 molar ratio of combined effector/guide plasmid to donor plasmid in 10-µl volume was diluted in 81 µl of mTeSR Plus and thoroughly pipette mixed. Next, 9 µl of FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) was added to the DNA/mTeSR mix, thoroughly mixed and incubated for 12 minutes. After another thorough pipette mix, 7 µl of the DNA was added dropwise to each well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, splitting 1:2 if 90% confluency was reached. After 3 days, the cells were dissociated with Accutase and split into two V-bottom plates, one for flow cytometry and one for gDNA harvest with QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies).

hESCs were differentiated into HPCs using the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). On day 10 of differentiation, 250 µl of non-adherent cells were collected from the supernatant using wide-bore P1000 tips and transferred to a V-bottom 96-well plate. Next, the cells were pelleted at 400g for 5 minutes, supernatant discarded and resuspended in 95 ml of Stain Buffer containing 1 µl of each antibody with a wide-bore pipette. The following antibodies were used: APC CD81 (BD Biosciences, 551112), APC CD147 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A15706), Alexa Fluor 647 CD63 (BD Biosciences, 561983), APC/Cyanine7 CD34 (BioLegend, 343514) and PE CD43 (BioLegend, 343204). The cells were incubated in the dark for 20 minutes to 1 hour, washed once with Stain Buffer and flowed on the Attune Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Attune Cytometric Software version 5.3.0 for collection.

hESCs were diluted to one cell per 100 µl in mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 1× CloneR (STEMCELL Technologies) and plated into two 96-well plates per sample. Cells were maintained until colonies were visible, and then wells with multiple colonies were removed. Single colonies were expanded to 24-well dishes when they covered half the surface area of the 96-well plate. At the next split, one quarter of each well was pelleted for gDNA extraction using QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies). The extracted gDNA was cleaned with 0.9× AMPure XP beads and genotyped by ddPCR. Primers and probes were designed to target the attH1 junction (ddPCR_attH1_1 set), the donor sequence (Amp_forward, Amp_reverse, Amp_probe) and a nearby genomic reference sequence. On-target zygosity was determined by the attH1/reference ratio, and total zygosity was measured by the donor/reference ratio.

Stem cells were transfected as previously described. Two days after transfection, cells were selected using Geneticin (Gibco) at 100 μg ml−1 and penicillin−streptomycin (Gibco) at 100 U ml−1. Cells were maintained in culture for 3 weeks until selection was complete and sufficient cell expansion was achieved for downstream applications, including cryopreservation and RNA extraction. Throughout the culture period, cell quality was monitored daily via microscopy to assess morphology and identify spontaneous differentiation events. Culture medium consisting of mTeSR Plus supplemented with penicillin−streptomycin and Geneticin was replaced daily. Upon reaching 70−80% confluency, cells were clump passaged using ReLeSR according to the manufacturer's instructions.

If spontaneous differentiation was observed, cells were subjected to a straining protocol to remove differentiated cells and maintain pluripotent populations. In brief, media were aspirated, and four drops of ReLeSR were added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were gently dislodged by pipetting or tapping the side of the culture dish to release cell clumps. The cell suspension was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer placed on a 50-ml Falcon tube and rinsed with 6 ml of PBS. The strainer was then inverted onto a fresh Falcon tube, and clumps were collected with 3 ml of culture medium before replating into six-well plates.

For RNA-seq, cells from one well of a six-well plate were harvested by adding 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. The lysate was mixed by pipetting until a homogeneous viscosity was achieved and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction.

For RNA extraction, 200 μl of chloroform was added, followed by vigorous shaking for 15 seconds and incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 4 °C, resulting in phase separation. The upper aqueous phase containing RNA was carefully transferred to a fresh tube, and 0.5 ml of isopropanol was added and mixed. After a 5−10-minute incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to precipitate RNA. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, mixed and centrifuged at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was air dried for 5−10 minutes before resuspension. The extracted RNA was analyzed on a High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies) to measure the RNA integrity number (RIN) score, which was higher than 9 for all samples.

mRNA enrichment was performed using the Roche/KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After mRNA enrichment, sequencing libraries were prepared using the HyperPrep Library Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Final libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X at a depth of at least 20 million reads per sample.

Raw paired-end FASTQ files for each stem cell sample were first subjected to adapter and quality trimming using Trim Galore (version 0.6.7)70 with default settings, retaining reads ≥20 nt. Quality of raw and trimmed reads was assessed with FastQC (version 0.11.9)71 and aggregated using MultiQC (version 1.15)72. Trimmed reads were aligned to the GRCh38.p13 reference genome (GENCODE version 46 primary assembly, FASTA and GTF obtained from GENCODE) using STAR (version 2.7.10a)73 in two-pass mode. Alignment metrics and insert size distributions were evaluated with Picard (version 2.27.4)74, RSeQC (version 4.0.0)75, Qualimap (version 2.2.2)76, dupRadar (version 3.21)77 and Qualimap RNA-seq modules, with reports again aggregated by MultiQC. Concurrently, Salmon (version 1.10.0)78 was used to quantify transcript abundances (–validateMappings), and transcript-to-gene summarization was performed to produce gene-level count and transcripts per million (TPM) matrices. All steps were orchestrated via the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (version 3.12.0)79 under Nextflow (version 24.10.0)80 with the Docker (version 28) profile, specifying –strandedness reverse81.

Gene-level count matrices (salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv) were imported into R (version 4.3.1)82, and DESeq2 (version 1.38.1)83 was used for normalization and differential expression. A sample metadata table containing sample_id, condition and group_id was preprocessed so that identifiers matched the column names of the count matrix. For each stem cell line (group_id), the wild-type (‘WT') condition was identified, and pairwise comparisons were performed between each edited condition and the corresponding wild-type condition. Differential expression was modeled in DESeq2 with the formula ‘~ condition' (R formula syntax), meaning that gene counts were fit as a function of the experimental condition (edited or wild-type). Wald tests were used to estimate log2 fold changes, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing by the Benjamini–Hochberg (false discovery rate (FDR)) method. DEGs were defined as those with adjusted P < 0.05 and |log2 fold change | > 1.

HEK293FT cells were transfected as previously described. Eight days after transfection, cells were placed under puromycin selection (0.5 μg ml−1) for 10 days. On day 18, cells were trypsinized and strained through a 35-µm filter, and single mCherry+ cells were sorted into four 96-well plates per sample using a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences). Single-cell colonies were expanded for 2 weeks until more than 50% confluent, with visual inspection to ensure single colony growth. Wells with zero or multiple colonies were excluded from analysis.

Confluent colonies were harvested with QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies) and amplified in two separate PCRs: PCR 1 using primers UMI_reverse and ddPCR_attH1_forward_1, flanking the UMI and attH1 donor/genome junction, and PCR 2 using primers UMI_reverse and UMI_forward, flanking the UMI on the donor plasmid. Amplicons were sequenced via Sanger and/or NGS to determine on-target UMI count (PCR 1) and total UMI count (PCR 2), allowing calculation of on-target and off-target insertion counts per colony.

HEK293FT cells were transfected with LSR and donor plasmids at a 1:5 ratio, as described above. After 3 days, cells were passaged into a 24-well dish for expansion. On day 5 after transfection, genomic DNA was harvested using the Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers with 0−5 stagger base pairs were designed to amplify the attH1 site. Each PCR reaction contained 1 μg of gDNA, 40 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 3.2 μl of forward primer (PR_N284−PR_N289, 10 μM), 3.2 μl of reverse primer (PR_N290−PR_N295, 10 μM) and water to 80 μl total volume. After 25 cycles under standard conditions, products were purified with 0.8× AMPure XP beads. A second PCR amplification added Illumina indexes using 1 μl of purified product, 12.5 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 1 μl each of uniquely indexed FLAP2 primers and 9.5 μl of water. After seven cycles, libraries were purified with 0.7× AMPure XP beads, quantified via Qubit, pooled and sequenced using Illumina chemistry.

Indel rates were calculated using Crispresso2 with the following command: CRISPResso -a CATTGGTGAATGTCTCATGTGGGTTTGAAAAGAGTGTGTATTCTGCTGTTGTTGGGTAAAGTAGTCTATACATGTCAATGATATGCTGTTGATTGATGCTGGTGTTGAATTCAACTATGTCCTTGCTGATTTTCTGCCTGCTGGATCTGTCTGAC -g GTCTATACATGTCAATGATA -r1 Read_1.fastq.gz -r2 Read_2.fastq.gz–keep_intermediate -w 20 -q 30–min_bp_quality_or_N 30–exclude_bp_from_left 10–exclude_bp_from_right 10–plot_window_size 20–ignore_substitutions. The Modified% output value represented the percentage of unintegrated cells containing indels. Background indel rates from untransfected cells were subtracted from each sample. The final percentage of cells with indels was calculated by multiplying the Modified% by the percentage of uninserted cells (1 minus the average insertion percentage determined by ddPCR).

HEK293FT cells were plated in black-walled, clear-bottom optical plates, excluding edge wells and transfected with LSR and donor plasmids at a 1:5 ratio with four replicates per sample. Two days after transfection, cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Assay (Promega). Cells were first refreshed with 100 μl of fresh D-10 medium and then treated with 100 μl of combined room temperature CellTiter-Glo Buffer and Substrate. Plates were orbitally shaken at 510 r.p.m. for 2 minutes on a Tecan Spark Microplate Reader and incubated for an additional 8 minutes, and then luminescence was measured with 1,000-ms integration time. Background luminescence from empty wells was subtracted from all measurements. Final viability values were normalized to control cells transfected with donor plasmid and pUC19 stuffer plasmid in place of the LSR effector plasmid.

HEK293FT cells were plated into 96-well plates and transfected as described above. Two days after transfection, cells were dissociated with TrypLE and transferred to a V-bottom plate. Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and washed with 200 μl of DPBS. Next, cells were centrifuged again and resuspended in 50 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in DPBS) for fixation. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times and stored in PBS overnight. To permeabilize cells, samples were resuspended in 0.25% Triton-X (diluted in DPBS) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Next, cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated in blocking buffer composed of the following: 10% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, G6767), 0.5% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, I3021) and 5% w/v saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, 84510) diluted in DPBS. Samples were incubated in blocking buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, samples were centrifuged and resuspended in a 1:1,000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-phospho histone H2A.X (Ser139) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. 05-636-AF647, clone JBW301, lot 4214083) diluted in blocking buffer. Samples were incubated for 2 hours, washed twice with DPBS and analyzed on the Attune flow cytometer.

HEK293FT cells were transfected with LSR and donor plasmids at a 1:5 ratio. After 3 days, cells were passaged into a 24-well dish for expansion. On day 5 after transfection, genomic DNA was harvested using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit. Tn5 tagmentation was performed as described above, with two reactions performed per sample.

For enrichment of translocation junctions, tagmented DNA underwent a two-step nested PCR. The first PCR combined 10.5 μl of tagmented DNA with 12.5 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 1 μl of outer nest primer (PR_N296 for upstream or PR_N297 for downstream of attH1) and 1 μl of PR_N163 (Tn5 adaptor binding). Reactions were amplified for 12 cycles (standard three-step protocol, 60 °C annealing, 1-minute extension), purified with 0.9× AMPure XP beads and eluted in 11 μl of water. The second nested PCR added indexes and Illumina adaptors using 10 μl of the first PCR product, 25 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 2.5 μl of inner primer (PR_N298−PR_N327 for upstream samples or PR_N328−PR_N356 for downstream samples), 2.5 μl of PR_N149 and 10 μl of water. After 20 cycles, products were purified with 0.9× AMpure XP beads, quantified by Qubit and pooled equimolarly. Amplicons between 300 bp and 900 bp were selected by gel extraction, quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit and sequenced with Illumina chemistry for 600 cycles.

Genomic rearrangements and translocations were identified using a custom pipeline. After merging paired-end reads, the sequence between the inner primer and the attH1 dinucleotide core (‘upstream sequence') was searched for, allowing up to three mismatches to account for sequencing errors. Reads containing the upstream sequence were processed to extract downstream portions (minimum 20-bp length), which were then aligned to both WT and donor insertion references using BWA-MEM (-a -M -k 8 -T 20)79. Reads were classified based on alignment quality (≥80% alignment and mapping quality (MAPQ) ≥ 20) into WT aligned, donor insertion aligned or potential translocations.

Potential translocation reads underwent further analysis by BWA alignment to the human reference genome (hg38). The resulting alignments were converted to sorted BAM files using SAMtools (version 1.22) for visualization and BED files using BEDTools (version 2.31.0) for genome browser compatibility.

Translocation events were classified into four categories: (1) close to target (within 2 kb of on-target site, reclassified as WT aligned); (2) EF1α promoter aligned (mapping to chr6 region 73,519,610−73,522,070, reclassified as donor insertion aligned); (3) non-chr10 translocations; and (4) chr10 rearrangements.

To quantify the presence of ITRs at the attH1/donor junction of AAV integrations, the same protocol was used, using the upstream bait primers. All reads containing the upstream sequence were aligned to WT and donor insertion references using BWA (version 0.7.19). All reads that did not align to these references were then aligned to the human genome. Finally, all reads that did not align to the human genome were aligned to AAV ITR sequences using Geneious Prime (version 11.0.20.1+1).

sgRNA spacers targeting cell surface markers CD81, CD147 and CD63 were cloned into the LentiGuide-Puro construct (Addgene, 52963). Lentivirus was generated using the LV-MAX Lentiviral Production Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and concentrated 100× with Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara). HPCs were diluted to 50,000 cells per well in 100 µl of Medium B (STEMCELL Technologies, STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit) in a 96-well plate. Each well received 1 µl of LentiBOOST (SIRION Biotech) and 1 µl of lentivirus. Media were changed the next day. Four days after transduction, a subset of cells was stained for cell surface markers. Remaining cells were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin for 4 days to select for transduced cells, followed by cell surface marker staining. Antibodies used for cell surface staining were as follows: APC CD81 (BD Biosciences, cat. 551112, lot 2061009, clone JS-81, 1:100 dilution); APC CD147 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. A15706, lot 540242, clone 8D12, 1:100 dilution); Alexa Fluor 647 CD63 (BD Biosciences, cat. 561983, lot 2112938, clone H5C6, 1:100 dilution); APC CD63 (BioLegend, cat. 353008, lot B373947, clone H5C6, 1:100 dilution); APC/Cyanine7 CD34 (BioLegend, cat. 343514, lot B413134, clone 581, 1:100 dilution); and PE CD43 (BioLegend, cat. 343204, lot B359578, clone CD43-10G7, 1:100 dilution). All antibodies chosen are validated for flow cytometric analysis of human cells according to the manufacturer's website.

The full-length WT Dn29 protein sequence and minimal attB-L or attB-R sequence (attB-L: GTAGACAAGGAAGGTAATGA; attB-R: GAAATAAGTTTGATAGATAT) were input into the AlphaFold3 web server with the seed set to ‘auto'. Five models were generated for each query of Dn29 bound to an attB half-site. Outputs were manually inspected in pymol (version 3.0.2) to ensure correct orientation of Dn29 bound to the half-site, with the dinucleotide core of the DNA proximal to the NTD. One model (Dn29 × attB-R) out of the 10 generated models met this criterion and was selected for further analysis. The chosen model was compared to the Listeria integrase crystal structure of the LSR CTD and attP complex (PDB: 4KIS). Despite 4KIS being bound to attP instead of attB, domain-wise comparisons showed strong alignment: RMSDs were 1.341 and 1.707 for the zinc-ribbon domain and the recombinase domain, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Protein/DNA interface residues were identified with the InterfaceResidues pymol script using default settings.

The efficiency and specificity data of all Dn29 variants were split into a training and test set based on what round of experimentation they were generated in. The training set, called round 1, contained all variants from the two single-mutation validation experiments, where mutations were tested individually on top of variant 127 (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2c−e) or variant 381 (Extended Data Fig. 2f). The testing set contained all higher-order combinations from the iterative rounds of driver mutation stacking (rounds 2−5). The efficiency (percent of integrations at attH1) was normalized to WT, and specificity (ratio of attH1/attH3 activity) was log transformed. The full amino acid sequences of the protein variants were one-hot encoded, a technique that transforms each amino acid in the sequence into a binary vector of length 21 (corresponding to the 20 standard amino acids plus a stop codon), where the position corresponding to that amino acid is set to 1 and all others are 0—this encoding is then flattened into a single vector representing the entire sequence. Activity in the training set was modeled using linear regression, ridge regression, XGBoost and CatBoost with the scikit-learn (version 1.0.2), xgboost (version 1.6.2) and catboost (version 1.2.5) Python libraries. Additional Python packages used include pandas (version 1.3.5), numpy (version 1.19.5), matplotlib (version 3.5.2), seaborn (version 1.73) and scipy (version 1.7.3).

For the ridge regression, optimal α was identified through minimization of the testing set R2 (α = 0.8 for efficiency model, α = 1.3 for specificity model). Hyperparameter optimizations were conducted for XGBoost and CatBoost by performing a randomized search, evaluating on negative mean squared error, using the following parameters: XGBoost: ‘n_estimators': [100, 500, 1,000], ‘learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1], ‘max_depth': [3, 5, 7], ‘subsample': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0], ‘colsample_bytree': [0.7, 0.8, 1.0]; CatBoost: ‘iterations': [100, 200, 500, 1,000], ‘learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2], ‘depth': [4, 6, 8, 10], ‘l2_leaf_reg': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], ‘bagging_temperature': [0, 1, 2, 3], ‘random_strength': [1, 1.5, 2, 3], ‘border_count': [32, 64, 128], ‘grow_policy': [‘SymmetricTree', ‘Depthwise', ‘Lossguide'].

The following parameters were chosen for each model: XGBoost, specificity: ‘subsample' = 0.5, ‘n_estimators' = 1,000, ‘max_depth' = 7, ‘learning_rate' = 0.1, ‘colsample_bytree' = 0.8; XGBoost, efficiency: ‘subsample' = 0.7, ‘n_estimators' = 100, ‘max_depth' = 7, ‘learning_rate' = 0.05, ‘colsample_bytree' = 0.7; CatBoost, specificity: ‘random_strength' = 1.5, ‘learning_rate' = 0.1, ‘l2_leaf_reg' = 1, ‘iterations' = 1,000, ‘grow_policy' = ‘Depthwise', ‘depth' = 4, ‘border_count' = 128, ‘bagging_temperature' = 1; CatBoost; efficiency: ‘random_strength' = 1.5, ‘learning_rate' = 0.1, ‘l2_leaf_reg' = 7, ‘iterations' = 500, ‘grow_policy' = ‘Lossguide', ‘depth' = 4, ‘border_count' = 32, ‘bagging_temperature = 2.

Effector constructs were cloned into an in vitro transcription (IVT) plasmid as previously described84. This plasmid contained a mutated T7 promoter, 5' untranslated region (UTR), P2A EGFP and 3' UTR followed by a 145-bp poly(A) sequence. IVT templates were generated by PCR using primers oGX006 and oLGR009, which incorporate a poly(A) tail and correct the T7 promoter mutation. PCR reactions were performed using KAPA HiFi HotStart 2× (Roche) Master Mix with 6.25 ng of plasmid template per 25-µl reaction. The PCR protocol involved annealing at 63 °C, extending for 45 seconds per kilobase and running for 18 cycles. The reactions were purified using 0.8× volume of SPRI beads and eluted into water. The purified PCRs were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop to ensure correct size and determine concentration.

The IVT reactions were set up using the HiScribe T7 High-Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, E2040S), modified with full pseudo-UTP substitution using N1-Methyl-Pseudo-U (TriLink Biotechnologies, N-1081) and co-transcriptionally capped with CleanCap AG (TriLink Biotechnologies, N-7113). Each IVT reaction contained 5 mM ATP, CTP, GTP and pseudo-UTP, 4 mM CleanCAP AG, 1× Transcription Buffer, 3.75 ng µl−1 DNA template, 1 U µl−1 Murine RNAse Inhibitor (NEB, M0314L), 0.002 U µl−1 yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (NEB, M2403L) and 5 U µl−1 T7 RNA polymerase. Reactions were incubated for 2.5 hours at 37 °C.

Next, the mRNA was purified using lithium chloride. To each reaction, 1.5× water and 1.25 × 7.5 M LiCl were added. The solution was chilled at −20 °C for 30 minutes and then spun at maximum speed (16,000g) for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rinsed with 70% ice-cold ethanol to remove residual salts. After another maximum speed spin for 10 minutes at 4 °C, the mRNA was resuspended in water and stored at −80 °C. The mRNA was analyzed on an Agilent TapeStation and by Qubit RNA High Sensitivity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to ensure correct size and determine concentration.

Two days before electroporation, T cells were seeded at 1 × 106 fresh cells per milliliter and activated with a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 40203D). On the day of electroporation, the beads were magnetically removed, and the T cells were electroporated with 2 µg of LSR−dCas9−P2A−EGFP mRNA and 2 µg of sgRNA (Synthego) for LSR−dCas9 samples or 1 µg of LSR−P2A−EGFP mRNA for LSR samples using the Lonza P3 Primary Cell Kit. Each electroporation contained between 0.5 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells in 20 µl total volume and was electroporated using the 4D Nucleofector system and the DS-137 pulse code. Immediately after electroporation, 80 µl of pre-warmed culture media was added to the Nucleocuvette strip, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 15−30 minutes. Next, 2 × 105 cells per condition were split into 96-well U-bottom plates in 100 µl of serum-free medium (TheraPEAK X-VIVO-15 Serum-free Hematopoietic Cell Medium, BEBP04-744Q) supplemented with 5 ng μl−1 IL-7 and 5 ng μl−1 IL-15. Cells were then transduced at an MOI of 1 × 105 genome copies per cell with ssAAV or scAAV vectors of serotype 6 (AAV6) containing the e-attP sequence, attH1 sgRNA target sequence and an mCherry expression cassette, which were ordered from VectorBuilder. The next morning, cells were spun down at 300g for 5 minutes; the serum-free medium was removed; and cells were resuspended in 200 µl of fresh cX-VIVO. Cells were maintained and passaged as needed by the addition of cX-VIVO every 2−3 days.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human blood donors were collected under an approved institutional review board protocol by the Stanford Blood Center and used to isolate human T cells. In brief, leukoreduction chambers from processing of platelet donations were used to isolate PBMCs using density centrifugation with Ficoll (Lymphoprep; STEMCELL Technologies) within SepMate tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. Next, primary human CD3+ T cells were isolated by negative selection using a Human CD3 T Cell Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. Isolated primary human CD3 T cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and activated using anti-human CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Cell Therapy Systems; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 1:1 ratio in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 5% FBS (MilliporeSigma) and 50 IU ml−1 human IL-2 (PeproTech). T cells were activated at a 1:1 ratio of cells to Dynabeads and initially cultured in standard tissue culture incubators at approximately 1 × 106 cells per milliliter of medium. After gene editing/electroporations, T cells were counted and reseeded at approximately 1 × 106 cells per milliliter, with additional IL-2 and X-VIVO 15 complete media added every 2–3 days to maintain a culture density of approximately 1 × 106 cells per milliliter.

Forty-eight hours after activation, Dynabeads were magnetically removed from activated T cell cultures by incubating for 2 minutes at room temperature on a magnet (EasySep Magnet; STEMCELL Technologies), and cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For electroporations, 1−2 million T cells per editing condition were gently pelleted by centrifugation at 90g for 10 minutes, followed by careful aspiration of the supernatant. T cell pellets were resuspended in 20 μl per editing condition in P3 buffer (Lonza) and then mixed with prepared LSR mRNA and DNA templates. Then, 1.5 µg of LSR mRNA, 2 µg of donor plasmid, 1.5 µg of sgRNA plasmid and 20 µl of T cell suspension were mixed and aliquoted into a 96-well Nucleocuvette plate (Lonza). All plasmids were purified using the ZymoPure II Plasmid Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research). The 5.8-kb CD19 CAR-expressing plasmid contains the EF1α promoter, tNGFR EC domain (cell surface reporter), T2A, 1928z CAR and bGH poly(A). Total nucleic acid volume was limited to 5 µl. Electroporation occurred on a Gen2 Lonza 4D instrument with a 96-well plate attachment using pulse code EO-151. Immediately after electroporation, 80 μl of pre-warmed X-VIVO 15 media was added to each cuvette, and cells were rested within the cuvettes for 15 minutes in a standard 37 °C tissue culture incubator. The cells were then gently resuspended and transferred to standard 96-well round-bottom plates with 300 µl of total X-VIVO 15 complete medium with 50 IU ml−1 human IL-2. T cells were maintained at 0.5 × 106 to 1 × 106 cells per milliliter, and X-VIVO 15 complete medium with 50 IU ml−1 human IL-2 was refreshed every 2−3 days.

Three days after electroporation, 50 µl of T cells was collected for staining and flow cytometry. In brief, cells were centrifuged, washed once with 200 μl of cell staining buffer and stained with Ghost Dye Red 780 at a 1:1,000 dilution (Tonbo, 13-0865-T500) for 20 minutes in the dark at 4 °C. The cells were measured using an Attune NxT Cytometer with a 96-well autosampler (Invitrogen) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.10.0) for viability, mCherry fluorescence (expressed on the AAV) and GFP fluorescence (effector expression). The remaining 150 µl of T cells in culture was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes, and the gDNA was harvested using QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies) and analyzed by ddPCR as described above.

At 13 days after non-viral gene editing, T cell editing was assessed by flow cytometry, and cells edited with goldDn29, goldDn29−dCas9 and Dn29−dCas9 were selected for the killing assay. T cells were mixed at indicated effector:target (E:T) ratios with target Nalm6 leukemia cells in 96-well plates, with four different Nalm6 conditions (16,000, 8,000, 4,000 or 2,000 cells per well) and 4,000 T cells per well. Cell killing was assessed by flow cytometry at 48 hours, and the percentage of Nalm6 tumor cell killing was calculated by taking 1 − (no. of Nalm6 cells alive in experimental condition / no. of Nalm6 cells alive in no-T-cell conditions). Effector cells were stained with human NGFR-APC (clone ME20.4, BioLegend, 345108), and target cells were stained with human CD19-PE (clone HIB19, BioLegend, 982402), for flow cytometric analysis.

Artificial intelligence language models (ChatGPT and Claude) were used for generating custom Python scripts for data analysis and visualization, assistance with copyediting and infilling preliminary drafts of some sections based on an author-provided outline. All content generated by artificial intelligence was thoroughly reviewed, edited and verified by the authors.

The Roman Empire's road system was critical for structuring the movement of people, goods and ideas, and sustaining imperial control. Yet, it remains incompletely mapped and poorly integrated across sources despite centuries of research. We present Itiner-e, the most detailed and comprehensive open digital dataset of roads in the entire Roman Empire. It was created by identifying roads from archaeological and historical sources, locating them using modern and historical topographic maps and remote sensing, and digitising them with road segment-level metadata and certainty categories. The dataset nearly doubles the known length of Roman roads through increased coverage and spatial precision, and reveals that the location of only 2.737% are known with certainty. This resource is transformative for understanding how mobility shaped connectivity, administration, and even disease transmission in the ancient world, and for studies of the millennia-long development of terrestrial mobility in the region.

The study of roads of the Roman Empire is a centuries-old pursuit1,2. There is a wealth of information about roads that were physically identified in archaeological excavations and surveys, about milestones which were placed at regular intervals along Roman roads, and historical sources like the Antonine Itinerary3,4 or the Tabula Peutingeriana5, describing major connections between settlements, as well as detailed regional summaries on Roman roads6,7. However, finding and locating this diversity of research and the spatially precise locations of the roads themselves is inhibited by a lack of an Empire-wide synthesis and digitisation.

There have previously been very few other open digital representations of our knowledge of roads over the entire Roman Empire. The Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World8 is the main reference atlas for the ancient world, and the roads recorded in it are openly digitally available from the Ancient World Mapping Center (https://awmc.unc.edu) and Mapping Past Societies (formerly the Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations, https://darmc.harvard.edu/). These two digitisations are highly similar and differ only in a few areas where the latter also includes roads from the Tabula Imperii Byzantini for Greece and Asia Minor9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. They have proven invaluable resources for spatially explicit computational studies of ancient trade and mobility, and as references for the overall structure of the Roman transport system17,18. However, both are of limited spatial detail as they reflect the spatial resolution of the Barrington Atlas (ranging from 1:500,000 to 1:1,000,000), which results in disregarding natural corridors and barriers. Moreover, the sources used to create the roads included in the Barrington Atlas are only available as a short list of references for all information in an atlas map sheet, and not on a road-by-road basis. The sources and methods used to include roads in the Barrington Atlas and trace their particular paths are not documented, and a quantitative assessment of how representative and reliable this resource is is not possible.

Itiner-e (dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17122148, online platform: https://itiner-e.org/) addresses this gap in resources for studying the ancient world. It presents an open, spatially high resolution digitisation of Roman roads, drawing on published historical and archaeological information, topographic maps, and remote sensing data, citing the sources used to create each road segment, and making each road segment uniquely citable through a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that is linked to URIs of nearby ancient places in the Pleiades gazetteer of ancient places (http://pleiades.stoa.org/). Itiner-e covers the area of the Roman Empire at its maximum extent, ca. 150 CE, and includes any terrestrial route with an evidenced, conjectured, or hypothesised location in the sources used for the study. This includes any road predating Roman conquest that continued to be in use during Roman times.

The resulting map includes, in total, 299,171.31 km of roads in an area of nearly 4,000,000 km2, which is nearly double the length of other resources (the Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilizations road dataset is 188,555 km). This increase is due to a higher coverage of roads (Figs. 1b, 2a; e.g., the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, North Africa), but also by the decision to make a spatially explicit dataset that adapts routes to the geographical reality (i.e., to cross a mountain, our roads follow a winding pass rather than a direct line), resulting in a higher number of vertices for the road lines and higher total length (Figs. 1c; 2b). The dataset includes 14,769 road segments and consists of 14 connected components, reflecting the contiguous landmasses (including continental Europe, Britain, Asia–North Africa, and various Mediterranean islands). The core of the Roman terrestrial transport network were those roads classified as main roads (see Main/Secondary Roads) documented via milestones or historical sources. Our dataset reveals these covered 103,477.9 km (34.58%), and this number is unlikely to increase significantly, since these are the most documented and studied Roman roads. The dataset enables studies of how these main roads structured and enabled phenomena including Roman conquest and administration. Our dataset further includes 195,693.3 km (65.42%) of secondary roads which can be studied to understand the structure of more local mobility, and future data collection focusing on understudied areas could significantly increase this number. The dataset reveals for the first time that only 2.737% of the spatial location of the total road length is certain, whilst 89.818% is conjectured and 7.445% hypothesised (see Certainty categories). This shows a discrepancy between our knowledge of the existence and location of Roman roads: we know all of the included roads were used at some point during the Roman period, but their precise locations are not certain. Our confidence maps (see Technical validation) visualise this uncertainty and elaborate on it by expressing differences across the dataset in road density, spatial accuracy of road digitisation, and source reliability.

(a) The Itiner-e road dataset, and two comparisons with the DARMC dataset: (b) difference in coverage, and (c) difference in spatial resolution as expressed by the number of vertices contained in the datasets. Itiner-e increases the coverage in selected areas throughout the Empire, most notably in the Iberian Peninsula, the Aegean and Egypt, and increases spatial detail throughout with a few exceptions marked in blue in c).

Comparison of DARMC (in orange) and Itiner-e (in black) datasets, (a) showing an example from France of a region with increased coverage of roads, and (b) an example of increased spatial detail.

A major challenge is the absence of chronological evidence of the creation and change of roads, that is comparable at an Empire-wide scale. This means the current dataset cannot show the growth and change over time of Roman roads and the degree to which they built on and reused previously existing roads. Historical and archaeological sources teach us that transport networks grow organically, new roads are constructed on top of old ones, they change function and physical characteristics, and become disused. Detailed temporal evidence for road construction, use and change is only available for a handful of cases, making an evidence-based reconstruction of how the road system changed throughout the Roman period at an Empire-wide scale currently impossible. This should be the subject of dedicated large-scale efforts in future research.

Itiner-e makes such gaps in our current knowledge of Roman roads explicit for the first time, allowing this information to inform robustness tests and uncertainty quantifications of future studies, and specifying how and where future data collection efforts can improve our knowledge.

Road digitisation followed three steps (Fig. 3), with regional variation depending on the availability of sources and intensity of research activity, as well as collaborators (see Regional overviews): (1) identifying roads through relevant literature, historical and archaeological sources, gazetteers and milestones; (2) locating roads using modern and historical aerial photographs, modern and historical topographic maps, and modern and historical satellite imagery; (3) digitising roads using GIS, cross-checking with sources, and adding attribute information.

Workflow summarizing the data collection and digitisation process.

The first step consisted of identifying roads in sources and those revealed in prior studies within the research area, based on previously published atlases, regional summaries, surveys, milestones and excavations. Previous studies identified roads through a set of historical and archaeological parameters19,20, often based on a combination of historical and archaeological sources, diachronic studies of the landscape and the geographical characteristics of possible paths. A key factor in all prior research was the inclusion of roads on ancient itineraries such as the Antonine Itinerary or the Tabula Peutingeriana. The location of milestones, and the location of cities or settlements close to each other also allowed researchers to assume the existence of roads that connected them, since all ancient places must have been reachable by a terrestrial route. But only rarely have long stretches of Roman roads been excavated or survived to the present day. Key overviews of roads of the entire Roman Empire include the Barrington Atlas8, and its digital representation by the Ancient World Mapping Centre and by Mapping Past Societies, as well as the Tabula Imperii Romani (https://tir-for.iec.cat/), and summaries of the Roman road network in specific regions, provinces, countries or extensively surveyed areas (discussed per region in Regional overviews). This phase further included collecting and summarizing relevant archaeological and historical sources and publications for each region. Milestones were used as an important source to determine points where roads passed through, and for chronology, as they were placed along the roads to indicate the distance to ancient places and sometimes named infrastructure investments by emperors. Milestone data were collected primarily using the geocoded database LIRE (Latin Inscriptions of the Roman Empire)21, which includes 8,388 milestones with Latin inscriptions. While milestones with Greek inscriptions are also included in LIRE, they are not fully represented. The drawbacks of the sources used by LIRE include the absence of anepigraphic milestones, the imprecise or incorrect location of some milestones and missing or unknown chronological data. This necessitated case-by-case corrections by consulting additional region-specific sources of the milestone data (see per region in Regional overviews). Furthermore, milestones were not evenly distributed throughout the Roman Empire and their explanatory potential is limited mainly to the major public roads (viae publicae)22. Additional data about ancient places, sites and settlements was consulted from Pleiades, which is the gazetteer of ancient places, and Vici.org, the archaeological atlas of antiquity (https://vici.org/). The archaeological, milestone, and site data were used to identify the existence of individual roads and the general layout of the road network in each region.

In step two, we proceeded to spatially locate identified roads. The specific information obtained for each road in the previous step (location of settlements, location of extant remains from survey or excavations, location of bridges, milestones, road stations, etc.) was subsequently compared to different planimetric sources such as modern and historical aerial photographs (USAF 1950s photogrammetric flights23), modern satellite imagery (ESRI World Imagery24, Google Satellite25) and historical satellite imagery (Corona mission26), and modern and historical (19th–early 20th century) topographic maps (see a detailed overview of the sources for each region in Regional overviews). Available topographic maps were scanned and georeferenced as needed. This enabled locating the roads in the real world.

In step three, each road section was manually digitised with a target spatial resolution of 5–200 m on a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platform and stored as a single data record in a vector layer with an associated attribute table. A number of general principles or observations were followed to guide the digitisation work. In ideal cases, ancient roads can be visually identified on satellite imagery, aerial imagery, or are marked as such on topographic maps (Fig. 4a–g). These usually appear as straight linear features in flat areas (Fig. 4b), or as sharp switchback roads on slopes (Fig. 4c). Roman land divisions (centuriation), which include the construction of roads in an orthogonal layout, are often preserved in modern networks of roads and agricultural fields, especially in northern Italy27 (Fig. 4d), but also elsewhere (e.g., Tunisia28 and Syria29). All such identified features were cross-checked against the primary publications and additional datasets (milestones and site data) where applicable. However, in other cases where roads were not visible in imagery, the digitised road sections follow a line connecting known archaeological road remains, milestones, and ancient sites. The digitised paths of such segments are refined by comparing them to existing contemporary and historical roads on georeferenced topographic maps and satellite imagery. It is then possible to approximate the layout of a Roman road to one of the existing roads to achieve a more realistic road layout that takes into account local topography, especially in areas where more formidable obstacles are present (wetlands, rugged terrain, mountain passes, etc.). In many of these cases then, the conjectured line of a Roman road follows the line of a modern road, which is often corroborated by additional archaeological and historical evidence. The only modern roads which were excluded from consideration for corroboration with Roman roads were modern highways/expressways, which in most cases do not conform to any previous historical roads. This process results in a plausible digitised road course recorded as ‘conjectured' or ‘hypothetical' (see Certainty categories), which is informed by Roman remains and prior research whilst conforming to the geographical context. A consistent issue across all study areas was the presence of modern water reservoirs and dams. In these cases, we relied on historical topographic maps or historical satellite imagery (especially Corona satellite photography for the Near East, from ca. 1967–1972) taken before construction of any dams to digitise the road segments (Fig. 4h–i).

Examples of the road locating process. (a) A Roman road indicated as ‘Voie Romaine' on a topographic map (Levant 1:50,000) leaving ancient Bostra (Bosra esh-Sham, Syria) due west; (b) Via Hadriana in the Eastern Desert of Egypt appears as a wide light linear feature on a darker soil on satellite imagery; (c) the Klimax pass between Argos and Mantinea (Greece) can be identified as a sharp switchback track on the mountain, partially overlaid by a modern wider track; (d) orthogonal Roman land divisions are retained by modern roads north of Padua, Italy; (e) a road drawn on the Tabula Imperii Romani Iudaea/Palaestina sheet; (f) the same area on the modern 1:50,000 topographic map of Israel, indicating ‘remains of the Roman road' (in Hebrew), and (g) the same area on a modern orthophoto, where the Roman road appears as a straight line with sharp turns running roughly southwest to northeast across the picture. (h) An example of employing Corona satellite imagery for locating roads around the ancient city of Samosata (Samsat, Turkey) before flooding (Corona mission image DS1107-2138DA061-62), and (i) its current state.

Several parameters were calculated for each road segment and added to the attribute table. Geodesic length in metres of each segment was calculated in GIS using the WGS 1984 World Mercator projected coordinate system (EPSG:3395). Average slope in degrees along the length of each segment was calculated over SRTM30 Global Digital Elevation Model with a resolution of 3-arc seconds. The dataset was finally cleaned to ensure consistency in terminology and topological continuity between line segments.

The work was performed as a collaborative effort between the co-authors of this paper undertaken between 2020 and 2024. The MINERVA (https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/projects/minerva-understanding-the-centuries-long-functioning-of-the-roman) project led the digitisation of the Roman road system in North Africa, the Near East, Asia Minor, and Southeastern Europe. The Viator-e (https://viatore.icac.cat/) project led the digitisation of the roads in the Western Roman Empire, excluding North Africa. The Viator-e project is a continuation of an earlier Mercator-e project, that focused on the Iberian peninsula (https://fabricadesites.fcsh.unl.pt/mercator-e/). These two projects' efforts were supplemented with road datasets for the Eastern Desert of Egypt (ERC Desert Networks, https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/), Bithynia (Weissova), Rough Cilicia (Şahin), Pamphylia (Massa), Campania (Renda), the Dutch part of the Roman frontier (Verhagen), the Meuse and Scheldt basins (Bongers), and Britannia and Sardinia (Lewis). The data collection per region is described in Regional overviews.

The geographical limits of the data collection are broadly defined by the extent of the Roman Empire during the Antonine dynasty, ca. 150 CE, when the Empire reached its largest extent (Fig. 1a). The inclusion of some regions does not strictly follow this chronological framework and is rather founded on available source material and natural connections of these regions to the Roman provinces in the 2nd century CE. Therefore, the road system on the left bank of the Euphrates between Samosata and Edessa (modern Samsat and Şanlıurfa, Turkey) is included, since the exact boundary between the Roman Empire and the Edessan kingdom is impossible to define exactly. Dura–Europos in Syria is included, although it was permanently annexed around the year 165 CE. Further regions to the east (Armenia, Mesopotamia) are not included as they were annexed by the Romans only for a short time in the early 2nd c. CE. A string of north Saharan oases (Jaghbub, al-Wahat, Marada, Zillah, Waddan and Fezzan in Libya, and Touggourt in Algeria) are included – even though they were not part of the Roman Empire they were part of the Roman trade network in North Africa. The region between Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall in Britain is also included, even though Roman control there was only ephemeral (ca. 142–182 CE).

CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era) are used throughout this paper and in the dataset. The lower chronological limit of the data collection is broadly defined by the first incorporation of each territory into the Roman dominion as a province (be it under the Republic or the Empire). Thus, the earliest dated road in the dataset is the Via Appia between Rome and Capua, built in 312 BCE. The lower boundary then varies on a regional basis (Table 1).

However, the Romans usually incorporated older roads into their road system, which they then improved, paved, or equipped with bridges and milestones20. Therefore, evidence for the pre-Roman road network in each region was taken into account during data collection, based on available published data. Only in rare specific cases is it possible to establish a precise date for the construction of a completely new road. For this reason, the start date of most roads in the dataset is not fixed, and in such cases the date fields are filled with the value 9999, to indicate missing data (see the next section, Data field description). The upper chronological boundary for the data collection was set at 400 CE, as there were minor changes in the Roman road system until the early part of 4th century CE. That means we also only used milestones dated up to ca. 400 CE.

Each data record represents a road section between two ancient places or road crossings, and additional information associated with it (Table 2). Due to limited sources about many roads and limits to the scope of data collection, it was not always possible to assign all values to every data record. As a minimum, each data record contains ID, Name, Type, Citation, Bibliography, and Segment Certainty, in addition to Shape Length and Average Slope.

Each record is identified by a unique numerical identifier and a descriptive name. The name is constructed from the two origin–destination place names of the digitised section, connected by a hyphen ‘-'. The ancient place name is used when known. The present-day toponym was used instead in cases where the name of the ancient settlement was unknown or did not exist. A characteristic geographical element was chosen as a place name in cases where the road ended without the existence of a settlement.

Further attributes are included for each road section related to the chronology of its creation and abandonment and, if known, the name of an emperor or a magistrate under whose mandate the road was built. Few roads can be dated with certainty, and it was outside of the scope of our data collection to obtain chronological information for all roads. These fields will be especially relevant to capture future new findings about road chronology, when the attributes will enable us to visualise the evolution of the Roman road system, or to compare the infrastructure investment of each Roman emperor.

Additional fields describe the type of road in the road system hierarchy (‘Main Road' or ‘Secondary Road'), the creator of each data record, bibliography, field identifying the ancient name of the road or itinerary it is part of, and segment certainty (‘Certain', ‘Conjectured', and ‘Hypothetical'). Additional fields describe physical properties of the road segments – length (in metres), and average slope (in degrees). Each entry also has a URI on the live itiner-e.org version of the dataset, which enables linking to other online resources.

For the purposes of the data collection, a road was defined as any line of terrestrial communication connecting sites existing within the defined geographical and chronological boundaries. This definition includes both formal (built, engineered) and informal (non-built) roads, i.e., both paved and unpaved roads which are in regular use as an accepted line of communication (e.g., desert camel tracks). Every inhabited place in the Roman world must have been reachable within its continental or island terrestrial context by a path of some sort, but road digitisation was not attempted in cases where no information was available for tracks and pathways leading to an inhabited place.

In the dataset, all roads are represented as line (vector) segments, where each segment corresponds to a single data record. A road segment spans from an intersection with another segment to the next intersection with a different segment, or from a starting point to the nearest intersection. This means that a single named road (e.g., Rome–Capua) will be split into multiple segments as the road is intersected by other roads along its course. These multiple segments will share many attributes (name, type, author, etc.) but not all of them – Shape Length and Average Slope are almost always unique, and the FID is a unique identifier for each record.

A basic road hierarchy is provided by designating each road segment as either a ‘Main Road' or ‘Secondary Road'. The assignment of these categories to the road segments is for the most part based on prior designations by archaeological and historical publications used in the digitisation process (see further below). We used the following principle in cases where prior designations were lacking. A road segment is defined as a ‘Main Road' if it has more than one of these characteristics: (a) the presence of milestones, (b) is part of an ancient Itinerary (chiefly the Antonine Itinerary and Tabula Peutingeriana), (c) it shares (a large part of) its course with a historically known major road indicated on 19th/early 20th century maps. The remaining roads were classified as a ‘Secondary Road'. This two-tier hierarchy is satisfactory for most of the study area, although in several regions with detailed road data an additional third tier could have been used (e.g., the region of Sicyon in Greece, Sagalassos in Turkey, Durocortorum–Reims in France, etc.), but due to the limited extent of these regions this was not implemented.

The segment certainty specifies the spatial accuracy and confidence in the digitised location of the road segment. Three values are defined: ‘Certain', ‘Conjectured', and ‘Hypothetical'. ‘Certain' designates well-documented segments in our sources that were digitised with high spatial accuracy (less than 50 m deviation in the mountainous terrain, less than 200 m in the plains). Most roads fall into the ‘Conjectured' category, i.e., identified road segments with lower spatial accuracy due to lower level of documentation in our sources. ‘Hypothetical' is reserved for identified but not located roads, or identified roads where the physical infrastructure of the roads was less fixed or where multiple parallel tracks might have existed (e.g., desert areas, flood plains). In addition, ‘Hypothetical' is used for roads which are speculated to have existed in antiquity but insufficient evidence exists to classify them as either ‘Certain' or ‘Conjectured'.

The following section provides an overview summarised by region of the main sources used in the processes of identifying and locating roads and in specific cases methods used in the process of digitising roads.

For Morocco, the main source was the Barrington Atlas31, supplemented by a few other studies32,33. Except for a road intersection at the site of ancient Volubilis (Fertassa) which is visible on the satellite imagery, all roads are only conjectured, following existing roads. The primary topographic map used for digitisation was a 1:200,000 map from the Army Map Service34. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in improving the spatial accuracy of the road data.

Algeria, Libya, and western Libya (Tripolitania) is covered by a map by Pierre Salama6. This source was supplemented by a study on the region of Sitifis (Sétif)35. Data on ancient sites from Pleiades and Vici were corroborated with the Atlas Archéologique d'Algérie36. Milestone data in LIRE were cross-checked against the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum37, but their interpretation and the assignment of construction dates to roads was found to be beyond the scope of the present research and only a few roads were unambiguously dated. The data for Tunisia is more detailed, with up-to-date research on several roads (Carthage–Theveste, Capsa–Tacape, etc.)38. Further roads could be digitised using an atlas of Roman land divisions (centuriation), which marks several Roman roads on modern 1:50,000 topographic maps28. A number of these roads could have been digitised with high accuracy as it was possible to visually identify them on modern satellite imagery. The majority of roads tend to follow a variety of modern roads, field roads, and tracks marked on topographic maps and corroborated on modern satellite imagery. Primary topographic maps used for Algeria were 1:50,000, and 1:200,000 Army Map Service maps, and for Tunisia, 1:50,000, 1:100,000, and 1:200,000 Army Map Service maps39,40,41,42,43. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in improving spatial accuracy across the region, and increased coverage in northern Tunisia, the desert region, and Algeria.

The primary source for Libya was Mattingly44 and two sheets of the Tabula Imperii Romani45,46, and the outlines of the main Roman roads and their milestones are provided in Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania47 and Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica48. A study of roads in the hinterland of Lepcis Magna (el-Khoms)49 and Cyrene50 provided detailed data that could be corroborated with modern satellite imagery and topographic maps, resulting in high accuracy of digitisation for the two cities. The road network for the Fezzan region was reconstructed based on the Archaeology of Fazzan51. Roads around Bani Walid, Misrata District, mostly follow wadi beds, along which settlements and water sources are concentrated, occasionally crossing rocky plateaus where indicated on modern topographic maps. However, their exact course, as with other desert roads, is hypothetical. Coastal roads in both Libya and Tunisia avoided sabkhas – seasonally inundated coastal salt pans not suitable for travel. Principal topographic maps used for coastal Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were 1:100,000 maps produced by the Army Map Service52,53. The desert area was covered by 1:250,000 maps by the Army Map Service54. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in Tripolitania and the city of Cyrene.

In Egypt, many desert routes were identified on both modern topographic maps and satellite imagery, following the approach to the identification of caravan routes outlined by Bubenzer and Bolten55. A specific problem is presented by the Nile Valley and its delta, which traditionally relied primarily on water transport. Both the Barrington Atlas56,57 and the Tabula Imperii Romani58 suggest a land route along the Nile and the delta, based on ancient sources (the Tabula Peutingeriana and the Antonine Itinerary); therefore, these roads were included. However, due to the regular flooding of the Nile and numerous waterworks in the valley (irrigation channels, dykes), the location of these roads is very uncertain and they were likely located closer to the edges of the Nile Valley (such as modern roads). The main reference work used for the Western Desert and Sinai was Paprocki59. Primary topographic maps used for Egypt were 1:250,000 maps by the Army Map Service54. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the Eastern Desert, Western Desert and the Nile Valley.

The road system in the Eastern Desert included in our dataset was developed by the ERC Desert Networks project (https://desertnetworks.huma-num.fr/). Our knowledge about these routes came from the Tabula Imperii Romani (sheet 36 Coptos)58, supplemented by regional surveys60,61 and archaeological work on the stations of the Coptos–Myos Hormos road62 and the Coptos–Berenike road63. However, the roads themselves and their exact routes were not well known as there are, e.g., no milestones. To overcome this lack of data, the Desert Networks project has adopted an original, semi-empirical approach, combining 1:50,000 scale maps from the Egyptian Survey Authorities, a DEM with a spatial resolution of 11 m, a corpus of 288 archaeological sites with precise locations, and 60 reconstructed itineraries by modern travellers (18th–19th centuries) who travelled through the desert in conditions comparable to Roman ones (environment, transport means and logistics)64. These data were used to calibrate various factors involved in camel caravan travel and to validate the least-cost routes calculated between sites. The modelled network was then used to generate routes, taking into account transport infrastructure, navigation conditions, difficulties of the terrain and the topographical constraints specific to camels. The Roman roads were reconstructed by calculating the least-cost paths65,66 between the known Roman road stations according to ancient sources (the Tabula Peutingeriana and the Antonine Itinerary, and ostraca found at the stations67). The occupation of most of them is well-dated thanks to recent excavations. It was thus possible to refine the route and propose an itinerary for each 50-year period between 1 CE and 300 CE, allowing us to consider the evolution of the network over time. The ERC Desert Networks project data were adapted to our data structure (removal of multiple overlapping segments, merging of segments diverging less than 200 m from each other, adjustment of start and end point vertices to archaeological sites).

The principal source for the southern Levant (Israel, Jordan, Palestinian Territories, southern Syria) is the Tabula Imperii Romani68, supplemented by numerous detailed studies on individual roads (Legio-Scythopolis69, Jerusalem-Jaffa70, Via Nova71,72,73, Gaza-Petra74), cities (Caesarea75, Jerusalem76, Petra77), and regions (Galilee78, southern Syria79, Negev80, north-east Jordan81). Many of the Roman roads were in continual use until the 20th century and are clearly marked on 19th/early 20th century maps, such as the Survey of Western Palestine82, or the 1:50,000 Levant map series by the French Army83. Many are still used to this day as modern paved roads or local field roads and tracks. In the case of Israel and the Palestinian Territories, high-resolution orthophotos and detailed 1:50,000 modern topographic maps were available on the Israeli government portal GovMap (https://www.govmap.gov.il/), which enabled digitisation with high spatial accuracy and resolution. Jordan was mostly covered by the French Army 1:50,000 Levant series and 1:250,000 topographic maps by the Army Map Service83,84. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and better coverage in the desert and mountainous regions.

A key overview of Lebanon and Syria is the study by Thomsen85 and by Bauzou86. The Syrian desert was covered by research by Antoine Poidebard and René Mouterde87,88. Northern Syria and southeastern Turkey was covered in the Tabula Imperii Byzantini project89 and Comfort90. Limited detailed studies were dedicated to only a few areas, mainly the city of Apamea91 and Antioch92. As in the southern Levant, many Roman roads have been used continually, corresponding to modern paved and unpaved roads marked on topographic maps (1:50,000 French Army series83) and visible on modern satellite imagery. The road system in flooded areas of the Atatürk and Assad dams was digitised over Corona satellite imagery and historical topographic maps recording the situation before the construction of the dams. The maps produced by Poidebard and Mouterde were corroborated with historical topographic maps (1:200,000 by the French Army93) and modern satellite imagery. The area between the Euphrates and the Taurus Mountains was covered by 1:100,000 military maps by the USSR General Staff94. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and better coverage in the Euphrates valley, and desert and pre-desert areas.

The roads of ancient Cyprus were described in detail by Bekker-Nielsen95, and a detailed survey was conducted on the Akamas Peninsula96. Most roads could be corroborated with historical roads recorded in Kitchener's survey of Cyprus (1:63,360)97 and modern topographic maps (1:50,000) by the Army Map Service98,99. Several roads not recorded on these maps (mainly on the Akamas Peninsula) could be identified on modern satellite imagery. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage across the island.

The principal source for the main Roman roads and their milestones in Asia Minor was the work by David French100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107 and the Tabula Imperii Byzantini10,12,13,14,15,16,108. This general survey is supplemented by various regional studies for the Euphrates frontier109, Cappadocia110,111, Pontus112, Lycia113, Caria114, and the Küçükmenderes valley115; and by further studies focusing on individual roads (Pilgrim's road116,117) and cities (Tavium118,119, Neoclaudiopolis120, Pergamum121, Aphrodisias122, and Sagalassos123).

Many Roman roads were in continual use until the 20th century and thus could be corroborated with Kiepert's Karte von Kleinasien (1:400,000)124 and the Deutsches Heereskarte (1:200,000)125 and with modern satellite imagery. The remainder of the roads mostly follow modern paved and unpaved roads as recorded on 1:100,000 USSR General Staff topographic maps94. A group of abandoned historical roads likely corresponding to Roman roads were identified on modern satellite imagery principally along the Euphrates frontier (the Melitene–Satala road) and in Lycia (the Patara–Phellos road above Kalkan, etc.). They were digitised in places where these could be corroborated with additional archaeological and historical data. In places where both historical and modern topographic maps lacked roads that could guide digitisation, a preference was given either to valley bottoms or ridges as suitable places for unobstructed travel. Particular problems occurred in digitising roads in dynamic fluvial environments where coastal progression and silting occurs. It necessitated using georeferenced maps published by geoarchaeological research in the Büyük Menderes126,127, Küçükmenderes128, and Dalyan129 river valleys. Detailed archaeological reports and visible remains identifiable on modern satellite imagery permitted the road network to be digitised in the vicinity of several cities with very high accuracy and detail (Ephesus, Magnesia130, Pergamum, Milet, Laodicea, Sagalassos, Tavium).

Mountain roads in Pisidia and Pamphylia (Termessus, Selge and Etenna, Antalya Province) were supplied as GPS tracks by Michele Massa and adapted to our data structure. These roads were digitised as part of a project aimed at creating a new archaeological trail in the region, and for the most part have not been published before with the exception of the ‘Döşeme Boğazı' (Via Sebasteia)131. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage, especially in western and north-eastern Asia Minor.

The road data for Bithynia were directly supplied by Barbora Weissova132 and adapted to our data structure. The first descriptions of Roman roads in Bithynia were published in the 19th century133,134,135,136. A fundamental contribution to the study of the road system represents W. M. Ramsay's The Historical Geography of Asia Minor137.

Bithynia was explored in the last two decades of the 19th century by von Diest, von der Goltz and Anton138,139,140,141,142. Results of their travels are particularly helpful for the present study as they brought to light 28 remains of pavements of roads and nine bridges with meticulous descriptions of their geographic positions, allowing for the rectification of the courses of ancient roads.

Researchers in the 20th century focused mainly on the reconstructions of the courses of the supra-regional Pilgrim's Road116,143,144 and the regional ‘Northern Road'145,146, leaving the course of the Pilgrim's Road in Nicomedia and following the eastern direction through Prusias ad Hypium-Claudiopolis–Cretia Flaviopolis–Hadrianopolis. The development of the roads from the Early Byzantine period onwards was examined by Belke108,147,148 and Avramea149.

Reconstructions in the present study were furthermore based on nodal points and roads compiled in the Barrington Atlas150, French's103 compendium of milestones in Pontus and Bithynia, and information about remains of roads and bridges scattered among regional archaeological and epigraphic studies and reports151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the Marmara region.

The milestones from Cilicia were first compiled by Theodor Mommsen in 1873 as part of CIL III160, in 1902 expanded together with Hirschfeld and Domaszewski, with milestones from Pamphylia and Cilicia. Additional milestone inscriptions in Cilicia were collected by Keil and Wilhelm161, and by Mitford and Bean162,163. French published several studies on local finds164,165,166,167,168 and a new catalogue of milestones169. In 2014, French provided a revised monograph, which includes new milestones from Cilicia106.

Sayar's essay published in 2002 on the ancient road connections of Cilicia in the Roman imperial period provided a repetition that was enriched with some milestone inscriptions, listed in Tabula Imperii Byzantini 5, of the road connections of Cilicia170.

Information from this prior research was combined with new surveys in Rough Cilicia (the regions of Anemurium-Anamur and Diocaesarea/Olba-Uzuncaburç), which began in 2011, to collect and publish milestone inscriptions from the area. During the fieldwork, several new Roman roads, showing connections between ancient cities, as well as new milestones, were discovered171,172,173,174, and previously published inscriptions were re-analysed and re-interpreted in some cases. The identified roads were recorded with GPS and entered into a topographic map (MapSource TOPO). To compile the milestone inscriptions, a database was developed using FileMaker Pro database software, in which the inscriptions were already entered. GPS tracks were adapted to our data structure and incorporated into the dataset. In comparison with previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the region.

Most of Greece, European Turkey, and parts of Bulgaria were covered by the Tabula Imperii Byzantini9,11,175,176. The Tabula Imperii Romani covered parts of Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, and southern Serbia177,178,179. Several maps from the Barrington Atlas were used as a basis to digitise especially secondary roads in Dacia (Romania), Moesia Superior and Moesia Inferior (Serbia and Bulgaria)180,181.

Detailed studies for Greece covered mainly the western Peloponnese182,183, including individual city territories (Corinth184 and Sicyon185), Attica186,187,188, Thessaly189, southern Euboea190, and lower Macedonia191. Pritchet described several individual roads192,193,194. The Via Egnatia, spanning from the Adriatic to the Bosporus, attracted most scholarly attention195,196,197,198,199. It was possible to corroborate most of the roads with the known historical roads presented on the Carte der Europaeischen Tuerkey (1:575,000)200, Carte de la Morée (1:200,000)201, Carte de la Grèce (1:900,000)202, Karten von Attika (1:25,000)203, and modern topographic maps (1:50,000 USSR General Staff)204, since many of these were used until the 20th century or they survive as local roads and tracks. In several cases, it was possible to identify the ancient roads on modern satellite imagery. Pikoulas182,183 provided precise GPS coordinates of the remains of roads which were used for digitisation. In other cases, the roads follow modern paved and unpaved roads and tracks, marked on modern topographic maps and visible satellite imagery. Several roads in the central Peloponnese (Arcadia) connecting Pheneos, Orchomenos, and Mantinea were added as hypothetical (based on the Carte de la Morée), since they must have existed in the Roman period. Coastal progression re-shaped the landscape in the deltas of several rivers, and georeferenced maps stemming from geoarchaeological research were used in these cases: the Vardar river205,206, the Sperchios river207,208, the Acheron river209 and the Kalamas river210. The road network of Crete should be treated as preliminary, since only limited studies were done on the cities of Aptera and Hierapytna211,212. The rest of the road network was reconstructed by connecting identified sites from the Tabula Peutingeriana with known and still existing historical roads identified by Pendelbury213 and corroborated on 1:50,000 British Army topographic maps. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in Attica, the Peloponnese, Acarnania, and Epirus.

The Roman and ancient road network in Albania was investigated mainly in its southern part214, along the Via Egnatia198, and in the city of Butrint215,216. For the remainder of the roads, the main reference was the Barrington Atlas180. Most of the digitised roads follow modern paved and unpaved roads and tracks found on the 1:50,000 topographic maps (USSR General Staff)217 and corroborated with modern satellite imagery. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted mainly in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the region of Butrint.

A principal overview for Roman roads in Serbia and Kosovo was Petrović7, more detailed albeit limited surveys were conducted around Viminacium (Kostolac, Serbia)218, Ulpiana (Gračanica/Graçanicë, Kosovo)219, and on the road Naissus (Niš, Serbia)–Ratiaria (Arčar, Bulgaria)220,221. For a variety of secondary roads, the main source was the Barrington Atlas180 and the Tabula Imperii Romani177, which were also principal sources for Northern Macedonia. All of the roads could be corroborated with historical and modern roads found on both historical and modern topographic maps (Yugoslavia 1:100,000 by the War Office, 1:575,000 Carte der Europaeischen Tuerkey, and 1:864,000 General-Karte der Europaeischen Turkei und des Konigreiches Griechenland)200,222,223 and identified on modern satellite imagery. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in several areas along the Danube (e.g., Viminacium).

An overview of Roman roads in Bulgaria was provided by Madžarov224, which was supplemented by a number of studies focusing on Via Militaris225, and the region of the middle Strymon river226. The lower Danube was treated by Panaite227 and Ţentea et al.228, and the geoarchaeological reconstruction of the landscape surrounding ancient Histria (Istria, Romania) was used to reconstruct the roads approaching the city229. The only additional source for European Turkey, besides the Tabula Imperii Byzantini, was a study of a ‘North Road' by Karaca230. Many of the Roman roads remained in continual use until the 20th century and it was possible to corroborate them with historical topographic maps (Bulgaria 1:126,000, 1:575,000 Carte der Europaeischen Tuerkey, and 1:864,000 General-Karte der Europaeischen Turkei und des Konigreiches Griechenland)200,222,231 and modern topographic maps (1:100,000 USSR General Staff)232. Some roads that do not appear on these maps (mainly along the lower Danube and the Danube delta) were digitised using modern paved and unpaved roads and tracks that connect the ancient sites obtained from modern satellite imagery. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in all areas south of the Danube.

The Roman roads of Dacia (Romania) were treated by Fodorean233,234. The data on Roman sites was improved by consulting the dataset of archaeological sites from the National Archaeological Repertory (RAN) of Romania (http://ran.cimec.ro/). Most of these roads were corroborated with historical topographic maps (1:200,000 by Austria-Hungary military mapping), modern topographic maps (1:100,000 USSR General Staff)235,236, and modern satellite imagery. The roads typically follow the course of modern paved and unpaved roads, and tracks. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the Transylvanian plateau.

The roads in central Italy have Rome as a focal point, they are numerous, many are named and are well known237. The roads published in the Barrington Atlas synthesised the previously published information and were used as a starting point. It was supplemented by the works of Crainz and Giuliani238 and Valenti239. The digital documentation offered by the Appia Regina Viarum (http://appia.beniculturali.it/appia/) project has been used to reconstruct the course of the Via Appia. Works used to identify possible road layouts in Northern Italy include, Bosio240 and Mateazzi27 for the Venice area, Page241 and Luccardini242 for the Po valley and Liguria, and Nouvel and Cramate243 for Alpine routes, in addition to the Barrington Atlas244,245. Finally, most of the Roman roads of Puglia, Basilicata and Calabria have been digitised following the Barrington Atlas246,247 and using sources such as Zocco248 and Ceraudo249. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the Alpine piedmont.

The road data is based on the work by Prof. Giuseppina Renda250,251,252,253, which in turn is based on a diversity of sources: archaeological documentation, fieldwalking and direct knowledge of the territory, combined with literary and ancient itineraria, epigraphic, ancient and contemporary cartographic sources, and supported by remote sensing and spatial analysis. The dataset originates from field surveys of the tracks, combined with the digitisation of ancient cartography and the results of photo interpretation and archaeological excavation. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in Campania.

The location of Roman roads in Sardinia was digitised using the Roman road system as presented by Attilio Mastino254 and digitised by Lewis255. Roman roads were predominantly identified from excavation and survey data. Where possible, in-situ milestones were also utilised. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted mainly in increased spatial accuracy.

In Narbonensis (southern France), one of the most important roads was the Via Domitia, which has been studied by Laforgue et al.256. The territory and the roads from this region have been studied by Leveau257. The eastern part of this region was published by Leveau and Segard258 (after Benoit259), while Passelac260 has been working on the route of the Via Aquitania. In the region of Aquitania, we relied on data from the Aquitaviae research group, who conducted a field survey of Roman roads (https://aquitaviae.hypotheses.org/). Some of the most recent sources used to digitise Roman roads in this region have been Baret261 and Cribeller262. For completing the Lugdunensis province (northern and central France), the work of Bayard and Lemaire263, Cloppet264, Cribellier265, Ferdière, Monnier and Cassard were used266. Nouvel and Venault267 studied the Roman roads of the Alps. Provost268 and Taboué269 were primary sources for north-east of France. For the region of Bretagne, we also have used the information provided by the Voies Romaines de Bretagne (https://voies-romaines-bretagne.com/index.html). In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in northern France and Belgium.

As general sources, we have used Arias' publication about all Roman roads of the Iberian peninsula270, completing certain areas with information from the Barrington Atlas271,272,273,274. The northeastern territories have been studied in detail by de Soto275. Magallón276 published all the Roman roads of the central and western Pyrenees and Pre-Pyrenees regions. Arasa and Rosselló277 published a book about the Roman roads of the western coast of the peninsula. The Roman roads of the Baetican province have been studied by Corso278 and Sillières279. Lusitania and the Portuguese territories were studied by Mantas and Alvarez Martinéz280. For the territory of Castilla y León, the principal source was Moreno Gallo (https://www.viasromanas.net/). Finally, to complete the Northwestern part of the Iberian peninsula, we used the work done by Argüelles-Álvarez281, Güimill-Fariña and Parcero-Oubiña282, Losada Pérez283 and Rodríguez Colmenero284. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage across the whole of the Iberian peninsula.

The principal reference source for the digitisation of roads in the upper Germanian and upper Danubian provinces (Raetia, Noricum) and the Alps was the Barrington Atlas244,285 and Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum286, which also provided data on the milestones and the itineraries. The communication and exchange networks in the Alps were examined by Flügel et al.287. The routes starting in the Po valley and leading up to the Alpine passes were examined by Bosio240. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted mainly in increased spatial accuracy.

The principal reference source for the digitisation of roads in Pannonia (roughly modern day Hungary, on the left bank of the Danube and eastern Austria) was the Barrington Atlas288. A comprehensive description of the Limes road and associated sites was provided by the Danube Limes project, conducted in the context of inscribing the Danubian Limes as a UNESCO World Heritage Site289,290. Recent research concentrated on the site of Brigetio (Komárom, Hungary)291. The local road network in the hinterland of Savaria (Szombathely, Hungary) was briefly examined by Borhy et al.292 and around nearby Arrabona (Győr, Hungary) by Teichner293. The road network around the legionary camp and the civil settlement at Carnuntum (Petronell and Bad Deutsch-Altenburg, Austria) was based on the published maps by Gugl et al.294. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in the region of Carnuntum.

The reconstructions of the Dutch Roman road system south of the Rhine are based primarily on registered observations in the Dutch national archaeological database system, ARCHIS (https://archis.cultureelerfgoed.nl/), and are supplemented with information from the Dutch national repository for archaeological research data, DANS DataverseNL (https://dataverse.nl/dataverse/dans/). While usually quite accurate in terms of location, many observations have low degrees of accuracy when it comes to dating, simply being referred to as ‘Roman'. Establishing an end date for the observed segments is often especially problematic. Coverage is best for the western part of the Rhine frontier (from Utrecht to the North Sea) and in the province of Limburg (the valley of the Maas and the so-called Via Belgica). Conjectured and hypothesised road sections are mostly based on maps and descriptions in the secondary literature295,296,297,298. These mostly rely on archaeological, historical and topographical analysis, and their accuracy can often not be assessed. Notably, reconstructions for the southwestern part of the Netherlands (Zeeland, parts of Zuid-Holland and most of Noord-Brabant) are either absent or have no underlying evidence, due to the major changes of the landscape since the Roman period. No additional modelling or reconstruction was attempted. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage along the Rhine.

For the Scheldt and Meuse basins, the project used the detailed reconstructions by M.-H. Corbiau299,300,301,302,303, supplemented by various regional studies297,304,305,306,307,308,309. Despite a large amount of data, several regions remain underrepresented, such as the (Campine) Meuse-Demer-Scheldt area. Notably, the dataset exclusively relies on digitisation of published sources and does not represent additional analyses. The data was compiled as part of the project Inland Waterways in the Roman Transport Network of the Gallic and Germanic Provinces (c. 50 BC–c. AD 400, https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/projects/inland-waterways-roman-transport-network-gallic-and-germanic-provinces). In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted in increased spatial accuracy and increased coverage in north-eastern France and Belgium.

The reconstruction of the Roman road system in Britain is primarily based on recorded observations by Margary310. Additional roads in the south-east midlands of Britain are conjectured by the Viatores group311. These two sources were digitised by Bishop312. To create an interconnected network, a number of road sections were connected using straight lines313. In comparison to previous datasets, this work resulted mainly in increased spatial accuracy.

A data cleaning phase was designed for this collaborative data collection effort, which included three steps: 1) ensuring consistent use of standardised terminology across data records; 2) proofreading and corrections of all textual fields; 3) checking for topological continuity and identifying topological errors in the vector polyline layer containing road segments. First, standardised terminology was applied to all fields following Table 2 (e.g., ‘Main Road'/'Secondary Road', ‘CE'/'BCE', etc.). Second, all ancient place names were corrected to conform to the Latin and Greek versions as recorded in the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World8 and the Pleiades dataset. Modern place names were derived from modern topographic maps, but omitting diacritic marks and other grammatical markings. Diacritics were retained only for personal names in the ‘Citation' and ‘Bibliography' fields. Third, the vector geometry of all road segments was checked, so that all are cut to intersections with other roads and are connected with (i.e., snapped to) vertices at the intersections. Continuity of road names and itineraries was checked, so they do not contain gaps or are not otherwise disconnected (e.g., the ‘Via Appia' will be presented as a continuous line of vector segments, same as all roads belonging to the ‘Tabula Peutingeriana' itinerary). The data cleaning was performed manually in GIS by a small team of three people over the course of four months.

The dataset is available in an open Zenodo repository314 with a canonical citation315. It contains 14,769 data records (road segments) and is stored as a polyline vector layer in the shapefile format (itinere_roads.shp), as a geopackage (itinere_roads.gpkg), and as a geojson database (itinere_roads.geojson). The shapefile and geopackage is projected onto the WGS 1984 World Mercator (EPSG:3395) coordinate system, while the geojson database is in the WGS 1984 (EPSG:4326) coordinate system. The Zenodo repository was chosen over a subject-specific repository to encourage findability and reuse beyond the field of archaeology, given the cross-disciplinary value of the dataset. The total size of the shapefile and associated files is 144 MB; the geopackage is 33.62 MB; the geojson database is 78.05 MB. The files can be opened in any GIS software or spatial database. Each data record contains only a shortened bibliographical reference (name and year), and all full references are stored in an openly accessible Zotero bibliography (https://www.zotero.org/groups/5141113/itiner-e) and attached to the Zenodo repository in bibtex format (.bib). The unchanging version of the dataset as described in this article is stored on Zenodo314 with a canonical citation (https://itiner-e.org/).

The available sources differ significantly between regions of the former Roman Empire due to preservation and research biases (see Methods). Some areas have good preservation of traces of roads in the landscape, while in others it is more obscured due to land use and building activity; some areas received vast amounts of research attention in the form of surveys and excavations, and others have not. The accessibility to the authors of sources and local knowledge from the roughly 40 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia that lie inside the boundaries of the former Roman Empire has also put practical limits on completeness. Some areas concern a significant increase in the number and accuracy of roads (e.g., the Iberian Peninsula, Egypt, Greece), others a significant increase in accuracy (e.g., the southern Levant), and yet others remained more similar to previous digitisations but with added metadata (e.g., some Central European regions). This has resulted in heterogeneities across the dataset in road density, spatial accuracy of road digitisation, and source reliability.

We evaluate and visualise this incompleteness and heterogeneity of the data by using the terminology and methodology proposed by Oštir et al.316 and Nuninger et al.317 to create a set of maps: road density (Fig. 5a) and number of vertices (Fig. 5b) are combined in a representativity map (Fig. 5c), which is in turn combined with source reliability (Fig. 6b), into a final confidence map (Fig. 6c). By establishing these maps as the basis for current knowledge about Roman roads, it will be possible to address some of these gaps through future projects that will further improve the digitised routes on our map through collaborative efforts.

The representativity map (c) is created by numerically reclassifying and summarizing the (a) road density map and (b) vertex count map.

The confidence map is created by numerically reclassifying and summing the (a) representativity and (b) reliability maps. (c) Roman road data overlaid on the confidence map.

The research area was divided into polygons measuring 0.5° × 0.5° (latitude and longitude). Polygons overlapping the ocean and seas were clipped to follow the coastlines. Polygons were only included in the confidence maps if they met two criteria: 1) intersecting with at least one road segment; 2) within the boundaries of the Roman Empire. This means polygons containing no road data in our dataset were excluded from the confidence analysis, including desert areas and small islands (e.g., Malta). The results for polygons at the borders of the analysis region (Fig. 5) suffer from edge effects: they receive lower values than would be expected, due either to the polygon that extends beyond the borders of the Empire not covered in this research (Lower Rhine, Upper and Middle Danube) or to small seacoast polygons with few road segments.

The aim of the representativity map (Fig. 5c) is to visualise and quantify the spatial heterogeneity, resolution, and accuracy of the collected data. Representativity in the current context of the road dataset means two things: a) whether a region contains many roads that likely represent a complete road network (coverage), and b) whether roads are digitised in high detail (spatial resolution). To describe the dataset regarding coverage and resolution we use road density (m/km2, Fig. 5a) and vertices (number of vertices/km, Fig. 5b). Vertices represent edit points of each road segment in our dataset and in this way directly reflect the level of spatial resolution with which each road segment was digitised (roads digitised in higher resolution will have more vertices than roads digitised in lower resolution). The data were standardised within the polygons (units of analysis) in relation to the global (theoretical) mean value. In this way, we can compare the differences across regions to find areas where the data conforms to the average, is overrepresented, or is underrepresented compared to the global mean value. On the one hand it will be possible to identify areas of high road density and high resolution, which are therefore highly representative of the potentially complete Roman road network. On the other hand it will be possible to identify areas of low road density and low resolution, i.e., areas where the road network is underrepresented in the dataset. We employ these two metrics (road density and vertices) to analyse representativity for several reasons. Taking into account only road density would underrepresent areas where lower road density is expected (such as mountains, deserts, etc.). On the other hand, considering only vertices would overrepresent areas with complicated road profiles – such as mountains where roads tend to be more sinuous than on plains. By combining these two metrics it is possible to better capture overall representativity of the dataset and to mitigate effects caused by its heterogeneity.

The mean value used is the global road density computed as the fraction of total road length over the total area of the polygons.

Global road density = 299,171,310.141 m / 4,819,775 km2  = 62.07 m/km2

The road density for each polygon is then calculated and the mean expected value (global road density) is subtracted from the values in the polygons.

Difference in road density = Road density in a polygon – Global road density

The resulting difference values are then classified into four categories representing the difference of the local road density compared to the global road density calculated in multiples of the global road density 62.07 (Table 3). The cut-off values were adapted and modified from the original methodology used by Oštir and Nuninger316,317. A value of ‘0' represents no difference from the global road density, so the value between 0–1 times the global road density are considered as ‘Average' representativity. Below ‘0' signifies lower representativity than the global road density. The values for ‘Above Average' and ‘Exceptional' represent a difference of 1–4 times, and more than 4 times higher than the difference from the global road density respectively.

The values of vertices per road length are normalised in a similar fashion as with the road density, first a global value is calculated:

Global vertices per road length = 1,031,791 vertices / 299,171.31 km = 3.448 vertices/km

The values are aggregated for each polygon of analysis and the global value is subtracted from the value of each polygon. This difference is divided into four categories (Table 4), based on the same rule as was done previously with the road density categories above.

To compose the final representativity map, the reclassified values of both road density and vertex count (Tables 3 and 4) are added together and divided by two (both categories are given equal weight). The resulting number is rounded down to arrive at the final representativity value used in the representativity map (Fig. 5c, Table 5). E.g., if the road density value is ‘Average' (30) and vertex count ‘Above Average' (20), the resulting value is calculated as 30 + 20 = 50, 50/2 = 25, and 25 is rounded to 20 (‘Above Average'). We chose to round the values to the ‘better' category in order to reflect that at least one of the used metrics is more representative for the description of the data in the affected unit of analysis.

The representativity map (Figs. 5c; 6a) visualises and quantifies the spatial heterogeneity, resolution, and accuracy of the collected data316,317. Of the 38.93% of the study area that has low representativity, 20.63% concerns deserts and 6.48% mountainous areas. Future data collection efforts should focus in particular on the remaining 11.82% of low representativity in areas including Northern England, Cornwall, the Upper and Middle Danube, Tuscany and Marche in Italy, Corsica, Sardinia, and central Anatolia.

The aim of the reliability map (Fig. 6b; Table 6) is to assess the quality of the sources used for the road data collection. This represents a value judgement about the sources used by the researchers responsible for the data collection on a region-by-region basis. Three categories of reliability are defined: high, medium, and low. High reliability represents areas with ample and detailed academic publications, often composed of large national projects (e.g., the Carte archéologique de la Gaule in France) or regional surveys and syntheses providing data in high-resolution spatial accuracy. Medium reliability is reserved for less detailed and lower-resolution sources, which in our case include some of the previous efforts mapping the Roman world (the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, Tabula Imperii Romani, and Tabula Imperii Byzantini) whose data were re-digitised and upscaled using additional sources and our methodology described above. Low reliability represents regions with little coverage in past scholarship or with very low resolution of data and therefore low reliability of the digitised geometry of the roads. In other instances, it represents areas where our own digitisation efforts only used previous large-scale and low-resolution resources (the Barrington Atlas). The reliability categories are reclassified into a numeric code using the following key:

The high reliability areas in North Africa, the Near East, Asia Minor, and Greece represent some of the more recent detailed regional-focused research projects (e.g., the Desert Networks project in the Eastern Desert of Egypt). The high reliability of Spain is thanks to the previous efforts of the Mercator-e project (https://fabricadesites.fcsh.unl.pt/mercator-e/). The high reliability of France and the Benelux countries is thanks to research carried out by project collaborators (Philip Verhagen and Toon Bongers). The moderate reliability of Portugal, Britain, Italy and the eastern Balkans is due to employing lower resolution sources, mostly region-based overviews. Most low reliability desert areas represent regions with only ‘Hypothetical' road segments, i.e., segments with very low reliability in the digitised geometry and outdated scholarship. The two large Mediterranean islands – Corsica and Crete – together with the western Balkans and the Upper and Middle Danube region are covered only using the low-resolution maps published in the Barrington Atlas.

The representativity and reliability maps were subsequently combined to create the confidence map (Fig. 6c). It is meant as a tool to evaluate confidence and reliability in spatial analysis results that use the data316,317. The representativity and reliability maps are reclassified into numerical values, rasterized, and using map algebra added up to create a simple matrix of summed representativity and reliability.

The confidence map (Fig. 6c) reveals areas for which open digital data collection should be prioritised: categories 33, 42 and 43 (39.51%). Among the more significant missing data gaps in this category are several areas of northern Italy (Tuscany, Marche, and northern Po valley), the western Danube, western Balkans, and Corsica. Other areas in these categories concern deserts or suffer from edge effects (see Units of analysis). Curious is the case of high reliability and low representativity areas mainly in Western Europe (category 41, 7.73%) – some (especially upland) areas exhibit lower digitisation resolution, while in other areas the environmental factors influencing human settlement and movement potential might lower representativity (such as floodplains of the lower Rhine and Landes de Gascogne).

While developing the methodology, we consulted with area experts to better understand local historical and environmental conditions that shaped the Roman road network. This expert knowledge helped to improve our methodological workflow and our understanding of the Roman road network in its complexity. There is inherent bias in all archaeological and historical data, stemming from human and geomorphological transformation processes, accidents of survival, and research biases. Throughout this process we attempted to minimise the potential for errors and omissions that would negatively impact the resulting dataset. The resulting dataset reflects these biases as shown on the confidence map, whilst representing the most comprehensive open digital dataset of Roman roads.

Itiner-e is valuable for future research on ancient mobility and trade, and the long-term development of transport infrastructure in Europe, the Near East and North Africa. Its spatial resolution means it can be used for both regional and Empire-wide studies. Our confidence map can be used to support future data collection work that can focus on areas of particularly low reliability and representativity to continue to fill in the gaps. Such focused work can expect particular growth in the knowledge about the existence and location of secondary roads. We also present an online platform (https://itiner-e.org) that allows Itiner-e to grow, and to address the incompleteness and heterogeneity revealed by our confidence maps (Fig. 7). The Itiner-e platform allows a scholarly community to add new road data as it becomes available, or to recommend corrections and alternative interpretations of existing road data.

The dataset is available in an open Zenodo314 repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17122148) and with a canonical citation on the Itiner-e platform (https://itiner-e.org). The Zenodo repository contains the data stored in shapefile format (itinere_roads.shp and associated files), as a geopackage (itinere_roads.gpkg), and as a geojson database (itinere_roads.geojson). In addition, it contains a data field description file (Data field description.docx) and bibliography file (Itiner-e bibliography.bib).

No customised code was produced to create or analyse this dataset. Specifically, the data was manually digitised with a target spatial resolution of 5–200 m on a GIS platform and stored as a single data record in a vector layer with an associated attribute table. The dataset is available on Zenodo at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17122148.

Not another damn light bulb. That's what you might be thinking if you've been following smart-home tech for the past decade or, indeed, building out your own fortress of missed connections.

The first Nest thermostat launched in 2011, Philips Hue in 2012, the Amazon Echo in 2014. But for anyone who has spent long nights scrolling through IoT troubleshooting forums since then, here's the latest: It's finally time for a do-over. Everyone's agreed that the open source interoperability standard Matter, which has Apple, Google, and Amazon signed up, is the answer, and Ikea has 20-odd new and improved devices to boost the case.

It's very much back to basics with this new Matter-compatible line-up of eleven KAJPLATS smart lightbulbs, five different sensors, a GRILLPLATS smart plug and—likely to be the most popular of the lot—two BILRESA multi-device remotes. These will roll out to IKEA stores globally, in many cases a straight swap for the old Zigbee equivalents from the TRÅDFRI ranges, including the UK and Europe from January 2026, but products might start to pop up in stores as early as this November. In the US, the new sensors and remotes will launch in January with the light bulbs following in April, alongside the smart plug.

First, those two BILRESA remotes: handheld, cute, and ergonomic. There's one with two buttons that can be set to trigger different functions across any Matter device: Switch bulbs on and off, change brightness and color, adjust the volume of a speaker, switch smart blinds up and down, switch between pre-set scenes. The scroll-wheel remote is more advanced: “We refer to this as the room remote,” says Ikea's global head of product strategy David Granath. This one has three LEDs and allows you to quickly toggle between controlling three different groups of devices: lights, audio, whatever, via one remote. The BILRESAs will be available to buy standalone and in kits of three of the same format.

Second, the sensors. Again, these are replacing older Ikea iterations, with feature tweaks here and there. There's a MYGGSPRAY indoor and outdoor motion sensor that can trigger smart lighting, a MYGGBETT door and window sensor which sends alerts to your phone, and a KLIPPBOK water leakage sensor for sinks and appliances. The TIMMERFLOTTE sensor checks temperature and humidity and the ALPSTUGA sensor adds air quality to that mix.

And then there are the KAJPLATS smart bulbs. Ikea is moving away from its current “warm white” focus by introducing dimmable, color, and white spectrum options with higher intensity spans. The range includes E27/E26 standard globe bulbs, compact E14/E12/E17 bulbs and GU10 spotlights with clear-glass options for just the white spectrum bulbs. The GRILLPLATS smart plug is designed for lamps and small appliances; it works with the remotes and motion sensors and tracks energy use. So far, so standard.

One key difference, aside from the Matter compatibility, is that prices are going to be lower across the board. Very low, in fact. In the UK, the KAJPLATS bulbs will go for between £4 and £9 each, versus £7 to £10 for TRÅDFRI bulbs. Pricing will be £3 for the dual button remote and £4 for the scroll-wheel remote, down from £5 and £7, respectively.

Meanwhile, four of the basic sensors will cost between £5 and £7 each and the higher-end ALPSTUGA air quality sensor will be £25, as compared to the £35 VINDSTYRKA it replaces. Ikea's reps say prices will vary across Europe and the US, but that affordability is a priority worldwide. The idea is that the difference in price, if there even is one, between the smart devices and non-connected equivalents will be down to “a euro or two” per product, to motivate more of Ikea's one billion in-store customers a year to build out smart homes.

“I probably have well above 100 smart devices in my home, but I also have like 10 different hubs. I hate it,” says David Granath, Ikea's global range manager for home electronics. “Right now I control some energy stuff through Homey, and I control my lights through Ikea Home smart, but then there's something else somewhere else and I can't get it to work together. That's not a smart home. That's a home for smart people, maybe, but that's not where we want to be.”

Granath acknowledges that for “many, many years” the smart home has been “a vision” that gets talked about a lot but doesn't really materialize. In the 2010s, the Zigbee protocol was the best the Ikea team could find for its first smart bulbs. The challenge of simultaneously connecting individual products via Touchlink—a Zigbee feature that allowed for linking smart devices—while also “building silos” between ecosystems was identified early on.

He points out that Ikea is on the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) board, and has been actively contributing to the development of the Matter platform since its 2019-2021 Project CHIP days: “It's just now that lately we've been able, as a company, to take a strategic position to switch altogether.”

Last September, Ikea updated its DIRIGERA smart-home hub, which itself has been the focus of connectivity and compatibility headaches on the forums, with support for Matter. This includes functioning as a Matter bridge, connecting older Ikea devices—rhe ones based on Zigbee tech—to the wider ecosystem instead of rendering them total junk.

The Matter ecosystem is not truly universal yet; the industry continues to work towards it. Whole categories of connected products, such as smart security cameras, video doorbells, robot vacuum cleaners, and smart locks are waiting for Matter support. Enthusiasts have been digitally soldering together the gaps between best-in-class devices, made by different brands, for years at this point, if not decades for hardcore automation tinkerers.

Sadly, there's not much here for the real smart-home heads. “The early adopters will obviously appreciate lower prices, and I think most will appreciate the interoperability, not having to buy a specific hub and actually being able to use what they have at home,” says Granath. “I think they will also like some of the improvements we've done on the remotes, not needing a separate remote for everything.” He's also aware that for the vast majority of Ikea customers, “Matter doesn't matter.” It's simply the thing that gets them lower prices and, in theory, far fewer set-up snafus.

The ALPSTUGA air-quality sensor is probably the device pointing to the direction in which Ikea's contributions to future smart homes are heading. Like its predecessor, the VINDSTYRKA, it can connect to IKEA's air purifiers to adjust fan speed depending on the levels of PM2.5 particulates in the indoor air—currently this is done manually via the app with full automation between the devices on the way as a next step. This new ALPSTUGA iteration also adds CO2 monitoring.

“We're improving some of the sensors, taking in the feedback we've gotten along the way, trying to make them more useful,” Granath says. “I actually brought one home. I installed it in my living room, and my wife said ‘Oh another smart product,' but I told her ‘OK, but keep an eye on the CO2 values. If it's under a thousand, you'll sleep better.' Now she's manically checking the levels, opening the doors and trying to get the number down.”

Another strand to explain why this is not, in fact, a techy Groundhog Day, reliving 2012 over and over again, is where AI now fits into the smart home: “Matter is one piece of that puzzle,"" Granath says. “It's a good foundation in terms of technology to create this shift. And with AI maturing, we're at the point where the infrastructure, the connectivity, and the actual intelligence will coincide and actually create that intelligent home we're looking for.”

That said, he speculates we're still around five years from the reality of a fully connected and intercompatible home containing smart sensors and cameras that understand the space, products that intuitively act on our behalf, and physical, inclusive, and “democratic” devices to help people from all generations interact with the home: remotes, voice assistants, and screens that blend in and just work rather than relying on smartphone apps.

There is what Granath calls “a healthy friction internally” within Ikea around the development and launch of the new Matter-ready slate: “A lot of people out in retail are super excited because they get a lot of questions about this, right? And then you have some people that are always pushing simplicity and affordability so ‘Is this too complex? Is this affordable enough?'”

When the scale of this latest Ikea range was first teased this summer, some industry insiders suggested it was a milestone for Matter going mainstream. Granath compares the pace of smart home progress to another gradual tech evolution: “It's taken longer, but if you take how we listen to music, we used to have bookcases full of CDs and now everyone's streaming, and it just feels like a natural technological shift.”

He also stresses that Ikea is not approaching any of this innovation like a tech company, and works to its own timeframes. “At one point, I know our CEO [Jesper Brodin] was working on new strategies and asking Ingbar [Kamprad], our founder, ‘What's the time perspective? Should I look five years or 10 years ahead?' And Ingbar was saying ‘Well, look 50 or so,'” Granath says. “We're not on the stock exchange, so we have that possibility. And to be fair, for 80 years we've been trying to fulfill people's needs and dreams in their homes. It doesn't matter if it takes a week or if it takes 20 years.”

So you're hosting a holiday party. You've got the snacks and drinks, the music and the mood lighting, but how do you create a truly festive atmosphere? Aromatherapy, that's how.

When a guest walks in the front door, they assess the general vibe with multiple senses simultaneously. Mood lighting and jolly jingles in the back go a long way, but you can put guests at ease and create a pleasant experience from the moment they take their first breath in your space. I spoke with multiple experts to get tips and tricks on how to hack your party atmosphere to create the ultimate festive holiday vibe. Here's how to have the best-smelling house on the block.

Everyone I spoke to has a different opinion on what “smells good.” In fact, some etiquette experts advise forgoing scent entirely to avoid possibly offending anyone. But holiday parties are stinky places! Different guests have different perfumes, colognes, and other smells. There's food, there are drinks, there are probably some pets around, there's the entire bathroom to think of. Really strong smells can trigger headaches or nausea in sensitive guests, so it's best to pick subtle, people-pleasing fragrances that harmonize the space without overpowering it. When in doubt, keep it simple.

Iryna Kolosvetova, founder of Fine Dining 4 Home, says she loves balancing “warmth, comfort, and sophistication” with scents like amber, balsam, and firewood (for coziness), or citrus, clove, and pine (for crisp, festive energy). She recommends avoiding scents that are too sweet, synthetic, or heavy—strong rose, sweet vanilla cupcake, or gardenia, for example, can feel cloying rather than inviting. She also says to steer clear of distinctive scents like peppermint or pumpkin, which can become overwhelming and often have their own olfactory associations.

LaRen Johnson, fragrance industry trend analyst, says, “Natural scents like vanilla, a rustic woodland, or warm santal work well at evoking that holiday feeling while not drowning out the scents of your lovely party foods.”

Kolosvetova recommends choosing layered, refined, and subtle scents. Pine, fir, woods, and spice can feel cooling and fresh rather than sticky or heavy.

Jim Reding, CEO of Aroma Retail, says resinous, minty, and spicy scents work well because “they are powerful reminders of the good times before,” and Harry Slatkin, founder of Slatkin & Co., recommends warm additions like sandalwood and vanilla for a luxuriant, cozy atmosphere.

And your guests might have different tastes than the experts do. According to a 2024 survey of 120 individuals, conducted by Aura Cacia (an essential oils company), the most popular scents were cinnamon and gingerbread, with scents like cookies, peppermint, apple cider, and pine being less popular. I, for one, absolutely despise baked-good scents, whereas my best friend can't get enough of them. Again, when in doubt, keep it simple—citrus or plant notes are generally agreeable.

The ideal method of delivery depends on the space you're scenting. Kolosvetova says that candles are her go-to for both scent and ambiance. Generally, experts recommend lighting candles about 30 minutes to an hour before guests arrive; that way, the scent is fully dispersed and the wax at the top is fully melted to have a nice, glowy effect. (We have a buying guide of the Best Scented Candles for recommendations!)

Reding recommends using different scents in different areas. Go with something appetizing in the kitchen, something cozy and fresh in the living room, and something clean and fruity in the entryway to create a welcoming experience. Other experts agreed with this, generally: You don't want your bathroom to smell like food, and you don't want the kitchen to smell like a spa. Match the vibes accordingly!

When it comes to the dining room, Kolosvetova says scentless candles are best so that you aren't competing with food aromas. But she did share a pro tip: “A light linen mist on napkins adds a chic, subtle touch.” And Johnson says that wax melts might be ideal over candles, since they're flameless and allow the host to be fully present without sacrificing peace of mind. (I've personally used Happy Wax melts and had a good experience.)

A diffuser can be beneficial for scenting your home too. Our Essential Oil Diffuser Buying Guide is full of recommendations for machines that can perfume the air, with or without steam. They're great flameless options and usually work in conjunction with essential oils so you can customize a blend (though you can also buy fragrance oils that are already mixed). If you're diffusing, start the machines up about 20 to 30 minutes before your guests arrive.

Based on my many conversations with experts, it seems like layering with multiple methods is the way to go. And Slatkin agrees, saying he likes to use candles paired with a fragrance mist to scent his home. Slatkin also recommends ensuring that you have a scented hand wash in place for guests to use, and to disperse scents throughout the home (like multiple candles) rather than keeping them confined to one area.

Elena Mercurio, aromatherapy educator and clinical herbalist at Aura Cacia, recommends starting with a room spray to freshen the air without getting too heavy-handed. She also recommends adding a few drops of essential oils (like orange or lemon) to trash cans, drains, and toilet paper rolls (the cardboard part!) to keep everything smelling fresh throughout your home. Just keep in mind that some essential oils can be harmful to pets.

And you might be able to scent the air without going shopping for anything special. Multiple experts recommended a reliable, old-fashioned simmer pot. Simply bring a pot of water to a simmer on your stove and add in spicy, sweet, fragrant ingredients like cinnamon sticks, cloves, orange peel, and vanilla for a scrumptious fragrance that'll waft through the air. Johnson adds apple slices to hers, too. (Just make sure to add water as needed.) Of course, this might not be ideal if you need to use your stovetop for cooking, but it is a solid option worth considering.

“The key is timing and layering: Start subtle before guests arrive, refresh midway if needed, and let the fragrance fade softly as the evening winds down,” says Kolosvetova.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Mark Zuckerberg Opened an Illegal School at His Palo Alto Compound. His Neighbors Revolted","https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-school-palo-alto-shut-down/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

The Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto, California, has some of the best real estate in the country, with a charming hodgepodge of homes ranging in style from Tudor revival to modern farmhouse and contemporary Mediterranean. It also has a gigantic compound that is home to Mark Zuckerberg, his wife Priscilla Chan, and their daughters Maxima, August, and Aurelia. Their land has expanded to include 11 previously separate properties, five of which are connected by at least one property line.

The Zuckerberg compound's expansion first became a concern for Crescent Park neighbours as early as 2016, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market. Then, about five years later, neighbors noticed that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. This would be illegal under the area's residential zoning code without a permit. They began a crusade to shut it down that did not end until summer 2025.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

WIRED obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the neighborhood dispute—including 311 records, legal filings, construction plans, and emails—through a public record request filed to the Palo Alto Department of Planning and Development Services. (Mentions of “Zuckerberg” or “the Zuckerbergs” appear to have been redacted. However, neighbors and separate public records confirm that the property in question belongs to the family. The names of the neighbors who were in touch with the city were also redacted.)

The documents reveal that the school may have been operating as early as 2021 without a permit to operate in the city of Palo Alto. As many as 30 students might have enrolled, according to observations from neighbors. These documents also reveal a wider problem: For almost a decade, the Zuckerbergs' neighbors have been complaining to the city about noisy construction work, the intrusive presence of private security, and the hordes of staffers and business associates causing traffic and taking up street parking.

Over time, neighbors became fed up with what they argued was the city's lack of action, particularly with respect to the school. Some believed that the delay was because of preferential treatment to the Zuckerbergs. “We find it quite remarkable that you are working so hard to meet the needs of a single billionaire family while keeping the rest of the neighborhood in the dark,” reads one email sent to the city's Planning and Development Services Department in February. “Just as you have not earned our trust, this property owner has broken many promises over the years, and any solution which depends on good faith behavioral changes from them is a failure from the beginning.”

Palo Alto spokesperson Meghan Horrigan-Taylor told WIRED that the city “enforces zoning, building, and life safety rules consistently, without regard to who owns a property.” She also refuted the claim that neighbors were kept in the dark, claiming that the city's approval of construction projects at the Zuckerberg properties “were processed the same way they are for any property owner.” She added that, though some neighbors told the city they believe the Zuckerbergs received “special treatment,” that is not accurate.

“Staff met with residents, conducted site visits, and provided updates by phone and email while engaging the owner's representative to address concerns,” Horrigan-Taylor said. “These actions were measured and appropriate to abate the unpermitted use and responsive to neighborhood issues within the limits of local and state law.”

According to The New York Times, which first reported on the school's existence, it was called “Bicken Ben School” and shared a name with one of the Zuckerbergs' chickens. The listing for Bicken Ben School, or BBS for short, in a California Department of Education directory claims the school opened on October 5, 2022. This, however, is the year after neighbors claim to have first seen it operating. It's also two and a half years after Sara Berge—the school's point of contact, per documents WIRED obtained from the state via public record request—claims to have started her role as “head of school” for a “Montessori pod” at a “private family office” according to her LinkedIn profile, which WIRED viewed in September and October. Berge did not respond to a request to comment.

Between 2022 and 2025, according to the documents Bicken Ben filed to the state, the school grew from nine to 14 students ranging from 5 to 10 years old. Neighbors, however, estimated that they observed 15 to 30 students. Berge similarly claimed on her LinkedIn profile to have overseen “25 children” in her job. In a June 2025 job listing for “BBS,” the school had a “current enrollment of 35–40 students and plans for continued growth,” which the listing says includes a middle school.

In order for the Zuckerbergs to run a private school on their land, which is in a residential zone, they need a “conditional use” permit from the city. However, based on the documents WIRED obtained, and Palo Alto's public database of planning applications, the Zuckerbergs do not appear to have ever applied for or received this permit.

Per emails obtained by WIRED, Palo Alto authorities told a lawyer working with the Zuckerbergs in March 2025 that the family had to shut down the school on its compound by June 30. A state directory lists BBS, the abbreviation for Bicken Ben School, as having operated until August 18, and three of Zuckerberg's neighbors—who all requested anonymity due to the high-profile nature of the family—confirmed to WIRED in late September that they had not seen or heard students being dropped off and picked up on weekdays in recent weeks.

However, Zuckerberg family spokesperson Brian Baker tells WIRED that the school didn't close, per se. It simply moved. It's not clear where it is now located, or whether the school is operating under a different name.

In response to a detailed request for comment, Baker provided WIRED with an emailed statement on behalf of the Zuckerbergs. “Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade,” he said. “They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”

By the fall of 2024, Zuckerberg's neighbors were at their breaking point. At some point in mid-2024, according to an email from then mayor Greer Stone, a group of neighbors had met with Stone to air their grievances about the Zuckerberg compound and the illegal school they claimed it was operating. They didn't arrive at an immediate resolution.

In the years prior, the city had received several rounds of complaints about the Zuckerberg compound. Complaints for the address of the school were filed to 311, the nationwide number for reporting local non-emergency issues, in February 2019, September 2021, January 2022, and April 2023. They all alleged that the property was operating illegally under city code. Both were closed by the planning department, which found no rule violations. An unknown number of additional complaints, mentioned in emails among city workers, were also made between 2020 and 2024—presumably delivered via phone calls, in person, or to city departments not included in WIRED's public record request.

In December 2020, building inspection manager Korwyn Peck wrote to code enforcement officer Brian Reynolds about an inspection he attempted to conduct around the Zuckerberg compound, in response to several noise and traffic complaints from neighbors. He described that several men in SUVs had gathered to watch him, and a tense conversation with one of them had ensued. “This appears to be a site that we will need to pay attention to,” Peck wrote to Reynolds.

“We have all been accused of ‘not caring,' which of course is not true,” Peck added. “It does appear, however, with the activity I observed tonight, that we are dealing with more than four simple dwellings. This appears to be more than a homeowner with a security fetish.”

In a September 11, 2024, email to Jonathan Lait, Palo Alto's director of planning and development services and Palo Alto city attorney Molly Stump, one of Zuckerberg's neighbors alleged that since 2021, “despite numerous neighborhood complaints” to the city of Palo Alto, including “multiple code violation reports,” the school had continued to grow. They claimed that a garage at the property had been converted into another classroom, and that an increasing number of children were arriving each day. Lait and Stump did not respond to a request to comment.

“The addition of daily traffic from the teachers and parents at the school has only exacerbated an already difficult situation,” they said in the email, noting that the neighborhood has been dealing with an “untenable traffic” situation for more than eight years.

They asked the city to conduct a formal investigation into the school on Zuckerberg's property, adding that their neighbors are also “extremely concerned” about the school, and “are willing to provide eyewitness accounts in support of this complaint.”

Over the next week, another neighbor forwarded this note to all six Palo Alto city council members, as well as then mayor Stone. One of these emails described the situation as “serious” and “untenable.”

“We believe the investigation should be swift and should yield a cease and desist order,” the neighbor wrote.

Lait responded to the neighbor who sent the original complaint on October 15, claiming that he'd had an “initial call” with a “representative” of the property owners and that he was directing the city's code enforcement staff to reexamine the property.

On December 11, 2024, the neighbor claimed that since one of their fellow neighbors had spoken to a Zuckerberg representative, and the representative had allegedly admitted that there was a school on the property, “it seems like an open and shut case.”

“Our hope is that there is an equal process in place for all residents of Palo Alto regardless of wealth or stature,” the neighbor wrote. “It is hard to imagine that this kind of behavior would be ignored in any other circumstance.”

That same day, Lait told Christine Wade, a partner at SSL Law Firm—who, in an August 2024 email thread, said she was “still working with” the Zuckerberg family—that the Zuckerbergs lacked the required permit to run a school in a residential zone.

“Based on our review of local and state law, we believe this use constitutes a private school use in a residential zone requiring a conditional use permit,” Lait wrote in an email to Wade. “We also have not found any state preemptions that would exclude a use like this from local zoning requirements.” Lait added that a “next step,” if a permit was not obtained, would be sending a cease and desist to the property owner.

According to several emails, Wade, Lait, and Mark Legaspi, CEO of the Zuckerberg family office called West 10, went on to arrange an in-person meeting at City Hall on January 9. (This is the first time that the current name of the Zuckerberg family office, West 10, has been publicly disclosed. The office was previously called West Street.) Although WIRED did not obtain notes from the meeting, Lait informed the neighbor on January 10 that he had told the Zuckerbergs' “representative” that the school would need to shut down if it didn't get a conditional use permit or apply for that specific permit.

Lait added that the representative would clarify what the family planned to do in about a week; however, he noted that if the school were to close, the city may give the school a “transition period” to wind things down. Wade did not respond to a request for comment.

There was another increasingly heated conversation happening behind the scenes. On February 3 of this year, at least one neighbor met with Jordan Fox, an employee of West 10.

It's unclear exactly what happened at this meeting, or if the neighbor who sent the September 11 complaint was in attendance. But a day after the meeting with Fox, two additional neighbours added their names to the September 11 complaint, per an email to Lait.

On February 12, a neighbor began an email chain with Fox. This email was forwarded to Planning Department officials two months later. The neighbor, who seemingly attended the meeting, said they had “connected” with fellow neighbors “to review and revise” an earlier list of 14 requests that had been reportedly submitted to the Zuckerbergs at some previous point. The note does not specify the contents of this original list of requests, but of the 19 neighbors who originally contributed to it, they claimed that 15 had contributed to the revised list.

The email notes that the Zuckerbergs had been “a part of our neighborhood for many years,” and that they “hope that this message will start an open and respectful dialogue,” built upon the “premise of how we all wish to be treated as neighbors.”

“Our top requests are to minimize future disruption to the neighborhood and proactively manage the impact of the many people who are affiliated with you,” the email says. This includes restricting parking by “security guards, contractors, staff, teachers, landscapers, visitors, etc.” In the event of major demolitions, concrete pours, or large parties, the email asks for advance notice, and for dedicated efforts to “monitor and mitigate noise.”

The email also asks the Zuckerbergs to, “ideally stop—but at a minimum give us extended breaks from—the acquisition, demolition and construction cycle to let the neighborhood recover from the last eight years of disruption.”

At this point, the email requests that the family “abide by both the letter and the spirit of Palo Alto” by complying with city code about residential buildings.

Specifically, it asks the Zuckerbergs to get a use permit for the compound's school and to hold “a public hearing for transparency.” It also asks the family to not expand its compound any further. “We hope this will help us get back the quiet, attractive residential neighborhood that we all loved so much when we chose to move here.”

In a follow-up on March 4, Fox acknowledged the “unusual” effects that come with being neighbors with Mark Zuckerberg and his family.

“I recognize and understand that the nature of our residence is unique given the profile and visibility of the family,” she wrote. “I hope that as we continue to grow our relationship with you over time, you will increasingly enjoy the benefits of our proximity—e.g., enhanced safety and security, shared improvements, and increased property values.”

Fox said that the Zuckerbergs instituted “a revised parking policy late last year” that should address their concerns, and promised to double down on efforts to give advanced notice about construction, parties, and other potential disruptions.

However, Fox did not directly address the unpermitted school and other nonresidential activities happening at the compound. She acknowledged that the compound has “residential support staff” including “childcare, culinary, personal assistants, property management, and security,” but said that they have “policies in place to minimize their impact on the neighborhood.”

It's unclear if the neighbor responded to Fox.

While these conversations were happening between Fox and Zuckerberg's neighbors, Lait and others at the city Planning Department were scrambling to find a solution for the neighbor who complained on September 11, and a few other neighbors who endorsed the complaint in September and February.

Starting in February, one of these neighbors took the lead on following up with Lait. They asked him for an update on February 11, and heard back a few days later. He didn't have any major updates, “but after conversations with the family's representatives, he said he was exploring whether a “subset of children” could continue to come to the school sometimes for ""ancillary"" uses.

“I also believe a more nuanced solution is warranted in this case,” Lait added. Ideally, such a solution would respond to the neighbors' complaints, but allow the Zuckerbergs to “reasonably be authorized by the zoning code.”

The neighbor wasn't thrilled. The next day, they replied and called the city's plan “unsatisfactory.”

“The city's ‘nuanced solution' in dealing with this serial violator has led to the current predicament,” they said (referring to the nuanced solution Lait mentioned in his last email.)

Horrigan-Taylor, the Palo Alto spokesperson, told WIRED that Lait's mention of a “nuanced” solution referred to “resolving, to the extent permissible by law, neighborhood impacts and otherwise permitted use established by state law and local zoning.”

“Would I, or any other homeowner, be given the courtesy of a ‘nuanced solution' if we were in violation of city code for over four years?” they added.

“Please know that you have not earned our trust and that we will take every opportunity to hold the city accountable if your solution satisfies a single [redacted] property owner over the interests of an entire neighborhood,” they continued.

“If you somehow craft a ‘nuanced solution' based on promises,” the neighbor said, “the city will no doubt once again simply disappear and the damage to the neighborhood will continue.”

Lait did not respond right away. The neighbor followed up on March 13, asking if he had “reconsidered” his plan to offer a “‘nuanced solution' for resolution of these ongoing issues by a serial code violator.” They asked when the neighborhood could “expect relief from the almost decade long disruptions.”

Behind the scenes, Zuckerberg's lawyers were fighting to make sure the school could continue to operate. In a document dated March 14, Wade argues that she believed the activities at “the Property” “represent an appropriate residential use based on established state law as well as constitutional principles.”

Wade said that “the Family” was in the process of obtaining a “Large Family Daycare” license for the property, which is legal for a cohort of 14 or fewer children all under the age of 10.

""We consistently remind our vendors, guests, etc. to minimize noise, not loiter anywhere other than within the Family properties, and to keep areas clean,” Wade added in the letter. Wade also attached an adjusted lease corresponding with the address of the illicit school, which promises that the property will be used for only one purpose. The exact purpose is redacted.

On March 25, Lait told the neighbor that the city's June 30 deadline for the Zuckerbergs to shut down the school had not changed. However, the family's representative said that they were pursuing a daycare license. These licenses are granted by the state, not the city of Palo Alto.

The subtext of this email was that if the state gave them a daycare licence, there wasn't much the city could do. Horrigan-Taylor confirmed with WIRED that “state licensed large family day care homes” do not require city approval, adding that the city also “does not regulate homeschooling.”

“Thanks for this rather surprising information,” the neighbor replied about a week later. “We have repeatedly presented ideas to the family over the past 8 years with very little to show for it, so from our perspective, we need to understand the city's willingness to act or not to act.”

Baker told WIRED that the Zuckerbergs never ended up applying for a daycare license, a claim that corresponds with California's public registry of daycare centers. (There are only two registered daycare centers in Palo Alto, and neither belongs to the Zuckerbergs. The Zuckerbergs' oldest child, Maxima, will also turn 10 in December and consequently age out of any daycare legally operating in California.)

Horrigan-Taylor said that a representative for the Zuckerbergs told the city that the family wanted to move the school to “another location where private schools are permitted by right.”

In a school administrator job listing posted to the Association Montessori International website in July 2022 for “BBS,” Bicken Ben head of school Berge claims that the school had four distinct locations, and that applicants must be prepared to travel six to eight weeks per year. The June 2025 job listing also says that the “year-round” school spans “across multiple campuses,” but the main location of the job is listed as Palo Alto. It's unclear where the other sites are located.

Most of the Zuckerbergs' neighbors did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. However, the ones that did clearly indicated that they would not be forgetting the Bicken Ben saga, or the past decade of disruption, anytime soon.

“Frankly I'm not sure what's going on,” one neighbor said, when reached by WIRED via landline. “Except for noise and construction debris.”

Atari is a very different games company in 2025 to the industry-dominating titan of the 1980s. Back then, it was practically synonymous with gaming, but following years of sell-offs and restructurings, it's now a stalwart of the retro scene, leveraging its classic franchises to position itself as a natural home for nostalgic play.

After the Atari Watch comes the brand's latest outing: the Gamestation Go. Or rather, it's retro hardware specialist My Arcade's latest—a roughly Switch-sized handheld that packs in hundreds of games from across Atari's long and storied history.

It should be an easy sell for a wide variety of players, from those wanting to relive their youthful memories to any self-styled gaming historians wanting to experience crucial moments of the medium. It almost succeeds—but unfortunately, a few too many compromises in performance and build quality hold it back from greatness. Let's get into the detail.

The Gamestation Go makes its biggest splash with a central offering of more than 200 built-in games—a phenomenal roster to have at hand. All the familiar faces are included, from Asteroids, Breakout, and Centipede to Missile Command, Tempest, and Yar's Revenge (the full list can be found on Atari's official page), with the bulk of the library, 70-plus games, coming from the iconic Atari 2600. Eight more come from the Atari 5200, 11 from the Atari 7800 (albeit with a hefty caveat on that front), plus three dozen of Atari's various arcade originals and a handful from lesser-known sources such as Mattel's M-Network carts.

Oddly, given the branding of the device, this isn't entirely Atari's party. There's also a trio of Pac-Man games (arcade classic, Atari 2600, and “Speed Up” flavors) and Balls of Steel, a mid-'90s pinball game broken out into its own section, with seven tables based on Atari games.

Drifting further, there are 40 titles included from defunct Japanese publisher Jaleco, including games released on 8-bit and 16-bit consoles and in arcades, and 20 from Piko, a US label that specializes in its own digital archaeology, licensing lost and abandoned titles from yesteryear. Still, it doesn't hurt to have some added variety, and there are plenty of genuinely hidden gems in this selection—Piko's Brave Battle Saga, a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive RPG released in the Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets in 1996 is a particularly nice find.

The Gamestation Go also tips its hat to modernity with five Atari Recharged titles, a series of remakes that take the core mechanics of classic games and revamp them with updated graphics, extra features, and even achievements. The five here—Asteroids, Berzerk, Breakout, Centipede, and Missile Command—are available on other platforms where they usually sell for $10 apiece, which makes for a nice value add here.

Hundreds of games means inevitable overlap, though, with some titles cropping up repeatedly. Centipede alone appears five times, with 2600, 5200, 7800, Arcade, and Recharged iterations. Others, including Missile Command, Asteroids, and Berzerk, also make multiple appearances. On one hand, it's an absolute gift for games preservation—being able to see how these games changed and evolved as they hopped platforms is pretty cool. On the other, given the core gameplay remains largely the same across versions, only the most devoted of Atari fans are likely to appreciate the nuances when it comes to actually playing them.

That “hefty caveat” when it comes to the Atari 7800 games, though? They don't work. Select any of the games from that platform, and you're met with a slight audio pause and a flicker of the menu screen, but nothing else. Even trying a factory reset of the console achieves nothing—this cohort of games simply will not launch.

A press spokesperson for My Arcade says that a “firmware update development is in progress, and an official announcement will be made once it's ready to deploy,” but it's far from ideal for the Gamestaion Go to be launching with several of its games unplayable and no date in sight for a fix. No explanation for the failure of the 7800 games was provided, but given everything on the device runs through emulation, my guess is the one for 7800 titles simply isn't working.

Relying on emulation results in unwanted quirks elsewhere, often in terms of presentation. While most games have an option to swap the screen ratio between original dimensions and the handheld's 16:9, some don't look right in either format. Anything with vector graphics seems to be particularly prone to this, but not uniformly—Missile Command seemed mostly fine, but Tempest could throw up problems like broken text or a stretched appearance. It makes selecting a game a bit of a crapshoot, as you can't tell which are going to have issues. On a more positive note, the use of emulators does mean you can expand the already massive library via a MicroSD slot, if you have any (legally obtained, obviously) ROMs to load up.

Away from the games, the overall system UI is … well, it's fine. Games are grouped under chunky category headers, each one leading to a perfunctory list. You can't search for titles, just scroll through the list, but you can at least mark favorites to return to later. Players are treated to a nice bio of each game and classic case art or, in a neat touch for the arcade titles, shots of their original cabinets—another lovely nod to the history of the roster. There are also helpful touches like being able to check the controls or read a tips section for each game, while the emulated approach means you can create save states for many titles.

The most annoying system aspect is that the device doesn't remember Wi-Fi settings, meaning you'll need to enter your network credentials every time. Given you only need to connect to check for system updates, it's not a deal breaker, but it's an irritating chore every time.

The Gamestation Go's secret weapon isn't in the sheer volume of games included, though, but in how many ways it gives you to play them. Along with all the expected inputs—four face buttons, four shoulder buttons, and a surprisingly great D-pad—it also incorporates unique controls inspired by traditional Atari hardware, allowing you to play some of these early, experimental games as originally intended.

Above the D-pad sits a dial—officially the “Paddle”—which is perfect for games like Breakout. Below it, a “Trak-Ball” allows for more accurate rotational controls, working great in Tempest. Below the ABXY face buttons is a full 12-key number pad. That's probably the least-used, but the Atari 5200's Meebzork supports it, at least.

While all these curious controls give the handheld a distinct look—there's no way you'll mistake it for any other gaming handheld—they might seem overwhelming. Thankfully, the Gamestation Go proves itself a bright spark, with its fantastic ""SmartGlow"" feature. This genius bit of design has the necessary controls for each game light up with a warm orange LED, making it immediately clear which to use. Given the vast roster included, that's no small feat. The gentle glow also beautifully fits into the aesthetics of the handheld, matching the autumnal swashes of color that hark back to the Atari 2600's wood paneling, and break up its otherwise monochrome look.

The in-built screen offers a 720p resolution and decent, if not mind-blowing, brightness or color depth—but realistically, no one in 2025 is playing the games here for their graphical prowess. The display is perfect for the intended purposes, as are the internal speakers—a bit tinny perhaps, but for '80s chiptune, absolutely fine.

If you do want a bit more visual clarity though, you can connect the Gamestation Go to your main TV and enjoy full 1080p thanks to an HDMI-Out port, although some input lag may be noticeable depending on the game. Two USB-C ports on the rear allow wired controllers to be connected for multiplayer, easily accessed thanks to a sturdy kickstand that also keeps the console upright. You can also use the Gamestation Go as a controller in TV mode, allowing you to use the Paddle, Trak-Ball, or Num Pad on the big screen. A solid battery life of four to six hours helps for portable or TV play without needing to plug in.

Unfortunately, the device's build quality doesn't quite match up to its engineering. The plastic casing feels low quality, and my review unit arrived showing what appear to be stress marks or warping near the 3.5-mm audio jack and volume rocker at the top edge of the handheld. The face buttons and the Start/Select/Credit/Settings buttons that sit above the screen have a cheap, acrylic feel to them. Annoyingly, the Paddle also tends to feel too stiff, and the Trak-Ball, too twitchy, and while it's possible to adjust sensitivity for some games, they rarely feel right.

The Gamestation Go also leaves something to be desired on the ergonomics front. While its 267 mm x 138 mm front-on dimensions puts the Gamestation Go in roughly the same size category as the Switch 2, it's much thicker (26-mm depth, measured at the hand grips) and slightly heavier, too—566 grams versus 534. Those hand grips are more of an indented ridge either side, just about creating space to rest fingers, and making reaching the shoulder buttons a literal stretch. It's not the most uncomfortable handheld, but its chunky form means it sits in the hands like a boxy slab and isn't great for longer play sessions.

The Gamestation Go feels like it has two identities. One is a retro gamer's fantasy, a portable console packed with classic games, authentic ways to play them, and a few modern tricks up its sleeve. That version feels like a real love letter to Atari fans. The other is a slapdash bit of tech crammed with more games than anyone will realistically play, some of which may not work at all, and lacking polish. If system updates fix some of the inherent software and emulation issues, there's great potential here, but even then, probably only for those with a real passion for the days when Atari was king.

In today's hybrid work and connected lifestyle, the right technology makes all the difference in productivity, creativity, and seamless living.

Whether it's robust connectivity, intelligent organization, or reliable performance, the latest innovations elevate everyday experiences.

The following reviews spotlight three exemplary products — the TP-Link Deco BE95 mesh router, the Plaud Note Pro smart note taker, and the Dell UltraSharp 32” 4K monitor — that innovatively redefine what “future-ready” really means.

From the moment I unpacked the Deco BE95 and powered it on, I could sense TP-Link taking a step into the next generation of home networking. With quad-band Wi-Fi 7 (two 6 GHz bands, 5 GHz, and 2.4 GHz) and theoretical throughput of up to 33 Gbps, it's built for more devices, more speed, and more headroom.

Its multi-gig wired connectivity includes two 10 Gbps WAN/LAN ports (one RJ45, one RJ45/SFP+ combo) and two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports, letting you deploy high-bandwidth backhaul links or hook up a fast NAS or gaming rig with minimal wired-speed compromise.

The mesh architecture, combined with AI-driven roaming and Multi-Link Operation (MLO) across bands, delivers seamless handoffs as you walk through rooms, keeping latency low and throughput high.

In large homes, especially multi-story ones or those with thick walls or long distances, the Deco BE95 shines. Each node is powerful enough to blanket 2,000–2,500 square feet, and when used in a 2-pack or 3-pack, can reliably cover 6,000+ sq ft with consistent performance.

Because the BE95 supports simultaneous wired and wireless backhaul aggregation, you can combine fiber or Ethernet links with 6 GHz backhaul to distribute traffic intelligently.

What makes the TP-Link Deco BE95 truly future-proof:

Yes, real-world metrics show that the extra 6 GHz band sometimes doesn't yield dramatic gains in all use cases, and reviews note that wireless backhaul performance can be modestly underwhelming in specific setups. However, as client hardware evolves and firmware optimizations are rolled out, the BE95 is already positioned ahead of most routers on the market.

For a large, device-dense home looking not just to keep up but stay ahead, the Deco BE95 is a bold, future-ready bet. At $1,499, the 3-pack carries a premium price, but it's engineered for sustained, high-end performance for years to come.

One final note: The Deco BE95 genuinely surprised me by finally solving a frustrating issue that my legacy router couldn't fix: my smart garage control system was constantly dropping offline. Since installing it, the connection has been rock-solid, proving how powerful and reliable its mesh coverage truly is in handling even the most stubborn smart home devices.

The Plaud Note Pro feels like a breakthrough in intelligent note-taking. At just over 2.99 mm thin, its stunning credit-card size design means it slips into a pocket or wallet unobtrusively, so you always carry listening and recording capability.

Its battery life is extraordinary: in normal mode, it supports up to 30 hours of continuous recording, and with the new “endurance mode,” you can push that to approximately 50 hours at closer range.

The magic lies in how it turns raw audio into insight. With four precision microphones and AI beamforming, it captures voices clearly up to 16 feet away, even in group settings. Then, coupled with the Plaud app and cloud-based “Plaud Intelligence,” it transcribes, organizes, and summarizes conversations — flagging key moments and differentiating speakers — all almost instantly.

Using it feels surprisingly effortless. You don't have to fuss with toggles: it automatically switches between in-person and call modes. You get a 0.95-inch AMOLED InstantView display for status, mode, and battery on the device itself. Meetings evolve from passive recordings into structured inputs — you can immediately ask Plaud to “show key takeaways,” or jump to highlights. It effectively becomes an extension of your memory and a synthesis tool.

For anyone who deals with conversations like consultants, executives, journalists, or researchers, the $179 Plaud Note Pro is more than a recorder: it's a personal intelligence amplifier.

No more fumbling for your phone, no missing quotes, no hesitation about capturing ideas. The thin design keeps it with you; the battery keeps it ready when needed; and the smart pipeline turns talk into clarity. In a world overloaded with speech, this device makes your conversations work for you.

From its clean, elegant design to its powerhouse connectivity, the Dell UltraSharp 32 (U3225QE) is a monitor built around real productivity. The thin bezels and understated aesthetic let your content take center stage.

What really differentiates this display is the clever pop-out front-access port module (USB-C, USB-A) tucked into the lower edge — giving you quick access without crawling behind the screen. I'd highlight that element as a thoughtful, user-friendly touch.

Visually, the monitor shines. Dell utilizes an enhanced IPS Black panel with a 3000:1 contrast ratio, resulting in deeper blacks and more vibrant colors than typical IPS displays. At a reasonable price of $1,029, given its features, the U3225QE also boosts its appeal with refreshed specs: a 120 Hz refresh rate in 4K, broad color coverage (100% sRGB, 99% DCI-P3), and brightness levels strong enough to compete with ambient light.

However, what makes this monitor truly practical for home offices is that it functions as a docking hub, delivering up to 140 watts of power via Thunderbolt 4 to charge laptops and peripherals. It features a built-in KVM switch, allowing you to control two machines simultaneously using a single keyboard and mouse. The total I/O ecosystem — HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, USB-C, USB-A, and Ethernet — reduces cable clutter and provides flexibility out of the box.

For anyone working from home, where space, clarity, and ease of access matter, the Dell UltraSharp 32 is compelling. You get crisp text and image fidelity, a hub that backs your laptop and accessories, and quick-access ports for charging your phone or plugging in accessories during meetings. In a crowded field of monitors, its combination of design, usability, and feature set gives it a strong edge.

If your home office is your mission control, the UltraSharp 32 is not just a screen — it's a productivity anchor.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

A Seattle biotech startup born from a Nobel laureate's lab has landed $12.7 million and partnerships with pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Kite Pharma by using AI to design proteins that mount a multi-pronged attack on diseases.

Accipiter Biosciences emerged from stealth today with a leadership team that includes researchers who worked at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design under David Baker, a 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner for his breakthroughs in building proteins from scratch.

The company is using artificial intelligence tools developed at the institute to engineer de novo proteins that have the unusual ability to bind multiple cellular targets at once, potentially amplifying their illness-fighting impact.

“We want to establish this new modality,” said Matthew Bick, Accipiter Bio's co-founder and CEO. The strategy, he added, could unlock new ways to more effectively treat complicated diseases.

There's evidence that combinations of drugs sometimes perform better than single therapies, but the challenge has been coordinating their actions so they work together at the same location. 

In some forms of cancer, for example, multiple cell functions need to be turned on simultaneously to produce helpful molecules that work synergistically to create an effect “that is not just additive, it's multiplicative,” Bick said. 

The approach could also speed U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and cut costs. Typically, when two drugs are combined to treat a condition, each must undergo its own expensive Phase 1 safety trial, followed by an additional trial testing them together. A single multi-functional drug would need just one Phase 1 trial.

Accipiter Bio has entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to research and engineer new molecules. The deal provides an upfront payment for the startup and the potential to earn more than $330 million if Accipiter Bio hits certain milestones and through royalties.

“With Accipiter's platform technology and collaboration, Pfizer aims to solve complex therapeutic problems with biologics that may have previously been unattainable,” said Jeffrey Settleman, Pfizer Oncology R&D's chief scientific officer. 

Accipiter Bio also has an agreement with the oncology drug company Kite, which is owned by Gilead Sciences, to design proteins for use in cell therapies. The arrangement similarly includes initial funding with the possibility of milestone payments and royalties. Kite has the option of acquiring molecules created through the arrangement and develop them into therapeutics for global sales. 

On top of those efforts, Accipiter Bio has four of its own drug-development programs. Two programs are preparing for formal FDA discussions about human testing — a stage called pre-IND .

Bick would not provide details on the efforts, but said the company is researching agents for treating cancers and irritable bowel syndrome, among other ailments.

Flying Fish Partners and Takeda co-led the seed round. Additional investors are Columbus Venture Partners, Cercano Capital, Washington Research Foundation, Alexandria Investments, Pack Ventures and Argonautic Ventures.

“We've reached the point where computation isn't just speeding up biology,” said Heather Gorham, principal at Flying Fish Partners and Accipiter board member. “It's expanding what's biologically possible.”

The startup launched in March 2023 and previously raised about $800,000 to get off the ground. Bick was a senior fellow in Baker's lab for more than seven years and later a senior director for Seattle's Neoleukin Therapeutics.

Accipiter Bio has 17 employees. The leadership team has three members in addition to Bick. 

While the strategy of using AI to build a new class of proteins could open the door to groundbreaking therapies, drug development is a risky business.

Neoleukin was a biotech company co-founded by Baker that spun out of the UW in 2019. The startup's lead drug candidate, an engineered protein used in cancer treatment, under-performed in a Phase 1 trial. Neoleukin laid off many of its employees before merging with another company.

The three co-founders met at the startup and gained valuable technical and strategic lessons from the experience, Bick said. That included the need to have multiple drug programs running at once and insights into preventing immunogencity, which is an unwanted immune response to foreign bodies. 

“We were part of the team,” he said, “that took the first fully de novo protein into patients.”

Digs, a Vancouver, Wash.-based startup that sells software for homebuilding, raised $5 million.

Founded in 2022, Digs' software helps residential homebuilders streamline various aspects of their workflows including document organization, communication, and other tasks. It focuses on the pre-construction and design phase, turning static blueprints into digital, searchable files.

Digs also converts build documents (PDF floor plans, change orders, etc.) into a 3D digital twin that supports warranty agreements. 

Digs CEO Ryan Fink describes the company as “CarFax for the home.”

“Digs offers homeowners a first-of-its-kind 3D digital twin and AI-powered home ownership experience to become a living record of value and improvements,” he said in a press release. 

Fink said revenue is growing but didn't provide specific metrics. The company said it has nearly 10,000 homes on its platform.

Fink previously founded an augmented reality glasses startup called ONtheGo Platforms, which Atheer acquired in 2015. He also founded Streem, a startup that developed AR technology for home improvement technicians, which was acquired in 2019 by home services company Frontdoor.

Fink started Digs with Ty Frackiewicz, who previously co-founded ONtheGo and was vice president of product at Streem.

Digs employs 28 people and has raised nearly $20 million to date.

The latest $5 million raise is part of a “pre-Series A funding.” The round was led by Dallas-based firm SPLY Capital. Other backers include Oregon Venture Fund; Flying Fish; Portland Seed Fund, and Cascade Seed Fund. Digs customer Lanthorne Homes also invested in the latest round. 

SPLYCAP General Partner Tyler Williams joined the board at Digs. The startup recently hired longtime sales leader Stephen Molen as chief revenue officer.

Ten years after Glowforge was founded in Seattle, the startup's longtime leaders are rebooting the laser-engraver business.

Following months of turmoil involving multiple rounds of layoffs, a failed funding round, and the closure of a Seattle manufacturing facility, Glowforge has undergone a restructuring through an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, a state-level process that's an alternative to bankruptcy.

Co-founder and CEO Dan Shapiro told GeekWire that the company — which had raised $183 million from investors — arrived at this moment “after spending a painful nine months looking at every possible option for the business.”

But it's not the end for the maker of a line of desktop 3D laser cutters/engravers that took the home crafting world by storm back in 2015.

Shapiro said he and co-founder Mark Gosselin, the startup's CTO, negotiated with the entity that was assigned Glowforge's assets — which was otherwise ready to liquidate the company — to acquire the trademark and brand, the hardware platform, software, and rights to manufacture more machines in Seattle.

“The board of directors ran a sales process led by an independent third party,” Shapiro said. “When there weren't any bidders, Mark and I put in a bid from our own savings.”

He said the company makes enough money out of the gate to support a team of about 20 former Glowforge employees, and that he and Gosselin plan to “get back to basics,” improving hardware and software and serving customers.

Shapiro said Glowforge was “weeks away from going public” in 2022 before it was derailed by what he called “a collapse in the crafting market” that took out key strategic partners like JOANN, which filed for bankruptcy in 2024.

While he credits millions in capital and a growing staff for enabling the startup to do things “we never dreamed of,” Shapiro said it's been a three-year struggle to keep serving customers.

“The need to scale at all costs, to optimize for the next funding round, to hit growth metrics that justified ever-higher valuations … it pulled us away from what mattered,” he said.

In early 2025, Glowforge moved assembly of its highest-end machines from Mexico back to the U.S. and Seattle with the opening of a production facility in its SoDo headquarters space. The work employed 15 people, and Shapiro said at the time Glowforge employed just over 90 full-time and contract employees.

But following layoffs in August that impacted multiple teams, the production facility was shuttered in September in the wake of more layoffs.

“I'm not going to pretend this year was anything but brutal,” Shapiro said. “Layoffs are painful. Restructuring is messy. And there are people who believed in the original company who are understandably disappointed.”

Shapiro founded Glowforge in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Gosselin (founder and former CTO of Cequint) and Tony Wright (founder of RescueTime, Jobby and CubeDuel), who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter.

Glowforge's machines let people use raw materials including leather, paper, plastic, fabric, or cardboard to intricately cut and engrave products with the push of a button.

Via its cloud-based software users can design and develop creations from a web browser on a computer, tablet, or phone. You can create “almost anything” with Glowforge, Shapiro previously said, including jewelry, decorative items, smartphone engravings, wallets, toys, and more.

Glowforge backers included Brad Feld's Foundry Group and True Ventures, which led the company's $9 million Series A round in May 2015. MakerBot co-founder Bre Pettis, former MakerBot CEO Jenny Lawton, Wetpaint founder Ben Elowitz, KISSmetrics founder Hiten Shah, and former Swype CEO Mike McSherry are among other investors.

The company set a crowdfunding record in October 2015 with a 30-day campaign that generated $27.9 million in sales.

“Mark and I started this because we believed something simple: everyone should be able to make beautiful things,” Shapiro said this week. “Not just people with engineering degrees or expensive workshops, but everyone. And we created a desktop laser market that nobody had even imagined could exist.”

In August 2016, the company raised $22 million, but it was dealing with shipping delays that stretched into 2017 and caused mounting customer frustration and order cancellations. In 2018, the company raised another $10 million, and $43 million more in 2022.

Glowforge initially focused on direct-to-consumer and later partnered with large craft retailers such as JOANN and Michaels. The company also expanded to serve schools and universities in 2021. 

The startup eventually sold two higher-end machines including the Glowforge Plus ($4,995) and Glowforge Pro ($6,995). In 2023 it released the $1,200 Aura and in 2024 the $699 Spark in an attempt to attract a wider audience of consumers.

Eternally optimistic throughout Glowforge's years of ups and downs, Shapiro exhibits that same characteristic in the face of starting over.

He called it a “rebirth” and a return to the vision that he and Gosselin had in 2015, with a team “that's here for the mission, not the vanity metrics” and to serve customers “rather than optimizing for investor presentations.”

“The cost of being a growth-first company is massive, and not always obvious,” Shapiro said. “When we stripped the business to its essentials, we could see what we actually needed to serve our customers.”

The same hardware and software products will be offered, and Shapiro said improvements are coming. New features are also being launched now and next week, including: Box Builder, which uses generative AI to let users describe a custom box in plain English before Glowforge creates the design; and Snapmarks, in which users can print anything on a regular inkjet printer (stickers, iron ons) and load it into a Glowforge laser for cutting.

Shapiro also said they plan to continue the manufacturing formula they previously developed to build machines in Seattle. 

He called the new Glowforge a great business from day one — “awesome product, amazing customers, and profitable,” adding that the startup is now “simpler, more focused, and more committed to the long haul. And Mark and I are all in.”

Peloton is recalling around 833,000 of its original Bike+ machines following reports that some seat posts broke during use, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). 

The CPSC reports that Peloton has received three complaints related to the issue, including two incidents in which users were injured.

The affected Bike+ units were sold between January 2020 and April 2025. The CPSC is warning Peloton users to “immediately stop using the recalled exercise bikes.” 

“The integrity of our products and our Members' well-being are our top priorities,” said Márcio Oliveira, Peloton's SVP of Global Hardware Operations and Product Safety, in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “We are taking this opportunity to make replacement seat posts available to all affected Bike+ users and we encourage them to contact us to receive the redesigned seat post as soon as possible.”

This isn't the first time that Peloton has issued a recall. The company recalled around 2.2 million exercise bikes over safety concerns in 2023 after reports of customer injuries.

Thursday's recall marks the latest setback for Peloton, which replaced its CEO and laid off hundreds of workers last year. The company is scheduled to release its latest earnings report on Thursday amid efforts to revive growth after a decline in post-pandemic sales. Since reaching its peak in January 2021, Peloton's stock has fallen by over 90%.

As part of the company's efforts to revive its business, Peloton recently announced its biggest launch in years. The company revamped its entire hardware lineup and launched Peloton IQ, an AI and computer vision system that provides personalized guidance to users. 

Peloton's new Cross Training Series includes five connected fitness devices: Cross Training Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and Row+. Each features an advanced Swivel Screen for easy transitions between cardio, strength, yoga, Pilates, barre, and more. As for Peloton IQ, the tool offers goal-based coaching tailored to a user's fitness level, along with performance tracking, progress insights, and real-time feedback.

Peloton's focus on AI marks the company's first big product change under CEO Peter Stern, a former Apple and Ford executive who took the reins of the company in January.

Paul Erlanger and Se Yong Park, co-founders of consumer crypto trading app Fomo, took an unusual route to raising capital that is paying off for them. 

Their app launched in May and they just announced a $17 million Series A round led by Benchmark — an atypical crypto bet for the top-tier VC firm — bringing total funding to $19 million.

Instead of a classic seed round, the founders drew up a list of 200 people they dreamed of having as angel investors. 

“We knew that every single person would be valuable to us in the business,” Erlanger told TechCrunch. 

Then they worked their networks for warm intros — both had previously worked at the popular crypto trading platform dYdX. Failing that, they made cold calls. And 140 of their dream angels wrote checks after hearing their pitch.

They landed such big names in the crypto world as Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron, co-founder of Solana Raj Gokal, and former Coinbase CTO and super-angel Balaji Srinivasan, the founders said.

“There's a lot of people we never got to, like Elon Musk,” Park said with a grin, but of the ones who did take their call, less than a handful said no, he said. 

The angels liked their idea of a super app that gives consumers access to every crypto asset ever (millions of them), available on any blockchain, with, they promise, no technical friction. The app also has a social component baked into it, where users can follow friends and leaders they respect to see their trades. 

While Fomo doesn't yet have every asset from every blockchain available, the founders said they are on track to be close to that goal in six months. And among the millions of assets they do offer today, users can trade everything from major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana to meme coins and altcoins, they say.  

The ultimate vision is to one day allow consumers to trade all kinds of other assets on the app, from prediction markets to standard securities like bonds. 

A month after Fomo's May launch, the founders added a feature that dramatically changed their company's trajectory: support for Apple Pay. This essentially let users download the app and quickly start trading. 

“We saw a massive influx of users and revenue,” Erlanger said.  Fomo instantly soared to about $150,000 in revenue per week and $3 million in volume a day, the founders said. 

The app collects transaction fees on each trade of 0.50% (with a minimum fee of $0.95 for transactions on Solana, and no minimum fee on other, less-expensive blockchains like Base and BNB Chain). But it doesn't make users pay so-called “gas fees,” or the fees blockchains charge to process transactions. That's a real selling point for users interested in holding the major coins, Park said. 

Their many-angels strategy paid off because not one but three people reached out to Benchmark early-stage investor Chetan Puttagunta to offer an introduction, Puttagunta told TechCrunch. 

Puttagunta was a long-shot choice for a lead investor of the Series A round that Erlanger and Park were actively pursuing. Benchmark is selective with its picks and doesn't invest much in crypto startups. It backed Chainalysis in 2018, along with Toncoin and a few others.

But Puttagunta (who's backed such companies as Elastic, Cursor, Manus, and LangChain) saw Fomo's fast growth and was convinced to take a chance, and a board seat.  

“Paul and Se and the entire team have a clear vision to make crypto assets both easy to discover and trade,” Puttagunta said. “Their vision is clearly resonating with truly exceptional growth since they launched a few months ago.”  

Benchmark was the only institutional check the founders took, with the rest of the round going to existing angels and new ones.

So far, it looks like Benchmark's bet could pay off. Since the round closed in September, Fomo has added more assets from more blockchains to its app and has seen growth go even crazier. The founders say they have onboarded over 120,000 users. “We're now doing about $20-$40 million in volume a day, and about $150,000 in revenue a day,” Erlanger said.

With so much money flooding into AI startups, it's a good time to be an AI researcher with an idea to test out. And if the idea is novel enough, it might be easier to get the resources you need as an independent company instead of inside one of the big labs.

That's the story of Inception, a startup developing diffusion-based AI models that just raised $50 million in seed funding led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Mayfield, Innovation Endeavors, Microsoft's M12 fund, Snowflake Ventures, Databricks Investment, and Nvidia's venture arm NVentures. Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy provided additional angel funding.

The leader of the project is Stanford professor Stefano Ermon, whose research focuses on diffusion models — which generate outputs through iterative refinement rather than word-by-word. These models power image-based AI systems like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Sora. Having worked on those systems since before the AI boom made them exciting, Ermon is using Inception to apply the same models to a broader range of tasks.

Together with the funding, the company released a new version of its Mercury model, designed for software development. Mercury has already been integrated into a number of development tools, including ProxyAI, Buildglare, and Kilo Code. Most importantly, Ermon says the diffusion approach will help Inception's models conserve on two of the most important metrics: latency (response time) and compute cost.

“These diffusion-based LLMs are much faster and much more efficient than what everybody else is building today,” Ermon says. “It's just a completely different approach where there is a lot of innovation that can still be brought to the table.”

Understanding the technical difference requires a bit of background. Diffusion models are structurally different from auto-regression models, which dominate text-based AI services. Auto-regression models like GPT-5 and Gemini work sequentially, predicting each next word or word fragment based on the previously processed material. Diffusion models, trained for image generation, take a more holistic approach, modifying the overall structure of a response incrementally until it matches the desired result.

The conventional wisdom is to use auto-regression models for text applications, and that approach has been hugely successful for recent generations of AI models. But a growing body of research suggests diffusion models may perform better when a model is processing large quantities of text or managing data constraints. As Ermon tells it, those qualities become a real advantage when performing operations over large codebases.

Diffusion models also have more flexibility in how they utilize hardware, a particularly important advantage as the infrastructure demands of AI become clear. Where auto-regression models have to execute operations one after another, diffusion models can process many operations simultaneously, allowing for significantly lower latency in complex tasks.

“We've been benchmarked at over 1,000 tokens per second, which is way higher than anything that's possible using the existing autoregressive technologies,” Ermon says, “because our thing is built to be parallel. It's built to be really, really fast.”

A slew of new companies have emerged in recent years offering fresh takes on RVs, like Lightship, Pebble, and Grounded. Now another startup called Evotrex is coming out of stealth with its own twist: a hybrid RV travel trailer with an integrated gas engine.

The new RV will have an onboard battery pack that will power the living quarters, onboard electronics, and an electric motor, but the gas engine will recharge that battery pack and extend its range for far longer than a full charge — potentially making Evotrex's trailer attractive for longer camping trips.

The Evotrex RV will debut at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, but the company detailed some of its plans ahead of that reveal in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.

Using a gas engine to get more out of a big battery pack has become a trendy idea in the automotive world, as carmakers and customers hesitate to transition to fully electric vehicles. In fact, the CEO of startup automaker Scout Motors recently revealed that 80% of the customers who preordered its upcoming vehicles have chosen the hybrid “extended range” powertrain option over the all-electric ones.

Evotrex co-founder Alex Xiao, a former product manager for consumer electronics company Anker, believes the idea will appeal to RV customers and dealers alike.

Xiao told TechCrunch that he and co-founder Stella Qin (another Anker alum) spent seven months researching the RV market before they started building anything. What they found was a customer base that was getting much younger and had the desire to take these kinds of vehicles farther out in the world, far beyond the typical plug-and-stay campsites and RV parks.

These customers “want to bring their gadgets and other equipment on skiing, hunting, fishing, and other activities, and stay in the wild for like four or five days, which is different,” Xiao said. “They're off-grid — off-grid living was not supported before within the RV life.”

To do all that, you need power. 

RV owners are no strangers to gas generators, but Xiao and Qin believe the way they've integrated their engine into the Evotrex trailer offers a number of benefits. They claim it's quieter and more efficient, and they say they're even using the excess heat created to help keep the cabin warm.

Xiao said Evotrex plans to ship the first of its RV trailers by the end of 2026, and it's raised $16 million in seed funding so far from his former employer Anker, as well as Chinese early-stage venture firms Unity Ventures, Kylinhall Partners, and Vision Plus Capital.

Evotrex has about 40 employees so far, Xiao said, with some in China and some in the U.S. Evotrex's CTO formerly led automotive R&D at Chinese automaker Geely Group, and the startup's COO (and a third co-founder) has held supply chain leadership positions at IBM, Lenovo, and Anker.

Xiao said the plan is to do most of the production in China with final assembly in California. Combined with the fact that much of the supply chain for RVs remains in China, he said he's aware that there will be challenges due to the Trump administration's trade policies.

Solving those problems won't be easy, Xiao said. But neither is making a successful RV company from scratch, he added.

“The purpose of this company is to bring those kinds of new experiences to the customer,” Xiao said.

Snap said on Thursday that it has signed a deal to integrate Perplexity's AI search engine directly within Snapchat. As part of the deal, Perplexity will pay Snap $400 million in cash and equity.

The deal gives Perplexity exposure to more than 940 million Snapchat users, who will get answers from its AI engine when they ask questions to the company's My AI chatbot.

The new feature will be integrated into the app's interface early next year. Snap said it will start recording revenue from this deal in 2026.

The deal was announced alongside Snap's Q3 2025 results. The company reported revenue of $1.51 billion, up 10% from a year earlier, though it narrowed its loss to $104 million from $153 million a year ago. The company said its subscription tier, Snapchat+, now has more than 17 million users.

As I just commented in the other AI trust thread on the front page, this dynamic is funnily enough what any woman using online dating services has always been very familiar with. With the exact same tragedy of the commons that results. Except for the important difference that terrible profiles and intro messages have traditionally usually been very short and easily red-flagged. But that is, of course, now also changing or already changed due to LLMs.(Someone I follow on a certain social media platform just remarked that she got no less than fifty messages within a single hour of marking herself as ""single"". And she's just some average person, not a ""star"" of any sort.)

This has additional layers to it as well. For example, I actively avoid using em dash or anything that resembles it right now. If I had no exposure to the drama around AI, I wouldn't even be thinking about this. I am constraining my writing simply to avoid the implication.

There's no ""LLM style"". There's ""human style mimicked by LLMs"". If they default to a specific style, then that's on the human user who chooses to go with it, or, likely, doesn't care. They could just as well make it output text in the style of Shakespeare or a pirate, eschew emojis and bulleted lists, etc.If you're finding yourself influenced by LLMs—don't be.

There is a ""default LLM style"", which is why I call it that. Or technically, one per LLM, but they seem to have converged pretty hard since they're all convergently evolving in the same environment.It's trivial to prompt it out of that style. Word about how to do it and that you should do it has gotten around in the academic world where the incentives to not be caught are high. So I don't call it ""the LLM style"". But if you don't prompt for anything in particular, yes, there is a very very strong ""default LLM style"".

I'm not saying that AI hasn't already given us useful things, but this is a symptom of one very negative change that's drowned a lot of the positive out for many people: the competence gap used to be an automatic barrier for many things. For example, to get hired as a freelance developer, you had to have at least cargo-culted something together once or twice, and even if you were way overconfident in your capability, you probably knew you weren't the real thing. However, the AI tools industry essentially markets free competence, and out of context for any given topic, that little disclaimer is meaningless. It's essentially given people climbing the Dunning-Krueger Mt. Stupid the agency to produce garbage at a damaging volume that's too plausible looking for them (or laypeople, for that matter) to realize it's garbage. I also think somewhat nihilist people prone to get-rich-quick schemes (e.g. drop-shipping, NFTs) play these workflows like lottery tickets while remaining deliberately ignorant of their dubious value.

If this isn't already a requirement, I'm not sure I understand what even non-AI-generated reports look like. Isn't the bare-minimum of CVE reporting a minimally reproducible example? Like, even if you find some function, that for example doesn't do bounds-checking on some array, you can trivially write some unit testing code that's able to break it.

You sort of want to reject them all, but ocassionally a gem gets submitted which makes you reluctant.For example, years ago i was responsible for triaging bug bounty reports at a SaaS company i worked at at the time. One of the most interesting reports was that someone found a way to bypass our oauth thing by using a bug in safari that allowed them to bypass most oauth forms. The report was barely understandable written in broken english. The impression i got was they tried to send it to apple but apple ignored them. We ended up rewriting the report and submitting it to apple on there behalf (we made sure the reporter got all credit).If we ignored poorly written reports we would have missed that. Is it worth it though? I dont know.

Regex exploitation is the forever example to bring up here, as it's generally the main reason that ""autofail the CI system the moment an auditing command fails"" doesn't work on certain codebases. The reason this happens is because it's trivial to make a string that can waste significant resources to try and do a regex match against, and the moment you have a function that accepts a user-supplied regex pattern, that's suddenly an exploit... which gets a CVE. A lot of projects then have CVEs filed against them because internal functions rely on Regex calls as arguments, even if they're in code the user is flat-out never going to be able interact with (ie. Several dozen layers deep in framework soup there's a regex call somewhere, in a way the user won't be able to access unless a developer several layers up starts breaking the framework they're using in really weird ways on purpose).The CVE system is just completely broken and barely serves as an indicator of much of anything really. The approval system from what I can tell favors acceptance over rejection, since the people reviewing the initial CVE filing aren't the same people that actively investigate if the CVE is bogus or not and the incentive for the CVE system is literally to encourage companies to give a shit about software security (at the same time, this fact is also often exploited to create beg bounties). CVEs have been filed against software for what amounts to ""a computer allows a user to do things on it"" even before AI slop made everything worse; the system was questionable in quality 7 years ago at the very least, and is even worse these days.The only indicator it really gives is that a real security exploit can feel more legitimate if it gets a CVE assigned to it.

Unfortunately majority of companies don't have something special they really need to add to cURL.

It certainly helped with ""under-resourced"" part. Whatever you considered ""exploited"" is up to discussion. From project perspective ofc copyleft licensing benefited the project.Linus Torvalds end up with a good amount of publicity and is now somewhat well set-off, but almost all other kernel developers live in obscurity earning somewhat average salaries. I pretty sure we can all agree that Linux Kernel made a massive positive impact on whole humanity and compared to that payoff to stakeholders is rather small IMO.

Last I checked, they had archive.is blacklisted; the people with power there had (as far as I can tell) come to the conclusion that people using that site to prove that websites had stated X on date Y were the bad guys. Of course, they still have archive.org sources everywhere, so the objection is not actually to archiving page content.Tons of claims also seem to be sourced ultimately to thinly-disguised promotional material (e.g. claims of the prevalence of a problem backed up by the sites of companies offering products to combat the problem) and opinion pieces that happen to mention an objective (but not verified) claim in passing.

Op means to say this type of pardon is not to meant to win votes or satisfy the demands of  constituents, Like with convicted cops or people with weed related crimes etc or pardoning draft dodgers after Vietnam or civil war and so on .While money is involved deeply in politics and financial corruption is there , occasionally idealogical (political) actions without direct financial benefits also happen.It is hard to say whether this  pardon of Silk Road founder was motivated by libertarian, or crypto community pressure or by financial donations to the party etc both are possible even at the same time but they are different considerations

As a libertarian voter, the pardon for Ross was the only thing Trump did that actually brought me pause.  To the point, I felt immensely guilty for not voting for him when I voted (L) because I knew[thought] I was damning Ross to a jail cell.  It weighed on my conscious for a long time after the vote, an it wasn't until Trump won I felt somewhat absolved of the guilt.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

Siri, which somehow still stinks, is finally getting a new core AI model, and it's going to be a 1.2 trillion parameter Google Gemini-based LLM, according to Bloomberg Apple reporter Mark Gurman. Until Apple gets its act together on a proprietary AI system, Gurman writes, it will reportedly give Google about $1 billion per year for a temporary fix.

Internally, Apple apparently calls the Google-powered Siri upgrade by the code-name “Linwood,” according to the report, and rather than announcing an exciting AI partnership, Apple regards Google's role in this deal as that of a “behind-the-scenes technology supplier,” Gurman writes.

Apple's AI assistant, released in 2010, has long been a perceived weakness in Apple's mobile software lineup. Even though it has been tweaked since the release of the Apple Intelligence suite, the voice-activated robot voice never became the centerpiece of some futuristic new AI-driven version of the iPhone as Apple once signaled it would. Instead it has come to symbolize Apple's sluggishness in the AI race—mostly perceived as a 15-year-old piece of software that tells you the weather, and says it doesn't understand you or can't help you aside from that.

According to Gurman's past reporting, the upgrade will be in place this coming spring as part of the update to iOS 26.4. This round of changes to Siri will be focused on “personalization,” allowing the assistant “to tap into consumers' personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries.”

According to MacRumors, the upgrade will still involve Apple's proprietary models when queries can be answered with a lower-powered model that runs on the device itself, and there will be privacy measures in place for when Google's software gets involved. “User privacy will be preserved by running the Google models on Apple's server infrastructure without any external data sharing, and on-device personal data will likely be processed using Apple's own Foundation Models,” writes Benjamin Mayo of MacRumors.

Gurman says the switch to Google Gemini will occur when Siri needs to perform complex tasks or summarize information.

Gurman's report, as usual, comes from anonymous leaks, while Apple's formal statement in response to this report notes that the spring release of new Siri features is not something the company has formally announced.

As Gizomodo's James Pero wrote in July of this year, Apple was reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Anthropic about the possibility of powering this Siri upgrade with a GPT or Claude model. Given that the AI announcements in July didn't match what had been previously advertised, it looked like things were “not going as planned.”

Now we have one more data point hinting at what's been going on behind the scenes at Apple's AI workshop. Apple supposedly still intends to develop its own AI system to power some future version of Siri, even as AI staff defections mount—for example, Ke Yang, who was spearheading Apple's in-house chatbot effort, and who left for Meta last month. But in the meantime, it seems a $1 billion-per-year Google Gemini model will do.

Open hailing frequencies to your wallet, because after a brief tease during Star Trek Day, it's finally here—Lego's first-ever official Star Trek set, celebrating one of the most beloved Starfleet flagships of all time.

This morning Lego confirmed what many had expected after that brief tease of a minifigure Captain Picard a few months ago: it's boldly going into the world of Star Trek with a replica of the USS Enterprise-D, as seen in The Next Generation. Clocking in at 3,600 pieces, the scale replica of the Enterprise-D is a faithful representation of the Galaxy-class starship, including a detachable saucer section to recreate the ship's ability to separate into two autonomous craft and even a tiny little opening shuttle bay on the rear of the saucer, which houses two miniscule shuttlepods. Once built, including its stand, the model is around 10.5 inches tall, 23.5 inches long, and 18.5 inches wide.

Of course, aside from the stand featuring the technical data of the Enterprise-D (and angled so you can pose the ship in flight as it was often seen in TNG), the set also features nine minifigures recreating the primary cast of the show. You'll get the previously teased Captain Jean-Luc Picard alongside Data, Geordi La Forge, Will Riker, Deanna Troi, Beverly Crusher, Worf, Guinan, and Will Crusher (yes, he's wearing the jumper). As well as a separate display stand, they'll also all come with a series of thematic accessories, from general Starfleet kit like a phaser, tricorder, PADD, or an engineering kit and a portable tractor beam generator, to some more character-specific touches, like a teacup for Picard, Riker's trombone, a bottle for Guinan (it's green, so maybe Aldebaran whiskey?), and Spot the cat for Data. D'aaw!

Star Trek may live in a post-scarcity economic utopia, but alas, we don't, which means you will have to cough up $400 if you want your own Enterprise-D when it releases on November 28—and gold-pressed Latinum is not an acceptable alternative, before you try your best Quark.

In Ferengi spirit, perhaps then, Lego will sweeten the deal if you purchase the set online or from a Lego store between November 28 and December 1: a buildable 261-piece replica of one of the Enterprise‘s Type-15 shuttlepods (specifically the Onizuka). The shuttle will include an opening rear hatch and even an LCARS system displaying an amazing deep cut: the stardate 45076.3, dating it to the season five episode “Ensign Ro,” so it's only fitting that the bonus also includes a minifigure of the feisty Bajoran ensign, Ro Laren.

The Lego Icons Star Trek: The Next Generation USS Enterprise-D will be available to preorder here later this month.

The news broke mere weeks before the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Lucasfilm and Disney had rehired writer-director Rian Johnson to make a new trilogy of Star Wars films, marking the ultimate vote of confidence in his upcoming eighth chapter in the saga. Excitement could not have been higher. And while, for some, the film's bold, surprising take on Star Wars lived up to that, for others, it did not.

The weeks, months, and now years since the release of The Last Jedi have seen Lucasfilm scrambling over where to go next in a galaxy far, far away. Johnson's trilogy all but evaporated, and announcement after announcement of new movies suffered similar fates. Next year, the release of a movie version of a TV show that was still two years from existence at that time will mark the first Star Wars movie since the conclusion of the sequel trilogy. A trilogy whose final film was put into disarray by the polarizing reaction to Johnson's work.

But, for Johnson himself, he looks back on that time and everything that's come since with positivity. Speaking at Newport Beach Film Festival this week, Johnson (who did go on to make a new trilogy, just of Knives Out films) was asked if the fan reaction to The Last Jedi was responsible for him not making new Star Wars films.

“No, not at all,” he said. “In fact, it's the reason that I wanted to. My overall experience with putting the movie out, and what you're talking about with fan feedback… I mean, first of all, I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan. So I know the deal. I know that Star Wars fans are passionate about this stuff. We love the stuff we love, we hate the stuff we hate, and we fight about it. And that's been happening since the original trilogy. I was in college when the prequels came out. Are you kidding me? The prequel wars? We had a few. I mean, everybody did. And so, the notion that Star Wars has been this kind of Shangri-La, united fandom, and that [nothing] could then split that apart [is false]. The reality is Star Wars has always been something that has meant different things to different people. And I think that's part of the fun and the passion of it as fans, is arguing about it respectfully.”

“I've talked to so many people over the years, since we made that movie, who have such deep connections to Star Wars and who have deep connections to that movie,” Johnson continued. “And so it's been the most positive experience I've ever had with anything I've made, in terms of interacting with people who've seen it. I came out at the other end of it loving Star Wars fandom more than I did even going into it.”

We may never know exactly what happened with Johnson's Star Wars movies, and, in fact, he often says he'd love to make them one day. But that all this time later he can look back on the experience as a positive is a testament to why he would have been a great person to entrust those movies to.

On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy confirmed that ten percent of flights will be cancelled at 40 unspecified American airports that experience “high volume” starting on Friday, Nov. 7, assuming the government shutdown hasn't ended by then.The decision came after a “gut check,” Duffy explained at a press conference. It's a strong signal that the effect the shutdown is having on air travel is starting to snowball, and that Friday's cancellations could be the start of a logistical catastrophe on a historic scale.

Air traffic controllers are the federal employees who are normally paid money to understand the position in 3D space of every object at or near a given airport, including and endless parade of flying tubes filled with people and jet fuel.

Detailed demos of the job for laypeople make an air-tight case that it is mind-bendingly stressful. Currently, air traffic controllers are doing this job for free, and if they need money to do things like “eat” or “pay rent,” they're scrambling to figure something else out.So there's been a rash of air traffic controllers “having to call in sick to go earn money elsewhere,” one anonymous air traffic controller told NPR. It's hard to work multiple jobs, particularly if you work in a field where over 90 percent of workplaces were already understaffed before the shutdown. Also, today, controllers are scheduled to receive their second pay stub without any money attached to it. This is leading to what the FAA has called “immense stress and fatigue,” which sounds about right. Duffy warned of the potential for “mass chaos” to ensue earlier this week. Mass chaos has sort of already begun, with about 5,000 flights to and from U.S. airports delayed in one day this past Sunday. The average flight at LAX was delayed by an hour that same day. It's on top of that existing mess that 40 airports are going to have ten percent of their traffic eliminated—a plan that won't be “based on what airline travel has more flights out of what location,” according to Duffy, but “about where is the pressure and how do we alleviate the pressure?” In other words, cancellations won't be coordinated to lessen the impact on travelers, but to relieve the maximum amount of stress on federal workers. The interconnectedness of flights and coordination of plane movements mean the reduction in traffic at a select number of airports will have a ripple effect, causing further cancellations, delays, and missed connections, no matter how hard airlines try to avoid them. And if you're flying anytime soon, keep in mind that cancellations and delays aren't your only worry. “Every single day that this goes on tomorrow is now less safe than today,” National Air Traffic Controllers Association president Nick Daniels told CNN. 

It's also worth noting that the pay situation is the same for TSA workers, so they're also calling in sick, leading to outrageous lines at airport security checkpoints, reportedly up to four-and-a-half hours long in at least one case.

Thanksgiving is in 21 days, and the Sunday following Thanksgiving is traditionally the busiest travel day of the year in the U.S. About 20 million Americans flew during Thanksgiving weekend last year. The airline lobby Airlines for America wrote in a statement on Oct. 30 that airlines are “expecting a record holiday travel season.”

The shutdown would have to end very soon for these delays to not impact holiday travel, since according to Daniels it will take “weeks to recover” from the shutdown.

If, on the other hand, the shutdown carries right on through the holiday travel season, workers' stress and lack of pay will only get worse. Add snowy conditions to all that, and Friday's decrease in flight traffic could prove to be a small taste of the plunge into travel hell we're all on the verge of experiencing.

Most 10,000mAh power banks feel like a brick in your pocket: They tout portability but deliver bulk that makes you wonder whether it's really worth the hassle. That's where the INIU mini portable charger flips the script completely: This thing is 45% smaller than your average 10,000mAh power bank, which means you actually get true pocket-friendly charging without sacrificing capacity. Right now, Amazon has cut the price from $38 to just $26 which makes this compact powerhouse an absolute steal for anyone tired of carrying around clunky charging bricks.

See at Amazon

But the secret behind this little marvel is Iniu's TinyCell Pro battery technology which packs the same 10,000mAh in a frame almost half as small as the competition. You're getting enough juice in here to charge an iPhone 17 twice over or a Samsung S25 about 1.5 times or even an iPad Mini 1.5 times. For daily commutes, weekend trips, or those long flights when your phone battery seems to drain faster than you can say “low power mode,” this capacity hits the sweet spot between usability and convenience.

But here's the kicker: this tiny charger is capable of a maximum 45W output,which seriously gets you into fast-charging territory. It supports Power Delivery, Quick Charge, and even Samsung Super Fast Charging protocols, so your devices charge at their absolute maximum speeds. That iPhone 16 or Samsung S24 you're carrying will power up just as quickly as it would plugged into the wall. The real party trick, though, is that this mini power bank can actually charge a MacBook Air, delivering 42% battery in just 25 minutes.

The USB-C port handles both input and output at that blazing 45W speed, which means recharging the power bank itself doesn't take forever either. Iniu includes a detachable lanyard cable that's USB-C to USB-C, so you've got a charging cable built right in for maximum convenience. The lanyard design is clever because the cable detaches when you need it for other devices or power banks, making it genuinely useful rather than just a gimmick.

At this price point, you're looking at one of those very rare deals where the discount actually reflects the value you're getting.

Premium headphones from the likes of Bose, Apple, Sony, and Sonos are always going to be pricey and offer up a combination of audio quality and active noise cancellation that cheaper pairs just can't match. But now, Bose is hurrying to clear out stock of its QuietComfort headphones which means it's knocked down the price from $349 to an incredible $199 (43% off). That puts these flagship cans at less than the price of basic models from competitors, basically rendering every other option obsolete at this price point.

See at Amazon

The QuietComfort line came into prominence due to its industry-leading ANC and this pair is no exception. Bose combines its proprietary ANC technology with passive noise isolation via the over-ear design to create a listening environment that genuinely blocks out chaos. Plush ear cushions create a soft seal that keeps ambient sound at bay while remaining comfortable enough for marathon listening sessions. You can flip between Quiet Mode for full noise cancellation and Aware Mode when you need to stay tuned into your surroundings, like during airport announcements or when someone needs your attention.

With the padded headband distributing weight evenly across your head, these can be worn for hours without the clamping pressure that makes cheaper headphones uncomfortable after 30 minutes. This matters on long flights, during extended work sessions and those days when you just want to disappear into your music for hours on end. The over-ear cushions completely seal your ears, rather than pressing against them and create that studio quality isolation professional musicians rely on.

With a solid 24-hour battery life from a single charge, even those super-long international flights are covered with power to spare. When it's time to recharge, USB-C charging gets you back into the action quickly, where just 15 minutes of charging delivers 2.5 hours of playback. This fast-charging capability can save you should you forget to plug them in overnight and have to head out the door.

Sound quality exceeds what most people would expect from a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Bose provides high-fidelity audio, with deep bass response that doesn't muddy the mids or treble. An adjustable EQ inside the Bose app puts you in complete control of your sound signature, letting you boost the bass for hip-hop, emphasize the mids for vocals, or crank the treble for classical music.

The fact that these QuietComfort headphones are $199, versus $399 for Sony's WH-1000XM5 or $549 for Apple's AirPods Max, nets out to a significantly better value when you consider they provide very similar noise cancellation and sound quality. Bose clearly wants to clear this inventory fast.

Jensen Huang made this controversial comment on the sidelines of the Future of AI Summit.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Washington has lost its edge in artificial intelligence and warns that China will win the AI race. He cited the West's cynicism, export controls, and favorable energy circumstances in China as the reason, claiming it is much easier for companies to access energy in the country.

The chief of the most valuable company in the world by market cap has long been saying that the U.S. ban on chip exports is a failure, and that the spread of its advanced semiconductors is vital for it to retain its competitive advantage globally. However, the ongoing trade war between the two powers has resulted in export bans of Blackwell chips from the White House on the one hand, and the CCP banning foreign AI chips from state-funded data centers on the other. Because of this, Nvidia's market share in China has since dropped to basically zero, which probably led to Huang's statement to the Financial Times.

“China is going to win the AI race,” Jensen commented. He also added that “we need more optimism,” saying that the West's cynicism is holding it back. Huang released a statement on Nvidia's X account a few hours after FT published his words. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.” The Nvidia CEO previously mentioned this in late September on a podcast, leaning on his stance that he's been preaching for over a year that export restrictions on his company's AI chips are detrimental to the U.S.'s long-term interests.

A statement from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. pic.twitter.com/Exwx54OYJVNovember 5, 2025

Huang argues that if China loses access to Nvidia's latest AI GPUs, its tech companies will be forced to purchase homegrown alternatives, which will pour money into its chip makers and further drive research, development, and innovations in the local semiconductor industry. Aside from that, it will also reduce these companies' dependence on Nvidia's software ecosystem, making it easier for them to migrate to a Chinese AI processor. On the other hand, other industry leaders contend that the U.S. is heavily dependent on China and that it's only using Nvidia's products as a stopgap until it builds a credible competitor to the AI chip powerhouse. The comments come just days after the administration hinted that China could have access to Nvidia Blackwell chips, but only once they are out of date.

Aside from export controls, Nvidia's top executive also highlighted China's approach to energy subsidies that make it easier for companies to put up power-hungry data centers, versus the hodgepodge of rules the different States in the U.S. are pushing on AI, potentially resulting in “50 new regulations.” Experts have been saying that electricity generation is the next bottleneck that the AI industry must solve, and it seems that Beijing is miles ahead, as it has already addressed the energy problem for its AI infrastructure. On the other hand, American tech companies are still investing in alternative power sources like small modular reactors and space-based data centers, which will take years to materialize, if at all. Recently, Microsoft revealed it has GPUs it simply can't plug in because it doesn't have the energy required.

The status of the AI race between the two global rivals isn't clear, especially as politics and protectionism are muddying the waters. Aside from that, both sides' arguments for and against China getting access to Nvidia's AI GPUs have merit, meaning we will probably only truly see who is right years down the line. But one thing is clear in all of this — Nvidia will get a massive advantage if it supplies the chips that both sides use in the AI race.

You'd better have your encryption key on hand, so you won't lose your data.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft just released a service alert informing users that the October 2025 Windows security update might trigger BitLocker recovery for some Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2, as well as Windows 10 22H2 systems. According to BleepingComputer, this isn't the first time that Windows has experienced this issue, with similar incidents in May of this year, as well as in 2024 and 2022.

“After installing Windows Updates released on or after October 14, 2025, some devices might encounter issues during restart or startup,” Microsoft said in its announcement. “Affected devices might boot into the BitLocker recovery screen, requiring users to enter the recovery key once. After the key is entered and the device restarts, it will boot normally without any further BitLocker prompts.”

This won't be an issue if your device does not have BitLocker activated — however, Windows 11 24H2 and onwards (even the Home version) have the feature turned on by default if it's a clean install on supported hardware and you logged in with a Microsoft account. This means you likely have BitLocker activated if you have a new laptop, especially as Microsoft is taking steps to make it impossible to log into your Windows 11 PC using a local account.

If you're using a corporate device, your IT administrator can prevent the bug from affecting your device via a Known Issue Rollback group policy. But if you're a consumer user, you'd better know your BitLocker password, or else you risk losing access to your files for good if it locks you out and you don't know the correct credentials. Thankfully, you can easily check if BitLocker encryption is enabled or disabled on your device, and you can also retrieve your BitLocker key from your Microsoft account if it has already locked you out.

BitLocker is a nifty tool for protecting your data, as it won't let anyone access your hard drive if your computer is stolen, even if they move it to another device. However, it can also be a pain for the average user, especially if they did not know that it's automatically activated on their Windows 11 PC, and how to recover the key should it activate. This is especially true if the bug activates after a software update — after all, most users do not expect that their system would flag an update from Microsoft as a security threat.

A brand new Intel graphics card, a free AAA game, plus an $80 saving, and it isn't even Black Friday yet? This graphics card deal isn't one to miss if you're thinking about upgrading your gaming rig. Thanks to the folks at B&H Photo, this Acer Intel Arc B580 Nitro OC GPU is down to just $234.99, saving you a whopping 25% on the card itself. You're also gaining Intel's Holiday Bundle as part of the deal, with one of four big game releases up for grabs, including the new Battlefield 6.

We were impressed with the performance offered by the Intel Arc B580 when we tested it late last year, especially considering its $249 MSRP. While stiff competition from Nvidia and AMD ultimately stole its thunder, not to mention price hikes amid stock shortages on launch, it's still a formidable choice for gamers at this new price. With Intel also adding multi-frame gen support to its XeSS upscaling tech, a feature previously only available to the latest Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards, these GPUs have also gained a real advantage that its AMD rivals can't offer – at least, not yet.

This Acer manufactured Intel Arc B580 Nitro OC graphics card is ready for 1440p gaming, featuring 20 Xe2 cores and 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM.

Specs-wise, this Battlemage GPU features 20 Xe2 cores and ships with 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM attached to a 192-bit memory bus. That 12GB of VRAM helps to explain why Intel focused attention on the B580's 1440p gameplay performance on launch, coming with faster GPU cores and higher capacity VRAM than equivalent cards available at the time, including the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060.

Buyers also get to take advantage of Intel's Holiday Bundle promotion. Running until January 31, 2026, this giveaway lets you redeem a free copy of either Battlefield 6, Dying Light: The Beast, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Civilization VI with each B580 purchase. Apart from Dying Light, which is worth $60, these games have a retail value of $70.

Similarly, low-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 cards are typically closer to $300, while AMD alternatives like the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 8GB can be found for around $250, but these cards are stuck with just 8GB of VRAM. With 12GB on hand, this Acer Intel Arc B580's $234.99 sale price is hard to ignore, especially for gamers looking to play at 1440p on a budget, but it won't be around forever.

An enthusiast has shared their first designs, melding the disparate worlds of PC DIY with model railroading. Beautiful-Turnip-353 shared a video of a prototype PC build with a small T-gauge train circling atop their chunky GPU. It adds a truly dynamic aspect to the case window view, and we can imagine a tiny stationmaster shouting, “All aboard the PCI Express, we're going gaming.”

T-gauge model trains are the smallest commonly available to hobbyists. With a track gauge of just 3mm (0.118 inches) and a model scale of somewhere between 1:450 to 1:500, these are the minnows of the model railroading hobby world. Nevertheless, once properly set up, T-gauge builders can enjoy realistic speed controls and the convenience of magnetized track building systems. They also fit well in the smallest of spaces – or allow for the most intricately detailed large-scale dioramas.

Even the biggest and best graphics cards don't really have enough room for anything more substantial, so T-gauge is the best choice in a PC like this. T-gauge track has a minimum corner radius of approximately 60mm; moving up to Z-gauge would double that. However, perhaps the GeForce 60 series will inadvertently open up Z-gauge options to the model train/PC building enthusiast community.

Beautiful-Turnip-353 reveals that they have more ambitious plans for the build. Currently, it is explained that the electric loco is powered via “an Arduino on a USB port that is sending a PWM 5V signal to the rails.”

Power delivery for the train set is one aspect of the design that is earmarked for further refinement, though. The Redditor said the current setup doesn't allow a great range of speed controls. A helpful fellow enthusiast in the comments suggested controlling the train throttle via an internal 5V PWM fan header and adjusting it using software such as FanControl. Another pointed out that it would also be possible, for example, to auto-adjust the train's speed in line with the PC's temperature sensors.

Beautiful-Turnip-353 hints that they are seeking to intensify their railroad/PC crossover designs. “I want to make a much more train-themed build in the future, but something is better than nothing, haha.” There is a lot Beautiful-Turnip-353 could do with more scenery in the case, and the outer PC case design, and they know it.

More interesting track layouts, interactive signaling and control systems, and lighting would add atmosphere and charm to the build. It would be a spectacular cherry on top if a chuffing steam train could run around in the case, too.

ATLANTA — Eli Lilly's investigational oral GLP-1 drug orforglipron produced significant weight loss, A1c reduction, and cardiovascular risk factor improvements in the company's Phase 3 ATTAIN-2 trial of adults with both obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Orforglipron is a once-daily small molecule (nonpeptide) that, unlike the current oral semaglutide formulation for T2D (Rybelsus), can be taken any time of day without restrictions on food and water intake or need for refrigeration.

The ATTAIN-2 findings track with those seen in people with obesity without diabetes in ATTAIN-1, reported and published in September 2025. Top-line results from ATTAIN-2 were announced in August 2025.

The full ATTAIN-2 results were presented on November 5, 2025, at Obesity Week 2025 by three of the trial's investigators.

“This is historical. I believe that this molecule is going to change the way we practice obesity medicine…ATTAIN 1 and ATTAIN 2 both make up the backbone of the clinical trial program for orforglipron. The results are completed, which means we're on our way to having a molecule that's going to change obesity medicine practice…and we can now move forward,” ATTAIN 1 investigator Sean Wharton, MD, PharmD, medical director of the Wharton Medical Clinic, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, told Medscape Medical News.

Orforglipron is the farthest in development of the nonpeptide “nutrient-stimulated hormone (NuSH)”-based molecules for obesity and T2D, but there are several competitors not far behind, including at least one other (HRS-7535) in phase 3.

Obesity expert Donna H. Ryan, MD, professor emerita at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who presented commentary at the end of the session, told Medscape Medical News, “The hope is that these nonbiological small molecules are going to be much easier to make, and easier to ship, so I think there's a lot of hope in the future.”

However, Ryan also cautioned, “They're metabolized differently than the peptides, so we'll be watching the post marketing surveillance of this one particularly carefully.”

The 72-week multinational phase 3 ATTAIN-2 trial randomized 1613 participants with obesity or overweight (BMI ≥ 27.0) and T2D to either 6 mg, 12 mg, or 36 mg orforglipron or placebo. Overall, 89.5% completed the study, with similar rates across groups.

The primary endpoint of significantly greater body weight loss compared with placebo at week 72 was met in the efficacy estimand (assuming all take as prescribed), with significant reductions of 5.5%, 7.8%, and 10.5% of body weight with the three orforglipron doses, respectively, vs just 2.2% with placebo.

The proportions achieving weight loss of at least 5% ranged from 49.8% to 72.8% across orforglipron doses compared with 24.4% with placebo. And with the 36 mg dose, half achieved at least a 10% weight reduction.

The weight loss in the placebo group is noteworthy, Rothberg said. “That is excellent with getting no medication. What was happening with the placebo group? They should look at that.”

Mean reductions in waist circumference were 5.6 cm, 7.2 cm, and 9.2 cm, respectively, vs just 2.7 cm with placebo, also significant for all three doses.

Orforglipron also lowered A1c from an average baseline of 8.0%, by 1.29, 1.60, and 1.79 percentage points, respectively, vs 0.14 with placebo. The proportions achieving an A1c of < 7% were 70.0%, 78.0%, and 85.1%, vs 23% with placebo.

Significant improvements were also seen with orforglipron in fasting serum glucose, systolic blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The highest orforglipron dose reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein by 50.6%.

The proportions of participants with serious adverse events was 9.2% overall and didn't differ across groups. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 7.3%, 10.3%, and 10.9% across orforglipron doses vs 4.6% with placebo. Deaths occurred in four participants each in the placebo and orforglipron 12 mg groups, two in the 36 mg group, and none in the 6 mg group.

Rates of reported nausea were 20.1%, 31.1%, and 36.4%, respectively, for the three orforglipron doses vs 8.4% for placebo. Diarrhea was reported for 27.4%, 24.8%, and 21.3%, respectively, vs 15.0%. And for vomiting, the rates were 23.1%, 20.2%, and 12.8% vs 3.8%. Most of these occurred primarily during dose escalation and were mild-to-moderate. 

Amy E. Rothberg, MD, clinical professor of internal medicine and of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, told Medscape Medical News,“I think it's valuable to have another oral option, but I am concerned about the rates of nausea and vomiting. They are not trivial.”

Rothberg noted, “We don't know the numbers who were taking antiemetics or anti-diarrheals.”

No hepatic safety signal was observed. Hypoglycemia rates were low and occurred primarily when used in combination with sulfonylureas.

Also asked to comment, Simeon Taylor, MD, PhD, professor of medicine and director of the T32 Institutional Research Training Program in Diabetes & Obesity at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, told Medscape Medical News, “a number of companies tried unsuccessfully in the early 21st century to discover and develop orally bioavailable small molecule GLP1 receptor agonists [RA]. So the development of small molecule GLP1 R agonists is a truly remarkable scientific accomplishment.”

Taylor also noted, “Many patients will likely have a preference for an orally bioavailable drug rather than an injectable drug. Furthermore, it is likely that it may be more practical and feasible to manufacture large quantities of this small molecule to provide therapy for the large number of people who are obese or overweight with or without diabetes.”

In her commentary at the meeting session, Ryan called orforglipron “a valuable asset, the first nonpeptide small molecule GLP-1 RA with some very appealing characteristics for patients and prescribers.” She also said it's a “scalable asset,” in that “the small molecule can be mass-manufactured and shipped. It is an opportunity to grow the base of patients and prescribers.”

Lilly announced previously that it will submit its review package for orforglipron to the FDA in late 2025.

Lilly is also seeking an indication for orforglipron in treating T2D based on its phase 3 ACHIEVE trial platform.

Wharton disclosed receiving honoraria, serving on advisory boards, and conducting research for Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Amgen, Bausch Health, Metsera, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer. Ryan had disclosures with many obesity product manufacturers, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, and reported holding stock options with Epitomee and Scientific Intake. Rothberg reported being an advisor for Boehringer Ingelheim and a speaker for Lilly.

A multicentre study conducted by researchers from West Africa and the UK evaluated a portable molecular malaria test that can detect asymptomatic and submicroscopic infections in under 45 minutes, with a sensitivity exceeding 95%.

Despite major progress in malaria control, Africa still accounts for 94% of global cases and 95% of malaria deaths, according to the latest World Health Organization report. In countries such as Burkina Faso and The Gambia, transmission continues largely because many asymptomatic individuals — though infected — never seek care and remain undetected by standard surveillance.

These low parasite-density infections, known as submicroscopic malaria, escape rapid diagnostic tests and often even conventional microscopy, yet they continue to drive transmission. Detecting these hidden cases is considered a crucial step towards malaria elimination.

To address this gap, an international consortium of institutions from West Africa and the UK developed a point-of-care molecular diagnostic tool. Published in Nature Communications, the study is a collaboration among the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé in Burkina Faso.

The team aimed to design a high-sensitivity, low-cost method suitable for resource-limited regions without advanced laboratory infrastructure.

The study analysed 672 finger-prick blood samples from residents of rural communities in The Gambia and Burkina Faso. Of these, 146 samples tested positive for Plasmodium falciparum using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

The new test, called Dragonfly, combines a magnetic DNA extraction system known as SmartLid with a colorimetric isothermal amplification platform based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Its performance was compared with three reference methods: qPCR (the gold standard), expert optical microscopy, and rapid antigen tests detecting the histidine-rich protein 2.

The device achieved a detection limit of 0.6 parasite per microlitre, and the full process — from sample collection to result — took less than 45 minutes.

Dragonfly integrates two key innovations. The SmartLid uses silica-coated magnetic beads to capture DNA directly from small blood samples without centrifugation, completing extraction in about 10 minutes. The Dragonfly platform then uses temperature-stable lyophilised reagents to amplify DNA at 63.5 °C. Results are visually read — a colour change from pink to yellow indicates a positive result — eliminating the need for optical or digital readers.

The system demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI, 90.4%-98.1%) and specificity of 96.8% (95% CI, 94.9%-98.0%) compared with qPCR. Among asymptomatic individuals, sensitivity was 94.9%, and for submicroscopic infections (fewer than 16 parasites per microlitre), it was 95.3%. These rates far surpassed rapid tests (49.6%) and microscopy (70.1%), even when performed by experienced technicians.

Beyond its diagnostic accuracy, Dragonfly offers practical advantages. Commercial LAMP platforms such as Loopamp (Eiken Chemical, Japan) and Alethia Malaria (Meridian Bioscience, the US) perform well but require costly equipment (around $20,000) and have limited throughput. In contrast, Dragonfly operates with a 20-W portable heat block, powered by battery or solar energy, making it far more suitable for field deployment in remote areas.

The authors emphasise that the new system meets the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda criteria for field diagnostics — high sensitivity, speed, affordability, ease of use, and portability. Mathematical models suggest that lowering the detection threshold below two parasites per microlitre could triple the effectiveness of mass testing and treatment strategies.

Still under development, the technology will undergo additional field studies to assess thermal stability and usability by community health workers. The lyophilised reagents remain stable for at least 6 months at 30 °C, while the SmartLid extraction kits can be stored for up to 1 year without losing efficacy.

The research team also plans to transfer the technology to African production centres, a move that could reduce costs and support regional manufacturing of molecular diagnostics. The Dragonfly platform has already been adapted for rapid detection of mpox and emerging respiratory infections, showing its flexibility for use beyond malaria.

The next phase involves integrating digital connectivity and cloud-based data storage to allow real-time reporting and epidemiologic surveillance, aligned with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's digital health transformation strategy.

The diagnostic approach tested in Africa could inspire similar efforts in the Brazilian Amazon, where logistical challenges and limited healthcare access remain major barriers to malaria elimination.

According to Brazil's Ministry of Health, 140,263 locally acquired malaria cases were recorded in 2023 — 15.3% caused by P. falciparum and 82.7% by Plasmodium vivax. More than 99% of cases occurred in the Amazon region, where geographic isolation makes laboratory testing difficult.

By March 2025, Brazil had reported 25,473 cases, a 26.8% decrease compared with the same period in 2024. In the state of Amazonas, 12,527 cases were recorded between January and March 2025, down from 14,340 during the same period a year earlier.

In remote riverine and Indigenous communities, dependence on central laboratories or microscopy is often impractical. Portable molecular technologies such as Dragonfly could enable rapid on-site diagnosis in floating clinics, mobile health boats, or Indigenous health centres, ensuring faster detection and treatment.

Similar innovations are already emerging. In Amazonas, researchers funded by the Amazonas Research Foundation have developed antibody-based prototypes and rapid tests tailored to local conditions. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Brazil's leading biomedical research institute, has also created a portable isothermal amplification device for diagnosing neglected infectious diseases, including malaria and arboviral infections such as dengue and Zika.

In 2025, the Brazilian Ministry of Health launched the Malariômetro, a digital surveillance tool designed to improve real-time monitoring of malaria trends and strengthen epidemiologic oversight nationwide.

The combination of high-sensitivity molecular diagnostics and digital data systems may represent a new frontier in malaria control. As demonstrated in Africa, technological decentralisation and regional production are essential to expanding access, reducing health disparities, and strengthening genomic and epidemiologic surveillance in hard-to-reach regions like the Amazon.

In a study, patients with dermatomyositis who used immunostimulatory herbs before symptom onset showed significantly lower rates of myositis-specific, myositis-associated, and antinuclear autoantibodies than those who did not use any herbal supplements.

“Rather than rely only on autoantibody testing, physicians should also consider clinical findings and screen for herbal intake when diagnosing and managing dermatomyositis,” the authors wrote. “Individuals susceptible to developing autoimmune responses should be counseled about the possible risk of herbal use until the pathway is further elucidated,” they added.

The study was led by Xiwei Yang, Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and was published online on November 5 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study was performed at a single US academic center and relied on self-reported herb use, which could introduce recall bias; confounding factors such as other dietary practices and infection-related herb use might have influenced results.

The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development and Biomedical Research and Development. One author reported receiving grants and consulting fees from multiple pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Biogen, Gilead, Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Viela, Amgen, Regeneron, Argenx, CSL Behring, Ventus, q32 Bio, BMS, and Horizon Priovant Pharmaceuticals.

Only about a quarter of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consumed high-fiber diets. Dietary fiber intake was lower among patients with active IBD vs inactive disease, particularly among patients with ulcerative colitis.

“While we await more randomized trials that evaluate the role of dietary fiber in patients with active disease, given the other health benefits of a high-fiber diet, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced cancer risk, these data should empower us to continue to strive for healthier high-fiber diets for our patients with IBD, which can be driven through patient education on this topic,” the authors wrote.

This study, led by Jaya Vasudevan, MD, of the University of Texas at Austin, was published online in Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.

The findings may be less generalizable to patients at nonacademic centers. The food frequency questionnaire relied on recall over the past year and was not specifically validated in patients with IBD. The cross-sectional analysis precluded causal relationships between dietary fiber and disease activity. 

This study was supported with institutional funds from Ascension Seton under a partnership with Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Proximity to primary care was associated with increased use of primary care, decreased emergency department use, and increased uptake of recommended cancer screening in a recent analysis. 

In a study that included nearly 10 million patients enrolled with family physicians in Ontario, those who lived further than 30 km away from their doctors were more likely to use the emergency department for nonurgent care, not to have seen any family physician in the past 2 years, and not to have had screening for colon, breast, or cervical cancer compared with patients who lived closer. They were also more likely to be male, to be younger than 65 years, to live in low-income neighborhoods, and to be newcomers to Ontario.

“When we talk about the primary care shortage, we often talk about people who don't have access to primary care, but this study highlights that even those who are attached to a family physician are struggling with access, and that increased distance is a potential barrier to receiving care,” study author Archna Gupta, MD, a scientist at Upstream Lab and a family physician at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, told Medscape News Canada.

The study was published on November 3 in CMAJ.

The Ontario government recently passed the Primary Care Act, which establishes a vision for providing publicly funded primary care for everyone who lives in the province by 2029.

“Our results are timely. The legislation's first commitments are that everyone in the province should have an opportunity to have a relationship with a primary care clinician or a team and that this access should be convenient and inclusive,” Gupta said.

“As we think about how to do this effectively, we need to think about geographics. When people move, every child has access to a school district. We could do something similar, developing primary care districts.”

To see how distance might affect healthcare use and quality, the investigators conducted a population-based study of all patients who were enrolled with a family physician as of March 31, 2023. They examined the relationship between travel distance to the physician and emergency department visits, primary care visits, continuity of care, and cancer screening rates during the previous 2 years.

The study included 9,967,955 patients. Of these participants, 1,262,112 (12.7%) lived farther than 30 km from their family physicians. The farther away patients lived from their physicians, the less continuity of care they had, the fewer family physician visits they had, the more emergency department visits they had, and the less cancer screening they had.

Distant patients had greater odds of having nonurgent emergency department visits in the past year (odds ratio [OR], 1.43), having no visits with any family physician in the previous 2 years (OR, 1.28), and not having had screening for colon cancer (OR, 1.17), breast cancer (OR, 1.24), and cervical cancer (OR, 1.17).

“Distance is a determinant of health that can affect our access to care and should be taken into consideration as we think about how to improve access to primary care,” Gupta said.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape News Canada, Howard Bergman, MD, professor of family medicine, geriatric medicine, and oncology at McGill University in Montreal, agreed with the researchers' premise that the distance from health services is an important factor in healthcare access.

“But for some people, driving a greater distance might not be a particular problem. For any medical care, there is always the aspect of choice,” Bergman said. He did not participate in the current study.

“In Sweden, they did an experiment. There, you had no choice. You went to the primary care clinic that was in your neighborhood or district. And they moved away from that at some point because they said that it removed choice. There's a balance between having your medical care at a reasonable distance and having a choice of primary physician,” he said.

“I know of many instances where people move for one reason or another, but still want to keep their family doctor, even though it means a longer drive. It's a balance between having somebody relatively close and having somebody whom you trust.”

The study was supported by ICES, which receives funding from the Ontario Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care. The study also received funding from the Innovations Strengthening Primary Health Care Through Research Program, which is funded through the Health Systems Research Program of the Ontario Ministry of Health. Gupta and Bergman reported having no relevant financial relationships.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Missing blood pressure (BP) records within 2 years prior to diagnosis were associated with substantially higher risks for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among those with recorded BP, systolic BP of 120 mm Hg conferred a moderately higher risk for mortality outcomes than that of 140 mm Hg.

""[The study] findings emphasise the need for routine BP assessments and personalised treatment strategies to optimise cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anna Meffen, PhD, Leicester Real World Evidence Unit, Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, England. It was published online on October 28, 2025, in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

Because this was an observational study, residual confounding could not be eliminated. Key variables, including other comorbidities, detailed antihypertensive treatment data, and albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio, were incompletely recorded or missing, potentially biasing the observed associations. BP was measured only at a single baseline timepoint, so visit‑to‑visit variability over time was not captured.

This study was supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, the Leicester NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, and the British Heart Foundation Research Excellence Award. Two authors reported receiving consulting fees, speaker fees, or grants from multiple pharmaceutical companies.

Among individuals at high risk for stroke, those who participated in a 10-week primary care program that promoted involvement in everyday activities and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle had a 61% lower likelihood of remaining at high risk at 12 months.

“[The study] results indicate the potential of the [Make My Day] intervention for primary healthcare settings and the potential of a comprehensive lifestyle analysis and formulating realistic individual goals,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Cecilia Johnsson, Division of Occupational Therapy, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on November 02, 2025, in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health.

The intervention group may have been motivated to succeed for both personal benefit and to comply with the study. The sample was largely homogenous, with high education and income levels. Both groups received lifestyle analysis and goals; thus, the control group acted as an active control group.

This study received funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare and the Research School in Health Science at Karolinska Institutet. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A new study finds that thunderstorms can trigger sharp increases in asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, underscoring the importance of storm preparedness for people with asthma. The research is being presented at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Orlando.

""Thunderstorm asthma"" is a well-documented environmental phenomenon internationally, but studies in United States in areas with heavy pollen have been limited. According to the World Allergy Organization, thunderstorms are considered a risk factor for asthma attacks in patients suffering from pollen allergy.

Researchers analyzed 4,439 asthma-related ER visits across three Wichita, KS hospitals from January 2020 to December 2024. Using meteorologic records, they identified 38 thunderstorm days during this period.

Key findings included:

These results confirm that thunderstorms can pose a serious health risk for people with asthma, even in the United States. Because storms are unpredictable, patients and healthcare providers should include storm-specific precautions in asthma action plans.""

Diala Merheb, MD, lead author of the study

The researchers note that storm-related surges in asthma cases place a significant burden on emergency departments. By recognizing the connection between thunderstorms and asthma exacerbations, communities and healthcare systems can develop preparedness strategies to protect vulnerable populations and reduce strain on hospitals.

Says allergist Selina Gierer, DO, ACAAI member and one of the study authors, ""If you or your child has asthma, it's smart to think about thunderstorms the same way you prepare for high-pollen days or cold weather. ""Understanding triggers and having a clear plan can help avoid emergency room visits.""

A nationwide study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has found that adolescents who experience migraines are three times more likely to have high blood pressure. The research, which analyzed data from over two million Israeli teens, revealed that the link was strongest among those with severe or frequent migraines. The findings suggest that early blood pressure screening for teens with migraines could help detect cardiovascular risks before they develop into chronic disease.

A massive Israeli study tracking over 2 million adolescents has uncovered a striking connection between migraine headaches and high blood pressure—conditions rarely studied together in young people. The research, conducted by scientists at The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center , reveals that teens diagnosed with migraines were three times more likely to have hypertension than their peers, suggesting that what may seem like ""just headaches"" could signal deeper vascular issues.

The study analyzed medical records from Israel's national pre-military health screenings between 1990 and 2019, covering adolescents aged 16 to 20. Among more than 61,000 teens diagnosed with migraines, nearly 1 in 150 also had hypertension, compared to 1 in 500 among those without migraines. The link held strong even after accounting for factors like age, gender, body mass index, and socioeconomic background.

What stood out most was the severity connection: adolescents with severe migraines were over four times more likely to have high blood pressure than those with mild or no headaches. Similarly, cases of severe hypertension were more common among those with frequent or disabling migraines.

Migraine is often dismissed as a temporary neurological complaint. But our findings suggest it may also serve as a marker for early vascular dysfunction—meaning these young people could be at higher cardiovascular risk long before adulthood.""

Prof. Ronit Calderon-Margalit from the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine, one of the study's senior authors

The study, published in Hypertension, is the largest of its kind to examine this relationship in adolescents using verified medical diagnoses rather than self-reported symptoms. Previous research mostly focused on adults, leaving a gap in understanding how these conditions interact during youth—when prevention can make the biggest difference.

While the findings don't prove that migraines cause high blood pressure, the researchers emphasize the importance of screening adolescents with migraines for early signs of hypertension. Identifying elevated blood pressure early could help prevent long-term complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage later in life.

The results also raise intriguing biological questions: both migraines and hypertension involve the body's vascular system, and recent genetic studies have pointed to shared pathways influencing blood vessel function and inflammation.

For parents and teens, the takeaway is clear—don't ignore frequent or severe headaches. They may be more than a passing pain.

Medical and scientific evidence is proving invaluable in holding public authorities accountable for the impact of unlawful air pollution on people's health, say experts in The BMJ's climate issue today.

Gaia Lisi and Rupert Stuart-Smith at the University of Oxford say that relatively few studies attributing health impacts to climate change have been published so far, but as this research field matures, methods are becoming more widely recognised, opening up new routes for climate accountability.

They describe recent cases where medical and scientific evidence has been used to defend human rights to health.

For example, in the UK, the inquest into the death of 9-year-old Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah concluded that exposure to high levels of air pollution contributed materially to her death, while in a case against Italy, the European Court of Human Rights used peer reviewed research to establish a ""real and imminent risk"" to life.

Similarly, in a series of civil liability cases in France, medical evidence was used to prove causal links between short term peaks in air pollution and aggravation of respiratory symptoms in children.

And they say scientific evidence demonstrating the human health consequences of climate change is likely to assume greater importance in lawsuits in national, regional, and international forums following recent advisory opinions on climate change by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and International Court of Justice saying that states have specific duties to protect the health of individuals from life threatening effects of climate change.

In lawsuits concerning environmental pollution, they also point out that medical experts have had a key role in helping courts understand the protections needed to uphold health related laws, be it through conducting research underpinning legal arguments and judicial decisions, acting as expert witnesses, or providing third party evidence.

""Improved understanding of the health consequences of climate change could have a similar effect, clarifying the extent to which states are meeting their legal obligations to protect health, and opening up routes for climate justice where they fall short,"" they conclude.

In a linked article, Laura Clarke at ClientEarth and Hugh Montgomery at University College London, say these landmark court decisions mean that big emitters, both states and companies, can no longer feign ignorance about the impacts of their activities.

""As attribution science strengthens further, we expect to see more class actions and damages claims brought by climate affected communities which, when they scale, will change the calculations and business models of big emitters,"" they add.

They suggest that health professionals can help in characterising and appropriately attributing cause of deaths and disease resulting from the direct and indirect impacts of climate change, such as the direct health consequences of heatwaves on kidney and heart disease, or reproductive health.

However, attribution to socioeconomic impacts will require the development of new models, they note.

Medical professionals can also drive action by helping to support legal interventions where those responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions are wilfully indifferent or unresponsive, they add.

""If we are to make progress on emissions, action will require holding big polluters to account through the courts. Medical professionals, everywhere, should play their part in this process,"" they conclude.

The world's largest collection of curated eye imaging and linked clinical data is expanding across the country, in an initiative led out of Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL (University College London).

The INSIGHT Health Data Research Hub for Eye Health and Oculomics is benefiting from investment funding of £3.7 million awarded by UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).

INSIGHT will expand from Moorfields Eye Hospital and create a blueprint for linking NHS sites across the country, supporting research, improving patient care, and fostering innovation in eye health.

As part of a four-year programme of work delivered through Moorfields Eye Hospital's strategic partnership with the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, INSIGHT will on-board NHS sites including Sunderland Eye Infirmary, one of the UK's largest regional centres for ophthalmology, working in collaboration with South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and North East North Cumbria Secure Data Environment.

INSIGHT will also broaden national data linkages and integrate genetic data from the NIHR BioResource and UK Biobank to accelerate oculomics research, which uses biomarkers in the eye to detect systemic conditions such as dementia and cardiovascular disease.

Patient and public representatives will play a central role, working with project leads to embed standards for data access and governance, address risks of bias in artificial intelligence, and ensure equitable benefits for underserved communities.

The enhanced INSIGHT research data platform will grow from over 30 million images - currently more ophthalmic data than the top three centres in the US combined - to some 50 million images, consolidating the UK as the global leader in ophthalmology and oculomics research and innovation.

INSIGHT Director Professor Pearse Keane (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital) said: ""This funding allows us to expand INSIGHT from Moorfields Eye Hospital into a truly national resource, with significant benefits for clinical research and public health. Ophthalmology is the busiest NHS speciality, increasingly under pressure as patient need grows. By providing a comprehensive, interoperable research resource for ophthalmic data, we can help to accelerate research discoveries, bring new treatments to patients faster, and ultimately reduce the burden of sight-threatening disease in the UK and globally.""

The potential of NHS data to improve patient outcomes and tackle health inequalities is immense. We are proud that the INSIGHT Hub has led the way in harnessing routinely collected NHS eye imaging data for medical research, demonstrating how patient data can be optimised for research in a safe and secure way, involving patients and members of the public in decision-making. With this grant funding, we anticipate entering an exciting new phase in the Hub's development, supporting the UK's ambitions as a global leader in healthcare technology.""

Peter Ridley, CEO, Moorfields Eye Hospital

The award is one of five announced by UKRI MRC and the NIHR to enhance biomedical and health-related data and digital platform resources in the UK, following a UKRI call published last year.

Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a pioneering method to mend damaged hearts without open-heart surgery, an advance that could one day transform the treatment of heart failure. 

The new approach uses lab-grown heart tissue made from reprogrammed adult stem cells, delivered through a tiny incision rather than a surgically opened chest cavity. In preclinical testing, the stem cell patch restored heart function and improved healing.

For patients with severe heart failure, there are very few options beyond mechanical pumps or transplants. We hope this approach will offer a new way to repair their own hearts.""

Wuqiang Zhu, Ph.D., senior author of the study published in Acta Biomaterialia and cardiovascular researcher, Mayo Clinic, Arizona

Heart attacks remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, oxygen-starved cells die and are replaced by scar tissue that cannot contract or conduct electrical signals - weakening the heart's ability to pump blood.

""The adult human heart doesn't regenerate once those cells are lost,"" Dr. Zhu explains. ""That's why heart failure, especially chronic heart failure due to the loss of functional cardiac muscle, is often difficult to treat; the muscle simply can't repair itself.""

For years, scientists have been working on ways to replace damaged tissue with healthy heart cells derived from stem cells. Early efforts showed promise, but most required open-heart surgery - a procedure too risky for many patients already struggling with severe heart failure.

Scientists have long hoped that stem cells could provide a way to rebuild what the body cannot. By reprogramming ordinary adult cells such as skin or blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers can coax them into becoming replacement heart cells.

But safely and effectively delivering engineered heart tissues made from these cells has remained a major challenge.

In collaboration with engineers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Mayo researchers developed a flexible, paper-thin patch made of nano- and microfibers coated with gelatin. This hybrid scaffold supports a blend of human heart muscle cells, blood vessel cells and fibroblasts-cells that form the tissue's structural framework-to create a living, beating piece of heart tissue. Before transplantation, the tissue is infused with bioactive factors such as fibroblast growth factor 1 and CHIR99021 that encourage the growth of new blood vessels and help the cells survive once they are in place.

""The beauty of this design,"" says Dr. Zhu, ""is that it can be folded like a piece of paper, loaded into a slender tube, and delivered precisely where it's needed through a small incision in the chest. Once in place, it unfolds and adheres naturally to the heart's surface.""

Instead of using stitches, the team used a biocompatible surgical adhesive that holds the patch in place while minimizing additional trauma to the surrounding tissue.

Testing in preclinical models showed that the minimally invasive method improved heart function, reduced scarring, enhanced vascular growth and lessened inflammation compared with conventional approaches.

""Our results show that these engineered tissues not only survive but actually help the heart heal itself,"" says Dr. Zhu. ""That's the ultimate goal: to replace what's lost and restore function.""

The research aligns closely with Mayo Clinic's Genesis Initiative, which aims to accelerate discoveries that restore or regenerate human organs and tissues.

""Genesis is about pioneering new ways to repair and rebuild the human body,"" Dr. Zhu says. ""What we're doing here is exactly that - using regenerative science and minimally invasive delivery to give the heart a chance to recover.""

Currently, more than 4,000 heart transplants are performed in the United States each year, while thousands more patients die waiting for a donor organ. Dr. Zhu hopes this technology could eventually offer another option.

""Our vision,"" he says, ""is that patients could one day receive engineered heart tissue made from their own reprogrammed cells, delivered through a minimally invasive procedure - no donor organ, no long recovery, just a repaired heart.""

The Mayo Clinic team plans to advance this work through larger-scale preclinical testing to ensure the therapy's safety and effectiveness before moving to human clinical trials, a process that Dr. Zhu estimates could take five years or more.

""Heart failure remains a devastating condition,"" he says. ""If we can make stem cell treatment accessible to more patients, especially those too fragile for open-heart surgery, we could save lives.""

Children with atopic dermatitis (AD), commonly known as eczema, may experience fewer infections and allergic complications if they receive the COVID-19 vaccine, according to new research being presented at the 2025 American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting in Orlando.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition driven by the immune system and often precedes the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Children with AD are also at higher risk for infections, including those affecting the skin and respiratory system.""

Tristan Nguyen, BS, medical student, lead author of the study

Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study, analyzing 5,758 vaccinated and 5,758 unvaccinated pediatric AD patients, younger than 17 years of age. The subjects were matched for demographics and health history. Children with prior COVID-19 infection or major comorbidities were excluded.

""Our study suggests that COVID-19 vaccination not only protects against coronavirus but may also have broader health benefits for children with atopic dermatitis,"" said Zhibo Yang, MD, PhD, the principal investigator (PI) of the study. ""We found lower rates of both allergic conditions and infections among vaccinated children compared to their unvaccinated peers.""

Key findings included:

The findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting vaccination as a valuable tool in protecting children with chronic allergic conditions.

Children with a family history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased risk of developing the disease. However, children born to mothers with T1D are less likely to develop the disease than those whose fathers or siblings have T1D. A new study published in Nature Metabolism has identified distinct blood methylome changes in children exposed to maternal T1D. Some of these changes were related to reduced islet autoimmunity development, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may underlie the protection against islet autoimmunity. The work is a collaboration between Helmholtz Munich, the Global Platform for the Prevention of Autoimmune Diabetes (GPPAD), and the TU Dresden University of Technology.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the body's own insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas, leaving patients with a lifelong dependency on external insulin. Children whose parents or siblings have type 1 diabetes have an 8- to 15-fold increased risk of developing the autoimmune disease themselves. However, this risk is not evenly distributed: the child of a mother with type 1 diabetes has a lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes than a child with a father or sibling with type 1 diabetes. Of interest, genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes has been shown to be comparable between the offspring of mothers and the offspring of fathers with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, researchers suspected that early-life epigenetic programming may be a key mechanism through which maternal type 1 diabetes confers a protective effect.

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation determine which genes are ultimately read and expressed. By changing DNA methylation patterns, environmental influences in the womb such as smoking by the mother, medical conditions, stress, or diet can have far-reaching effects on a child's health by switching genes on or off in the early life period and later in life. Hence, specific environmental conditions in the womb of a mother with type 1 diabetes, the so-called intrauterine environment, may influence the child's risk for islet autoimmunity through epigenetic modifications.

We observed DNA methylation changes at multiple type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes in children born to mothers with type 1 diabetes."" 

Prof. Sandra Hummel, researcher at the Helmholtz Munich Institute for Diabetes Research and last author of the study

Her team investigated how maternal type 1 diabetes influences the child's epigenome. In a new epigenome-wide association study, they identified that maternal type 1 diabetes is associated with specific epigenetic marks in the form of DNA methylation in the child. These changes appear to affect the expression of several genes involved in immune function.

The researchers examined blood samples from 1,752 children at around two years of age from the BABYDIAB, BABYDIET, and POInT cohorts. All children included had an increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. They compared DNA methylation patterns of 790 children with and 962 children without a mother affected by type 1 diabetes to identify differences linked to maternal diabetes.

""Our study identified numerous differentially methylated genetic locations, predominantly in the HOXA gene cluster and the MHC region in offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes. The MHC region is known to confer the major genetic susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. We observed that the epigenomic changes in these children were associated with the expression of 15 type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes,"" explains Dr. Raffael Ott, lead scientist at the Institute of Diabetes Research and first author of the study.

Using 34 differentially methylated positions at type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci that best reflected exposure to maternal type 1 diabetes, the researchers created a methylation propensity score. Testing this score in children without a mother with type 1 diabetes, they found that those who developed islet autoimmunity had significantly lower scores, indicating less protective epigenetic modification. These findings suggest that environmental factors may modulate the risk of islet autoimmunity through epigenetic changes to key susceptibility genes.

In a following project led by Sandra Hummel, the researchers will take a closer look at the relative protection of children born to mothers with type 1 diabetes. Together with Prof. Ezio Bonifacio and colleagues from the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden at the TU Dresden University of Technology, the team aims to identify which type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes are epigenetically modulated by maternal type 1 diabetes and whether similar epigenetic effects occur in children born to mothers with gestational diabetes.

In collaboration with further Helmholtz Munich researchers, the project will also explore potential protein and metabolomic biomarkers linked to DNA methylation patterns and how these molecular changes contribute to protection against islet autoimmunity. To this end, they will analyze bio-samples collected within GPPAD trials, the BABYDIAB and the BABYDIET cohorts, and the Fr1da study. The project is supported by a grant of over 550,000 USD from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust.

New research presented at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) offers encouraging news for parents of young children with peanut allergies. A long-term study found that a peanut patch treatment – epicutaneous immunotherapy – continued to help toddlers safely build tolerance to peanuts over three years.

The treatment, known as the Viaskin Peanut Patch, delivers small amounts of peanut protein through the skin. The goal is to train the immune system to tolerate peanut exposure and reduce the risk of severe allergic reactions from accidental ingestion.

This new analysis looked at toddlers who originally received placebo in an earlier one-year study and then used the peanut patch for up to three years. After three years of treatment, more than 70% of these children could tolerate the equivalent of at least three to four peanut kernels – a significant improvement from their first year of treatment. Nearly half could tolerate even higher amounts.

Importantly, the treatment continued to show a strong safety record. No cases of treatment-related anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) were reported in the third year. Skin irritation at the patch site – the most common side effect – became less frequent over time. Researchers also found that children's reactions during food challenges became milder, with fewer severe symptoms after three years than after one year.

These results show that ongoing treatment with the peanut patch continues to improve tolerance and remains safe over time. For parents of toddlers with peanut allergies, this kind of approach may one day offer peace of mind by reducing the risk of having an allergic reaction, including severe reactions, from accidental exposure.""

Matthew Greenhawt, MD, MBA, allergist, lead author and ACAAI member

Peanut allergy affects about 2% of children in the U.S. and is a leading cause of severe allergic reactions. The study results add to growing evidence that early intervention in young children could help change the course of peanut allergy. Researchers stress that parents should not attempt any form of peanut desensitization at home and should discuss emerging treatment options with a board-certified allergist.

The research was funded by DBV Technologies.

The rise in virtual research since the COVID-19 pandemic has created opportunities for researchers to expand and diversify clinical trials, but it has also opened up avenues for fraudulent participation in these studies. A new study led by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researchers directed by Michael Stein, chair and professor of the Department of Health Law, Policy & Management (HLPM) at BUSPH, provides a comprehensive checklist of indicators that researchers can utilize to quickly identify suspicious behavior and prevent fraudulent actors from enrolling in online studies and compromising valuable data.

The most effective way to prevent this fraudulent activity is to implement a combination of automated and manual actions during the prescreening, screening, and enrollment process, according to the report published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. 

In addition to automated fraud detection methods, the study suggests that researchers should utilize a checklist of precautions to spot, along with videoconferencing and photo identification requests from participants during the screening process. These actions can reveal fraudulent actors-who are largely driven by financial gain from research compensation-before the actual enrollment process begins.

Modest financial remuneration is a cornerstone of most studies, important for recognizing participants' time and effort, while also helping to boost engagement and retention. However, as compensated research opportunities expand in the online setting, so too do opportunities for fraudulent participation, from participants misrepresenting their eligibility or enrolling multiple times, to automated bots attempting to complete online surveys. As online research becomes more prevalent, it is essential for investigators to be vigilant and design their digital studies with fraud prevention in mind.""

Kara Magane, study corresponding author, senior director of research operations in HLPM at BUSPH

Digital recruitment is especially valuable because it allows researchers to collect data among populations that are underrepresented or difficult to reach through traditional in-person methods.

""Online research has lowered barriers to participating in research, particularly for people with stigmatized diagnoses, such as HIV,"" says study lead author Robert Siebers, an HLPM research coordinator at BUSPH at the time of the study. ""Allowing participants to remain in their own home ensures higher levels of privacy and comfort that in-person research cannot. Without proper guardrails, fraudulent participation can arise due to the ability to more easily misrepresent one's identity online.""

In the study, the researchers and colleagues from BU's College of Arts and Sciences, Tufts Medical Center, and the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University describe the team's own experience with fraudulent participants when screening and enrolling people with HIV into two linked online trials: ""Integrated Telehealth Intervention to Reduce Chronic Pain"" and ""Unhealthy Drinking Among People Living With HIV."" The randomized trials were conducted through the Boston ARCH Comorbidity Center in 2023 and 2024. After a research assistant noticed during a videoconference screening that a participant appeared to be wearing a wig and resembled another person who had been interviewed days prior, the team discovered that 10 fraudulent participants had enrolled in the trials, and they quickly disenrolled them at an early stage. The team created a checklist of precautions to refer to during each stage of the selection process moving forward, and was able to detect 37 additional fraudulent participants during the screening process. They evaluated their enrollment protection methods six months later and found no new fraudulent actors participating in their trials.

Some of the suspicious behavior that researchers should look for during the prescreening process include similar patterns in email addresses (such as those that use multiple numbers), zip codes that do not correspond to the participant's home state, or other details that seem unusually similar, such as the same level of physical activity among multiple participants. During the screening portion, the team says researchers should also investigate participants who enroll multiple times, provide predictable responses or swift answers to questions that typically require thought, or have similar accents or patterns of speech to participants previously identified as fraudulent. In their trials, the team modified the study protocol to allow phone screenings to take place on camera so that they could monitor participants' appearance and other suspicious behavior, such as muting their microphone frequently after each question. 

During baseline interviews on video, the team recommends that researchers ask-but not mandate-that participants show photo identification on the screen.

""Ensuring participant comfort and privacy is of utmost importance for all researchers, but particularly in research that involves stigmatized populations or diagnoses,"" Siebers says. ""Requesting, but not requiring, a photo ID in our study was a key flexibility that allowed us to be respectful of participant privacy concerns while ensuring we had the opportunity to verify someone's true identity when needed."" They also did not request electronic copies of IDs, he adds. 

Automated methods, such as IP address identification systems and bot detection tools, can also be effective at identifying fraudulent activity in the earliest stages of the selection process, but these methods often require financial or technological resources that may not be available to all researchers.

The team also recommends that researchers coordinate with their institution's Institutional Review Board (IRB), committees that ensure that human research is ethical and compliant with regulations.

""IRBs and funding agencies can play an important role by recognizing fraud prevention as an integral part of research workflows, particularly for online studies,"" Magane says. ""They can encourage researchers to include fraud detection and prevention plans in their study protocols, and allocate appropriate resources for these efforts within study budgets. They can also provide clear guidance and support around recognizing and responding to research participation fraud.""

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and all precautions should be tailored to each study design, the researchers say.

""As a community of researchers, I'm not sure we have a grip on how much virtual research involves fraudulent participants and therefore how much published data might be tainted,"" says Stein, senior author author of the study. ""What we unexpectedly and unfortunately learned as researchers was that from the moment of planning an online study through the participant recruitment phase, researchers need to be alert to the possibility that bad actors-and I mean that literally-can ruin the reliability of their findings. Fraud protection may need to be described in all published fully virtual studies going forward.""

A team of scientists at the University of Seville has identified an essential process that protects DNA integrity in reproductive cells, providing new clues about how organisms avoid genetic defects during egg formation.

A recently published study, the result of Nuria Fernández-Fernández's doctoral work, describes how phosphorylation, a chemical modification of the BRC-1/BRD-1 protein complex in the Caenorhabditis elegans worm, acts as a ""switch"" against DNA damage. This activation allows the genome to repair itself properly during meiosis, the process that gives rise to reproductive cells.When this mechanism fails, the DNA suffers serious breaks, leading to accumulated damage, chromosome fragmentation and loss of embryo viability. The researchers also identified two enzymes, Bloom and Mus81, that contribute to these problems by incorrectly resolving the bonds between damaged DNA molecules.

Our findings reveal a critical step in the cellular response to genetic damage in the germline. Understanding these processes is essential to understanding how aneuploidy and developmental defects are prevented.""

A Weill Cornell Medicine investigator and other members of a technical advisory group to the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund have outlined measures that nations can take to ensure that children's health is accounted for within climate change goals. The authors discuss concrete and achievable indicators in a commentary published Oct. 1 in The Lancet Planetary Health.

Children have specific needs that often get overlooked. We're making sure that doesn't happen.""

Dr. Ilan Cerna-Turoff, lead author, assistant professor of epidemiology in emergency medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine

The topic is particularly relevant as world leaders gather for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) in Belém, Brazil to discuss how to measure their countries' progress toward adapting to climate change.

""When they met at COP28 in November of 2023, world leaders made very broad commitments, but they didn't have concrete indicators for measuring progress,"" Dr. Cerna-Turoff said, ""and how are you going to keep to your commitments without metrics?""

To rectify the situation, the United Nations, government representatives, regional governance bodies and civil society groups proposed a list of candidate indicators to assess progress, totaling 5,339 distinct indicators related to the impacts of climate change. ""It was an enormous list,"" Dr. Cerna-Turoff said, ""that covered multiple domains of health and wellbeing but did not have an explicit focus on child health.""

Dr. Cerna-Turoff and the co-authors identified six indicators from the original list pertinent to child health, which could be measured in at least 50% of countries globally. To those six, they suggested 11 additional standardized indicators, making a total of 17. The final list spans childhood mortality rates to metrics related to nutrition and vaccination coverage. Dr. Cerna-Turoff and the co-authors are advocating for signatories to the Paris Agreement to adopt these 17 indicators at COP30.

Whether signatories to the Paris Agreement adopt all 17 indicators or chart a separate course, Dr. Cerna-Turoff thinks that increasing standardized measurement makes global child health data more readily available, which supports other targets, like the Sustainable Development Goals, and opens valuable opportunities to analyze how the climate change agenda is influencing child health. Combining communicable disease data with information about flooding or heat, for instance, ""could pinpoint the specific effects of these weather systems on health outcomes,"" he said. He further hopes the specificity of the data will increase, disaggregating children by age and economic status, for instance, so global leaders can make sure they are protecting the most vulnerable.

Ultimately, Dr. Cerna-Turoff hopes to see signatories to the Paris Agreement include children in assessing progress and impact of climate adaptation on health. ""Children ultimately will inherit the world that we create today, and we can't afford to leave the youngest members of our society behind,"" he said.

U.S. Veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) face an increased risk of developing several chronic respiratory conditions, according to new research presented at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Orlando.

The large-scale study examined more than 48,000 deployed Veterans compared with a matched group of non-deployed Veterans. Researchers found that deployment was significantly associated with new diagnoses of asthma, chronic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and nasal polyposis (NP) in the decade following service.

Veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were often exposed to airborne hazards such as burn pits and dust storms. We found that these exposures may have long-term health impacts, particularly for respiratory diseases that can affect quality of life for years after service.""

Patrick Gleeson, MD, allergist, lead author of the study and ACAAI member

Key findings included:

The analysis used data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse and included only Veterans with no prior history of the studied conditions. Each deployed veteran was matched with a non-deployed veteran of similar age, sex, race, and ethnicity.

The median age at deployment was 26.7 years, and the majority of veterans in the study were male (84%) and White (75%).

""These results highlight the importance of long-term health surveillance and specialized care for Veterans who served in OIF and OEF,"" said Dr. Gleeson. ""Recognizing the link between deployment and respiratory disease can help guide medical support, policy, and preventive strategies for those affected.""

Despite higher awareness of caffeine's dangers, new research shows that university students, including future doctors, keep reaching for energy drinks to power through their studies.

Study: Energy Drink Knowledge, Consumption, and Regulation Support Among Polish Medical and Non-Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study. Image credit: New Africa/Shutterstock.com

Young adults commonly consume energy drinks (ED), despite the association with high-risk behaviors. A recent study published in Nutrients explores the effect of health education on knowledge about EDs, their consumption, and their attitudes towards them, as well as towards ED sales regulation for minors.

EDs comprise an expanding segment of the global beverage market, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Not only are they widely available, but they are also heavily marketed, making them extremely attractive to this age group. In addition, EDs are most frequently consumed by males and physically active people.

If ingestion starts in youth, ED use may persist and has been associated with poor dietary patterns and the use of other substances, including smoking and alcohol. ED consumption is also associated with palpitations. These effects are often overlooked by marketers, who focus instead on improvements in cognitive and physical performance.

Unmarried people and non-medical students are also at a higher risk for ED consumption. Heavy academic workloads also play a role, with students preferring to use EDs to fight fatigue and maintain alertness. Most university students have mixed feelings about energy drinks and a limited understanding of their potential risks. 

Polish studies indicate high public awareness of these dangers, and public demand for ED sales to be prohibited for minors. Poland has therefore enacted the 2023 amendment to the Public Health Act, which regulates the sale and distribution of ED at the national level. It became operational on January 1, 2024.

This amendment makes it illegal to sell EDs to minors and to distribute EDs in schools or through vending machines. It officially defines EDs and requires that they be clearly labeled. This aims to promote consumer awareness and promote effective enforcement of the amendment.

The current study aimed to evaluate the consumption of EDs and attitudes towards them among Mazovian students in Poland.

The study included 871 students, approximately 42% of whom were medical students. They were asked to fill out an online survey on ED consumption, their knowledge of ED, and their attitudes towards regulation. The students were primarily female, with an average age of 22 years.

About 75% of students consumed EDs once in a while, while the rest were never-users. Approximately 14% each had EDs two or three times a week, once a month, or less than once every three months, respectively. About 9% consumed EDs almost every day. There was no statistically significant difference in consumption frequency between medical and non-medical students.

Only a third of students knew the recommended daily limit of caffeine consumption, with 35% stating they had no idea. Medical students were more likely to answer this correctly.

Knowledge of what goes into EDs was greater among medical students. This group was aware that EDs contained simple sugars, B vitamins, L-carnitine, and electrolytes. Even so, they were no more likely than nonmedical students to identify the presence of caffeine, ginseng, artificial colorants, and taurine in EDs.

Medical students were better informed about the ill effects of ED, including nausea, dizziness, and irritability.

Both medical and non-medical students had the same frequency of ED consumption, despite the former group having superior knowledge. Medical students were more likely to use coffee as well as EDs.

Males were more likely to consume EDs than females, reflecting a broader societal pattern. Almost all ED consumers self-reported disrupted sleep, and 95% said they experienced self-reported elevated blood pressure, while over 90% reported anxiety and irritability. Between 40% and 60% self-reported feeling dizzy or nauseous, vomiting, or decreased coordination.

Both groups had similar patterns of use for alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or psychoactive drugs, as well as taking dietary supplements. Adverse effects were also similarly reported in both groups.

The most common age of first trying EDs was between 15 and 18 years, but 30% said they had their first ED before the age of 15 years. Among medical students, 41% and 42% had their first ED at 15-18 years, and before 15 years, respectively.  Conversely, 59% and 58% of non-medical students showed this pattern, respectively.

Factors prompting ED use included the need for more energy, which was relevant for 63% of students. The need for more concentration accounted for 37%; a similar proportion drank it for the taste; and 32% used EDs as a substitute for coffee. The use of EDs for energy and concentration was more pronounced among medical students. A smaller proportion drank them as part of a social group.

This marks medical and associated professionals as high-risk groups for ED consumption and could underline the need for stronger regulation of the advertising of EDs and other caffeinated beverages. This step may reduce their exposure to these advertisements. Coupled with their heightened awareness of the negative aspects of these drinks, this could lead to a decrease in their consumption among young people.

Both groups supported the legal prohibition protecting minors from EDs. Female students were more often in favor of not selling ED to minors, and supported restrictions on ED advertising, but most students did not believe a ban could be enforced in the real world.

Medical students knew more about the composition and adverse effects of EDs, but did not reduce their use of EDs compared to non-medical students. Health education on the importance of avoiding unsafe caffeine consumption is crucial in preventing excessive caffeine use by medical students, who often seek to overcome fatigue associated with shift work.

Medical students are likely to become responsible for counseling patients with lifestyle disorders and advising them to cease behaviors such as consuming caffeinated drinks. These results highlight the significance of this issue in the field of education.

Combining targeted education with stronger enforcement could enhance the impact of regulatory policies and reduce risky consumption among young adults.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study highlights the impact of pediatric integrative medicine services","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251105/New-study-highlights-the-impact-of-pediatric-integrative-medicine-services.aspx","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 02:31:00 GMT","

A new study conducted by University Hospitals Connor Whole Health highlights the impact of pediatric integrative medicine services. This unique self-governed program, operating within UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, integrates complementary therapies – such as lifestyle interventions, supplements, herbal medicine, cognitive strategies, and bodywork therapies – alongside conventional medical practices. The study describes how this combined approach can help address gaps in care for pediatric patients with complex conditions.

The U.S. pediatric population is experiencing a rise in chronic illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and mental health issues – including those associated with social media. Pediatric integrative medicine is emerging as a promising solution. However, the published landscape describing how these services are implemented, and which pediatric patients are served by integrative medicine, remains limited in scope. The UH Connor Whole Health Pediatrics Program (UH CWHP) was initiated in 2020 as a physician-led service with broad service integration, addressing demands for comprehensive care. This study examined patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment strategies utilized within UH CWHP.

This retrospective study reviewed 2,677 outpatient UH CWHP visits among 657 patients from March 2020 to September 2023. Among those patients, common conditions included anxiety (59.2%), fatigue (44.4%), headache (43.1%), abdominal pain (33.6%), constipation (33.0%), and long-COVID (24.7%). Frequently recommended interventions included dietary changes (61.8%), self-care (33.8%), massage (21.0%), and acupuncture (19.2%). Supplements often suggested were probiotics (49.9%), vitamin D (42.6%), multivitamins (41.9%), and fish oil (39.4%).

The study revealed that many patients with anxiety preferred non-drug treatments and were receptive to learning new coping skills such as cognitive reframing, breathing techniques, dietary modifications, and management of inner dialogs. Patients valued insights from Traditional Chinese Medicine, and about 30 percent utilized Chinese herbal treatment. Those with anxiety related to long-COVID often required additional treatments (e.g., antihistamines). For fatigue related to long-COVID and for many patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, pacing and low dose naltrexone were key interventions.

Dietary interventions and nutritional management focused on realistic, family-friendly shifts toward nutrient rich, minimally processed foods. Probiotics were prescribed in subgroups of patients showing dysbiosis commonly linked to diet and antibiotics. Approximately 30 percent of patients presented with vitamin D deficiency. Also, patients exhibiting seasonal mood imbalances were prescribed light therapy as a helpful non-drug treatment.

Moreover, this study found that myofascial pain was often overlooked before UH CWHP visits. Treatment focused on teaching patients myofascial self-care techniques to manage pain and reduce reliance on medication. Gua Sha, a Traditional Chinese Medicine technique, was frequently used and taught for home pain management. In addition, sleep disruptions and insomnia were common with contributing factors including screen use before bed and inconsistent routines. Support included sleep education, referral to sleep medicine, melatonin, Chinese herbal treatments, and management of iron deficiency.

""Pediatric Integrative Medicine can fill key service gaps in existing health systems, particularly in regards to offering nonpharmacologic pain control methods and emotional regulation strategies. It can also serve complex populations such as patients with long-COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome who do not otherwise have a home within the medical system,"" said David W. Miller, MD, FAAP, L.Ac., Dipl. OM, Principal Investigator of the study, Medical Director of Pediatric Integrative Medicine, and the Françoise Adan, MD, Endowed Director in Connor Whole Health Leadership. ""Patients value care that includes diet and lifestyle modification as well, and appreciate the integration of herbal medicine alongside conventional care approaches. Working with a trained physician helps patients understand what is safe and likely effective, and helps in navigating the vast information available on the internet.""

The whole health model of care provides a framework to understand what matters most to our patients. This study demonstrates the variety of integrative and lifestyle strategies that can be implemented to improve the health of our pediatric patients."" 

Kristi Artz, MD, MS, FACLM, CCMS, Vice President of UH Connor Whole Health, and Sara H. Connor Chair in Integrative Health

UH Connor Whole Health is currently implementing patient-reported outcome measures within its clinics to build upon these findings and better describe the effects of pediatric integrative medicine on patient outcomes. This work was supported by the Elisabeth Severance Prentiss Foundation.

People who drink heavily may have bleeding strokes a decade earlier than people who are not heavy drinkers, according to a study published November 5, 2025, in Neurology®, an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Researchers found that people who regularly had three or more alcoholic drinks per day were more likely to experience intracerebral hemorrhage, a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the brain, at a younger age and with greater severity than people who had fewer than three drinks a day.

Researchers also found that heavy drinkers were more likely to show signs of cerebral small vessel disease, which is damage to small blood vessels in the brain and a type of long-term brain damage.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most deadly type of stroke with cerebral small vessel disease being its leading cause. While heavy drinking has been linked in previous studies to an increased risk of stroke, our findings suggest that it doesn't just increase the severity of a bleeding stroke, it may also accelerate long-term harm to the brain's small vessels.""

M. Edip Gurol, MD, of Harvard University in Boston and member of the American Academy of Neurology

The study included 1,600 adults with an average age of 75 who were hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage. Information on alcohol use was provided during hospital admission, either by the patient or a person with them at the hospital.

Researchers defined heavy alcohol use as regularly drinking three or more alcoholic drinks per day with one drink having the equivalent to 14 grams, or 0.6 ounces, of alcohol. This is typically equal to 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of liquor. Of participants, 104 people, or 7%, met the criteria for heavy alcohol use.

Participants underwent brain scans to assess the severity of their strokes and to look for signs of cerebral small vessel disease. Researchers then compared heavy drinkers to participants who drank fewer than three drinks a day or not at all.

Researchers found heavy drinkers experienced stroke at an average age of 64 compared to an average age of 75 for non-heavy drinkers-an 11-year difference. They also had brain bleeds that were 70% larger on average. They were twice as likely to have bleeding in deep brain regions, and nearly twice as likely to experience bleeding that spread into the brain's fluid-filled spaces, a complication called intraventricular extension. Gurol said these findings typically indicate poorer recovery and health outcomes among people who had brain bleeds.

Heavy drinkers were more than three times as likely to show severe signs of white matter damage called white matter hyperintensities that are typically caused by cerebral small vessel disease. They also had nearly twice the odds of having a pattern of cerebral small vessel disease that reflects chronic damage caused by high blood pressure.

Additionally, they had lower blood platelet counts and slightly higher blood pressure upon hospital admission than non-heavy drinkers, factors that may again contribute to stroke severity and how well a person recovers.

""Reducing heavy alcohol use may not only lower a person's risk of bleeding stroke, it may also slow the progression of cerebral small vessel disease, which in turn may reduce the chances of having another stroke, cognitive decline and long-term disability,"" said Gurol. ""Promoting lifestyle changes like quitting alcohol should be part of stroke prevention efforts, especially for those at higher risk.""

Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design, which looked at a single point in time rather than tracking changes over time. Detailed lifetime alcohol exposure was not available. Researchers also noted that heavy drinking was self-reported, so people may not have remembered or reported the information accurately.

First drink is on us.

First drink is on us.

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (Nov. 6, 2025) - Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw has signed a contract extension through the 2029 season, the club announced Thursday in partnership with Dove.

Shaw, 20, joined Gotham FC in September in an NWSL intraleague-record $1.25 million transfer from the North Carolina Courage. In her Gotham debut on Sept. 12, Shaw scored her first goal for the club against the San Diego Wave, where she began her professional career at age 17. The goal marked the second time she has scored in an NWSL club debut, making her the fifth player in league history to achieve the feat.

“I'm so excited to continue to give my all for this incredible club and our amazing fans,” said Shaw. “I'm grateful to call this place home for the years ahead.”

“Jaedyn has already demonstrated her incredible quality in the short time she's been with us,” said Yael Averbuch West, the general manager and head of soccer operations for Gotham FC. “We're thrilled to keep her at Gotham and look forward to watching her continue to thrive and make an impact with our club.”

The 2022 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year began this season with the Courage, appearing in 19 matches, including 10 starts, and recording three goals and one assist. She became the youngest player in NWSL history to reach 15 career goals, surpassing Alyssa Thompson.

A regular with the U.S. Women's National Team, Shaw was a member of the gold medal–winning American squad at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She also earned the Golden Ball – awarded to the tournament's top player – at the Concacaf W Gold Cup that same year, helping lead the United States to the title in the inaugural event. Shaw received her first senior national team call-up since joining Gotham FC in October and assisted a goal in a U.S. win over Portugal.

Shaw has made nine appearances for Gotham FC this season in all competitions, including seven starts, with one goal and one assist.

Upcoming Friendlies vs. World Cup Qualifiers on Nov. 15/18 in suburban Philadelphia and Tampa;

Luna Faces RSL Teammate Braian Ojeda in Paraguay Match

ATLANTA / HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday, November 5, 2025) – Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna has been named by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino amongst the 25 players selected for upcoming U.S. friendlies on Sun., Nov. 15 and Wed., Nov. 18 against World Cup-bound opponents Paraguay – which will feature Luna's RSL teammate Braian Ojeda – and Uruguay, the two South American nations ranked 15th and 16th globally.

Luna – RSL's 2025 Golden Boot winner with 10 goals and seven assists across all competitions in this most recent season – surpassed his goal output from last year in fewer MLS matches. The 22-year-old playmaker has appeared in 15 of the U.S.A.'s 16 games this season, leading the list of a half-dozen players on the roster with double-digit appearances in 2025. All but one of Luna's career national team appearances have come this year.

Named to the CONCACAF Gold Cup Best XI this summer, Luna tallied three goals and two assists and earned Man of the Match honors after scoring twice in the semifinal win against Guatemala.

Earlier this year, Luna earned the game-winning assist during his first 45 minutes played under Pochettino, suffering a shattered nose in the process, during a January friendly against Costa Rica. During the CONCACAF Nations League consolation match, Luna was bright and assertive against Canada, as the two-time 2024/25 MLS All-Star selection and former MLS Young Player of the Year continues to press for 2026 FIFA World Cup inclusion.

The USA will first host Paraguay, presented by Allstate, on Sun., Nov. 15 at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa. Kickoff from the home of the Philadelphia Union is set for 3:00 p.m. MT and will be broadcast on TNT, HBO Max, Telemundo, Universo, and Peacock.

Three days later, USA-Uruguay, presented by New York Life, will mark the USMNT's return to Tampa for the first time since 2018. Raymond James Stadium hosts on Wed., Nov. 18 against the 16th-ranked Uruguayan side, kicking off at 5:00 p.m. MT and shown live on TNT, truTV, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. Fans can follow the USMNT on X (@USMNT), Instagram (@USMNT), U.S. Soccer Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

For the USMNT, the matches against two more World Cup qualified teams offer more experience against the opponents and styles it could face next summer. Paraguay, 2010 World Cup quarterfinalists who are making their ninth appearance in the tournament, are led by Atlanta United striker Miguel Almirón. Uruguay, currently 15th in the Coca-Cola FIFA Men's World Rankings, finished third in the 2024 Copa America.

Cesar Hernandez reports on the chances that Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi make the U.S. men's national team. (0:52)

United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino on Thursday named his 25-player roster for upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

While it features the return of Borussia Mönchengladbach teammates Giovanni Reyna and Joe Scally, as well as PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi, there are also notable absences, including Juventus' Weston McKennie, AC Milan's Christian Pulisic, Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Marseille's Tim Weah.

The U.S. will face Paraguay in Chester, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 15, and will then take on Uruguay in Tampa three days later.

""As we continue to develop our squad and build on the culture we have created, this is another great opportunity for the players selected for this roster to prove they deserve to be on the final list for the World Cup,"" Pochettino said.

""It's important that they come into this camp prepared to show their qualities on the field and their commitment to being a good teammate. We will keep working on the competitive details in training and have the opportunity to challenge ourselves against two high-quality opponents from South America.""

Pulisic, Richards and Weah have been nursing injuries, with the former sustaining a hamstring injury during the last international window. Weah suffered a thigh injury on Oct. 25, while Richards has been nursing a calf issue.

The reason for McKennie's absence is unknown at the moment, and while he went the distance in Juve's draw against Sporting CP in the UEFA Champions League, he is also trying to impress a new manager in Luciano Spalletti, who was hired last week.

The injury list, which also includes Fulham's Antonee Robinson and Club América's Alejandro Zendejas makes for yet another window where Pochettino will have a roster that is significantly less than full strength.

Reyna and Scally return for the first since both players took part in the 2025 Concacaf Nations League finals back in March. Reyna has also switched clubs in that time, moving to Gladbach from Borussia Dortmund. Both players featured in last week's 4-0 victory over St. Pauli, which was Gladbach's first of the season. The absences of McKennie, Pulisic, Weah and Zendejas could potentially clear the way for Reyna to get considerable playing time.

Pepi returns to the USMNT for the first time since November of 2024, and carries with him considerable momentum, having scored a stoppage time equalizer in PSV's 1-1 draw against Olympiacos in the UCL.

He'll contend with Monaco's Folarin Balogun -- who also scored in the Champions League this week -- as well as Coventry City's Haji Wright for playing time.

The aforementioned November 2024 window was also the last time that Celtic defender Auston Trusty was in the USMNT fold having benefited from injuries to club teammate Cameron Carter-Vickers, as well as the Vancouver Whitecaps' Tristan Blackmon.

Players begin reporting to camp in Philadelphia on Nov. 9.

Gio Reyna is back with the U.S. men's national team for the first time since March.

The 22-year-old 2022 World Cup veteran has made just one 21-minute cameo for his country since former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino took over as USMNT coach last year, and he's played sparingly for new club Borussia Mönchengladbach since leaving German Bundesliga rival Borussia Dortmund in August.

Usual starting attackers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah are unavailable this month because of injury and Malik Tillman just returned to action after missing three-plus weeks of action with a hamstring strain he sustained while on U.S. duty last month.

That has given Reyna, who helped the U.S. win a trio of Concacaf Nations League titles between 2021-24, the chance to get on Pochettino's final roster of the year.

The roster was revealed Thursday ahead of 2026 World Cup tuneups against South American powers Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa.

Forward Ricardo Pepi returns for the first time since November 2024. The PSV striker scored in each of his first three appearances for Pochettino but underwent knee surgery in February after getting hurt in a UEFA Champions League win over Liverpool. 

Though he has yet to win back his starting job for the Dutch champs, he's averaging a goal every 81 minutes in the Eredivisie and Champions League. On Tuesday, he helped PSV salvage a point with a late tally off the bench against Olympiacos. It was Pepi's third result-changing goal in second-half stoppage time in the Champions League, equaling Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Agüero for the most in the competition's history. 

Fellow striker Folarin Balogun has also been in fine form in Europe's top club tournament, having scored Monaco's Champions League winner over Bodo/Glimt earlier this week.

Besides Pulisic, Tillman and Weah, several other regulars were omitted. Central defender Chris Richards, a stalwart for Premier League Crystal Palace, was left in London, presumably to rest the calf injury Eagles manager Oliver Glasner says the Alabama native has been nursing this fall.

Standout midfielder Weston McKennie will remain with Juventus, which recently hired yet another new manager, the Texan's fourth since arriving at at the Italian powerhouse five years ago.

And there was no place for goalkeeper Matt Turner, who started all four games for the Americans at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Turner ins't scheduled to play another competitive match until the New England Revolution kick off the new MLS season in February. Yunus Musah, another mainstay in Qatar, was left out for the fourth consecutive camp; Musah came off the bench for Atalanta Wednesday and helped the Italian side preserve a 1-0 win over a Weah-less Marseille in UEFA Champions League action.

Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson recently scored their first Premier League goals this season. Adams missed the October exhibitions because of the birth of his second child.

The meeting with Paraguay represents a homecoming for four Philadelphia Union alums, as Aaronson, keeper Matt Freese, and central defenders Mark McKenzie and Auston Trusty all return to Subaru Park.

Fourteen of the 25 men summoned by Pochettino play for European clubs. With Liga MX-based Alex Zendejas (knee injury) still out, the remaining 11 are MLS-based. Right back Alex Freeman was recently voted the 2025 MLS Young Player of the Year. Freeman, Sebastian Berhalter and Cristian Roldan were named to MLS's Best XI on Wednesday, as was injured Vancouver defender Tristan Blackmon.

The 25 invited players, listed below, will begin reporting to the Philadelphia area following this weekend's slate of club matches in MLS and overseas.

Goalkeepers: Roman Celentano, FC Cincinnati (MLS); Matt Freese, New York City FC (MLS); Jonathan Klinsmann, Cesena (Italy): Patrick Schulte, Columbus Crew (MLS) 

Defenders: Max Arfsten, Columbus; Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands); Alex Freeman, Orlando City (MLS); Mark McKenzie, Toulouse (France); Tim Ream, Charlotte (MLS); Miles Robinson, Cincinnati; Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach (Germany); John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel (Germany); Auston Trusty, Celtic (Scotland) 

Midfielders: Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England), Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Aidan Morris, Middlesbrough (England); Gio Reyna, Borussia Mönchengladbach; Cristian Roldan, Seattle Sounders (MLS); Tanner Tessmann, Lyon (MLS); Sean Zawadzki, Columbus

Forwards: Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United (England); Folarin Balogun, AS Monaco (France); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS), Ricardo Pepi, PSV; Haji Wright, Coventry City (England)

2026 World

Cup Countdown

FIFA president Gianni Infantino (right) presents US President Donald Trump a FIFA World Cup ticket for the final Andrew Caballero-Reynolds

In recent months, 2026 men's World Cup host cities in the United States have watched on as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that he is prepared to relocate matches from cities he deems to be unsafe.

While FIFA's contracts are with the host cities directly, rather than the U.S. government, the World Cup organizer suggested it would fall into line with President Trump when a spokesperson said in October: “Safety and security are obviously the government's responsibility and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

President Trump has name-checked Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston as areas of concern during his presidency, all of which are due to be World Cup cities, even if the games themselves are in the broader surrounding areas.

He said in late September: “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni (Infantino), the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.' And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

One challenge this has posed for host cities relates to their attempts to drive local sponsorship for the tournament. While FIFA has exclusivity for its own sponsors at stadium venues, the host cities are able to seek revenue around fan festivals in non-competing categories. However, several host city executives, speaking anonymously to The Athletic when discussing commercially sensitive matters, have expressed their concern that uncertainty could deter commitments from sponsors.



Bob Lynch, a former partnerships executive at the Brooklyn Nets and Miami Dolphins, is now founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a global sports sponsorship intelligence platform. He warned that the political environment has the potential to place obstacles in front of deals for host cities.

Lynch said: “It's definitely something I'm sure brands are bringing to the table in their discussions with local governing bodies around their sponsorship deals. Having sat in that seat, there are always things that are potential threats.

“When you have things like that, which include the threat of leaving or pulling out, there are a couple of things that generally take place. One is that it usually slows down the decision-making process of brands at the table. They may say: ‘We need to watch and see.' It is no different than if the economy is really struggling and people have major deals on the table or the uncertainty during Covid. So that's a real thing. That does slow down probably conversion on sponsorship deals.

“In some cases, there are conversations taking place around, ‘If we're in an agreement or we're going to be in agreement, what are our rights to get out of this?' Those are generally no different than what actually takes place within sports to guard against an earthquake taking place. It is to ensure brands are legally protected.

“I'm sure, like anybody, they would want the noise to stop. Anybody in sponsorship on the sales side is going to want the least amount of disruption. They would want that to dissipate, because that doesn't help them sell anything.”

In 2026, 11 cities in the United States will host World Cup games. Yet Chicago, the city with the third-largest population in the United States, will not be part of the tournament — and they appear to be quite happy about it.

The Midwest is short of representation at the World Cup, with only Kansas City, Missouri, among the host cities in that region. Chicago, which boasts an iconic venue in the 61,500 capacity Soldier Field, withdrew from the U.S.'s joint bid with Canada and Mexico in 2018, with the office of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying in a statement at the time that it would not be in Chicago's “best interests.”

Seven years on, Chicago's decision-makers do not have regrets.  In an interview with The Athletic, Chicago Sports Commission's long-serving executive Kara Bachman said: “There are people who think ‘Oh my God. How are you not hosting? What's wrong with you?' I'm like, ‘You didn't see what we saw.' There was not a way to get a handle on the financials in a way I could confidently stand behind.”

She said that the deal transferred a financial burden to the city to the extent it risked “leaving us in debt.”

She also described FIFA's terms as “demands” rather than requests and said the World Cup organizers would not accept “any changes or edits” to the contract.

“Quite honestly, I never spoke to anyone from FIFA face to face during that process, which to me was also a red flag,” Bachman added.

A FIFA source, who remained anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said that FIFA was negotiating with the United (United States, Canada and Mexico) bid rather than with cities directly. They also insisted that the process has been collaborative between host cities and FIFA.

Bachman warned that some of her counterparts in different host cities in America are envious of Chicago's position in 2026. She said the requirements had “taken over” for some host cities and constituted an opportunity cost for other possible ventures.

In New Jersey, for example, MetLife Stadium, the host venue for the final, has already spent $37m (£28.4m) on upgrades to enable it to host games for FIFA. Congressman Josh Gottheimer told The Athletic in March that New Jersey will take on $65m in costs for things such as transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports. Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with hosting World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium.

Chicago has hosted other soccer events in recent years, such as the 2025 Premier League Summer Series, which Bachman says she would like to bring back to the city. Chicago is also currently part of a group of cities considering bidding to be a host city for the 2031 Women's World Cup, which is expected to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica.

Yet Bachman also warned that Chicago “will not sell our soul to do it.” She said: “If they show up with the same terms, then I don't know. If it's the same terms, the answers don't change.

“I don't know that any of (the cities) have confidence that FIFA is going to look into themselves that much. I'd love to be proven wrong. Nobody seems to have the confidence that FIFA is going to be that self-reflective.”

Before FIFA's revamped Club World Cup had reached its conclusion in the summer, Gianni Infantino gave a speech at Trump Tower, New York, and declared it a roaring success.

The FIFA president said more than two million fans had “visited the matches,” with an average attendance of just under 40,000 for the 63 fixtures played across the U.S., culminating in more than 81,000 spectators at MetLife Stadium to watch Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

One area that proved to be a struggle when it came to ticket sales, however, was the hospitality packages.

Ahead of the tournament, FIFA announced it had partnered with Beyond Hospitality, with Beyond's initial press release outlining the “multiple tiers of social, premium and luxury” options available across the 12 venues.

These included a “Flagship Lounge”, which Beyond described as “the most luxurious shared commercial hospitality space available,” and “Exclusive Private Suites” offering a “five-course dining menu.”

Despite the plentiful offerings, more than 50 per cent of the hospitality tickets at the Club World Cup went unsold, according to people with knowledge of the sales.

FIFA sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, highlighted that this was an inaugural tournament being held in the U.S. for the first time and there were always bound to be inconsistencies in attendance. The challenge for both Beyond and FIFA was also increased by the late planning of the tournament, with a broadcaster only announced seven months before the competition.

Beyond did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite FIFA's many challenges in launching the expanded Club World Cup in the United States, the world governing body is confident it has plenty of options when it comes to hosting the next tournament in 2029.

FIFA intend it to be a summer competition again, which almost certainly rules out Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where the summer heat would render the games likely unplayable and require a move in the calendar to winter, as we saw with the men's World Cup in 2022. This would bring a collision between FIFA and domestic European leagues, not to mention European football's governing body UEFA, whose own competitions would be disturbed by the Club World Cup. For 2029 at least, this is not a fight FIFA wants.

During and following the competition in the summer, FIFA received expressions of interest from the Brazilian Football Federation, while the 2029 edition could also be used as a dummy run for Spain and Morocco, who are two of the host nations in the six-nation, three-continent bonanza that is the men's World Cup in 2030.

Australia have also been credited with an interest in potentially hosting the Club World Cup, but The Athletic can reveal another registration has come from Germany, who most recently hosted Euro 2024.

There are also advocates within FIFA to take the tournament to England, owing to the quality of the training bases and stadia. It may also be a way to improve relations with the Premier League, which was aggrieved by a perceived lack of consultation ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. FIFA would also be able to rope in an additional Premier League team beyond the current country limit of two by giving England a host-country place, which was the mechanism by which Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were invited this summer.

One of the criticisms of the 2025 edition was the absence of so many leading European names and a qualification formula that resulted in Liverpool, Napoli and Barcelona (the current champions of England, Italy and Spain) not being in a competition marketed as “the best v the best.”

There had been widespread expectation that the tournament would expand from 32 teams to help accommodate the most famous and successful teams in the world. But, for now at least, there are high-profile advocates within FIFA who believe the competition should remain a 32-team affair, but with play-in rounds to help improve the quality of competitors without removing access for confederations across the world, while the two teams per country cap may also be altered.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a more in-form, goal-scoring center back than Christian Gray.

Over the past four months, he has scored against Western Springs AFC and Eastern Suburbs in the Northern League, and he also netted a late equalizer in Auckland City's recent draw vs. Auckland FC's reserve side. However, the most important goal of his career came on July 24 — not in his native New Zealand, but in the United States.

Having lost their first two matches to Bayern Munich and Benfica by a combined 16-0, Auckland City were already eliminated from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, unlike Boca Juniors, who were seeking to book their ticket to the knockout round with a victory. When Boca opened the scoring in the 26th minute via an own goal, all signs pointed to Auckland suffering yet another heavy defeat in Nashville. Instead, they held firm and reached halftime with a manageable deficit, and in the 52nd minute, they pulled level as Christian Gray headed home from a corner kick. While Boca exited the tournament without a win, and Bayern and Benfica confirmed their spots in the Round of 16, Auckland managed to bow out of the Club World Cup with their heads held high.

“Coming off the back of the previous results, if we were told that we'd get a point from that game vs. Boca, I don't think anyone would have believed you,” said Gray in an exclusive World Soccer Talk interview. “It was a funny feeling after the game… you're not sure how to react. It's a draw at the end of the day, but when you take everything into account, it's still a good result. It took a moment to realize it's not a win, but it's not a loss.”

Born in the Gisborne region of New Zealand, Gray was raised by Sandra Edge — who won gold at the 1987 World Netball Championships in Glasgow, silver in 1991 in Sydney, and bronze in 1995 in Birmingham — and Rodger Gray, who captained New Zealand's men's national team and scored four goals in 39 caps between 1989 and 1997, in addition to representing Mt. Wellington, Waitakere City, and Waitemata FC.

Like many players such as Sergey Palkin, Diadie Samassékou, and Marco Verratti, he was hooked on soccer from a young age and sought to emulate his father. Initially a striker, Christian transitioned to midfield and later to center back, ultimately following in his father's footsteps by launching his senior career with Waitakere United in 2016.

“My father and my uncle played together for the national team and club team. Mum has a netball background, so I guess I grew up surrounded by sport. Academically, they were both involved in coaching, and Mum also has a teaching background, so sports were always a big part of my childhood.”

Gray moved from Waitakere United to Hamilton Wanderers, then to Birkenhead United and Eastern Suburbs in 2019, before eventually joining Auckland City in January 2022. Unlike New Zealand's two professional clubs, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix — who play in the Australian league — Auckland City remain an amateur side, and because of that, they compete in the New Zealand top flight. They have not only participated — they have dominated, winning 10 league titles and 13 OFC Champions League trophies, including each of the last four. As a result, Auckland have played in more FIFA Club World Cups (12) than any other club, finishing third in 2014.

An unused substitute in Auckland's defeat to Al Ahly in Morocco in 2023, Gray made his first Club World Cup start against Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, facing Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kanté, and Fabinho in a 3–0 defeat. He was on the bench nine months later as Auckland lost 6–2 to Al Ain in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in Qatar. The tournament was later rebranded and expanded into a 32-team Club World Cup, meaning Auckland would spend a full month abroad and have more chances to prove themselves.

“Traveling to all these locations has been awesome. We've ticked off quite a few places. We just got back from Egypt where we saw the pyramids — something I probably never would have done without football. That's been a big part of why we play. We've played against some huge names over the last four years, at big stadiums, and visited countries we might never have seen otherwise. I had the chance to play against Benzema a year after he won the Ballon d'Or, and other legends like Edinson Cavani and Ángel Di María.”

After competing in Cincinnati, Orlando, and Nashville, Gray returned to New Zealand before heading back to Egypt to face Pyramids in the Intercontinental Cup. Unable to overcome a strong opponent, Auckland lost 3–0. He later scored an own goal vs. Birkenhead but responded by helping his team secure wins vs. Western Suburbs and Wellington Olympic, followed by a 1–1 draw with Auckland FC's reserves.

“There are always lessons from these matches that we'll take back into the National League. Pyramids are obviously a strong side, so the big thing is taking what we learned and applying it at home.”

Gray has become a key figure in Auckland's backline thanks to his timing, awareness, passing quality, and physical bravery. Like Gonçalo Inácio, Marc Guéhi, and others, he excels aerially, scoring and defending with equal determination.

At 29, Gray has faced world-class opposition — yet has not been called up to the New Zealand national team, largely due to not being a professional player. His full-time job is teaching Physical Education and Health at Auckland Grammar School and Mt. Roskill Intermediate, while also coaching the school's boys' team. His days begin before dawn and often end late at night, alongside completing his graduate teaching diploma.

“It's been a busy year, juggling everything — especially with all the travel. I coach in the mornings, teach during the day, study on weekends, and train in the evenings. I'll finish my diploma in December and become a registered teacher.”

Whether Gray will someday turn professional or play for the All Whites remains uncertain, but one thing is certain: his goal against Boca Juniors will be remembered as one of the biggest shocks in FIFA Club World Cup history.

Chelsea came crashing back down to earth on Wednesday night after staggering to a 2-2 draw against Qarabag in Europe, highlighting the inconsistencies that have frustrated Enzo Maresca since taking over.

The west Londoners face a tough battle to secure an all-important spot in the top eight of the Champions League group standings, with tricky ties against Barcelona and Italian champions Napoli to come. 

Maresca has been desperate to utilise his expensively-assembled squad this season, but has been forced to contend with injuries to key players including Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Liam Delap - a knock-on effect from their exertions at last summer's Club World Cup. 

To add more misery to the Blues boss, young midfielder Romeo Lavia was forced off with an injury during Wednesday night's draw in Azerbaijan. It has been a miserable time in London for the Belgian, who has picked up no fewer than 10 injuries during his stint at Stamford Bridge. 

In real terms, that's led to 495 days out injured, 77 matches missed, and just 29 minutes for Chelsea. The brutal reality is that he has spent more time injured than healthy. 

Maresca has attributed his side's terrible injury record to their exploits in the United States this summer, where they triumphed in the inaugural Club World Cup, meaning they struggled to adequately prepare for the new season.

Enzo Maresca has bemoaned the Club World Cup's effect on his fatigued Chelsea squad 

The Blues boss has changed half his team every game, leading to inconsistent results

‘The Club World Cup affects a lot,' he said after Wednesday's draw. 'We try to rotate. When you win, no one mentions all that. When we don't win, everyone is focused on that, and now I think it's important to recover energy for Saturday and go again.' 

It's been a mixed start to the season for the Blues. Statement victories over Liverpool and Spurs have been interspersed with dismal defeats by Man United, Brighton and newly promoted Sunderland, seeing Maresca's side languishing in seventh position. 

The Italian's constant tinkering - he's made no fewer than 85 total starting lineup changes this season - has proved to be a double-edged sword for the boss. While he's managed to keep injury-prone stars like Reece James and Pedro Neto fit by shuffling his pack, rotation may be a key factor behind the team's struggle to find sustained runs of consistency. 

The foundation of any successful team can be found in a settled back line. While Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made 67 changes to his starting lineups and boasts impressive strength in depth at centre back, he rarely rotates his go-to duo of William Saliba and Gabriel.

Even Pep Guardiola, who has been the source of frustration for many Fantasy Premier League managers with his regular first XI changes, has settled for Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol at centre back. 

Other contenders have shuffled their squad - not to the extent of Chelsea - but can still produce positive results and performances

It can be no coincidence, then, that the young defenders Maresca has turned to when rotating his squad have been prone to errors. In Azerbaijan, £37million new boy Jarrel Hato made two key errors leading to the underdogs' goals, while Trevoh Chalobah was at fault for Sunderland's winning goal at Stamford Bridge.

At the other end of the XI changes table, Sunderland have rarely made tweaks to their starting lineups this season. Blessed with a kinder calendar where they rarely have to play three times a week, the Black Cats have made just 32 changes to their team week on week.

For the frontrunners - Arsenal, Man City and reigning champions Liverpool - they have a remarkably similar number of changes to their XI: 67, 64 and 69 respectively. 

As Maresca aims to reach the levels of the three leaders, there are lessons to be learnt for the Blues boss if he is to make his squad last the season - while picking up results.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Mauricio Pochettino's World Cup decision would see Donald Trump deny Christian Pulisic historic moment","https://talksport.com/football/3708589/mauricio-pochettino-world-cup-donald-trump-christian-pulisic-usmnt/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 17:02:00 GMT","





If Christian Pulisic leads his country to World Cup glory on home soil in 2026, he might not be the first man to get his hands on the trophy.

Traditionally it is the captain that lifts the trophy at the end of six weeks of intense competition, but USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino might have to yield to a higher power rather than Pulisic, who wears the armband.

Poch is yet to meet with President Donald Trump but has hinted he might have to concede ground if the President decides to pull rank.

The Argentinian tactician joined Ben Jacobs on a special edition of the talkSPORT Daily Podcast to discuss the upcoming tournament, with the draw set to take place in Washington in December.

Trump famously joined the Chelsea squad on stage during the Club World Cup presentation in July.

It caused some confusion at the time, but should Pulisic and the USMNT pull off what would be a famous - and hugely unexpected - victory, there is a plan in place.

""For sure, I will give -- in case we win -- I will give him the trophy and he can lift the trophy,"" Pochettino said. ""For sure, no problem for me.""

Trump's new-found love of soccer has yet to see him cross paths with Pochettino but the former Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain manager hopes to change that soon.

""We'll see now in the draw if is the possibility to, to meet him and, and to say hello,"" he explained. ""For sure, it's going to be in Washington. Maybe we will have the opportunity.""

Asked what he would say to the Commander in Chief, Poch expressed his gratitude for the support the sport receives.

""In case I meet him, I think I'm going to say, 'Thank you for everything that he's doing for soccer in America and the continuing support.'

""I think that is great because he's showing his support to football and soccer.""

Despite boasting stars like captain Pulisic, Fulham defender Antonee Robinson, and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie, the Stars and Stripes will not be among the favorites for a long run in the tournament.

Pochettino - who has been dragged into a row with Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner - was a bold appointment, bringing plenty of pedigree, and his expectations are high.

Jacobs asked what his goal was come next summer -- and suggested nothing short of President Trump holding the trophy aloft.

""It's to win,"" he said. ""Because I come from Argentina and then from Europe and from England and we are so competitive and that is in our blood.

""Also knowing that it's going to be difficult, but I think our mentality is to win every single game and to compete with no fear and thinking that we can beat any team.""

Pochettino has won 12 of 20 matches since taking over as manager in 2024, and believes he has been successful in creating a winning culture.

After spells in England with Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, Pochettino continues to be linked with a return to the Premier League, most notably back to Spurs who he memorably led to the Champions League final.

However, his focus is squarely on the ambition for his current role, where wants his players to believe anything is possible.

""With our quality to to try to be intelligent in the way that you build the team and how you are going to compete against these big teams -- talking about Spain, talking about Argentina, talking about England,"" said the 53-year-old. ""I think we can we can be very competitive and create and build a very good team to compete.

""And then winning depends on many factors, but they see the mentality is to win. That is the culture that we are creating in the federation after one year.

""We are so happy about how we are translating this mentality.""

Soldier Field in Chicago during the Premier League Summer Series match between Manchester United and Bournemouth Daniel Bartel - Premier League/Getty Images

Hello! The World Cup circus is in full swing — brace yourselves for another Gianni Infantino wheeze — but the city of Chicago will take no part in it. We're here to explain.

On the way:

No bid to host the World Cup is worth its salt without promising to lavish riches on a country domestically. Every tournament, without fail, will be ‘worth X to the local economy' (insert a satisfying number of millions or billions), heading off financial sceptics at the pass.

The book Soccernomics devoted a chapter to this subject and, through a fair amount of research, deduced that projections of how much a nation earns from a World Cup — i.e. the amount of cash which benefits ordinary people like you and me — are often optimistic at best. Some are pulled from fantasy land. If you're in the United States, Mexico or Canada, I'd recommend reading it.

And when you see it said, as it does in two FIFA-backed reports, that the 2026 edition and the 2025 Club World Cup could generate a combined $47bn (£36bn) for the U.S. alone, I'd suggest applying your hogwash filter. It's possible that the impact will be felt to that extent. Just don't take the figures at face value.

Chicago certainly didn't, hence why the third-biggest city by population in the States won't be hosting any of the matches at the 2026 finals. It's odd when you think about it. Soldier Field, above, the home of the Chicago Bears and Chicago Fire, is every bit as large and modern as the average venue set aside for next summer. I'd have had it on my bingo list as readily as Boston, San Francisco or Philadelphia.

But as Adam Crafton illustrates in his World Cup column today, the authorities in Chicago were far from convinced that pitching to be a host was in the best interests of the city's public purse. On the contrary, they feared it might merely incur debt. So Chicago was out. And others who got in on the act are apparently wondering if the Windy City called it right.

Adam spoke to Kara Bachman, the executive director for the Chicago Sport Commission (a body which supports major events there). Her concerns were numerous, starting with the question of whether Chicago would post a significant profit from hosting World Cup games.

Beyond that, she described the terms put forward by world governing body FIFA as “demands”, not requests, and claimed Chicago had no power to alter the contract it would be told to sign. She says she was unable to speak to anybody at FIFA in person, calling this “a red flag”. FIFA sources contacted by Adam insist they were cooperative but according to Bachman, officials in certain host cities — having encountered the reality — quietly wish they had taken Chicago's stance.

The costs incurred through hosting are not minor. Take, for instance, the $37m spent upgrading MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the stage for the World Cup final, or the $65m that state will spend on travel security. It falls to individual locations to manage “safety, security and protection”, none of which is simple or cheap for a competition so big. Adam also reports U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats to relocate fixtures are running the risk of spooking prospective sponsors.

The counter-argument is that the World Cup can turn host cities into jamborees. People in and around group-stage and knockout-phase matches are having the door opened to experiences they might remember forever (assuming they can afford to attend). But on the matter of who stands to earn what from the 2026 finals, all we can say is that FIFA will make hay. The various host cities would be well advised not to spend their mooted royalties in advance.

I'm not saying UEFA's Champions League is going as expected this season, but the top eight halfway through the first stage resembles a European Super League, with English sides doing particularly well. Barcelona, in 11th, are the only real outliers, and that won't last.

Don't mistake those observations for complaints, though. I'm a natural-born sceptic, but I can't deny the Champions League is the most entertaining competition out there as it stands. The goals alone are worth the subscription fees, and after Micky van de Ven's Roadrunner impression for Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, we were treated to another batch of dynamite last night.

Apologies to Lazar Samardzic, whose stonking late winner for Atalanta at Marseille doesn't quite make the TAFC cut, but we had to squeeze in a Lionel Messi-esque finish from Lamine Yamal in Barcelona's 3-3 draw at Club Brugge, above.

And you remember I wrote about Piotr Zielinski's volley for Inter at the weekend being as smooth as chocolate? Well, this Dan Burn header for Newcastle United in their win against Athletic Club, below, is straight out of the same packet. Every time I roll it back, I'm convinced it's going wide. Genius.

Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff made 4-3-3 the staple diet at Ajax. Then they took it to Barcelona. It was so immensely successful for both clubs (and later under Pep Guardiola at Barca) that you'd think the system would have taken over the world.

Instead, it remains the domain of Dutch clubs, many of whom still cling to Cruyff's ideal of Total Football. That's not to say coaches elsewhere don't go 4-3-3 — Jurgen Klopp did at Liverpool, and Luis Enrique guided PSG to the Champions League title last season using that formation, after a fashion — but the Netherlands is its spiritual home.



That's shown by The Athletic's latest Tactics Board feature, a series which our readers have been all over (the potted histories of 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 were very popular). Since 2011-12, four of the five teams who have used 4-3-3 most often are Dutch, with Ajax top of the list. Only nine of the top 20 hail from elsewhere.

But even in the Netherlands, loyalty to it is fading. Go back 10 years or so and a staggering 79 per cent of formations deployed in the Eredivisie top flight were 4-3-3. Now it's down to 29 per cent. “Anyone with the guts to use 4-3-3 in the right way will be rewarded, as long as the right players are chosen,” Cruyff once wrote, and his word was gospel. But no corner of football is impervious to change.

Osters' defender Mattis Adolfsson had two choices: let the attack ride or stick a foot in. Like any loyal servant, he took one for the team. I can feel this one from here.

MIAMI — FIFA has announced the creation of a peace prize, which it plans to award for the first time at the draw for the World Cup on Dec. 5 in Washington.

The award, called the FIFA Peace Prize, will ""recognize exceptional actions for peace,"" soccer's governing body said Wednesday. But FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has a close relationship with President Donald Trump, would not tip his hand Wednesday when asked if Trump will be the first recipient of the award.

""On the 5th of December, you will see,"" Infantino said. He was speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami, shortly after Trump addressed the same event.

Infantino said earlier Wednesday that, ""in an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace."" FIFA said the award, which Infantino will present this year, will be bestowed annually ""on behalf of fans from all around the world.""

Trump was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize last month despite lobbying from fellow Republicans, various world leaders and himself. And Infantino made no secret of the ties between himself, FIFA and Trump in his remarks Wednesday.

""I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, who I consider really a close friend,"" Infantino said. ""Of course, he's been very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup. ... He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He says, actually, what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say. And that's why he's so successful.""

FIFA recently added another link to Trump by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100 million education project part-funded by 2026 World Cup ticket sales.

The World Cup draw, and the awarding of the peace prize, is expected to draw about 1 billion viewers worldwide, Infantino said.

2026 World

Cup Countdown

FIFA president Gianni Infantino (right) presents US President Donald Trump a FIFA World Cup ticket for the final Andrew Caballero-Reynolds

In recent months, 2026 men's World Cup host cities in the United States have watched on as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that he is prepared to relocate matches from cities he deems to be unsafe.

While FIFA's contracts are with the host cities directly, rather than the U.S. government, the World Cup organizer suggested it would fall into line with President Trump when a spokesperson said in October: “Safety and security are obviously the government's responsibility and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

President Trump has name-checked Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston as areas of concern during his presidency, all of which are due to be World Cup cities, even if the games themselves are in the broader surrounding areas.

He said in late September: “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni (Infantino), the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.' And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

One challenge this has posed for host cities relates to their attempts to drive local sponsorship for the tournament. While FIFA has exclusivity for its own sponsors at stadium venues, the host cities are able to seek revenue around fan festivals in non-competing categories. However, several host city executives, speaking anonymously to The Athletic when discussing commercially sensitive matters, have expressed their concern that uncertainty could deter commitments from sponsors.



Bob Lynch, a former partnerships executive at the Brooklyn Nets and Miami Dolphins, is now founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a global sports sponsorship intelligence platform. He warned that the political environment has the potential to place obstacles in front of deals for host cities.

Lynch said: “It's definitely something I'm sure brands are bringing to the table in their discussions with local governing bodies around their sponsorship deals. Having sat in that seat, there are always things that are potential threats.

“When you have things like that, which include the threat of leaving or pulling out, there are a couple of things that generally take place. One is that it usually slows down the decision-making process of brands at the table. They may say: ‘We need to watch and see.' It is no different than if the economy is really struggling and people have major deals on the table or the uncertainty during Covid. So that's a real thing. That does slow down probably conversion on sponsorship deals.

“In some cases, there are conversations taking place around, ‘If we're in an agreement or we're going to be in agreement, what are our rights to get out of this?' Those are generally no different than what actually takes place within sports to guard against an earthquake taking place. It is to ensure brands are legally protected.

“I'm sure, like anybody, they would want the noise to stop. Anybody in sponsorship on the sales side is going to want the least amount of disruption. They would want that to dissipate, because that doesn't help them sell anything.”

In 2026, 11 cities in the United States will host World Cup games. Yet Chicago, the city with the third-largest population in the United States, will not be part of the tournament — and they appear to be quite happy about it.

The Midwest is short of representation at the World Cup, with only Kansas City, Missouri, among the host cities in that region. Chicago, which boasts an iconic venue in the 61,500 capacity Soldier Field, withdrew from the U.S.'s joint bid with Canada and Mexico in 2018, with the office of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying in a statement at the time that it would not be in Chicago's “best interests.”

Seven years on, Chicago's decision-makers do not have regrets.  In an interview with The Athletic, Chicago Sports Commission's long-serving executive Kara Bachman said: “There are people who think ‘Oh my God. How are you not hosting? What's wrong with you?' I'm like, ‘You didn't see what we saw.' There was not a way to get a handle on the financials in a way I could confidently stand behind.”

She said that the deal transferred a financial burden to the city to the extent it risked “leaving us in debt.”

She also described FIFA's terms as “demands” rather than requests and said the World Cup organizers would not accept “any changes or edits” to the contract.

“Quite honestly, I never spoke to anyone from FIFA face to face during that process, which to me was also a red flag,” Bachman added.

A FIFA source, who remained anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said that FIFA was negotiating with the United (United States, Canada and Mexico) bid rather than with cities directly. They also insisted that the process has been collaborative between host cities and FIFA.

Bachman warned that some of her counterparts in different host cities in America are envious of Chicago's position in 2026. She said the requirements had “taken over” for some host cities and constituted an opportunity cost for other possible ventures.

In New Jersey, for example, MetLife Stadium, the host venue for the final, has already spent $37m (£28.4m) on upgrades to enable it to host games for FIFA. Congressman Josh Gottheimer told The Athletic in March that New Jersey will take on $65m in costs for things such as transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports. Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with hosting World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium.

Chicago has hosted other soccer events in recent years, such as the 2025 Premier League Summer Series, which Bachman says she would like to bring back to the city. Chicago is also currently part of a group of cities considering bidding to be a host city for the 2031 Women's World Cup, which is expected to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica.

Yet Bachman also warned that Chicago “will not sell our soul to do it.” She said: “If they show up with the same terms, then I don't know. If it's the same terms, the answers don't change.

“I don't know that any of (the cities) have confidence that FIFA is going to look into themselves that much. I'd love to be proven wrong. Nobody seems to have the confidence that FIFA is going to be that self-reflective.”

Before FIFA's revamped Club World Cup had reached its conclusion in the summer, Gianni Infantino gave a speech at Trump Tower, New York, and declared it a roaring success.

The FIFA president said more than two million fans had “visited the matches,” with an average attendance of just under 40,000 for the 63 fixtures played across the U.S., culminating in more than 81,000 spectators at MetLife Stadium to watch Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

One area that proved to be a struggle when it came to ticket sales, however, was the hospitality packages.

Ahead of the tournament, FIFA announced it had partnered with Beyond Hospitality, with Beyond's initial press release outlining the “multiple tiers of social, premium and luxury” options available across the 12 venues.

These included a “Flagship Lounge”, which Beyond described as “the most luxurious shared commercial hospitality space available,” and “Exclusive Private Suites” offering a “five-course dining menu.”

Despite the plentiful offerings, more than 50 per cent of the hospitality tickets at the Club World Cup went unsold, according to people with knowledge of the sales.

FIFA sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, highlighted that this was an inaugural tournament being held in the U.S. for the first time and there were always bound to be inconsistencies in attendance. The challenge for both Beyond and FIFA was also increased by the late planning of the tournament, with a broadcaster only announced seven months before the competition.

Beyond did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite FIFA's many challenges in launching the expanded Club World Cup in the United States, the world governing body is confident it has plenty of options when it comes to hosting the next tournament in 2029.

FIFA intend it to be a summer competition again, which almost certainly rules out Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where the summer heat would render the games likely unplayable and require a move in the calendar to winter, as we saw with the men's World Cup in 2022. This would bring a collision between FIFA and domestic European leagues, not to mention European football's governing body UEFA, whose own competitions would be disturbed by the Club World Cup. For 2029 at least, this is not a fight FIFA wants.

During and following the competition in the summer, FIFA received expressions of interest from the Brazilian Football Federation, while the 2029 edition could also be used as a dummy run for Spain and Morocco, who are two of the host nations in the six-nation, three-continent bonanza that is the men's World Cup in 2030.

Australia have also been credited with an interest in potentially hosting the Club World Cup, but The Athletic can reveal another registration has come from Germany, who most recently hosted Euro 2024.

There are also advocates within FIFA to take the tournament to England, owing to the quality of the training bases and stadia. It may also be a way to improve relations with the Premier League, which was aggrieved by a perceived lack of consultation ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. FIFA would also be able to rope in an additional Premier League team beyond the current country limit of two by giving England a host-country place, which was the mechanism by which Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were invited this summer.

One of the criticisms of the 2025 edition was the absence of so many leading European names and a qualification formula that resulted in Liverpool, Napoli and Barcelona (the current champions of England, Italy and Spain) not being in a competition marketed as “the best v the best.”

There had been widespread expectation that the tournament would expand from 32 teams to help accommodate the most famous and successful teams in the world. But, for now at least, there are high-profile advocates within FIFA who believe the competition should remain a 32-team affair, but with play-in rounds to help improve the quality of competitors without removing access for confederations across the world, while the two teams per country cap may also be altered.

Gio Reyna is back with the U.S. men's national team for the first time since March.

The 22-year-old 2022 World Cup veteran has made just one 21-minute cameo for his country since former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino took over as USMNT coach last year, and he's played sparingly for new club Borussia Mönchengladbach since leaving German Bundesliga rival Borussia Dortmund in August.

Usual starting attackers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah are unavailable this month because of injury and Malik Tillman just returned to action after missing three-plus weeks of action with a hamstring strain he sustained while on U.S. duty last month.

That has given Reyna, who helped the U.S. win a trio of Concacaf Nations League titles between 2021-24, the chance to get on Pochettino's final roster of the year.

The roster was revealed Thursday ahead of 2026 World Cup tuneups against South American powers Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa.

Forward Ricardo Pepi returns for the first time since November 2024. The PSV striker scored in each of his first three appearances for Pochettino but underwent knee surgery in February after getting hurt in a UEFA Champions League win over Liverpool. 

Though he has yet to win back his starting job for the Dutch champs, he's averaging a goal every 81 minutes in the Eredivisie and Champions League. On Tuesday, he helped PSV salvage a point with a late tally off the bench against Olympiacos. It was Pepi's third result-changing goal in second-half stoppage time in the Champions League, equaling Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Agüero for the most in the competition's history. 

Fellow striker Folarin Balogun has also been in fine form in Europe's top club tournament, having scored Monaco's Champions League winner over Bodo/Glimt earlier this week.

Besides Pulisic, Tillman and Weah, several other regulars were omitted. Central defender Chris Richards, a stalwart for Premier League Crystal Palace, was left in London, presumably to rest the calf injury Eagles manager Oliver Glasner says the Alabama native has been nursing this fall.

Standout midfielder Weston McKennie will remain with Juventus, which recently hired yet another new manager, the Texan's fourth since arriving at at the Italian powerhouse five years ago.

And there was no place for goalkeeper Matt Turner, who started all four games for the Americans at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Turner ins't scheduled to play another competitive match until the New England Revolution kick off the new MLS season in February. Yunus Musah, another mainstay in Qatar, was left out for the fourth consecutive camp; Musah came off the bench for Atalanta Wednesday and helped the Italian side preserve a 1-0 win over a Weah-less Marseille in UEFA Champions League action.

Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson recently scored their first Premier League goals this season. Adams missed the October exhibitions because of the birth of his second child.

The meeting with Paraguay represents a homecoming for four Philadelphia Union alums, as Aaronson, keeper Matt Freese, and central defenders Mark McKenzie and Auston Trusty all return to Subaru Park.

Fourteen of the 25 men summoned by Pochettino play for European clubs. With Liga MX-based Alex Zendejas (knee injury) still out, the remaining 11 are MLS-based. Right back Alex Freeman was recently voted the 2025 MLS Young Player of the Year. Freeman, Sebastian Berhalter and Cristian Roldan were named to MLS's Best XI on Wednesday, as was injured Vancouver defender Tristan Blackmon.

The 25 invited players, listed below, will begin reporting to the Philadelphia area following this weekend's slate of club matches in MLS and overseas.

Goalkeepers: Roman Celentano, FC Cincinnati (MLS); Matt Freese, New York City FC (MLS); Jonathan Klinsmann, Cesena (Italy): Patrick Schulte, Columbus Crew (MLS) 

Defenders: Max Arfsten, Columbus; Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands); Alex Freeman, Orlando City (MLS); Mark McKenzie, Toulouse (France); Tim Ream, Charlotte (MLS); Miles Robinson, Cincinnati; Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach (Germany); John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel (Germany); Auston Trusty, Celtic (Scotland) 

Midfielders: Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England), Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Aidan Morris, Middlesbrough (England); Gio Reyna, Borussia Mönchengladbach; Cristian Roldan, Seattle Sounders (MLS); Tanner Tessmann, Lyon (MLS); Sean Zawadzki, Columbus

Forwards: Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United (England); Folarin Balogun, AS Monaco (France); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS), Ricardo Pepi, PSV; Haji Wright, Coventry City (England)

FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) — Hershey native Christian Pulisic will miss the United States' friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay, the next-to-last set of games before coach Mauricio Pochettino calls in players for his pre-World Cup training camp, while Gio Reyna is back on the roster for the first time since March.

Midfielder Weston McKennie and goalkeeper Matt Turner were among the notable omissions from the 25-man roster announced Thursday.

Forward Ricardo Pepi, midfielder Tyler Adams and defenders Joe Scally, John Tolkin and Auston Trusty are back with the 16th-ranked U.S. for the games against No. 39 Paraguay on Nov. 15 at Chester, Pennsylvania, and 15th-ranked Uruguay three days later at Tampa, Florida.

Pulisic injured a hamstring in an Oct. 14 friendly against Australia but AC Milan said he likely will be available for Saturday's Serie A match at Parma. The attacking midfielder is the top American player and drew criticism for skipping the CONCACAF Gold Cup last summer to rest his body ahead of the European season and the World Cup.

Reyna, a son of former captain Claudio Reyna, has played for the U.S. team just once since the 2024 Copa America, appearing as a 69th-minutre sub in the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match loss to Canada. Slowed by a thigh injury following his transfer to Borussia Mönchengladbach, he has been limited to one start and four substitute appearances in the Bundesliga.

Pepi and Trusty are back with the team for the first time since Pochettino's second camp in November. Scally, like Reyna, has not been with the group since the Nations League final four. Adams missed the October games because his wife was due to give birth.

In addition to Pulisic, others missing the matches because they are hurt or recovering from injuries include defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers (Achilles) and Antonee Robinson (knee), winger Tim Weah (thigh), midfielders Malik Tillman (thigh) and Johnny Cardoso (ankle), and goalkeeper Chris Brady (lower body).

Crystal Palace captain puts off Spanish giants with wage demands","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/marc-guehi-prices-out-real-madrid-move-crystal-palace-wage-demands/blt67ea575fd98b1568","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 09:32:27 GMT","

Marc Guehi's dreams of a move to Real Madrid look dead in the water after the Crystal Palace captain's wage and signing-on demands reportedly forced Los Blancos to walk away. The England international, who is out of contract in 2026 and refusing to extend, is now expected to stay in England, with Liverpool leading the race for his signature next summer, while Bayern Munich remain interested.

Real Madrid look set to pull out of the race to sign Crystal Palace centre-back Guehi, with Spanish outlet AS reporting that his high wage and signing-on demands have made the transfer “virtually impossible.” The 25-year-old, who has just 18 months left on his current contract, is widely expected to leave Selhurst Park next summer after declining multiple renewal offers. The Eagles have already accepted that their captain intends to move on, but Real Madrid, who were keen to bring in a long-term defensive reinforcement, have been priced out.

Sources close to Los Blancos suggest that Real's recruitment team were impressed with Guehi's performances in the Premier League and on the international stage but were unwilling to match his financial expectations. Guehi's camp had reportedly sought a significant pay rise and a multi-million-pound signing bonus, terms which exceeded the club's internal wage structure. As a result, Real Madrid have turned their attention elsewhere, leaving Liverpool and Bayern Munich as the frontrunners for the England defender's signature.

Guehi will be eligible to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with overseas clubs from January 2026, though several Premier League sides are expected to make renewed efforts to sign him before then. Liverpool, who came close to securing his services this past summer, are considered favourites to finalise a deal after Real's withdrawal. However, Bayern Munich's growing interest could yet complicate matters in what promises to be a major transfer battle.

Real Madrid's withdrawal from the race is less about Guehi's ability and more about their evolving defensive strategy heading into 2026. The club is actively seeking to reinforce its backline amid a mounting injury crisis and long-term uncertainty surrounding key defenders Eder Militao, David Alaba and Antonio Rudiger. With all three battling recurring injuries or approaching the final year of their contracts, Madrid are under pressure to secure a new defensive leader for the next cycle.

Militao has endured back-to-back ACL tears across consecutive seasons, while Alaba's fitness struggles have continued into 2025, limiting his availability. Rudiger remains consistent but turns 33 in 2026, prompting discussions about succession planning at the heart of Xabi Alonso's defence. Real Madrid have therefore been scouring Europe for top-tier defenders available at reasonable prices or nearing the end of their contracts, a strategy that initially made Guehi appealing.

However, Guehi's financial demands reportedly exceeded those of any existing Madrid defender, and the club hierarchy, led by Florentino Perez, has no intention of breaking its internal pay balance for a non-Galactico-level signing. With Guehi off the table, Los Blancos are now turning their attention to other long-term targets, including Bayern Munich's Dayot Upamecano, Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate, and Arsenal's William Saliba, all of whom have been tracked by Madrid scouts in recent months.

Guehi's decision to pursue high wages comes against the backdrop of his failed transfer to Liverpool earlier this year, a saga that dominated the final hours of the 2025 summer window. Liverpool had agreed a £35 million (€40m) fee with Crystal Palace, including a sell-on clause, and the player even underwent parts of his medical ahead of a deadline day move to Anfield. However, the transfer collapsed at the last moment after Palace failed to secure a replacement, reportedly prompting manager Oliver Glasner to threaten resignation if the sale went ahead.

Palace's first-choice target, Brighton's Igor Julio, chose to join West Ham instead, leaving the Eagles without adequate cover and forcing chairman Steve Parish to pull the plug despite the deal sheet already being submitted. Guehi, who was said to be “devastated” by the decision, returned to training with the Eagles the following week but made clear his intent to move on when his contract expires. The breakdown of that move not only frustrated Liverpool but also alerted several European giants, with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Inter all contacting his representatives soon after.

For Liverpool, the failed transfer represented a rare misstep in an otherwise calculated window, which saw them sign Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz, among many others. The Reds have maintained contact with Guehi's camp since then, with sources suggesting that he remains their “priority target” to eventually succeed Van Dijk.

With Real Madrid officially stepping away from the deal, the race for Guehi's signature is now expected to intensify between Liverpool and Bayern Munich. Liverpool's advantage lies in the player's long-standing admiration for the club and his desire to remain in the Premier League, while Bayern are prepared to offer him a lucrative deal. Both clubs view Guehi as a leader capable of anchoring their defence for years to come.

For Crystal Palace, the priority is stability until the end of the season. The club remains resigned to losing their captain but are determined to keep him until his contract expires in 2026, believing his leadership and consistency are vital for their Premier League campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi has responded to Cristiano Ronaldo's claim that winning the World Cup is not something that he is overly concerned about, as success in that competition will not define his legacy. Messi has savoured success on the grandest of stages and considers his triumph with Argentina at Qatar 2022 to be the “ultimate” accolade in his record-shattering career.

Portuguese superstar Ronaldo is already assured of a standing among the immortals, with many ranking him above Messi on any GOAT list. He is, however, missing the most prestigious of international trophies on a glittering CV that includes a European Championship win and two UEFA Nations League successes.

Speaking with Piers Morgan, CR7 has refuted any suggestion that he needs to guide Portugal to a global crown in order to join Messi at the very top of the game. He is expected to grace FIFA's flagship event in 2026 - his sixth appearance at that tournament - but insists he is not infatuated with landing the ultimate prize.

Ronaldo said: “If you ask me, Cristiano, is it a dream to win the World Cup? No, it's not a dream. To define if I'm one of the best of the history, to win one competition, [of] six games, seven games. You think it's fair?”

While that assessment may not be “fair”, Messi has been quick to point out that any player should want to experience the thrill of lifting the World Cup. He did that as captain of Argentina, allowing his own medal collection to be completed.

Speaking at the America Business Forum in Florida, Messi - who now plays his club football in MLS for Inter Miami - said of living the dream: “The truth is that explaining the feelings of that moment is difficult. It's hard to put into words what that title meant, on a personal level, on a family level, for my team-mates, and for the country. It was clear how the country celebrated, the need and the desire we had for it to happen again after so much time had passed.”

He added: “For me it was special. First, because for a player, winning the World Cup is the ultimate achievement. It's like anyone in their job, any professional reaching the top. There's nothing more after the World Cup. You can't ask for anything more. And on top of that, I had been lucky enough to have achieved everything before. At the club level, at the individual level. We had also won the Copa América with the national team. That was the missing piece. It was like closing out my entire career with that trophy.”

Messi, who is the most decorated player in history, went on to say of hoisting an iconic trophy aloft - with final heartache having previously been endured in 2014: “When I won the World Cup at the professional level, like I said, I'm not comparing, but all things considered, I had the same feeling as when my children were born. A feeling that, well, I was lucky enough to experience, you know what it means, and it's hard to explain what it feels like at that moment. It's so special and so immense that everything that follows falls short.”

Ronaldo would undoubtedly like to experience those emotions himself, with Portugal and Al-Nassr team-mate Joao Felix having previously claimed that CR7 is determined to conquer the world. He told TNT Sports when asked if an illustrious countryman will grace the 2026 finals: “Yes, I think so and everything indicates that he will. He dreams of winning the World Cup, we will do everything we can to give him that prize. I think it is the only one he is missing.”

Portugal are poised to confirm their qualification during the November international break, as they prepare to face the Republic of Ireland and Armenia. Messi and Argentina have already booked their tickets to next summer's showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with the Albiceleste looking to become the first team since Brazil in 1958 and 1962 to go back-to-back.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Within the last week, Amad Diallo has pulled off the rather impressive feat of being seen as one of Manchester United's greatest weapons and yet also one of their most obvious weak points. The Ivory Coast international's incredible volley at Nottingham Forest last Saturday grabbed his side a point, while he was a few inches away from snatching the winner in added time. Yet while he was rightly hailed as a difference-maker in United's attack, a lot of the post-match analysis focused on his defensive shortcomings.

Both aspects of Amad's game exist. He is far from alone in being a wonderful attacking player who is yet to master the art of winning headers in his own box or being able to clip the wings of pacey, fleet-footed wingers. 

The difference is that, unlike the other top attacking players in the Premier League, he is being asked to carry out those defensive tasks on a weekly basis due to operating as a wing-back in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 formation. In a few matches he has gotten away with it, but Forest seemed to target Amad and successfully exposed his vulnerabilities. United's next opponents - Tottenham, Everton and Crystal Palace - would be advised to do the same.

The scrutiny on Amad's role in the team has further highlighted the limitations of Amorim's formation and given the coach yet another problem that he needs to confront.

Amad started United's very first match under Amorim at right-wing-back against Ipswich Town and set up the first goal of the Portuguese's new era, for Marcus Rashford. But while the England forward was cast aside by the coach less than a month later, Amad has become a fundamental part of Amorim's project. 

United effectively had a bonfire of wingers over the summer, as Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony were all placed in the 'bomb squad' that had to train separately from the rest of the first team. Amad remained, starting in eight out of the nine Premier League games he has been available for this season (he missed the trip to Brentford on compassionate leave). While three of his appearances have come in attacking midfield, six of them have come at right-wing-back, and recently he has become Amorim's first-choice for the role, forcing natural right-back Diogo Dalot to play on the left.

Amorim outlined Amad's suitability to playing at wing-back last December when he said: ""He's very good playing in that position (wing-back) but also playing between the lines because he has good control and he seems faster with the ball than without the ball. He is capable of playing in both positions and he can play in different systems. You need to to have good physicality [at wing-back]. Good physicality is not the size, but he can run. And that is a key point in that position. The technical characteristics are perfect for him.""

While no one could disagree that Amad has the lungs to play at wing-back, his lack of natural physicality was exposed when Morgan Gibbs-White out-jumped him to head in Forest's equaliser. It was not the only time they managed to get at him, either, as Sean Dyche's plan seemed to be to try and leave Amad isolated against the tricky Callum Hudson-Odoi, who had the run of him in several key moments.

""Amad is a conundrum,"" said former Wales captain Ashley Williams on BBC's 'Match of the Day'. ""He's in the team because of his attacking qualities but he can't play in the No.10 position because [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha are playing really well. He plays right-wing-back and he finds himself in defensive positions at times, which isn't his strength. 

""He's in this full-back position because he has to do his work. He's an honest lad and he's trying to get back and do a job for his team, but it's not his quality. Amad gets in a centre-back position trying to head a ball out which is not his strength and they concede from that.""

Williams was, however, in awe of Amad's equaliser, praising his ""perfect technique"", adding: ""Going forward he's devastating. His goal, what a strike! This is not the player you want defending. He's in the team because of his attacking play and he's such an honest lad that he ends up doing lots of defensive work and then it looks bad on him.""

The stunning volley at the City Ground was just the latest of many brilliant moments Amad has provided. He kick-started his United career with his memorable winner against Liverpool in the FA Cup back in March 2024 before he won a late penalty and then scored to complete the dramatic comeback win at Manchester City last season, while he single-handedly averted an embarrassing home defeat by Southampton by scoring a 12-minute hat-trick a few weeks later. 

This season, he won the penalty with which United beat Burnley deep in added time and was brilliant in the surprise victory at Anfield, laying on the pass for Bryan Mbeumo's early goal. 

Rio Ferdinand launched a staunch defence of Amad on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, saying that pundits and fans should be relishing his attacking qualities rather than picking at his flaws.

""We get too caught up in what players can't do,"" he said. ""He is giving us so much going forward. His partnership and his telepathy with Mbeumo. For what he's giving you going forward and what he's giving the opposition winger, they are having to chase him half the time. That's what you want, them on the back foot. I just think he's a wonderful footballer.""

But Ferdinand also admitted that Amad was not being used in his best role by Amorim: ""Would he be better as a right winger? I think he would be, but that's not detracting away from what he's doing. I think he's just what this team need in this position right now.""

Amad's defensive weaknesses are not the only drawback with United playing wing-backs. While the ex-Atalanta youngster is not suited to the defensive responsibilities that come with the role, the player on the other flank, Dalot, is not made for its attacking demands.

""Amad's been getting questioned but as a wing-back, you're asked to be a full-back defensively, so Amad's asked to be here and defend crosses at the back post. But then when he gets up here, he's asked to be a winger,"" said former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports' 'Monday Night Football'. ""Now he is more of a winger, he's probably more suited to that position, but then Dalot's the opposite, where he may be able to deal with that [defensive headers] better. But when he gets on the last line and they actually get the ball to Dalot, he can't beat a man.

""He's not going to play a clever pass, he's not going to get a cross in. So for me, that's a little bit of a downfall in terms of getting five on the last line. It's whether these players have the quality.""

Amorim replaced Dalot with natural left-back Patrick Dorgu against Forest as well as in the previous win over Brighton, although the Denmark international has defensive weaknesses of his own and United's unbeaten run began when Amorim took Dorgu out of the starting line-up following the defeat at Brentford in late September.

With Amorim still insisting he is not going to change his formation, he will need to look for solutions from his other players. As Williams pointed out, Leny Yoro could have helped Amad out more by being quicker to support him when Forest put in crosses, while Casemiro can also support the team more when defending balls into the box with his natural height and strength. United can also make sure Amad is less exposed by playing more on the front foot and pegging opponents back, as they did in the first half at Anfield when he dominated against Milos Kerkez.

But with the Premier League trending towards being ever more physical and with long throws and crosses becoming increasingly prevalent, Amad is likely to get tested more and more in future games, especially now everyone is aware of his weaknesses. And with the league being as competitive as it is, with even teams as low down in the table as 19th-placed Forest providing a real threat at home, dominating the play in every minute of every game is just not realistic.

Amorim has said time and time again that his system can work in the Premier League, expressing his frustration when the media blame his formation when United lose but do not credit it when they win. But the paradox of playing Amad at wing-back has drawn more attentions to the limitations of his preferred set-up.

On Saturday, Amorim will come up against Tottenham boss Thomas Frank, his opposite in many ways. The Dane has chopped and changed his playing philosophy throughout his coaching career, playing an expansive style in the Championship with Brentford before then becoming more pragmatic upon promotion to the Premier League, mastering the art of scoring from set-plays and on the break. 

Frank's ideas have recently put him on a collision course with Spurs' idealistic supporters after their dismal display in the London derby against Chelsea, in which his side recorded their lowest expected goals (xG) total in the Premier League since the metric started being used in 2012. Frank was considered as a potential United boss when the club were thinking about sacking Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2024, although he was not interviewed when the Dutchman was finally fired last October, with Amorim taking his place.

Amorim has also dispensed with the hallmark of United's traditional style of play by rooting out classic wingers, but for now he just about has the backing of the fans thanks to the team's recently improved results. That level of support can easily fade though with another bad run of results, and that's why the coach needs to make sure that Amad, one of his greatest assets, is not allowed to be painted as a scapegoat again.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","‘Real Madrid did a great job not signing Erling Haaland'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/real-madrid-great-job-not-signing-erling-haaland-transfer-shout-explained-former-blancos-star-heirs-lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-named/blt16d1a5cb3b91f979","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:00:19 GMT","

Real Madrid “did a great job by not signing Erling Haaland”, according to former Blancos star Wesley Sneijder, with the Norwegian striker considered to be the wrong fit for a team that now has Kylian Mbappe leading the line. Sneijder, who is a big fan of Haaland, has also picked out the obvious heirs to crowns that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have worn with such distinction for so long.

La Liga giants Real, who are famed for their ‘Galacticos' recruitment policy under president Florentino Perez, were heavily linked with free-scoring Haaland when exit doors opened up at Borussia Dortmund. No deal was done there as he opted to follow in the footsteps of his father Alf Inge by heading to England.

Interest in the Spanish capital is said to have been retained, with Haaland posting incredible numbers on the goal front for Premier League giants City. He is, however, now tied to a contract through to 2034.

Real will forever be in the market for such talents, but they have helped to turn World Cup-winning Frenchman Mbappe into a fearsome No.9. They have that central striking berth filled, meaning that Haaland would prove to be more of a disruptive presence were he to make his way to Santiago Bernabeu.

That is the opinion of ex-Madrid playmaker Sneijder, with the Dutchman telling AdventureGamers.com: “I think Real Madrid did a great job by not signing Haaland. There was a moment where they still believed in putting Mbappe down the left with Haaland as the striker but I think the way now is much better because for me Mbappe has become a real striker.

“The way he takes up positions as a striker, it's very unique, and I believe he's much better now as a striker than from the left side so it doesn't make sense to sign Haaland anymore. That's good news for Man City!”

Haaland and Mbappe are expected to compete for Ballon d'Or recognition on an annual basis as they star for City and Madrid respectively. Both have been in the running for that prize before, only to be left empty-handed.

Golden Balls are, however, becoming easier to obtain now that all-time greats Messi and Ronaldo have entered the latter stages of their record-shattering careers. That is leaving the door open for others to walk through, with Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele being named the best player on the planet in 2025.

Sneijder once formed part of that conversation, having helped Jose Mourinho's Inter to Champions League glory in 2010, and added when asked to name those that will dominate the global scene for the next decade: “Once Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo retire then people will start talking more about Mbappe, Vinicius, Lamine Yamal like how we talk about Ronaldo and Messi now. It's all about generations. When Diego Maradona quit, other players came through.

“In 100 years, people won't talk about Mbappe, Vinicius or Yamal the same. There will be a new generation who has replaced them but when they retire, we will start talking about Mbappe, Yamal and Vinicius the same way we talk about Ronaldo and Messi.”

Mbappe and Haaland both made the top three in the Ballon d'Or vote of 2023, but were beaten to the ultimate prize by eight-time winner Messi - on the back of his World Cup triumph with Argentina. Neither has made the podium since, with Rodri and Dembele the last two names to have been added to a star-studded roll of honour.

Yamal could prove to be a problem for prolific forwards in Manchester and Madrid, with the Barcelona wonderkid finishing as the Ballon d'Or runner-up in 2025 at just 18 years of age. He is considered to boast the kind of potential that will allow him to emulate the feats of Messi and Ronaldo, meaning that Mbappe and Co will need to raise their game if further frustration is to be avoided when it comes to the most prestigious of individual honours.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Luis Diaz 'clearly' didn't deserve red card for Achraf Hakimi foul as Toni Kroos criticises referee for key decision in Bayern Munich win","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/luis-diaz-deserve-red-card-achraf-hakimi-foul-toni-kroos-criticises-referee-key-decision-bayern-munich-win/bltaf5d95b4299286da","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:04:07 GMT","

Toni Kroos has hit out at the decision to send off Luis Diaz during Bayern Munich's win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, insisting that ""it wasn't a red card”. The German and Real Madrid legend believes referee Maurizio Mariani was influenced by Achraf Hakimi's injury rather than the tackle itself. Diaz, however later apologised publicly, while Bayern backed their forward.

Bayern's statement 2-1 win away at PSG in the Champions League was overshadowed by a highly debated refereeing decision. Colombian international Diaz, who had scored both goals for Bayern in the first half, was shown a straight red card following a VAR intervention for a tackle on PSG full-back Hakimi. Initially given only a yellow, referee Maurizio Mariani changed his decision after reviewing the incident on the monitor, citing excessive force and danger to the opponent.

Hakimi, who left the field in clear pain and in tears, was later diagnosed with a syndesmosis tear and deltoid ligament damage expected to keep him sidelined for around eight weeks. 

The moment dramatically shifted the tone of the match, even as Bayern held on for a crucial away victory to extend their winning run under Vincent Kompany to 16 straight matches across competitions. The incident has since become the primary talking point across European football, with varying opinions from pundits, former officials and players, and one of the most vocal critics has been the German legend Kroos.

Speaking on his Einfach mal Luppen podcast, Kroos was emphatic in his belief that the referee made the wrong call. “For me, it's clear: it wasn't a red card,” Kroos said, insisting that the referee “let Hakimi's injury have too much of an influence on his assessment of the play.”

The German argued that the challenge itself, while forceful, did not indicate malicious intent from Diaz. “If Hakimi had gotten up after the challenge, nobody would have reviewed the play.”

Kroos also turned his attention toward the role of the VAR team, suggesting that replay slow-motion angles can distort reality, “In situations like these, the referee should judge the action itself, not the consequences.”

His position echoed the sentiment of several Bayern players, including Joshua Kimmich and Josip Stanisic, who suggested that the injury may have influenced the decision. However, Kimmich admitted upon reflection that “seeing the replay and how he catches him, you can understand the referee showing a red card.”

Diaz addressed the incident after the match, posting a message on Instagram that said: “Football always reminds us that in 90 minutes, the best and the worst can happen… I wish Hakimi a quick return to the pitch.”

Bayern boss Kompany expressed sympathy for PSG and Hakimi, citing Bayern's own past injury experiences with Jamal Musiala, while also defending the Colombian winger. 

“I hope Hakimi recovers soon, it's terrible. We went through the same thing last year with Musiala. I don't think Diaz meant any harm; it was just an unfortunate incident in a high-intensity match,” said the Belgian coach.

Despite the controversy, Diaz's performance before the red card reinforced his growing importance under Kompany, decisive, direct, and ruthless in transition. Kroos then moved to tactical commentary, praising Bayern's bravery in pressing PSG high and suggesting their superiority would likely have produced the same result, regardless of Hakimi or Diaz's presence. 

""Bayern were clearly superior and could have gone into halftime 3-0 or 4-0 up. I don't think PSG would have created any danger with eleven against eleven,"" he said.

Bayern sit top of the Champions League table and will turn their attention to domestic action, where they face Union Berlin next, a fixture Kompany warned could become a “trap game” after the emotional and physical intensity of Paris.

For PSG, the focus is now on recovery and rotation, and Hakimi's absence adds further pressure on coach Luis Enrique, who is already dealing with Ousmane Dembele's injury, who also left the pitch earlier in the game due to a calf injury. The French champions need solutions on the flanks, especially with decisive Champions League fixtures still ahead.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Jude Bellingham decision made: Thomas Tuchel makes huge England selection call after leaving Real Madrid superstar out of last Three Lions squad","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/jude-bellingham-decision-thomas-tuchel-england-real-madrid-three-lions-squad/blt710756c9e5ea6a36","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:49:35 GMT","

Thomas Tuchel has reportedly decided to draft Jude Bellingham back into his England squad for the November internationals. The Real Madrid superstar was surprisingly left out of the Three Lions' ranks in October after recovering from shoulder surgery and returning to action at club level. The expectation is that he will figure in 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania.

Eyebrows were raised when Tuchel chose to overlook Bellingham for fixtures that saw England book their tickets to next summer's global gathering in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The German tactician stuck with those that performed admirably in September.

Tuchel claimed that Bellingham was left out as he was lacking “rhythm” after several weeks on the sidelines. The 22-year-old midfielder has not represented his country since June, with his international coach going on to reveal that his mother finds some of Bellingham's on-field behaviour “repulsive”.

Questions were asked of Bellingham's character on the back of those comments, with Tuchel eager to establish squad harmony ahead of a bid for World Cup glory. He has said: “We are not collecting the most talented players, we are trying to build a team. Teams win trophies, no-one else.

“That's how it is in international football. But the thing you are playing [back to me] is not what I am saying. You are playing the game that says: ‘He [Tuchel] is saying the others who aren't in the team, you cannot build a team with them'. It's not like this. We built a team with the players who were available and they did so well so we go again with them. Nobody said we can't do the same with them. Or even better, or maybe the same level, with the others.

“For this moment we stick with our choice and the radical statement is that we don't collect the most talented players. We collect the guys who have the glue and cohesion to be the best team. Because we need to arrive as the best team. We will arrive as underdogs at the World Cup because we haven't won it for decades and we will play against teams who have repeatedly won it during that time. So we have to arrive as a team or we will have no chance.”

The Athletic reports that Bellingham will be given a chance to prove his worth when Tuchel names his latest England squad on Friday. He has been catching the eye for Real Madrid of late, netting three goals through his last four appearances, and will get the chance to add to his collection of 43 senior international caps.

Danny Murphy will be among those pleased to see Bellingham welcomed back into the fold, with the ex-England midfielder having told GOAL in the wake of October's snub: “I find the narrative around his character and any problems a little bit strange because when I have watched England - I have watched them a lot at tournaments and watched him closely, he is, by far, the best character on the football pitch when England play, in terms of producing big moments, grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, leaving everything out there.

“If you could have 11 Jude Bellinghams, you would win most tournaments. The element of not talking to the press or not doing interviews or the odd swear word or rant or a little bit of what some people would call arrogance, that is what creates the player on the pitch. They are just rumours because a lot of the feedback from the players - Jordan Henderson recently said how much he likes him and how great a character he is - I think some of it has been exaggerated.

“From a footballing perspective, we have a much better chance of winning the World Cup if he is in the team. I don't mean just in the squad, I mean in the team. He is a phenomenal talent. We should be - as pundits, fans, press - building him up, applauding him and being thankful that we have got him, not trying to pull him down because he is the best one we have got. He is the game-changer in our side. He is the one that can make things happen. He's just a phenomenal player.

“I don't blame Tuchel for not bringing him back on this particular occasion because he has only played a few minutes for Real Madrid. I understand that and don't see that as a drama. I don't see that as a big statement. We are playing two games we should win comfortably - let him get on with his fitness, let him get on with building himself back up. I would be absolutely gobsmacked and amazed if he is, if fit, not in Tuchel's first XI come the World Cup.”

England, who have already topped their World Cup qualification group after taking maximum points from six fixtures that have all delivered clean sheets, will be back in action on November 13 when playing host to Serbia. They will then travel to Albania three days later as their 2025 schedule is wrapped up.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

France national team head coach Didier Deschamps refrained from sparking further controversy while addressing the recent injury suffered by Paris Saint-Germain forward and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele. Deschamps claimed that he is ""especially sad"" to see Dembele's fitness struggles drag on, but added that he won't ""add fuel to the fire"" amid Les Blues' ongoing feud with PSG.

Dembele was forced off after just 25 minutes during their Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich earlier this week, just moments after he thought he had levelled the score at the Parc des Princes. It continues to be a frustrating season for the 28-year-old, who was crowned with the Ballon d'Or award in less than two months ago. His struggles with injuries seem to have returned, as he has played a grand total of 425 minutes this season, having suffered a hamstring injury with France in September and escaping a scare against Nice just days prior to the Bayern game. ""It hurts, it hurts so bad,"" Dembele was captured telling his team-mate Achraf Hakimi.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Thursday, where the France squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers was announced, Deschamps expressed his sorrow over the fact that Dembele, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner, has been ""hit with a string of injuries"" after remaining largely injury-free during the 2024-25 season. 

""I'm especially sad for Ous. Last season, he was spared from injury, and now he's been hit with a string of injuries,"" he told reporters. ""Not having him with us isn't good. But don't count on me to add fuel to the fire [with PSG]. I'm not interested in controversy. We have one thing in common: his absence isn't good for PSG or for us. I hope he recovers quickly.""

He further elaborated on the feud between PSG and the French national team: ""I'm not giving lessons. What happens at PSG is their business; I don't have all the information. I wouldn't presume to say anything about any club; they decide, they have the information to decide. Just like us. There have always been exchanges, as is the case here with Ousmane's injury. When tests are done, they are communicated both ways. Of course, the interests of clubs and the interests of national teams aren't the same. But there have always been exchanges regarding the tests and diagnoses. I'm not here to change the medical protocol. The fact that clubs can be given more decision-making power than national teams isn't up to me to decide. I'm not in Luis Enrique's position, just as he's not in mine. From the moment his players are on the pitch, there's a risk. [Achraf] Hakimi and [Nuno] Mendes weren't not at risk, but they got injured.""

Dembele's fitness issues have sparked tension between PSG and the French Football Federation (FFF). Dembele and  team-mate Desire Doue both suffered injuries on duty with Les Bleus in a World Cup qualifying game against Ukraine. The Ligue 1 champions were left angry by the governing body's handling of their players, saying the injuries were ""serious and avoidable"" and that they would not have happened had the FFF's medical staff consulted the club properly.

Les Bleus currently lead the Group D standings in the World Cup qualifiers with 10 points from their four games. The upcoming fixtures against Ukraine on November 13 and Azerbaijan on November 16 are their final set of qualifiers. While Deschamps' men only require one more point to seal qualification to the World Cup, they will be determined to bag all three points against Ukraine to not only confirm their place at next year's World Cup, but also finish the group as the table-toppers. Such a scenario could see Deschamps hand much-needed rest to his most important players against Azerbaijan while also providing opportunities to players who haven't had as many chances to prove their mettle.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Inter coach Cristian Chivu believes his side could have played better during the 2-1 win over Champions League debutants Kairat Almaty, but had words of encouragement for his captain Lautaro Martinez, who scored his seventh goal of the season across all competitions. The Argentine has been urged by Chivu to play with a smile on his face and rediscover his passion for the game.

Inter welcomed Champions League debutants Kairat Almaty at the San Siro on Wednesday, having won their opening three games in the competition. Ahead of the game, Inter boss Chivu spoke about Martinez's lack of goals in recent Serie A fixtures ahead of the encounter. “The captain is on the field because we need his spirit, he is a leader and his presence is very important,"" he told Amazon Prime Video Italia as he opted against resting Martinez in a side that was heavily rotated – the likes of Manuel Akanji, Marcus Thuram, Hakan Calhanoglu, and Alessandro Bastoni started on the bench.

Although the Argentine striker found the back of the net against Union Saint-Gilloise in the previous league phase outing of the Champions League, his last goal in the Italian top-flight came against Cremonese on October 4, over a month ago. He has since gone four games without scoring a league goal, his total tally a meagre three goals in 10 Serie A games. 

“I made a gesture to Lautaro: to smile,” Chivu revealed. “I told him he needs to rediscover happiness and passion.""

The goal did come on Wednesday, as Martinez opened the scoring in the 45th minute. His celebrations were jubilant and passionate, and his goal would ultimately prove to be more crucial than one would have expected against a Champions League debutant. The Kazakh giants gave Inter a run for their money, equalising in the 55th minute via Ofri Arad. However, defender Carlos Augusto restored the lead 12 minutes later to ensure Inter registered their fourth win on the trot in the competition.

Speaking to reporters after the game, the manager reflected on the result and claimed that his team could have and should have done much better. ""This was a lesson for us. We should have done better,"" he said. 

""Yes, we weren't able to close it out earlier. They always stayed in the game and caused us problems. We often tried a three-man defence with the goalkeeper, but we struggled to express what we had planned. I put my face to it, they know it because they are mature and intelligent guys.""

Chivu was impressed with Martinez's performance. The Romanian head coach stated that Martinez leads the team by showing the ""right spirit"" but urged him to keep smiling.

""Now I'm the coach and the responsibilities are mine, I could have done better. A deal with Lautaro? A player will never dare come to me and ask to play,"" he told reporters after the game. ""I had the idea. For a striker, to get him out of a problem like this, you have to let him play. I'm happier with the play he made in the corner to clear a cross, for example. This is the right spirit for us. Football is also about happiness, you shouldn't get too excited or see ghosts that aren't there. Lautaro is important, as are so many others, and it's important to smile, you have to give your all.""

With his goal, the former River Plate prodigy became the joint third-highest Argentine goal scorer in the competition, tying Hernan Crespo's record of 25 goals. Only Sergio Aguero (41) and Lionel Messi (129) are ahead of Martinez. 

Chivu has done a pretty decent job since taking over the reins from Simone Inzaghi ahead of the Club World Cup in June, even claiming recently that he's starting to ""enjoy"" his job. The Nerazzurri are on course to seal a spot in the top eight of the Champions League league phase, and thus a direct entry to the round of 16. In Serie A, Inter are currently sitting on second position on the table, just one behind defending champions Napoli. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

The ATP today announced a multi-year extension of its partnership with Lexus, one of the world's leading premium car brands. Lexus will continue as Official Automotive Partner and Platinum Partner of the ATP Tour through 2028.

Since joining forces in 2023, Lexus has served as Official Car partner at the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals and Rolex Paris Masters, in addition to a global portfolio of tournaments spanning Almaty, Hamburg, Kitzbuhel, Montpellier, Marseille, Metz, Lyon, Rotterdam, Auckland, Barcelona, Houston, London, and Eastbourne.



Through the renewal, Lexus will continue to engage the tennis community through a global tournament portfolio and high-value brand exposure across the ATP Tour's digital and social platforms. Lexus remains Title Partner of ATP Head2Head – a digital initiative showcasing the Tour's biggest rivalries – featuring an exclusive content series that follows ATP players as they take on entertaining challenges at tournaments.

Lexus will also continue to provide a fleet of electrified vehicles at sponsored events to support the transportation of players, officials and guests. With a portfolio of self-charging hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all electric models, the brand's leadership in electrification aligns closely with the ATP Tour's sustainability ambitions under ATP Serves and UN Sports for Climate Action, which targets Net Zero emissions by 2040.



Eno Polo, ATP CEO, said: “Lexus is a partner that truly adds value to our Tour. Since we began our journey together, they've shown a genuine commitment to tennis – elevating the experience for our players and staff at key events and helping advance our sustainability efforts through ATP Serves. That purpose-led approach is what makes this partnership stand out. We're proud to keep building on this.”

Andre Schmidt, Head of Lexus Europe, commented “Lexus' partnership with the ATP Tour reflects our shared commitment to excellence, precision, and passion — values that resonate deeply with our brand. Through our electrified portfolio, we offer a range of choices that make luxury a personal experience, perfectly aligned with the spirit of world-class tennis.”

The ATP and Spotify are teaming up on a global content collaboration focused on fan engagement and on-platform programming. The initiative aims to inspire and engage the next generation of fans through compelling content, and behind-the-scenes access.

As part of this collaboration, the ATP will team up with Spotify to distribute original tennis programming that brings fans closer to the sport. The collaboration kicks off ahead of the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, the ATP Tour's season-ending championship, with episodic content on Spotify and continues through the 2026 season. One of the first projects will be a behind-the-scenes documentary on the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals, set to debut in December.

The initiative will feature a range of on-platform content celebrating the intersection of tennis and culture within the ATP ecosystem – spotlighting athletes, tournaments, and moments that showcase the energy and personality of the game.

With sports video content consumption up more than 250% on Spotify and overall video consumption rising 80% since early 2025, fans are increasingly turning to the platform for new ways to experience sports. Tennis, with its global audience, iconic athletes, and world-class events, offers a powerful space for storytelling, entertainment, and fan engagement.

“Spotify is a best-in-class platform with a passionate, global audience, and we're thrilled to bring ATP storytelling to life through this collaboration,” said Andrew Walker, Senior Vice President of Brand and Marketing, ATP Tour. “This partnership enables us to create new content experiences that resonate with fans, showcase our athletes in fresh ways, and invite new audiences into the sport.”

“Fans today want to connect with the moments and personalities that define sport,” said Roman Wasenmüller, VP, Head of Podcasts at Spotify. “Teaming up with the ATP is about giving fans deeper access to the stories and energy that make tennis one of the world's most compelling sports.”

This collaboration builds on ongoing innovation in ATP's digital and content strategy, including recent global collaborations with TikTok, Overtime, and the launch of the ‘It All Adds Up' brand campaign, developed with global creative agency Wieden+Kennedy, along with the launch of the ATP's new logo and brand identity.

Cameron Norrie overcame a stern test from home hope Kyrian Jacquet at the Moselle Open on Thursday. A finalist last year in Metz, Norrie rallied past the lucky loser 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-4 to reach his second semi-final of the season.

The only seed remaining at the ATP 250, Norrie won the final 11 points of the two-hour, 25-minute match to advance. 

“He surprised me a lot,” Norrie said of Jacquet, the third Frenchman whom the lefty has beaten this week. “He was mixing it up really well. A lot of slicing, then really aggressive at moments. His serve is really, really good.

""The French have so many good players, so many different kinds of players. I really liked the way he competed and he could have easily won the match in the second set as well, but I managed to stay tough.”



Jacquet crushed 48 winners, half of which came from his forehand, to Norrie's 28, but the 30-year-old Briton found his best tennis when he needed it most to earn his place in the last four. He will next meet Lorenzo Sonego after the Italian beat Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(6). Sonego has fond memories in Metz, having clinched the crown in 2022.

Norrie is aiming for his sixth tour-level title and first since 2023 in Rio de Janeiro, where he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

Ocon: Haas update 'has definitely made a big difference'

Alonso 'optimistic' he can 'take advantage' of Sprint weekend opportunities at Interlagos

Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Sao Paulo Grand Prix, from the pole position favourite to who might claim victory.

Formula 1 heads to the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace as the Sao Paulo Grand Prix hosts Round 21 of the championship, but what do the odds tell us about who might succeed during the weekend ahead? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

Leading into Mexico, Max Verstappen dominated the conversation after mounting a sensational comeback that started at Monza. However, championship rival Lando Norris took momentum in the Mexican capital, sealing victory by 30.324 seconds to pull one point clear in the title race.

Returning to Verstappen, the Dutchman is the in-form driver coming into Interlagos, with a 1.60 average in his past five races. He also delivered one of the drives of his life on his last visit to this track, taking a remarkable win after starting in 17th place on the grid.

The third piece to the title race triad is Oscar Piastri who is now second in the championship, having last prevailed in the Netherlands. The Australian has battled since Baku, missing out on a top-three result in four consecutive appearances.

Ferrari have endured a tricky season, but Charles Leclerc gave the squad a boost after podium finishes in Austin and Mexico City. The Monegasque has formed part of the post-race champagne celebrations on seven occasions in 2025.

A regular rival of Leclerc's is George Russell, who has struggled to keep up with the frontrunners since his triumph in Singapore, but he returns to a happy hunting ground this week. The Briton clinched his debut win here in 2022, and his team have been victorious in Sao Paulo on three occasions since 2019.

Pierre Gasly is a double rostrum finisher in Brazil across his last five visits. Last year, the Alpine racer navigated his way from 13th on the grid to claim a place on the platform. However, the Frenchman's car is not up to par this season, and he'll likely need a miracle to finish inside the top three this time.

Over in the rookie corner, Kimi Antonelli is exhibiting glimpses of the form he delivered earlier in the campaign. The Italian only has the one podium to his name from Canada, but he's crossed the line inside the top six in three of his past four races.

Another youngster to impress of late is Ollie Bearman. The Haas driver has only two top-six finishes behind him this year, including a career-best fourth place last time out.

On the opposite end of the experience spectrum, we find Lewis Hamilton quietly plotting his next move after a tough season that has yielded no podiums and nine top-sixes.

Williams driver Alex Albon leads the midfield teams in top-six finishes with five under his belt in 2025. The Thai racer last mingled with the top six at Zandvoort, and lines up in Brazil with four consecutive returns outside of the top 10.

Double World Champion Fernando Alonso has experienced mixed fortunes this term, having finished one race inside the first six spots. That was in Belgium and, since then, he's registered three top-10s and two DNFs. Sticking with experienced drivers, Nico Hulkenberg also carries two top-sixes with him into Brazil, but the last one came back at Silverstone.

This weekend's hometown hero Gabriel Bortoleto offers value for a top-10 return, earning his fifth of the year in Mexico. The Brazilian averages 12.80 in his last five races, claiming two top-10s, and his best performance this year came in Hungary, when he crossed the line sixth.

Another rookie, Isack Hadjar, finds himself with eight top-10 drives this year, his last one arriving in Azerbaijan. On the other side of the Racing Bulls garage, Liam Lawson has struggled for consistency this season. The Kiwi produced a career-best fifth-place drive in Baku, but has since failed to finish inside the top 10 and didn't complete the Grand Prix in the previous round.

Over at Red Bull, Yuki Tsunoda is starting to find his groove. The Japanese driver has found the top 10 in 50% of his past six races, and averages 9.80 in the ultimate five appearances.

Finally, Carlos Sainz departs the pits at Interlagos with eight top-10s behind him, but the Spaniard has registered two consecutive DNFs coming into this race.

Lando Norris stopped the clock fastest for a fifth time this season in Mexico, marking his first pole position since Belgium. This weekend Norris returns to a track where he claimed the front row grid position 12 months prior, though ultimately the Briton went on to end the race in sixth.

A three-time winner in Sao Paulo, Max Verstappen enters the event as the leading fastest qualifier on the grid, notching up seven pole positions so far in 2025. The four-time World Champion has found himself starting the Grand Prix in first place twice at this venue.

Oscar Piastri has five poles to date this year, with his last success arriving in the Netherlands. The McLaren driver has fallen outside of the top six Qualifying spots in three of his last four outings after a dominant early and middle sector of the season.

Mercedes touch down in Sao Paulo with an exceptional record in the last 10 editions of the race, having been the winning team 60% of the time since 2014. Since George Russell's success here in 2022, however, the squad have handed over the reins to Red Bull.

Max Verstappen has powered the Milton Keynes-based outfit to two consecutive wins at Interlagos, and their recent form suggests a hat-trick is a strong possibility.

McLaren have been hunting their maiden victory in Sao Paulo since 2012, when Lewis Hamilton was still racing for the team and Jenson Button took the win. The closest they've come to a win since was when Lando Norris finished runner-up to Verstappen in the 2023 edition.

What McLaren lacks in recent success in Brazil is made up for with their hefty win tally this term; Norris' success in Mexico City gifted the papaya squad their 13th victory of the campaign. Ferrari, meanwhile, enjoyed a successful visit to this circuit in 2017 thanks to Sebastian Vettel, but the Italian outfit have failed to replicate that triumph since.

The penultimate Sprint on the calendar takes shape on Saturday, and Max Verstappen is the clear frontrunner. The Dutchman has snatched the first prize in the last two Sprints, and found himself on the podium in three out of four contests so far in 2025.

A familiar rival to the Red Bull man is Oscar Piastri, who secured three runner-ups in the first three Sprints of the season before failing to finish last time out at the Circuit of The Americas.

The Australian's team mate, Lando Norris, fared well in Miami and Belgium, where he won and finished third respectively. However, he ended eighth in China and failed to get his car across the line in the United States Sprint.

Lewis Hamilton is the only other Sprint winner this season, taking the crown in Shanghai. The Ferrari driver backed it up with a third-place finish in Miami before settling for 15th in Belgium.

Tsunoda's focus is on 'maximising performance' rather than aiding Verstappen title challenge

Ocon: Haas update 'has definitely made a big difference'

The McLaren chiefs are the latest guests on our Beyond The Grid podcast.

McLaren have won back-to-back Constructors' titles for the first time since the early ‘90s. But just eight years ago, in 2017, they finished second to last, so how exactly have they transformed into World Champions since then?

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson at the McLaren Technology Centre, CEO Zak Brown and Team Principal Andrea Stella outline how they've masterminded McLaren's remarkable turnaround together, revealing just how desperate the team's situation was at the start of this journey – and how they're planning to sustain their recent success in the years to come.

But in the immediate future, their eyes are on the next prize, as McLaren chase a first Drivers' World Championship since Lewis Hamilton won in 2008.

Going into the final four rounds of the 2025 season, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri are separated by just one point at the top of the standings.

Brown and Stella discuss how the pair have evolved during their time at McLaren, address criticism of their approach to this title fight, and discuss whether they'll have any regrets should Max Verstappen beat both Norris and Piastri to the crown.

Ocon: Haas update 'has definitely made a big difference'

Alonso 'optimistic' he can 'take advantage' of Sprint weekend opportunities at Interlagos

Following their engagement announcement, we take a closer look at Alexandra Saint Mleux –⁠ the art historian, fashion muse, and dog mum, whose stand-out looks over race weekends have made her a familiar face across the paddock.

On Sunday November 2, in an Instagram post that has over 6.3 million likes at the time of writing, Charles Leclerc announced his engagement to long-term parter Alexandra Saint Mleux.

A familiar face in the paddock, Alexandra is often seen cheering on her Ferrari-driver partner Leclerc from the garages. But beyond the world of F1, Alexandra is an art historian, influencer, and fashion icon in her own right.

So, who is the future Mrs Leclerc?

Born in Calais, France, in 2001, Alexandra has both French and Mexican roots. She pursued a degree in Art History at the prestigious Ecole du Louvre, where she specialised in the 20th-century art, studying the works of artists including Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe, Andy Warhol, and Henri Matisse.

Before her relationship with Charles Leclerc brought her into the F1 spotlight, she kept a modest online presence, where she occasionally shared moments from her life and travels while studying in Paris.

One of the couple's first public appearances was at Wimbledon in 2023, where the pair sat with friend Pierre Gasly and his partner, Francisca Gomez. And the rest, as they say, was history.

Known for her polished highly styled online presence, Alexandra maintains a carefully considered approach to social media. Her posts often highlight her interests, such as fashion, art, and travel, as well as appearances at events with friends and fellow paddock regulars, including Rebecca Donaldson, partner of Carlos Sainz.

Her passion for art history continues beyond her studies, and is evident on her dedicated Instagram account, @alexandramalenart, where she shares artwork and exhibitions that resonate with her. Professionally, she serves as Art Coordinator & Public Relations lead at Kamil Art Gallery in Monaco, reflecting her commitment to the art world.

Alongside her art career, Alexandra has become increasingly recognised within the fashion space. She has collaborated with brands such as Meshki, Rhode, and Nina Ricci, and has appeared in publications such as Vogue, People Magazine, and ELLE.

In the ELLE interview, Alexandra promoted her charitable fund, Corazones Unidos, which supports children across Mexico by providing access to quality education. Here, she spoke about the importance of giving back and explained that social media has given her “a sense of independence”, and that with that came a desire “to turn gratitude into action”.

The acknowledgement of the privilege that comes with her platform, and her commitment to using it for a positive impact, has resonated strongly with fans who admire both her talent and her purpose-driven outlook.

Alexandra is undoubtedly a fashion force to be reckoned with. Her style is effortless, chic, and elevated. Her fashion sense is the perfect mix of aspirational and attainable; you could imagine yourself wearing something similar at half the price. Alexandra also uses fashion to pay homage to the location she is in.

She regularly nods to local tradition or takes inspiration from cultural icons such as Frida Kahlo or Grace Kelly, weaving her art-historian's perspective into her approach to fashion. Here are some of her top fashion moments so far.

No story about Charles and Alexandra would be complete without mentioning their dog, Leo. The miniature long-haired dachshund joined the couple in April 2024 and has since become a familiar face in the paddock and on social media.

Whether he's running about the paddock on a race weekend or relaxing at their home, Leo is very much a member of the Leclerc-Saint Mleux family, even playing a small role in Charles' proposal!

Here are some of our favourite Paddock Pup moments.

After nearly three years of dating, Charles proposed in a romantic candlelit setting surrounded by red roses. The proposal included some thoughtful and personal touches – even Leo was part of the moment, adorably sporting a tag announcing “Dad wants to marry you!”

Since the announcement, the news has been met with joy and well-wishes from fans, friends, and others in the paddock. Drivers such as Carlos Sainz, Oscar Piastri, Esteban Ocon, and team mate Lewis Hamilton have all publicly congratulated the couple.

Ocon: Haas update 'has definitely made a big difference'

Alonso 'optimistic' he can 'take advantage' of Sprint weekend opportunities at Interlagos

As F1 arrives at the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

Formula 1 travels to the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace – also known as Interlagos – this weekend for Round 21 on the 2025 calendar, the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

With the Sprint format in play, Free Practice 1 and Sprint Qualifying will take place on Friday, November 7, followed by the Sprint and Qualifying on Saturday, November 8, and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, November 9.

*From the previous seven races in Sao Paulo

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Interlagos has a tricky first corner, you can brake much later than you imagine and carry speed into the apex – but go too late and it's easy to lock up the front left.

The middle sector here is all about the flow, the corners come thick and fast. One lock-up in either of the tight right-handers and it puts you off line and out of sync for the whole lot. It's easy to lock up as well because you are loaded laterally on the entries there. It's a technical sector where the rhythm is everything.

The final corner is critical, it's all about exit speed to carry you onto the whopping straight back up the hill. You've got to get the right balance between opening up the corner and taking too much kerb as well, which can unsettle the car and cost you exit speed.

Overall it's a short but fun circuit to drive. The anti-clockwise nature and long, loaded left-handers make this one a bit harder physically for the drivers as well. By the end of this race you might be feeling it on the neck, which isn't used to being loaded up so much on that side.

“This year's compound selection for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix harks back to 2023, with the C2, C3 and C4 as hard, medium and soft, therefore one step harder than the trio used last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview.

“Last year, the dry weather tyres were not required for the race, but when used on Friday and Saturday morning, they showed high levels of wear, as well as graining, especially on the rear axle. The circuit had been completed resurfaced, thus leaving a very smooth surface, less abrasive than in previous years, although still with plenty of bumps around the track.

“If conditions are similar, with the inevitable variations due to the ageing of the asphalt, the decision to bring harder compounds could thus extend the performance life of the tyres, which are already more resistant to degradation than the 2024 range. That might allow the soft to come into play, which last year was only used for Sprint Qualifying.

“The layout at Interlagos is interesting, with hints of an anti-clockwise oval circuit, which the drivers deal with 71 times in the race. It boasts 15 corners with relatively balanced lateral and longitudinal forces that do not put any undue strain on the tyres, as they are subjected to loads distributed equally between the front and rear axles.

“The combination of several straights and much twistier sections offers plenty of overtaking opportunities, although it also means there's a higher risk of Safety Cars and incidents. At this time of year, the weather and temperature can be very variable, with a risk of frequent rain and the inevitable use of wet weather tyres.

“A further peculiarity of Interlagos is the bumpy nature of the track, as a result of it being built on relatively unstable ground: just one more challenge for drivers and teams to deal with in terms of set-up and tyre management.”

With four rounds remaining in the 2025 season, the battle for the Drivers' Championship is still very much on. The fight took another twist last time out in Mexico after Lando Norris returned to the top of the standings for the first time since April, though the Briton leads by only one point from team mate Oscar Piastri.

Max Verstappen, meanwhile, has continued to close the gap in third place, with the Red Bull driver now just 36 points adrift of Norris. Of the three title contenders, Norris arguably arrives into the weekend with the momentum off the back of a dominant victory in Mexico City.

However, Piastri will be keen to bounce back following a trickier run of late that has seen him finish off the podium for the last four races, and the McLaren racer is likely to welcome the higher grip conditions at Interlagos.

But with the possibility of showers arriving during the event – a weekend in which the Sprint will make its penultimate appearance of the campaign – Verstappen would be one to watch in such conditions, given the Dutchman's stunning drive to victory on a wet track back in 2024.

A strong result for the reigning World Champion could see him gain even more ground in the championship, while a solid points haul for Red Bull might put the Milton Keynes-based outfit ahead of either Ferrari or Mercedes in the ongoing close duel for P2 in the Teams' standings.

Behind that battle, Williams still have a firm grip on P5, while the midfield scrap remains as close as ever as only 12 points separate Racing Bulls, Aston Martin, Haas and Kick Sauber in the fight for sixth place. Who will have the edge this weekend in Sao Paulo?

There are countless memorable moments from the career of Ayrton Senna, but one particular highlight came when the three-time champion scored an emotional victory in his home race during the 1991 season.

Having started from pole position, Senna led for 65 laps before the gearbox on his McLaren started to fail. With the rain clouds gathering and just one gear available to use, the Brazilian driver managed to make it across the line in P1, marking the first time that Senna had claimed a win in front of his local fans.

From festival regulars like Tom Blyth and Havana Rose Liu to prestige TV players (see: ‘The Studio's Chase Sui Wonders), these are the rising stars gracing screens and piquing industry interest.



		By Kirsten Chuba, Mia Galuppo, Seija Rankin 

	November 6, 2025	




	These eight rising screen stars are popping up everywhere from streaming successes to festival stand-outs, catching the attention of directors, studio executives and audiences alike.


	Some have had franchise turns like Hunger Games actor Tom Blyth and 28 Years Later's Erin Kellyman, while others will be familiar to A24 obsessives (see: Chase Sui Wonders and Archie Madekwe). The 2025 class joins alumni that include a pre-Top Gun Glen Powell, pre-Euphoria Sydney Sweeney, pre-Spider-Man Zendaya, and many others who are now at the top of call sheets and calling their own shots.


	And while Hollywood has always been a difficult industry to navigate, these talents are charting their own course. “You're in this weird business where you're constantly in competition with your friends,” says Madekwe. “As soon as you can learn to find joy and to celebrate everyone's success, it frees you.”


	Blyth has tackled franchise fare (Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), TV Westerns (Billy the Kid) and festival standouts (Plainclothes and Wasteman), but, as he'll tell you, one of his hardest roles was something completely unexpected. “I'd been offered People We Meet on Vacation a couple of times and turned it down because it almost felt too light and fun and didn't feel congruent with the other stuff I've been doing,” says the 30-year-old of Netflix's highly anticipated adaptation of the Emily Henry bestseller. But the Nottingham-born actor, who studied at the city's Television Workshop before continuing on to Juilliard, was coming off the videogame adaptation Watch Dogs and found himself craving lighter fare. In the end, the rom-com proved to be its own kind of acting challenge. At this year's Academy Museum Gala, he was talking with Zoey Deutch, who starred in the early Netflix rom-com Set It Up, and recalls, “She said, ‘I know how hard that genre is.' And I was like, ‘Yes! Thank you!'” He explains: “People think rom-coms must be really easy but, especially when you're used to doing stuff that is full of grit, you've got to be really present and stay fluid.”


IF I WASN'T AN ACTOR I'D BE “I've always held this feeling I would be a Zoologist.”


WHAT I DID WITH MY FIRST HOLLYWOOD PAYCHECK “My very first one was when I was 11 or 12 and I played a feral child in Ridley Scott's Robin Hood and I bought a bunch of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.”


THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARSTRUCK “There have been many times but the first time I was properly starstruck was meeting Daniel Day-Lewis.”


THE PERSON I AM DYING TO WORK WITH “Again, dream of dreams, that person would be Daniel Day-Lewis. In terms of a person who makes other actors look good, he would make you look like a much better actor than you could ever possibly be. There are so many others, too, and I was so lucky to already work with Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage [on Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes] so the bar is already quite high.”


	Kellyman was launched into Hollywood on the biggest of stages, landing her first major acting role in 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story. Looking back now, the 27-year-old says, “I kind of spent the whole time just like a deer in the headlights.” The former child model — she discovered her love of acting during a commercial audition where she was asked to improv — has now appeared in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Willow, 28 Years Later and the upcoming 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. In between the franchises, she found time to star in Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut, Eleanor the Great; she says smaller movies provide the intimacy and emotionality that drew her to the industry initially. Kellyman, who is openly gay, says she's partial to queer stories but “also wouldn't box myself in in that way.” Looking ahead, she cites Greta Gerwig as a dream collaborator and says she's very interested in writing and creating characters of her own. Her ultimate goal, however? “If I could be, like, one-sixteenth of what Meryl Streep is,” she says, “that would be an achievement.” 


IF I WASN'T AN ACTOR I'D BE “A mess. Thank God this worked out.” THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARSTRUCK It was meeting Donald Glover. I think I was 17, we were filming Solo and staying in a hotel and my aunt was with me. We were getting breakfast and I was like, you can sit anywhere but just not next to that guy. She had no idea who he was and I was too shy to talk to him even though we were in the same movie. Anyways I turn around and she sat at the table with Donald and his dad. WHAT I DID WITH MY FIRST HOLLYWOOD PAYCHECK “Got my dog, Bambi. Which my mom was not happy about.” BEST ADVICE I'VE GOTTEN WORKING IN ENTERTAINMENT WAS FROM “Scarlett Johansson. When we were on a carpet and I was really overwhelmed, she told me to imagine I was in Hawaii.”


	In the two years since Bottoms — the raunchy gay comedy from zillennial scribes Rachel Sennott and Emma Seligman — came out, Havana Rose Liu has booked eight roles. “That movie changed how I see myself, and it held such a powerful space in our political landscape that opportunities started to open up for me,” says the 28-year-old actress. Originally a model (and before that an NYU student), Liu has been busy curating an indie- and auteur-heavy roster. She stole the screen in this summer's Lurker (from The Bear‘s Alex Russell), and her turn in Tuner (the feature debut of Oscar-winning Navalny director Daniel Roher) was the talk of the fall festival circuit; still to come are roles in Jesse Eisenberg's untitled musical comedy and Nicolas Winding Refn's thriller for Neon. “Someone told me early on not to think about this career as a ‘job,' or our industry as an ‘industry,' and that has really helped me take the weight off,” she says. “And it brought me back to the core of the art.” 


	IF I WASN'T AN ACTOR I'D BE “I was just saying today that maybe I'd want to be a doula. Or a teacher, or something where I'd get to read a lot.”THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARSTRUCK “I saw Tilda Swinton from very far away and literally just left the room because I was too struck.”IF I'M WEARING MY AIRPODS ON SET, I'M PROBABLY LISTENING TO “Right now it's Tame Impala, because I am oontz oontz-ing my way through my nerves.”MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF DUSTIN HOFFMAN ON THE SET OF TUNER WAS “That he is such a charmer. He leads with so much gravitas and magnetism and grace. And I remember he just walked into the room very slowly and everyone sort of bristled and he has this just really cool guy charm that I think makes everyone around him feel very special. And you really see that with the greats. I think they just have a way of shining their light on you and you feel suddenly very safe and whole.”


	“I'm constantly searching for roles that I haven't seen somebody that looks like myself play,” says the 30-year-old Brit, who got his start in the theater before nabbing parts in Midsommar and Saltburn. “I'm interested in stories that show people of color not in a position of trauma.” Earlier this year, Madekwe starred in and produced the psychological thriller Lurker; now, he has his eye on developing projects of his own. “When you're a creative person,” he says, “you write, you sing, you dance, and then at some point someone says, ‘Which one are you going to do?' And then you choose to be an actor, but it doesn't take away that spark of wanting to be creative from inside you.” He points to pal Harris Dickinson — who last year launched his own production company and recently released his directorial debut — as an inspiration. “You're in this weird business where you're constantly in competition with your friends, and as soon as you can learn to find joy and to celebrate everyone's success, it frees you.” Up next, Madekwe will star alongside Kingsley Ben-Adir in The Arrival and opposite Sophie Turner in a Prime Video heist thriller. 


IF I WASN'T AN ACTOR I'D BE “I always thought I would be great at music A&R. I thought I could hype people up, introduce them to the right venue, try to get people listening to them.”THE FICTIONAL CHARACTER I IDENTIFY WITH THE MOST “This is so embarrassing, and I can't believe I'm about to say this but as a kid it was Lisa Simpson. I loved that she was an outcast in her family and was really into the arts. That episode when she became a Buddhist, I was like I think I'm going to become a Buddhist.” WHAT I DID WITH MY FIRST HOLLYWOOD PAYCHECK “Bought a house before I could spend it on Nando's and chocolate.” THE PERSON I AM DYING TO WORK WITH “Paul Dano. He's such a special actor and I love his career.”


	The Los Angeles native's big break came after losing out on what could have been a dream role. May auditioned for Mayor of Kingstown, a popular show in the vast Taylor Sheridan television universe, but didn't get it. “Two weeks later,” she says, Sheridan called her and said, “I haven't written it yet, but I'm going to do a show called 1883, and I'm writing you a role.” That role was Elsa, the lead character in the Yellowstone prequel about the Dutton family's wagon train journey across the Western U.S. “It wasn't so much about having a conversation about a scene and getting into character. You're just thrust into it,” the 24-year-old says of the shoot, which took place outdoors in Texas and Montana, with the cast and crew subject to whatever nature threw at them. Still, May says she was grateful for the experience: “You just don't make anything like that anymore. It's like a film in the '70s.” Four years after May wow-ed in 1883, audiences can expect to see a lot more of the actress. Looking ahead, she has a stunning half-dozen movies lined up, including the latest Scream (in which she plays Neve Campbell's onscreen daughter) and other titles that see her starring opposite Jennifer Lopez and Cynthia Erivo. May says the sudden burst in productivity came after a strike-imposed period of self-reflection. “I had a weird moment of not knowing what I needed to do and maybe relying on other people to guide me. I thought, ‘Maybe I'm not cut out to be an actor,' ” she says. “I went and lived life and traveled and then thought: ‘It's time to get back to work.' I feel very certain and assured now.”


THE FICTIONAL CHARACTER I IDENTIFY WITH THE MOST “Probably, Holden Caulfield. I have said that since the minute I read [Catcher in the Rye]. But maybe it's because I wanted to be more like him, which I don't know why because I think he was very depressed. There is probably something psychological there that should be studied, but I love the way that character was written.”


IF I'M WEARING MY AIRPODS ON SET, I'M PROBABLY LISTENING TO “It varies a lot. I can listen to A Perfect Circle and Tool and Nine Inch Nails, or I could be listening to a Jazz album. But nothing pop-y.”


THE PERSON I AM DYING TO WORK WITH “Colin Farrell and Willem Dafoe. I love chameleons. I have a list that I wrote ten years ago, and I will eventually check them all off. It is my goal.”


BEST ADVICE I'VE GOTTEN WORKING IN ENTERTAINMENT WAS FROM ”She's not in entertainment, but my mom told me when I was young, ‘Isabel, I don't know how I can help you but I would say befriend all of the characters and the only person you are trying to impress is them.'”


	As the daughter of actor Ewan McGregor, Esther was lucky enough to spend a lot of time on sets as a child. She tried several creative outlets while coming of age (she's a licensed tattoo artist and writes music), but says that deep down, she always knew acting was going to be part of her life. And when she booked the role of a young Tilda Swinton in Pedro Almodóvar's The Room Next Door, her career started to click into place. “I have a French mother, so my love for this [business] is deeply rooted in international film, and that call felt like a full-circle moment,” says the 24-year-old. “It changed my life.” She then broke big in last year's erotic thriller Babygirl (as Nicole Kidman's daughter) and this summer's YA Prime Video series We Were Liars. Next, she'll be in Chloe Domont's follow-up to Fair Play and will co-star with Pamela Anderson and Dakota Johnson in a family drama about survivor's guilt. “I think a lot of art we see is just distraction, which can be great, but what I want to do is tell a story that might change someone's life.” 


BEST ADVICE I'VE GOTTEN WORKING IN ENTERTAINMENT WAS FROM “Nicole Kidman told me, take care of yourself. And I think it's a very vital part of our art and anyone's life, but in specific, there's a lot of giving that you do as an actor, and I think that you can't really do it fully unless you've taken care of yourself properly. So I think a lot of people struggle with that, and I enjoy taking care of others more than me. And so I've really tried to apply that to my daily life on set or offset.”THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARSTRUCK “I recently did a film with Michelle Williams and Daisy Edgar-Jones, and they were the most inviting people ever, but I sat in the makeup chair in between them and I was like, hi. I really didn't know what to do with myself. I also met Ari Aster and couldn't look him in the eyes.”WHAT I DID WITH MY FIRST HOLLYWOOD PAYCHECK “I bought an old Mercedes. It's the sexiest thing I've ever driven, and I'm obsessed with her, and she's named Charlie.”


	The 29-year-old has been building up her filmography — and her reputation as Hollywood's resident “cool girl” — for several years now, with turns in HBO Max's Generation and A24's Bodies Bodies Bodies. But it was her role as an entertainment executive try-hard on The Studio — where she held her own alongside comedic heavyweights Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Kathryn Hahn — that tipped her into full stardom. “My parents are very achievement-focused, so I always had these delusions of grandeur,” she says with a laugh. “I always thought that if I didn't become an actor, I would be a woman of business or a CEO of something niche, like a company that manufactures plastic parts. I would wear suits and give a firm handshake.” Next, she'll star alongside Olivia Wilde and Charli XCX in Gregg Araki's erotic thriller I Want Your Sex, and she's filming another A24 horror flick before returning to the Continental Studios backlot. “I think it was actually on a THR shoot where Seth just dropped to us that we were doing a season two,” she says. “We were all freaking out about it, and he was like, ‘Oh, I thought you guys all knew [another season] was a given.' ” THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARSTRUCK “I was at the Emmy's the other day and I was in the queue for an interview right behind Ben Stiller and his wife. And so we kind of had to smack right into each other and I was freaking out. I was really mincing my words. He's like, congrats on the studio. And I was like, congrats on amazing life and career. But that was amidst everything that was going on my heart. My BPM was freaking out upon seeing him.”THE MOST HOLLYWOOD THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME IS “Every day on set of The Studio is a real Hollywood moment. You're chilling at [craft services] and Martin Scorsese is also getting a little cup full of carrots and Charlize Theron's looking at the monitor.”THE PERSON I AM DYING TO WORK WITH “I have so many manifestations for season two of The Studio Seth and Evan have talked me through a lot of the plans, so I'm a little reticent to say because I don't want them to slip through our fingers. But I think it would be very fun for fans of Seth and Evan, of which there are many, to see Michael Cera or Jonah Hill.”


	Withers' revelation came during the pandemic. After years of making online videos, the former Florida State football player picked up and moved to Atlanta to pursue a career in acting. From there, he parlayed bit parts in Atlanta and Tell Me Lies into starring roles in this year's tentpoles Him and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Next, Withers will segue from scream king to an adaptation of Colleen Hoover's Reminders of Him, in which he stars opposite Maika Monroe. “That was the scariest one to make,” he says, “because you're living in the soft gentleness of masculinity and showing your emotions.” The romance deals heavily with grief, which is something that the 27-year-old is familiar with. Withers lost his older brother in a 2021 car accident and wanted to explore his own pain head-on. Looking ahead, Withers would love to lean into comedy as well. In the meantime, he says of his breakout year: “Going into these projects, I always feared that I was not the right person for the role, and then I just had to keep reminding myself that I am enough.” 


THE FICTIONAL CHARACTER I IDENTIFY WITH THE MOST “Nemo, from Finding Nemo. I feel like a little fish in a big sea, trying to find my way home, which means getting creative and finding your way to success. It's poetry.” WHAT I DID WITH MY FIRST HOLLYWOOD PAYCHECK “I was living in Atlanta and I got my check and took myself to Olive Garden. Growing up, my mom used to take me there to celebrate for my birthday, and we've have soccer team dinners there. That was luxury. That is luxury.” IF I'M WEARING MY AIRPODS ON SET, I'M PROBABLY LISTENING TO “”The Climb” by Miley Cyrus. She's talking about anxiety, and that calms my anxiety. But it depends on the scene. The song that gets me to a sad place is “Dear April” by Frank Ocean, because I lost my brother in the month of April. And if you need to get crunk, you play Lil' Jon or “Dreams and Nightmares” by Meek Mill.” THE FIRST TIME I WAS STARSTRUCK “I'm shooting shots.

Her performance as the creepily clownish aunt in 'Weapons' has relaunched her career and made her an Oscar frontrunner — not to mention the year's most unlikely Tiktok star.


							By 

	David Canfield


Senior Entertainment Writer


	A woman is sitting alone in the back of a sleepy Malibu café. She's in her mid-70s, with striking blond hair running just past her shoulders, wearing a long-sleeved black crew neck. She has newspaper pages splayed across her table, reading keenly between sips of coffee. The clanging of dirty dishes being gathered in the back kitchen does not bother her. The scene feels routine, set by a regular who prefers a late-afternoon arrival to enjoy the peace of a restaurant resetting itself between prime mealtimes.


	I walk past the woman to set up at a nearby table, in prep for an interview with the actress Amy Madigan. Before I can sit, my phone buzzes with a text from an unfamiliar local number: “I'm sitting inside.” I turn around. The woman is still reading, still undisturbed. But it has to be her. “Amy?” I ask as I backtrack toward her. She smiles warmly. She got here early.

	Madigan has a history of hiding in plain sight. While a whole generation of moviegoers may have only just discovered this, the veteran character actress has made her name, again and again, as a true chameleon. I genuinely didn't recognize Madigan in Weapons, the smash-hit horror film that has thrust her back into the Hollywood spotlight after years of fighting for even small roles, until her name popped up in the end credits. At that moment, I yelped with delight. Such is the Amy Madigan effect: It might take a minute to recognize her — but once you do, her imprint is unmistakable and unforgettable.

	In Weapons, 17 third-grade children go missing in a small Pennsylvania town at the exact same time. The film's final act reveals that one of their classmate's supposed aunts, Gladys (played by Madigan), is actually a witch and behind it all: She's enchanted the kids into transferring their life force onto her, to keep her alive and kicking (or, I guess, killing) amid her deteriorating health. The movie, directed by Barbarian‘s Zach Cregger, has grossed $268 million worldwide since its August release. Madigan's unhinged creation — her smeared clown-like makeup, her forehead-exposing auburn wig, her spunkily menacing fast talk — has evolved into the year's most unexpected social media icon. Last month, Reddit threads sprouted up, dedicated to assembling the perfect Gladys Halloween costume.


	“I'll call her every now and again, and I'll be like, ‘Amy, are you aware of what's going on?' ” says Cregger. “She's like, ‘No! Tell me.' “


	Madigan, 75, is not on social media, but Cregger and others send her the TikToks, the reels, the dances, the memes. “As you very well know, the gay community has really taken to Gladys,” she says to me with pride as I open my notebook. “That's really great — especially in this framework of the demonization of anybody other than a cis person — for the trans community. I think they really appreciate Gladys' drag and makeup and how confident she is. So that's a really nice cherry on top of all this.”


	And how to describe “all this”? Madigan seems bewildered by these past few months, and as she folds up her newspaper and puts it away, tells me that she's nervous even about this conversation. She made her feature debut in 1982; four years later, she was nominated for an Oscar. She went on to play significant roles in everything from '80s classics Field of Dreams and Uncle Buck to the 2000s HBO hit Carnivàle. Somewhere along the way, the offers dried up. “There was a long period of time where she really didn't work at all, or very little,” actor Ed Harris, her husband of 42 years, tells me. “She was considering just stopping and giving up on it.”

	











	“Let's say I'd be in the airport and someone recognized me — they'd go, ‘Oh, are you still acting?' or ‘So what are you doing? Did you give up acting?' ” Madigan says. “Those kinds of questions, just straight out!” Her pitch spikes here, the first time I can spot Gladys' glorious quirks in the Madigan before me — except they're endearing, not terrifying.


	When Weapons came along, it was, above all, Madigan's first juicy part in years. “I was telling everybody, ‘Hey, I'm going to play this really wild lady,' ” she says. “Then it came out, and it turned into something else. It feels very antithetical to the work that I do and how I live my life.”


	***


	Madigan was born and raised on Chicago's South Side. She grew up as a rabid sports fan and a budding cinephile. “The train tracks were right on the corner, and there was one movie theater here, one movie theater there — they were a mile apart, and my brother and I would go every week with a quarter,” she says. “We watched all the black-and-white movies on TV. I saw all these new art films when I was a kid.”


	Still, she didn't pursue that life initially. After attending college in Milwaukee, Madigan moved to Los Angeles in 1974. She did not want to be a “rock star,” as some accounts of her early to mid-20s have it, but her aspiration was to be an alternative musician. She performed “blue-eyed soul, but also esoteric performance-art kinds of things,” she says, alongside friends Fred Bliffert and Jesse Roe. She pushed boundaries: In 1978, she appeared in Playboy nude and covered in jelly to promote their band called Jelly. “One of our hits was, ‘Why not take it out on the children? They're smaller and weaker than you,' ” she says with a laugh. It's unclear if she's describing the song's name or theme or both.

	











	She soon made a “hard pivot” toward her great love: acting. She studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute and got enmeshed in Los Angeles' then-exploding theater scene. She met Harris while they performed onstage together, their first of many collaborations.


	Screen roles soon followed. Read reviews of Madigan's work in the '80s and '90s, and the adjective that comes up most often is somewhere between “fierce” and “ferocious.” Still something of an unknown, she starred opposite the likes of Gene Hackman, Ann-Margret and Ellen Burstyn in 1985's Twice in a Lifetime and blew the roof off the indie family drama as a rageful woman trapped in a bad marriage. She earned its only Oscar nomination, competing against Oprah Winfrey (The Color Purple) and the eventual winner, Anjelica Huston (Prizzi's Honor).


	“I went to Neiman Marcus in my beat-up car and bought a dress for myself. I didn't have a stylist,” she says of her first red carpet Oscar experience. “They got me someone to come over and do hair and makeup, thank God. Ed and I got to dress up. It was fun, and it was nerve-racking.” The awards campaign machine has expanded exponentially since those days. “Did they even have an Academy nominee luncheon back then?” she asks me. They did, but it was only a few years old.


	Madigan didn't exactly skyrocket to stardom from there. She played the female leads opposite Kevin Costner and John Candy, respectively, in two 1989 favorites: Field of Dreams and Uncle Buck. She got along swimmingly with Costner on Dreams and found Buck an ideal vehicle for her penchant for physical comedy. In both movies, she played opposite a then-7-year-old Gaby Hoffmann in her first two film roles. “I loved Amy. I just remember her smile and that I loved when she was around,” Hoffmann tells me. “That's not always true of every adult on a movie set — that they make you feel like that, that they put a smile on your face.”

	











	Those movies are about as broad and mainstream as you'll find in Madigan's filmography, but even there her work is courageously, movingly odd. “She's a chameleon with a very pure essence that is a constant throughout all of her [projects], which is what the best actors can do,” Cregger says. Adds Josh Brolin, Madigan's Weapons co-star: “An interesting actor is an interesting actor — hedge your bets with someone you know is going to deliver. Amy has always delivered appropriately, sometimes in an understated way, and sometimes in extremis.”


	Going into the '90s, Madigan started making even bolder choices simply by taking on risky films. She starred opposite Tilda Swinton in 1996's Female Perversions, a bracing feminist erotic drama that struggled to find funding and that its writer-director, Susan Streitfeld, had struggled to cast. “Every actress was horrified by what we were revealing about what we women do to ourselves,” Streitfeld told The New York Times in 1997. Not Madigan: “It didn't feel like a risk to me,” she says now.


	Nor did Roe v Wade, a lightning-rod of a project that premiered on NBC at the height of the resurgent pro-life movement of the late '80s and early '90s. During production, the 1989 telefilm (co-starring Madigan's longtime friend Holly Hunter) filmed under secret titles so as to avoid protesters — and worse.


	By the time of its launch, advertisers had largely pulled out of the broadcast, which wound up attracting about 17 million people. The film was radioactive, but Madigan, who won a Golden Globe for her steely turn as the novice lawyer who defended “Jane Roe,” was steadfast. “I was very, very proud to make that movie, but it was an intense experience just because of everything swirling around it,” she says. “That's how scared all those [advertisers] were.” She pauses, sighs and calmly raises her voice: “Well, now they're scared again.”

	











	***


	Madigan is a news junkie. She reads three newspapers in print a day: The New York Times, The Washington Post and, solely for its sports section, the Los Angeles Times. These days, she scans her local paper to feed her cross section of baseball fandom that would delight most followers of the sport. She's a diehard for her hometown Chicago White Sox, “who we hope could have a good team at some point,” but she also roots for the Cubs, the Yankees and the Dodgers. Then: “I hate Boston, as we would, and I hate Houston because they're cheaters.” Noted.


	As for what she's reading in the other papers: Recent political developments have put Madigan in an “insular” state of mind. “People have been bullied and they've been pushed into the corner and they are afraid,” she says of the period since Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office. “Everybody is terrified and nobody speaks up.” She's never been afraid to go against the grain: Along with Harris, she famously sat still as a stone at the 1999 Academy Awards while others stood and applauded when the Hollywood blacklist-fueling Elia Kazan received an honorary Oscar. She hasn't changed since. Madigan points out one bit of news that hits a little closer to home, given the studio behind Weapons. “Now, what — Warner Bros. is just going to be sold now?” she says, referring to reports that it is exploring interest from the likes of Paramount Skydance and Netflix. “It's awful. It's like it's three entities: You're dealing with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and — well, somebody else.” She trails off. “Zuckerberg?” I ask. She nods with authority. “Zuckerberg! All those guys, man. They're all just bending the knee.”

	











	I'm learning it's best to stay out of the way when Madigan gets on a roll. She says what's on her mind; she's funny, smart and direct — in a way that's anathema to most of today's actors minding their social media presence.


	We move on to AI. “Listen, if they could get rid of actors, they would do it. And Tilly whatever the fuck her name is — I'm sorry, Tilly. But she's not real, so I don't have to apologize!” Madigan says of the controversial “AI actress” named Tilly Norwood. “That's just going to keep coming and coming and coming. But Tilly can't put makeup on me and do special effects and create something. They can't come up with an original idea.”


	I start thinking back to that word that kept coming up in my research of Madigan's early screen work: ferocious. It's equally evident in person, however many decades later — she expresses herself with a commanding, witty force. Her musings are also sadly relevant to why her career started slowing down. If Madigan established herself by making fearless choices in fearless projects, she had little room to maneuver once the industry stopped supporting that niche. American indies like Twice in a Lifetime and Female Perversions are in deep peril. Hollywood has become petrified of anything close to polemical.


	Despite some promising gigs, Madigan couldn't find her footing in the burgeoning world of prestige TV, either. “I understand that I'm not the leading lady — I'm a character actor, and I like doing things with my body,” she says. “Maybe that was confusing to people, or what they were looking for was not me. I don't really exude ‘the city D.A.' ”

	











	She's managed great work where she could find it. Madigan is terrific in a small role in Ben Affleck's Gone Baby Gone, and Harris cast her as Peggy Guggenheim in his Oscar vehicle Pollock. “I had a lot of pressure on me, and I wasn't always the most gracious director,” Harris says with a laugh. “She showed up on set one day, just appalled at how I was behaving. … But it turned out OK. She did a great job as Peggy.” Otherwise, forget offers — she was barely getting auditions. “That wasn't really asked of me,” she says. “Maybe some of those [casting] people were like, ‘Wait, is she still doing this?' ” Madigan admits to having some “depressive” days until recently. “It's not a very nice business,” she says. “It's not easy when you had more opportunities, and then they get less and less and less. … I used to be more confident when I was younger. I'm not as confident now.”


	She told Harris at one point, “I feel like people have retired me.” He responded: “Just wait. Something is going to come your way that's going to get you everything that you need.” He recalls to me now, “I was trying to be supportive of her and trying to be a friend, good husband, lover, et cetera.” But he was onto something.


	***


	There was a lot of pressure on Cregger when it came to Weapons. His solo debut, Barbarian, made more than $45 million on a budget of less than $5 million, and now Warners was entrusting the actor turned director with a movie costing eight times that. Even in the script, Gladys was the key to bringing the whole strange mystery together: “If that character doesn't work, this movie doesn't work,” he says. Cregger wrote out a long list of potential names with his casting director; someone suggested Meryl Streep. “I was like, ‘She's a wonderful actor, but that would dominate the movie.' ”

	











	When Cregger got to Madigan, it all clicked. He first saw her in Field of Dreams and stayed a fan ever since. “Whenever she was onscreen, I was kind of dazzled — and I never really got why she wasn't all over the place,” Cregger says. “So when her name came up, there was no downside. I was like, ‘She can do it. She's amazing. She just fits right in.' ” They met at a Malibu café — no, not the same one Madigan invited me to — and bonded quickly. Months went by before she was cast. “Zach wasn't sure if the powers that be wanted somebody with a bigger name,” Harris says. “Amy was really patient. She really wanted to play this character.”


	Madigan finally secured the part. Then Cregger kind of left her alone, confident their dynamic would function best if he didn't know too much about how she would approach Gladys. When she showed up for her first full camera test in makeup and wardrobe, “Dude, I was crying,” Cregger says. “I was honestly crying.” The first time Brolin saw her in character, he got emotional, too: “It reminded me of a time when actors truly experimented and went for it with no ego or cosmetic concerns. She is of that echelon.”


	What's perhaps most remarkable about Madigan's tour de force in Weapons is that it's utterly reflective of her earliest years in the industry, when she crafted singular characters in all kinds and scales of projects. She goes big and silly and scary and heartbreaking, all at once.

	











	“It says everything about casting the right actors, actors who are going to fill roles interestingly no matter where they are on their personal trajectory,” says Brolin. Weapons serves as not just an overdue reminder, but a galvanizing reintroduction to a generational actor, wrongly cast aside — as still happens all too often to women in Hollywood, once they cross a certain age threshold. And Madigan's embodiment of Gladys is not only vibrant, but popular. Cregger now says he's even officially working on a Gladys prequel movie. Madigan tells me she'd be all in but, true to form, she's reluctant to get too excited: “I'd love to live inside Zach's brain again, but we'll see if that happens.”


	She's “shocked” by the love that's swept the internet. “I've been doing this a long time and I am who I am now at this stage of my life,” she says. She's learning to enjoy the ride and starting to hear about more exciting acting prospects to come. “She's been offered a couple of things already that she's said no [to], that she just didn't want to do,” Harris says. “She has always been really selective, not that she's had that much to choose from. I hope that she gets some great opportunities in the future.” Madigan sounds optimistic: “People have already reached out, like, ‘Here it is, we want you,' in various forms. That's different in a way that feels new.”


	The same goes for the Oscar buzz around Madigan's Weapons performance. As with Twice in a Lifetime, she could well be the sole representative for her movie — and she's uneasy with how big it all feels. “You see how I look when I go out — I look how I look!” she says, cackling as she gestures to her makeup-free face. “I've got a little tinted sunblock on, and that'll do it.” Indeed, despite the apparatus around Weapons, it's not hard to imagine Madigan navigating her second Oscar go-round as she did her first. She arrived at the Weapons premiere without a cadre of representatives in tow (unusual) and brought a bag up to the stage when she was called with the rest of the cast (also unusual). She is freely herself, unfiltered and vulnerable even with a reporter she's only known for a few hours.

	











	Just down the road, she and Harris are leasing a temporary home. Madigan gets teary recalling how, in January, they lost their house in the Pacific Palisades fire. “We got burned out,” she says, choking up. “Excuse me. It's still very close.” This followed decades of close calls. During the 1993 Topanga Canyon fire, neighbor Sean Penn lost his home, and Madigan remembers the harrowing evacuation with her then 9-year-old, Lily. “I got a lifeguard to drive us to the Pali High gym,” she says. “We survived a number of fires, but not this one.” But they remain resilient: They're in the process of rebuilding on their old lot, which will take years. All told, they've lived in the area since 1981 and aren't going anywhere.


	It's a decent metaphor for Madigan's career — she never abandoned this industry, either. When we're not talking through her “psychological ups and downs,” as she wryly puts it, we often circle back to a shared love of movies. That's where Madigan has always found drive, passion and inspiration — even when the parts weren't there.


	She expresses an unabashed love for Paul Thomas Anderson, Ari Aster and Hamnet star Jessie Buckley. (“I don't know her. I've just seen her work. She's incredible. I saw her play Juliet when she was younger, and I was like, ‘Oh, wow, who is this?' “) She fears big money and AI advancements further curbing the cinema she treasures most. She hopes to work with more female directors, having observed Maggie Gyllenhaal in total command in Greece while helming The Lost Daughter, in which Harris co-starred. (“You're with her and you're like, ‘God, do I know anything?' … It's very inspiring!”)

	











	She also looks back in awe at having acted with the likes of James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster in Field of Dreams. “I got to work with some really cool people — I hope that doesn't change,” she says. “And maybe at some point, someone will say, ‘Oh yeah, I got to work with Amy Madigan.' “

ESPN's partner Penn will rebrand the online sportsbook as theScore Bet.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Amid a massive NBA gambling scandal, ESPN, one of the league's top partners, is exiting its own betting arrangement.


	On Thursday, Penn Entertainment and ESPN announced the early termination of U.S. online sports book ESPN Bet, effective Dec. 1, 2025. ESPN is pulling its name and marketing power from the partnership; ESPN Bet will be rebranded theScore Bet.




	Under the original agreement, ESPN provided Penn with its name and trademark, as well as media and marketing services in exchange for $150 million a year in cash payments and warrants to purchase Penn common stock. (It was the same deal that sold Barstool Sports back to Dave Portnoy.) The deal, first struck in August 2023, had a 10-year term. It included a clause that would allow either party to terminate after year three “if specific market share performance thresholds were not met.” We didn't quite make it through year three.

	No one here is uttering the letters N-B-A. Jimmy Pitaro, the chairman of ESPN, said in a statement that his company is “now pursuing other media and marketing opportunities within this space.” (That new deal, which was unveiled shortly after the Penn exit, was a pact for DraftKings to power the betting tab within the new ESPN app starting Dec. 1. The standalone ESPN Bet app is still going away under the new agreement.)

	“When we first announced our partnership with ESPN, both sides made it clear that we expected to compete for a podium position in the space,” said Jay Snowden, CEO and president of Penn Entertainment. “Although we made significant progress in improving our product offering and building a cohesive ecosystem with ESPN, we have mutually and amicably agreed to wind down our collaboration.  We plan to refocus our digital strategy on our growing iCasino business, while continuing to capitalize on our omnichannel advantage as the nation's leading regional retail casino operator.”


	Snowden continued, “Looking ahead, we plan to rebrand our OSB offering in the U.S. to theScore Bet, with a target date of December 1, 2025 to coincide with the expected launch of sports betting in Missouri, subject to regulatory approvals. We currently operate theScore Bet brand in Ontario, and our OSB product across both the U.S. and Canada will now leverage connectivity with the theScore media app, which has approximately 4 million monthly active users across North America. Our OSB offerings will continue to provide a top of funnel cross-sell opportunity for our Hollywood-branded iCasino, which will remain integrated into our OSB product offering in states where legal, in addition to serving as a standalone iCasino app.” 


	Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN, said, “Together, ESPN and Penn created a truly unique offering with unparalleled integrations across our various media assets. ESPN drove over 2.9 million new users into the Penn ecosystem, with a strong uptick in first time bettors this fall. We appreciate the collaboration we had with Penn and are now pursuing other media and marketing opportunities within this space.”

	











	ESPN found itself in a tough spot when, last month, the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office arrested current NBA player Terry Rozier, former player Damon Jones and former player and current Portland Trailblazers head coach Chauncey Billups in a recent federal probe into illegal sports betting and rigged poker games. ESPN covered the NBA scandal while paying the league billions of dollars for media rights, and all the while the ESPN Bet chyron populated the lower-third of the screen. It was weird, and now it's a little less weird.


	ESPN is owned by Disney, which also owns the ABC broadcast network, the home to the NBA Finals.

Columbus is on board to also direct the new sequel to the Warner Bros. 1984 classic, which the studio dated on Thursday for a 2027 release.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are learning why you don't get a Mogwai wet.


	The directing duo behind this summer's horror hit Final Destination: Bloodlines have teamed up with Chris Columbus to write the new feature installment of Gremlins, Warner Bros.' horror comedy franchise featuring little mischievous monsters, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.




	The development occurs as the feature project moves full steam ahead at Warners, with the studio announcing Thursday on an earnings call that it is dating the movie for Nov. 19, 2027.

	Kristie Macosko Krieger and Holly Bario of Amblin Entertainment are producing the project, as are Columbus, Michael Barnathan and Mark Radcliffe via their banner, 26th Street Pictures. Steven Spielberg returns to executive produce.


	Lipovsky and Stein are working with Columbus as a writing team. Columbus wrote the 1984 original (but sat out the 1990 sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch) and is slated to direct this new installment. A script by Columbus has been in development since at least 2017 — Toby Halbrooks and Carl Ellsworth wrote previous drafts — and the boarding of Lipovsky and Stein, who are very much in demand around Hollywood thanks to Bloodlines, is an electric charge for the project.


	In talking about his to return to Gremlins, Columbus said to The Hollywood Reporter, “I'm filled with a tremendous surge of inspiration and passion, as I embark on this cinematic journey. It's an honor to reunite with Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros., as we bring this latest chapter of Gremlins to a brand new generation of moviegoers who will experience all of the thrills of this grand adventure on the big screen”

	











	“Few titles are as beloved and iconic as Gremlins, and we're beyond excited to bring it back for both lifelong fans and a whole new generation,” said Jesse Ehrman, Warners' president of development and production. “It's a privilege to be working alongside Steven (Spielberg), Chris (Columbus), and the entire creative team, and we look forward to audiences experiencing the magic, mayhem, and heart of Gremlins on the big screen in 2027.”


	With Bloodlines, Lipovsky and Stein reinvigorated a moribund Warners title, helming the first Final Destination movie in about 14 years. The movie, released in May, grossed $315.0 million worldwide on a budget of around $50 million, becoming not only the highest-grossing entry in the franchise but also the best-reviewed. The duo are known for their directing work, but the opportunity to work as writers on a movie series that was a childhood favorite to them both, and to work with Columbus, who also wrote 1980s classic The Goonies and directed Home Alone, was too good to pass up. Lipovsky and Stein have yet to pick their next directorial outing but are being heavily courted by studios.


	The original Gremlins, directed by Joe Dante, told of a young man who receives a unique cute and furry creature as a present from his father and who names it Gizmo. The pet comes with three rules: keep it away from light, don't let it come in contact with water, and don't feed it after midnight. Of course, all those rules are broken and soon, all hell breaks loose in the hero's small town, as not only new Mogwais appear, led by the nasty-tempered Stripe, but they then turn into reptilian killers as well.

	











	The movie was released the same weekend as Ghostbusters, with both becoming hits and making their mark on 1980s pop culture. Dante came back for the sequel, but Columbus did not.


	The franchise and IP went into a cocoon for decades, but talk of an eventual third movie would pop up intermittently. In 2023, HBO Max released the animated series Gremlins: The Wild Batch. Dante was involved with the series and, last year, as the second season launched, he commented on the prospects of a third movie.


	“That's up to the audience,” he told THR about the chances of a third film. “The fact is that it's too big a property for somebody not to make something. But it's been difficult for people to wrap their heads around, ‘Exactly how are we going to do this?'”


	Looks like Lipovsky and Stein, as well as Columbus and Warners, may have found an answer.


	Lipovsky and Stein are repped by Verve, Ground Control and Lichter Grossman.

The collab marks Biza's first ""BZRP Music Session"" in 10 months.


													By
												

	Jessica Roiz


Assistant Editor, Latin


	Ten months after unleashing his last of many star-studded music sessions, Bizarrap returns with Daddy Yankee in tow for a new “BZRP Music Session.” 


	Titled “BZRP Music Sessions #0/66”— which can easily be interpreted as the first of 66 brand new sessions — the collaboration between the Argentine hitmaker and Puerto Rican global star was announced Tuesday (Nov. 4) on social media just hours before it officially dropped on Wednesday.


	In the nearly three-minute-long track, DY returns to his roots spitting bars and rhymes over a reggaetón drum. The electric beat speeds up at some points for that rhythmic DY approach, reminiscent of previous hits, including “Llamada de Emergencia.” In the Biza-produced session, he sings about that positive essence that's guiding his latest projects. 

	











	“If you ask me, I owe nothing to anyone,” DY sings. “When I leave here, I won't take anything with me, I will just leave [feeling] true love, my feet on the ground, always looking up at the sky.” 




	“BZRP Music Sessions #0/66” marks Biza's comeback after releasing “BZRP Music Sessions #61” alongside Billboard's former Latin Artist on the Rise Luck Ra last December.


	The collaboration also comes just weeks after Daddy Yankee's Superstar Q&A panel at Billboard Latin Music Week 2025, where he sat with Billboard's Leila Cobo for a one-hour-long conversation about his personal and professional rebirth after his conversion to Christianity. 


	“I feel reborn, reenergized, and truly joyful with everything I'm experiencing,” he said then. “The personal, spiritual, and faith-based change certainly feels good in my heart. Each person has a different purpose and design. Everyone has a purpose to fulfill in their lives, and mine was this path: to forefront popular culture, announcing the Kingdom — that's a challenge. My father is so strategic that he's calling many people.”

Universal Music Publishing Group, which owns Dylan's song catalog, says it has a ""longstanding policy"" of keeping his compositions out of political projects. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Bob Dylan's “The Times They Are A-Changin'” scored New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's final advertisement before his election night victory — but the campaign spot has now been removed from X amid a licensing rejection from Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG).


	The ad, posted by Mamdani's various social media accounts just before polls closed on Tuesday (Nov. 4), featured the caption “New York is a-changin'” and a montage of scenes from the 34-year-old progressive's campaign set to Dylan's famous protest song. Mamdani was declared the winner of the race Tuesday night, beating former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.


	But as first reported by the New York Times, the ad has since been taken down from X and replaced by a notice reading, “This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.” The video is still available on Instagram and TikTok. 


	It was not immediately clear who requested that the video be taken down from the social media platform, but a source familiar with the situation tells Billboard that UMPG, which has owned Dylan's publishing catalog since 2020, previously denied a request from Mamdani's campaign to license the composition.


	Reached for comment on the matter on Wednesday (Nov. 5), a spokesperson for UMPG said, “As a longstanding policy, we do not license Bob Dylan compositions for projects involving political figures.”


	The Mamdani campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. A rep for Sony Music, which owns Dylan's master recordings, declined to comment. Representatives from Instagram owner Meta and TikTok did not immediately respond to questions about whether the platforms also received takedown notices for the ad.


	While individual social media users are free to soundtrack their videos with songs covered by blanket licenses, advertisements must get clearance from copyright owners via a so-called sync license.


	Failure to get a sync license for a political video creates potential legal liability, as Billboard has recently reported in the wake of President Donald Trump's administration posting TikTok videos featuring Taylor Swift's No. 1 single “The Fate of Ophelia” and Zach Bryan's track “Revival.”

Lionsgate has released the first trailer for Michael, the upcoming biopic charting the story of The King of Pop, Michael Jackson.


	Jackson is played by his nephew, Jaafar Jackson, and Antoine Fuqua directs. The trailer features the famed singer in the studio with Quincy Jones (played by Kendrick Sampson). Songs featured include “Thriller” and “Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.”


	The synopsis reads: Michael tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.

	











	The pic also stars Miles Teller as Jackson's attorney and adviser John Branca, Colman Domingo as his father Joe Jackson, Nia Long as his mother Katherine Jackson, Jessica Sula as his sister LaToya Jackson, Larenz Tate as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, Laura Harrier as pioneering music executive Suzanne de Passe and Kat Graham as Diana Ross.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The biopic is set to be released in theaters on April 24. There has been plenty of speculation about its release and delays, including reporting that the movie would be split in two, but no update on that today. It's not clear from the synopsis whether the film will touch on any of the controversies that met the superstar later in life.

	











	John Logan wrote the script. Branca, Graham King and John McClain serve as producers. David B. Householter serves as executive producer. The trailer will run in theaters from next week ahead of the new Now You See Me film.

Will they depict the secret meeting he had with Howard Stern with his nose melting?

I mean… looks good, amazing music… but, you know… you know.

Full frontal?

Miles Teller – long hair?

This should've been a Paul Schrader movie.

This should've been a Pauly Shore movie.

This should have been a true crime documentary.

Keeping up with Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner.

The actor hinted at the major next steps his and his girlfriend's ultra-private relationship will take in a cover interview with Vogue, published Thursday.

The “Wonka” star did not divulge much about his romance with the “Kardashians” star, whom he's been dating since early 2023 — not out of “any fear,” he clarified, but because he doesn't “have anything to say.”

However, Chalamet hinted that starting a family could be in the cards, teasing that this milestone “could be on the radar.”

Advertisement

He mentioned recently watching a video in which someone was “bragging about not having kids and how much time it afforded them to do other stuff” — a mindset he considered “bleak.”

The Oscar nominee went on to acknowledge the “new stage of life” he is in as his friends mark major milestones.

“Zendaya is engaged. Anya [Taylor-Joy] is married,” he said of two of his “Dune” co-stars.

Page Six has reached out to Jenner's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Chalamet, 29, and Jenner, 28, first sparked romance rumors in 2023 when the latter's Range Rover was seen outside the Golden Globe nominee's Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion.

That September, the pair shocked fans when they were seen making out at one of Beyoncé's “Renaissance” tour stops in Los Angeles.

Later that month, the Oscar nominee and the beauty guru got touchy-feely at the US Open.

Jenner accompanied Chalamet to the Golden Globes in January 2024, where they shared several kisses during a commercial break, and she has since supported her beau at many awards ceremonies.

In August, reports surfaced that the duo hadn't seen each other in “weeks,” sparking breakup rumors.

Jenner and the “A Complete Unknown” star proved they are still going strong by grabbing coffee together in Hungary.

Last month, they made back-to-back outings for the New York Film Festival premiere of Chalamet's forthcoming movie, “Marty Supreme,” and a New York Yankees game.

Jenner shares daughter Stormi, 7, and son Aire, 3, with ex Travis Scott.

Defying an assumption we would have made with some confidence at pretty much any point between, like, 1998 and today, the American entertainment industry has apparently pushed Snoop Dogg's ability to self-promotionally appear in things to its limit. Admittedly, it took the confluence of the planet's biggest ice-based sporting event and its largest party holiday to do it, as Mr. Dogg reported today that he will be canceling his planned live NBC New Year's special, Snoop Dogg's New Year's Eve, in favor of focusing more of his energies on the Winter Olympics.

This is per Deadline, reporting on a statement from the rapper/professional appearer-in-things, who said that “Sometimes the calendar gets in the way of the celebration, which is why my NBC family and I decided this winter was time for us all to focus on the Olympics. But don't worry, we'll party together bigger and better later in 2026. Ya dig.”

Ya dig indeed, as NBC has clearly decided that getting Snoop's energy on hand for the Winter Games—after he was a breakout hit at the network's very expensive Paris coverage back in 2024—will be key to making next year's Winter Olympics pop. (The Games are scheduled to take up most of next February, and are set for Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy; apparently, when Snoop Dogg puts on a New Year's Eve party, he does so in such a way that it makes him unavailable for luge commentary duties for at least a month.)

The question now is what NBC will put on in the event's place, or whether it'll worry about it at all. (There's not enough time to organize a whole new New Year's event, apparently, although we've done some pretty bold things in less time with a couple of lovingly burnt mix CDs, and a cocktail best described as “Anything sold on the bottom shelf of the liquor store that happens to be blue.”) The network has been inconsistent about handling the holiday, in recent years to the point that it just ran a football game last year, since New Year's fell on Sunday anyway; in previous years, it tapped Miley Cyrus to handle its competition for ABC's regular Ryan Seacrest-focused offerings.

Guns N' Roses continues to be the rock band that keeps on giving (opportunities for its members to appear in court), as a former manager for the band has now sued it over claims that he's been blocked from releasing a memoir about his time in the Axl Rose trenches. Specifically, Billboard reports that Alan Niven—who managed the group during six of the most pivotal years of its multi-decade run, including the period when 1987's Appetite For Destruction saw them shoot up into international renown—is suing Guns N' Roses, claiming that a non-disclosure settlement he signed while getting fired in 1991 doesn't hold legal weight.

That's relevant in so far as Niven (who also managed Great White from 1982 through 1985) has written a new book, Sound N' Fury: Rock N' Roll Stories, which is currently languishin' in' warehouses over threats of legal action' from the band. (“Thousands of copies of Sound N' Fury have been printed and continue to incur storage expenses,” according to legal documents.) While Niven admits he signed an agreement not to talk about Guns N' Roses when he departed in 1991—after Rose reportedly refused to release Use Your Illusion until Niven was fired—he says the agreement is null for multiple reasons. For one, Rose himself has talked at least a bit of shit about Niven over the years, opening up room for the manager to rebut; more importantly, Niven claims that while most of the band's members signed the termination agreement, Axl didn't, which, yes, is extremely easy to imagine of 1990s-era Axl Rose.

Niven is clearly harboring his own negative feelings about all this—his legal filing include allegations that he was “betrayed” by the band—but basically just wants a judge to say it's okay for him to release his book. (Among other things, his lawyers claim it's not clear who's actually trying to stop the release from the GNR camp, asserting, “It is unclear who is attempting to enforce the agreement now, and whether they have standing to do so.”) The band itself—currently on the tail end of a tour featuring Rose, Slash, and Duff McKagan, among others—hasn't responded to Niven's lawsuit as of yet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The MPA is pretty pissed about Instagram using ""PG-13"" to describe its teen accounts","https://www.avclub.com/mpa-cease-and-desist-letter-instagram-pg-13","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 03:24:00 GMT","

In the sort of legal action that makes us want to cry into our Kleenex while xeroxing Photoshopped pictures of our Jet Skis, the Motion Picture Association has made it clear that it is not happy that Meta and Instagram have been using the term “PG-13” to refer to its upcoming guidelines for teen users. PG-13 is, after all, a trademark of the group (formerly billed as the MPAA, now sans final A), which puts a lot of work into ensuring that a “PG-13 movie” is what it says it is, not some more generic understanding of teen-appropriate content.

Specifically, the group has now (per Variety) issued a cease and desist order to Meta, ordering that it stop using “PG-13” as a way to describe its new teen-focused accounts. “The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public's trust in its rating system,” the letter, sent late in October, asserts. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta's automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA's rating system.”

The issue here points back to a Meta Blog post from mid-October, when the company explicitly used the MPA's rating structure as a benchmark for what would, and would not, be allowed on its newly deployed teen accounts. “Teens will see content on Instagram that's similar to what they'd see in a PG-13 movie,” the blog's writer asserted, apparently not cluing in to the idea that the whole concept of “PG-13” remains owned by a non-profit corporation that's extremely vigorous in pursuing and protecting its trademarks.

Among other things, the MPA sounds pissed that its own rating and curation work might end up getting smooshed together in the public consciousness with what Meta's doing, work that is likely to rely heavily on automation. “Meta's attempts to restrict teen content literally cannot be ‘guided by' or ‘aligned with' the MPA's PG-13 movie rating because Meta does not follow [the MPA's] curated process,” the letter notes. “Instead, Meta's content restrictions appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence or other automated technology measures.”

For its part, Meta has popped back with the response that typically crops up in these sorts of conversations about how trademarked materials get genericized, i.e., that obviously it wasn't trying to claim that content would actually be PG-13-rated, and that it's just a shorthand for a set of restrictions that most Americans are fairly familiar with. (Noting that it used “publicly available PG-13 standards” to set the new guidelines.) None of which seems likely to mollify the MPA, which knows better than most that you have to nip these kinds of things in the bud, lest you find yourself having to take an aspirin after weeping too hard into your Jell-O over having your trademark get genericized out from under you.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix's Death By Lightning is rife with tonal whiplash","https://www.avclub.com/death-by-lightning-review-netflix-tv","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 09:01:00 GMT","

Pop quiz: Can you name the six men who held the highest office in the land after Abraham Lincoln? Unless you're an armchair historian, this is probably a stumper. There's a reason why academics dubbed this dirty half dozen the “forgotten presidents.” Three were pretty ineffectual, one was mired in corruption, one never wanted to be president at all, and one died only six months into his term.

That last mention, James Garfield, is at the center of Netflix's Death By Lightning, sharing the spotlight with his unhinged assassin, Charles Guiteau. Mike Makowsky's limited series, based on Candice Millard's Destiny Of The Republic: A Tale Of Madness, Medicine And The Murder Of A President, chronicles two tumultuous years in U.S. politics. It's a whopper of a tale that involves, among other things, political infighting, a radical free-love commune, quack doctors, a vengeful mistress, midnight kidnappings, and the invention of the metal detector.

On paper, this all sounds like rich material for a small-screen drama. The thing is, there's so much material that Death By Lightning can't decide what to focus on, so it opts for packing as much as possible into its scant four episodes. The result is a meandering saga rife with tonal whiplash. Is it a psychological portrait of a madman? A Conclave-esque political thriller? A gentle family drama? A four-hour Drunk History segment? Yes to all. Thankfully, the series is salvaged by its talented cast, led by Michael Shannon and Matthew Macfadyen.

Our story kicks off in 1880, when Garfield (Shannon), a mild-mannered family man and Civil War hero, heads to the Republican National Convention to decide who will be the GOP's next presidential candidate. The vote is initially split between James Blaine (Bradley Whitford) and incumbent Ulysses S. Grant (Wayne Brett), but the contest takes a surprise turn after Garfield gives an impassioned speech about the future of the party. Before long, he finds himself at the top of the ticket. And though he easily earns the love of the American people, he stokes the ire of Roscoe Conkling (Shea Whigham), whose ice-cold devotion to the political machine is a stark contrast to Garfield's essential goodness. While Conkling uses his influence to secure the vice presidency for his hard-drinking crony Chester Arthur (Nick Offerman), Garfield finds an ally in Blaine, whom he names secretary of state. 

Garfield also earns a zealous superfan in Guiteau (Macfadyen), a mentally ill grifter who's determined to worm his way into the president's inner circle. Since D.C. security was hilariously lax back in the day, it's all too easy for this weirdo to accost Garfield and the members of his camp, whether he's crashing the inaugural ball or pleading his case to Arthur as the sloshed veep pukes his guts out in a bathroom stall. 

Death By Lightning isn't interested in nuance. The show portrays Garfield as a person of pure righteousness. (Take a shot every time his wife, Betty Gilpin's Crete, assures him that he's “a good man.”) Conkling, meanwhile, is a mustache-twirling villain, grinning like the Joker as he schemes, strong-arms, and revels in the president's misfortune. Yes, Garfield was a progressive social reformer far ahead of his time, and political history is full of morally bankrupt men like Conkling. But it's hard to be invested in characters who are so black-and-white. More nuance is reserved for Guiteau, but we find out so little about him that he's ultimately a cipher.   



Macfadyen sure makes us wonder, though. You can hear the time bomb ticking down every time he elbows his way into a scene, his charm all too quickly giving way to wild-eyed fervor. His sweaty desperation makes us understand why everyone keeps letting him off the hook. How could a guy this ridiculous pose a real threat? The actor delivers an unsettling portrayal of a man led by his delusions of grandeur.

Shannon does what he can with Garfield, but playing a paragon is a thankless job. Still, he brings a quiet magnetism to the twentieth president. (If you saw him speak at the RNC, you'd likely vote for him, too). His earnest commitment to reform makes the tragedy of his death hit home—and make viewers wonder what could have been if he'd gotten to serve his full term. 

As Arthur, Offerman answers the question: What if Ron Swanson was a dickhead? Like Pawnee's iconic parks director, Arthur giggles like a little kid, loves whiskey, and would rather gorge himself on red meat than run the government. He's so lovable that it's easy to forget he's kind of a monster.

The most compelling performance in Death By Lightning comes from the always surprising Gilpin (fresh off tackling a very different first lady in Broadway's Oh, Mary!). Crete is Garfield's shrewd protector, whether he's getting played by Conkling or submitting to the barbaric treatment of the White House doctor (portrayed by Željko Ivanek). When a grief-stricken Crete visits Guiteau the night before his execution, Gilpin delivers a ferocious monologue that's topped off, the next morning, by Guiteau's ignominious hanging. Unfortunately, all that work is undone by a saccharine epilogue.

And therein lies the show's central problem: Like America in the aftermath of the Civil War, Death By Lightning doesn't know what it wants to be. If the first episode's opening text (“This is a story about two men the world forgot”) is anything to go by, Makowsky aims to explore the unlikely parallels between Garfield and Guiteau. But ultimately, the show feels like a chronicle of a bunch of stuff that happened. It may as well have been called A Series Of Unfortunate Events.

Death by Lightning premieres November 6 on Netflix

Halloween just ended, and you know what that means: Time to roll out the Christmas trailers. (Seriously, what happened to poor, neglected Thanksgiving?) At least this particular one seems pretty cute. Michael Showalter‘s Oh. What. Fun. centers on Claire Clauster (Michelle Pfeiffer), the overworked and underappreciated mother to a huge gaggle of children and in-laws that somehow seems to keep growing throughout the clip. (Her brood includes Chloë Grace Moretz, Maude Apatow, Dominic Sessa, and Jason Schwartzman, among others.) The lead-up to Christmas is progressing in the typical fashion (i.e. Claire is doing absolutely everything) when a miscommunication on the way to a dance show results in her being left behind, Kevin McCallister style.

Of course, being left home alone is less of a big deal when you're a grown woman, but it feels like a betrayal to Claire nonetheless. She decides to pick up and drive off to enter something called the “Holiday mom contest,” hosted by Eva Longoria (as the delightfully-named talk show host Zazzy Tims), leaving her family behind to fend for themselves.



Oh. What. Fun. seems to take the concept laid out in the Saturday Night Live sketch where Kristen Wiig only gets a robe for Christmas and dial it up to 11. And by 11, we mean televised revenge dancing and Denis Leary literally calling the police because his wife “got in her car, with luggage, and drove away,” as an incredulous officer questions at his door. If the rest of the family had just helped to deck literally one hall, they probably wouldn't be in this situation.

Oh. What. Fun. premieres December 3 on Prime Video. Maybe make a note of that so your mom doesn't have to do it herself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Johnny Depp Has 3-Word Response to ‘Pirates' Return Rumors","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/johnny-depp-pirates-return-rumors/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 17:05:25 GMT","

While it's been nearly a decade since Johnny Depp portrayed the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise, during the Los Angeles premiere of his new film, “Modi: Three Days On The Wing Of Madness” on Tuesday, November 4, he revealed that he's not entirely ruling out a sixth “Pirates” film.

“That'd be fun,” Depp, 62, told Entertainment Tonight when asked about a potential return to the Disney franchise. 

Depp did not expand on his reaction, but the “Edward Scissorhands” star is one of only three characters who appeared in all five of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films. (Geoffrey Rush played Captain Hector Barbossa and Kevin McNally played Joshamee Gibbs throughout the franchise).

Jerry Bruckheimer — the producer of the iconic franchise — previously revealed his thoughts on bringing Depp back for a sixth film. 

“If he likes the way the part's written, I think he would do it,” Bruckheimer told Entertainment Weekly in August. “It's all about what's on the page, as we all know… We are still working on a screenplay. We want to make it. We just got to get the right screenplay. We haven't quite gotten there yet, but we're close.”

Depp was the lead in all five of the “Pirates” films, beginning with 2003's “The Curse of the Black Pearl.”

Depp's last Hollywood studio movie was 2018's “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”

He's currently resurrecting his career, starting with the film “Modi: Three Days On The Wing Of Madness, which he directed. 

“It was something that Al [Pacino] was going to do a long, long time ago. He was going to make this film,” Depp told Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday. “And then time passes. So he called me, and he said, ‘John, I think you should direct this film.'”

After some hesitation, he agreed to give it a try, joking that he was happy not to have to deal with himself as a cast member. 

His next career move will be starring as Ebenezer Scrooge in the upcoming movie “Ebenezer: A Christmas Carol,” a darker take on the classic holiday tale. 

Depp called the 1951 film by Alastair Sim “perfection,” adding, “It's one of my favorite films of all time.”

“A lot of people have gone into that world of Dickens, but I'm really, sort of, interested in finding a different angle on Scrooge,” he said of his portrayal.

Television personality Maury Povich has vulnerably discussed a personal difficulty he and his wife Connie Chung had to contend with earlier in their marriage. The former talk show host opened up about the fertility problems that prevented them from having any biological children but was full of praise for the adoption system and shared the love he has for his adopted son. 

Povich was incredibly honest when talking about the personal issue while appearing on an episode of Bunny XO's “Dumb Blonde Podcast” on November 2. In the podcast, the retired broadcaster revealed that he and Chung were unable to fall pregnant naturally.

“We tried to get pregnant,” Maury explained. “This is over 30 years ago. Connie had to take time off from CBS, and it became a big story that we were trying to get pregnant.”

With both Maury and Connie—who tied the knot in 1984—being public figures, their experience became a hot topic.

Povich and Chung married in 1984 and were both public figures. Povich launched his tabloid talk show “Maury” in 1991 and Chung was a respected journalist and news anchor who had worked for CBS, CNN, and MSNBC throughout her career. This meant that their personal life and fertility difficulties were often the subject of scrutiny — something they each found difficult.

“Late show guys, you know, Jay Leno and everybody was making fun, ‘I wonder if Maury and Connie are doing it tonight,'” the 86-year-old lamented. “Fox had this great show called In Living Color. They did a skit on Connie and I in bed trying to get pregnant and Jim Carrey played me.”

He continued, “There was all kinds of press and all kinds of stuff, so we finally adopted because we couldn't do it. It's tough.”

On the topic of adoption, Povich was gushing in praise of the process, which provides needy children with a home and gives families the chance to have children when they might otherwise not have the opportunity. The pair adopted their son, the now 30-year-old Matthew Povich.

“I'm a big fan of adoption,” he says. “He's just spectacular. He's now 30. He's engaged. He and his girlfriend have been together for like nine or ten years.”

Povich has often been candid about his personal life. Earlier this year, he detailed how he was financially broke before he found television success.

“I was dead broke at 44. I mean, really dead broke,” Povich told former Canadian hockey player Sean Avery during an episode of his “On Par” podcast. “At 44, I had just come back — how about this. Starting out in Washington, D.C., where I was a kind of a minor celebrity, trying to say, ‘Can I make it somewhere else?' And I worked in five cities in the next seven years, kind of like an itinerant hockey player, right? Bouncing around all over.”

 “A couple of years later, this wild, crazy Australian [Rupert Murdoch] buys the television stations. And in a second, I'm off to New York to do this crazy tabloid show called A Current Affair. And the rest is history.”

Reality TV fans will surely recognize Teddi Wright from Season 26 of “The Bachelor” with Clayton Echard and Season 8 of “Bachelor in Paradise,” which saw her leave during week two. In the time since, Teddi has found love offscreen. 

First opening up about her relationship with Nicholas Meyers in 2022 via Instagram, the pair then became engaged in April 2023, before getting married that November. Now, Teddi has revealed that they're expecting their first child.

Teddi took to Instagram to make the big announcement, sharing photos of herself and Nicholas at the beach together. Holding hands, smiling at each other and sharing a kiss, the parents-to-be look incredibly happy in the pics. Beyond that, Teddi shows off her baby bump both in a form-fitting black top as well as a light white shirt that exposes her belly.

She then took to the caption to write, “WE ARE HAVING A BABY!! can't believe I'm making a tiny human with my favorite person 🥹 #early2026 🤍”

When Teddi posted the baby news on Instagram, her friends and followers made it clear that they were excited for her and Nicholas.

One person wrote, “Eek!!!!! So excited for you guys! You'll be the best parents! 🤍”

“Aw Teddi! So precious! Congrats sweetness 💝,” another person added.

A third person left a comment saying, “Oh my goodness! Congrats sweet friend 🥹”

“Congratulations pretty Mama!! ❤️❤️,” came from another follower.

Yet another fan wrote, “You are absolutely glowing! 😍 So happy for you both.”

Before Teddi revealed that she's pregnant, she opened up about her wedding while talking to People.

Recalling the first look on the big day, Teddi recalled, “We were both so nervous, so it was so nice to see him ahead of time and just remember that these moments are what it is all about!”

She also noted the role their families filled during the wedding. Along with the fact that Teddi's father-in-law acted as the officiant, she noted, “All of our siblings were in our wedding.” 

Teddi explained each of their roles, saying, “My brother walked my mother down the aisle. His brothers were in the groomsmen party. My sister was my maid of honor and walked down the aisle with her husband and two sons as the ring bearers — they looked so cute in their tiny suits!”

Bravo's “Next Gen NYC” star Gia Giudice has officially moved out of her mom, “Real Housewives” icon Teresa Giudice's million-dollar mansion, and into her very own apartment.

On Instagram, Gia documented the process of moving all of her belongings out of her mom's New Jersey home. She later posted a series of Instagram Stories from inside her new digs, highlighting a large kitchen and floor-to-ceiling windows that offered gorgeous views of the city. 

Gia Giudice made the heartfelt decision to leave her mother's home and start a new chapter in her own Jersey City apartment. After documenting a moving company packing up all her belongings to take them to her new place, she took fans on a mini tour of her new space on Instagram Stories.

Reality Blurb shared Gia's photos, which showed that her mom, Teresa Giudice, her step-father, Luis Ruelas, and her boyfriend, Christian Carmichael, all joined her as she began to make her apartment feel more like a home.

Some of the photos captured the incredible floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city below, where she can even watch the sunset from her new place. Gia shared a photo of her family having takeout together with fans noticing her large kitchen island, which is perfect for Gia as she loves to cook.

Additionally, Gia showed off her walk-in closet, which was already filled with her clothes and will most likely be something many of her “Next Gen NYC” co-stars living in Manhattan will envy. 

come with me on my first jersey city path ride to nyc🚊🚊 public transportation girly now 

Prior to her big move, Gia shared on TikTok how she planned to navigate trips between Jersey City and New York City. Alongside her boyfriend, the two documented their adventure on the PATH train, from accidentally boarding the wrong train to rushing to catch the next, before finally making it to her co-star's Brooks Marks' apartment.

Before her move, Gia shared what would be her last “Get Ready with Me” video at her mom's home on Instagram. In the clip, the reality star shared that she would take her fans on a tour of her new apartment once she's settled.

“So tomorrow is move-out day. I found this gorgeous apartment in Jersey City, and I cannot wait to take you guys along this entire journey with me, room by room, step by step,” she began. “Moving is obviously super exciting, but really scary. I have always just loved being at home with my family.”

She then shared how participating in “Special Forces” motivated her to take this next major life step. “This move is definitely necessary just for me, my life, and my career. I think I really knew that I was ready to move, honestly, after “Special Forces.” Doing that show just showed me that I am totally okay on my own. And, I think I always knew that, I just needed that push for me to realize that I'm ready and it's okay to leave my family.”

Luckily, Gia does not have to travel far to see her family. Her mom's Montville home is just a 40-minute drive to Jersey City.

Jarrett “JT” Thomas gave fans a look at his new life—in Bali.  The former “Southern Charm” star opened up about the major change she made to his life one year after his sudden exit from the show weeks before the season 10 premiere.

In a video posted to Instagram on Nov. 5, Thomas explained that with his home country “imploding,” his goal was to “quickly find a new community of friends.”

“I came to this  ‘secret garden' estate earlier this year as I explored all over Asia in case s— hit the fan in the US,” he captioned the clip. “When I hit the eject button last week… I came straight back to the secret garden and reunited with this lovely family in paradise. Four days in, we've got some friendships brewing, and the core family didn't forget me. 🌱❤️”

In the video, Thomas explained, “When your country's imploding, you gotta leave sometimes and start something new for a while.'

The “Southern Charm” alum added that he sold everything he owned and embarked on a new journey in Bali, Indonesia. “Retired, at least for the time being,” he said.

Thomas then walked along the secret community where he is living, which is run by a Balinese family. He waved to a handyman on the site and introduced viewers to his “new sister,” her children, and the family dog.  “So now I am part of the family, the Balinese family,” he said. “Living in our secret garden.”

He also gave a brief tour of the garden, which includes a series of small houses adorned with coconut trees out front, a pool, and a yoga pavilion.

“They've taken me under their wing,” Thomas said of his new family. “I explained that I needed some friends.”

“It's starting to feel like home,“ he added of his new accommodations.

Thomas said he will leave Bali in a year, or maybe three, depending on how things go with U.S. elections next November.

The former North Carolina businessman first told fans about his plans on an Instagram post on  Nov. 2, “So today's the first day of my new journey in life,” he said in the video. “I have pulled the ripcord, and I am living in Bali. Just retired. Retired, living in Bali, after living my whole life in the US.”

He added that he will stay in Bali “until things become normal again, if that ever happens.”

Thomas was a cast member on the 9th and 10th seasons of “Southern Charm,” but his final season on the show didn't end well.

On November 8, 2024, he posted a message to Instagram to announce that he informed Bravo he would not be completing his remaining confessional interviews and that he no longer wished “to participate in any ways moving forward with the show.”

“I will leave it at that for now while I work on next steps to recover both physically and mentally from what has been an extremely challenging and exhausting year,” Thomas said of the stressful season, in which he was ostracized by most of the cast amid a love triangle involving his former best friend Venita Aspen.

Thomas returned for the “Southern Charm” reunion earlier this year, but it's clear that chapter of his life is now closed.

Adios man child … maybe grow up and come back ..or just stay in Bali

You can accuse “All Her Fault” of a lot of things — exploiting parental anxieties, bland AirBnB home design, criminal misuse of Sarah Snook — but you can't accuse it of being subtle.

In the Peacock limited series' first scene, Marissa (Snook) stops by a friend's house to pick up her son from a playdate. Except Milo (Duke McCloud) isn't there. Neither is the mom who's supposed to be watching him. Instead, a bewildered stranger answers the door. While she's very nice — inviting Marissa inside, offering reassurance, helping her make phone calls — her every kindness only leads to more questions. The number for the mom-in-charge isn't working. (Why not?) Her son's playdate pal is at the park with a bunch of other kids. (But not Milo?) After a few exposition-heavy minutes of searching, there's only one conclusion left for Marissa to draw.

“I don't know where my son is,” she says, right before the title “All Her Fault” flashes across the screen. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Not subtle, sure — but also, kind of fun? It is for a while, at least, before an overextended story runs out of steam and the delayed answers stretch themselves silly to emphasize a point made patently clear from the start.

 










Throughout the hour-long premiere, Megan Gallagher's adaptation of Andrea Mara's 2021 novel balances the tragic urgency of a missing-kid mystery with the soapy indulgences of a trash-TV thriller. There are leading dramatic beats as suspects are introduced and new information comes to light. There are emotional meltdowns as the family's fresh reality dawns on each of Milo's loved ones. And there are outlandish twists that reframe who we like and who we hate, who we're leery of and who we implicitly trust, and, of course, what we think really happened to the innocent little five-year-old.

The cast largely helps to keep things grounded, rebutting the histrionics by treating each claim with legitimacy or reciting each gauche line with apt conviction. But really, they're all just suspects, as the first episode's closing flash-forward to a police lineup of each series regular's mugshot makes clear.

Marissa runs her own wealth management firm in Chicago, alongside her very handsome business partner, Colin (Jay Ellis). Despite looking like a fighter pilot who could win a game of dogfight football, Colin isn't framed as a temptation for Marissa, and a lack of sexy secrets proves to be a recurring blind spot for the series, even if those two have plenty of other skeletons in their massive, boring closets. (In case you couldn't tell from the moneyed term “wealth management,” everyone in this show is filthy rich — which makes the drab interior designs feel like an obvious oversight. They've got the cash! Give us our decor porn!)

 










Instead of pining over co-workers, Marissa is happily married to Peter (Jake Lacy), a commodities broker and, conversely, a gold-star human being. He supports his brother, Brian (Daniel Monks), and his sister, Lia (Abby Elliott), paying for their homes, their food, and their tertiary expenses. He loves his wife sincerely — and he's happy to prove it. After an early inquiry into his whereabouts — was he with another woman?! — it's clear he would never cheat on Marissa, and his lack of resentment over the accusation only serves as further evidence of his good-guy bonafides.

But… he is played by Jake Lacy, Hollywood's go-to actor for self-centered douchebags, so he's not to be trusted. (You could say the typecasting started with “The White Lotus,” and you wouldn't be wrong, except it actually started with “Carol,” and in this house we do not forget about “Carol.”) Brian is a nice guy, too, but vague allusions to a mysterious accident that left him in constant pain keep the door open to a hidden dark side. Lia's issue is out in the open: She's a drug addict who's spent half of Milo's life in rehab, so is she as devoted to her nephew as she claims? 

And what about Jenny (Dakota Fanning)? The fellow mom from school says she has no idea a playdate was scheduled with her son and Milo, but as another mom cattily voices directly to Jenny: “If someone did take Milo Irvine, why would they pretend to be you?” Yeah, Jenny! Why would they? What are you hiding?! Could it have something to do with Ana (Kartiah Vergara), the nanny, who's obviously guilty of something? (Because she's the nanny? Duh?)

 










For as dismissive as “All Her Fault” can be toward childcare professionals, it does sport a feminist edge so blunt it would struggle to cut Milo's birthday cake. When Marissa is first interviewed by the police, she's lightly chided by her otherwise respectful husband for not checking a parent's phone number against the school registry. When Jenny has to work late one night, her husband won't stop bugging her with questions about their kid — questions he should know how to answer if he was ever “on duty” (his words) for bedtime. The other moms at school cast dubious glances at both Marissa and Jenny for making mistakes any good mom could avoid, while the media pounces on the women for every perceived error whether it's rooted in fact or not. As the days mount and tension builds, inequities are exposed as often as breaks in the case.

Lending such prominence to an under-addressed parenting issue — the disparity in childcare, even in “progressive” couples that aim for an equal workload — makes “All Her Fault” that much easier to cheer, especially when you're already yelling at your TV. If that level the enthusiasm proved sustainable over eight long hours, perhaps Peacock would have another “Apples Never Fall” on its hands. (Hey, that's another Jake Lacy show!) Instead, episodes start to drag and the big reveals lose steam, leaving Sarah Snook to reign over a series that can't maximize her skillset.

 










The series' failures are not, of course, her fault, and it's to Snook's immense credit that a tender moment at the end of the first episode lands at all. If only she had more of them.

“All Her Fault” premieres Thursday, November 6 on Peacock. All eight episodes will be released at once.

Bi Gan pushes against the edges of the cinematic medium once again with his new dream-logic epic, “Resurrection.” It's the 35-year-old Chinese filmmaker's first feature since he dared audiences to put on 3D glasses 70 minutes in for an unbroken take, which is also when the title card showed up, in “Long Day's Journey Into Night.”

“Resurrection” is an even more daring achievement, one that will enchant and alienate audiences in ways that will equally encourage conversation and, hopefully, more dreams. No 3D glasses required, though, when Janus Films opens “Resurrection” in theaters on December 12. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for the film below.

Across the six chapters in “Resurrection,” director Bi adopts the aesthetics of a number of genres and periods in film history as his canvas, from Méliès-inspired silent films and wartime epics to a con-artist buddy movie and even a millennial vampire romance, to tell stories revolving around the same monster's dreams.

Taiwanese superstar Shu Qi headlines as a woman who, in a far-off future, enters the consciousness of the only remaining creature who can dream. Jackson Yee, meanwhile, plays that creature, as well as various humanlike, wrought-from-a-dream versions of him that feature throughout the film's segments and — wait, did I get that right? Regardless, this film also boasts a oner for the ages, as a raincoat mafia descends upon a rave and a pair of bloodthirsty lovers. The phrase “bravura sequence” gets tossed around with abandon, but “Resurrection” has a truly special one.

Here's Janus' synopsis: “In a future where humanity has surrendered its ability to dream in exchange for immortality, an outcast (Jackson Yee) finds illusion, nightmarish visions, and beauty in an intoxicating world of his own making. A work of staggering imagination from visionary Chinese director Bi Gan, ‘Resurrection' conjures vast and ever-shifting worlds on the brink of collapse in an era-spanning journey through our deepest and most human desires.”

In my experience, one viewing at the New York Film Festival was not enough to parse the film's gorgeous riddles and meditation on cinema as a dream machine. 

IndieWire's own review by Sophie Monks Kaufman out of Cannes asked enthusiastically, “Endurance Test, or Imaginative, Boundary-Defying Cinema? You Decide!” 

 










It feels reductive in late 2025 to call a film or television series Lynchian anymore, but parts of “Resurrection” feel like Bi Gan somewhere out there mainlined “Twin Peaks: The Return” and it burrowed its way into his own unconscious: floating orbs, ghostly light patterns, time loops, and all.

“Resurrection” opens in select theaters December 12. Watch the IndieWire-exclusive trailer below.

The King of Pop is finally coming to theaters. Lionsgate released the first teaser for “Michael,” its long-awaited Michael Jackson biopic starring MJ's nephew Jaafar Jackson. 

And the first look is a thriller. The brief teaser shows quite a lot, including Jackson prepping for a show at Dodger Stadium, a recreation of the “Thriller” music video, and Jackson in the studio speaking with his producer, who tells him that, “in here, keep those feet still, my man.” 

Jaafar Jackson, Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Juliano Krue Valdi, Miles Teller, and Colman Domingo all star in “Michael,” which Lionsgate is releasing in theaters April 24, 2026. Antoine Fuqua is directing “Michael,” which has a script by John Logan and is produced by “Bohemian Rhapsody” producer Graham King along with John Branca and John McClain.

IndieWire understands that this first teaser for “Michael” will also be screened ahead of showings of Lionsgate's “Now You See Me: Now You Don't” in theaters, which opens next week.

 










The film was meant to come out as early as this year, but a massive legal snafu involving a big chunk of the movie, which reportedly centered on a child molestation accuser's lawsuit that the Jackson estate was not allowed to depict on film, forced filmmakers to completely reshoot and retool parts of the film, leading to it to be delayed for months indefinitely. Footage from the movie was even confidently teased at CinemaCon back in 2024 but was completely absent this past spring as the movie underwent its reshoots. That wait is over now, and this film has the chance to be one of the bigger box office smashes of 2026. 

Here's the official synopsis: ‘Michael' is the cinematic portrayal of the life and legacy of one of the most influential artists the world has ever known. The film tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.

Chester A. Arthur is shitfaced. Stumbling out the back of a raucous bar in the wee hours of the morning, two hats stacked on top of his head, eyes shut so tight he can't see the wall he's about to walk into, the recent Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States (played by Nick Offerman, a master of drunken mimicry) only manages to find a ride home by the less-than-benevolent graces of a supporter he keeps mistakenly calling “Cousteau.”

Charles Guiteau, played with craven magnetism by Matthew Macfadyen, has been bending Arthur's ear all evening, spinning an accidental kindness — when Arthur saved Cousteau/Guiteau from being arrested — into a genuine opportunity. You see, Guiteau wants to work on Arthur's campaign. Back in Chicago, he was inspired by the top of the ticket, James Garfield (Michael Shannon), and now he dreams of “making an impact” just like his future president. If that means going by a different name — one that's not tied to the thefts, debts, and untold lies he's sown from Illinois to New York — then a different name he shall have.

So, despite his savior's soused state of mind, Guiteau can't say goodnight without bringing up his professional prospects one more time. “You are still angling for a slot,” Arthur says, slurring his words as he stumbles over his feet. “Wily bastard, you are.”

 










“Well, it takes one to know one, sir,” Guiteau says, matching Arthur's bemused chuckle. “It takes one to know one!”

Indeed it does. Although the future vice president (and, soon after, president) can only envision Guiteau's place in politics when he's blind drunk, the invoked comparison speaks as clearly as Arthur cannot. These two wily bastards have more in common than their social statuses would have you believe. After all, what relevant moral line can distinguish a man who slips on brass knuckles to whip delegates from a man willing to steal from the same sister he promises to make proud? Aren't they both feigning service while looking out for themselves? Is it not responsibility, be it to their vast constituency or their immediate family, that's supposed to guide their actions? Without it — without some sense of accountability to an idea greater than themselves — what does that mean for their work? Their function? Their impact on America, now and in the centuries to come?

In Mike Makowsky's exceedingly entertaining and vibrantly topical Netflix drama, “Death by Lightning,” the writer and creator uses a deceptively slight slice of history to illustrate the enduring flaws in our government as well as the defects in character of those drawn into it. While that may sound like old hat given the hordes of “timely” critiques tossed around in the last nine years, the four-hour limited series arranges its vivid political portraits into a rip-roaring yarn that's scalding and endearing, riotous and mournful, a plea for America's better angels to surface and a eulogy for a country that never lived up to its ideals.

 










To assess with how the righteous American dream grew distorted, Makowsky's series (directed by Matt Ross) peers all the way past our 25 most recent presidents to find the long-term lessons in our country's second-shortest presidency. It's a tandem tale split between Guiteau and Garfield, the assassin and the assassinated, enlivened by an exquisite cast of character actors. 

Shannon's Garfield is a classic reluctant hero. His Congressional obligations aside, Garfield prefers a simple life on his Ohio farm, where his days are consumed with making an “ugly” picnic table and his nights are devoted to reading on the front porch with his wife, Crete (Betty Gilpin). But when duty calls, he schlepps from his blissful haven in rural America to the bustling streets of Chicago, where the traveling circus has set up stakes. 

The only reason he even attends the 1880 Republican National Convention is to nominate another candidate, John Sherman (Alistair Petrie). Later, when Crete asks him why he gave such a speech to begin with — a speech so rousing, so honest, and so commanding that his words upstage the man they're meant to elevate and propel Garfield himself to the presidency — he responds, simply, “Because no one was saying what needed to be said.”

 










Garfield is soon labeled a progressive politician; an outlier who can put an end to the corrupt, conservative wing of Republican power who backed two-term president Ulysses S. Grant. The power-hungry crew finds its colorful embodiment in Roscoe Conkling (Shea Whigham, going full Whigham as only Shea can), a New York Senator whose control of the port lends him enormous sway and whose friendship with Chester A. Arthur — his unofficial enforcer — lends him an air of invulnerability. If you try to outmaneuver him politically, he'll cut you off at the knees, and if you try to out-muscle him, well, that's what Arthur's brass knuckles are for.

The one tactic they're ill-prepared for is the only one in Garfield's quiver: the truth. When his speech wins over the crowd, they don't know how to counter it. They can barely recognize it, and Garfield rides it all the way to the White House.

But no further. Waiting for him there, fuming from a bench with an unobstructed view of the North Portico, is the living manifestation of dishonesty. Macfadyen's Guiteau is an obvious charlatan; a man so easy to peg as a bad seed that a bank manager remembers him from a single confrontation five years earlier. So it's only fitting that after being rejected by a proper professional, Guiteau literally scurries across the street into the arms of improper politicians. As soon as he hears the name “President Grant,” he's barging through the gathered crowd, declaring himself “one of your biggest boosters” and concocting tall tales with just enough truth to sound plausible… if any other man was spouting them.

 










In the sober light of day, Arthur takes one look at the leach before him and wrenches it from its prey. “Hit the road, chief,” he says. “We ain't buying.” But how the promptly dismissed Guiteau shifts into a Cousteau worth defending is more than a matter of counting the whiskeys Arthur consumes. Once Charles latches onto an idea, be it how he sees himself or what he needs from others, he's a dog with a bone, and the kindness (or indulgence) of strangers becomes one too many scraps tossed to a desperate animal. He's relentless, shameless, and the only person willing to believe his own lies. To those who want to see the best in their fellow man, he's also pitiable, which protects Guiteau from Garfield himself during one of their few, brief meetings. 

And makes Macfadyen the perfect performer to play him. Having graduated with honors from the “Succession” School of Suck-Ups and Sycophants, the English actor applies the same cringey eagerness to his courtships with various power players, just as he finds immense pathos in the fleeting moments when Charles has to face the cold truth of his character. As a snake consistently twisting itself into knots to be seen as anything but itself, it's a credit to Macfadyen that there's no mistaking Guiteau's precise identity throughout “Death by Lightning.” His true self comes tumbling out in between every lie, and that's because Macfadyen makes sure of it. 

 










In his last project, “Bad Education,” Makowsky studied another charlatan. Frank Tassone (played by Hugh Jackman in his best performance to date) is fueled by personal entitlement. He works hard, helps his students get into good colleges, and therefore deserves the $2 million he embezzles from Long Island public schools. That's the promise oof the American dream, isn't it? That if you put in the work, you'll be rewarded for it. Well, the American public school system doesn't abide by dream logic, and “Bad Education” makes sure to expose the structural inequities that contributed to Frank's scandal, while still acknowledging the personal demons that led him astray. 

Here, however, Makowsky examines a purely ignoble figure who feels entitled without accomplishing a thing. As far as the show is concerned, Guiteau never works hard. (He dismisses his sister's offer to work at a patent office because that's a “business for those who lack their own ideas.”) He doesn't help anyone but himself. (His poor sister supports him again and again, nearly at the cost of her life.) He doesn't deserve anything, and yet he still demands everything. Moreover, he expects the President of the United States to make sure he gets it.

Guiteau is an angry white man, too resolute in his self-regard to accept blame for his own misfortunes and too stupid in his understanding of public service to realize the most powerful man in the country may have greater responsibilities than finding work for an asshole who won't do any. The modern parallels are as striking as their centuries-old existence is deflating, but you'll mainly feel emboldened by the end of “Death by Lightning.” 

 










Despite its dubious conclusion regarding the American experiment, the practitioners are realized with such vivacity and the goal glimpsed with such a warm glow, it's hard not to want to start the whole thing over and try again. The way things are headed, maybe we can. Until then, perhaps it's best to take Arthur's advice when asked what to do amid dark times.

“We get fucking sloshed, that's what.” 

“Death by Lightning” premieres Thursday, November 6 on Netflix. All four episodes will be released at once.

The last time screenwriters Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet collaborated, on the Corbet-directed “The Brutalist,” they created a bold American epic that garnered deserved critical praise and awards attention for its textured 70mm images (captured via VistaVision) and sweeping vision of 20th-century art, culture, and politics. 

For their new film “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Fastvold steps back into the director's chair to tell another story of, as IndieWire critic David Ehrlich wrote, “a European iconoclast who comes to America in order to build a new kind of church.” Watch the teaser trailer below.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The Testament of Ann Lee” is an account of the rise of Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), founder of the 18th-century religious sect known as the Shakers. A fervent proponent of celibacy, Lee was also an activist for gender equality — and a utopian leader who believed herself to be the female incarnation of Christ.

Fastvold's film tells Lee's story — one which, like the tale of László Tóth in “The Brutalist,” works beautifully as an allegory for the struggles and passions of a 21st-century filmmaker — as an audaciously conceived musical, using over a dozen original Shaker hymns as the basis for spiritually inflected expressions of agony and ecstasy choreographed by Fastvold and Corbet's “Vox Lux” collaborator Celia Rowlson-Hall.

 










Shooting on 35mm with an eye toward 70mm blow-ups for the film's theatrical release, cinematographer William Rexer creates a sumptuous candlelit look for the film reminiscent of Caravaggio's paintings and atmospheric period pieces like Stanley Kubrick's “Barry Lyndon” and Ridley Scott's “The Duellists.” Like “The Duellists,” “The Testament of Ann Lee” is a sweeping epic made with limited resources — working with a budget comparable to that of “The Brutalist” (reportedly around $10 million), Fastvold and production designer Samuel Bader have crafted a film of astonishing scale and detail.

In his review of the film out of the Venice Film Festival, Ehrlich called “The Testament of Ann Lee” a “speculative, feverish, and altogether rapturous biopic” that works as “a celebration of — and then in its less rhapsodic second half, a plea for — the conditions required to make a movie like ‘The Testament of Ann Lee.' Just as Ann Lee's upbeat message appealed to a Christian population that had grown tired of being promised salvation through suffering, Fastvold and Corbet's model offers a more actionable response to an industry sick of Hollywood doomsayers.”

Watch the trailer below.

“The Testament of Ann Lee” opens in theaters on December 25 from Searchlight Pictures.

If you're trying to build something big, the pipe organ will excavate the space for you. Indie-rock bands begging for gravitas, mystics christening avant-garde civic architecture, conceptual geniuses following the fractals of human depravity and the xenophobic state—they've all used the rafter-rattling boom of the pipe organ as a way to construct vastness; if cathedrals didn't already exist, the flying buttresses of the pipe organ's groans would have called them into being. In other words, it's an instrument designed to make a human being, with all of our inner depths, seem very small indeed. You pluck the lyre; God rumbles the pipes.

Over the past decade, Swedish composer and organist Anna von Hausswolff has fashioned her instrument's blasts of air into cavernous spaces that drip with oversized exhalations. With Iconoclasts, she not only shapes the kind of terrible majesty she created with her mostly instrumental 2020 record All Thoughts Fly, she sings to fill it with heartache, longing, rupture, pain, love—normal, human-sized things whose personal stakes she builds to appropriately towering proportions. With sky-high production to accommodate her songs' unabashed maximalism, Iconoclasts feels like a triumphant requiem for dead relationships and the carapaces of old selves. “I'll tell you the whole truth,” she sings in standout “The Whole Woman,” a duet with Iggy Pop. “And you will see me as the woman that I am.”

As the title suggests, many of Iconoclasts' songs concern themselves with the destruction of idols, whether former lovers, beliefs, or aesthetic principles. Accordingly, the album vibrates with the energy of the recently liberated, even if at times you might mistake it for the shivering of heartache. After saxophonist Otis Sandsjö scribbles heart-shaped patterns over the gothic-jazz overture “The Beast,” von Hausswolff lays out the record's thesis. “I fought so much for you, for us, our life here,” she sings with the poise of someone who's taken a deep breath and counted to three. “But now you need to go.” The ensemble bursts into flame, dense organ and clashing cymbals underscoring her dismissal. Across the album, her vocals are buoyant like a bruise, deep purple tones and half-formed blues rising as if from tender skin.

Much of what makes the album work is the intense pressure it seems to be under. As it builds, the title track takes on a gasping desperation. “Who am I? Who am I?” von Hausswolff asks. The song crests as she implores the listener to “accept the freedom in your soul,” breaking with the delirious tender-heartedness of the “My Heart Will Go On” key change. While von Hausswolff shares Celine Dion's willingness to absolutely go for it, she finds her strength in solitude, rather than in the presence of another. “I'm breaking up with language/In search of something bigger than this,” she sings in “Stardust,” riding a bassline that lurches like it's throwing off pursuers. Von Hausswolff and her ensemble are patient with these songs. They linger over them, giving them time and space to develop, even when they're nearly at the boiling point.

Even in the shadow of von Hausswolff's unabashedly dramatic delivery, the album's atmospheric production speaks volumes. Like Nick Cave wandering the heavy firelight of Ghosteen, or Chuquimamani-Condori awash in the sentimentality of pop country, von Hausswolff creates spaces that throb with a wounded pulse. In “The Mouth,” she shrinks the entire ensemble down to shoebox size, sending it bouncing across stereo channels. The way “Struggle With the Beast” sounds like it's being forced through the organ reminds me of Maggie Nelson describing the process of articulating unformed thought into blunt words as “like grinding a lump of wet clay through a hole.” At one point in the song, the group turns a corner into something resembling big-band Ethio-jazz, then returns to the theme with the flick of a wrist.

Sandsjö makes his debut with von Hausswolff's ensemble here and instantly asserts himself as a key member of the group. Sometimes he sounds like Alabaster DePlume; sometimes he sounds like one of Steve Reich's 18 musicians. In “Consensual Neglect,” the saxophonist takes a long and meditative solo that feels flecked with gold, then plays a stroboscopic section so intense it sounds like he's crossfading between two dozen different solos at once. He gets heavier in “Stardust,” mimicking the shred of a death-metal guitarist—finger-tapping and all—while in “Facing Atlas,” his overlapping lines flap like black wings, cloaking a corner of the song in shadow. His horn is a secondary character whose clarity and directness makes the overall picture more legible.

Change can be diminishing. When your context shifts dramatically—when you look around and see that all of your statues have been toppled—it's disorienting. It can be hard to reconcile how you're still here even after the things that formed you are gone. On Iconoclasts, von Hausswolff leans into the dissociation, embracing bewilderment and rebirth. Solitary on her plinth, she becomes transcendent, made lighter by the experience of carrying something so heavy.

The violence in Armand Hammer songs tends to be ambient, lingering in the air like a pink mist. Elucid and billy woods write about how that violence seeps into everyday life, like the Confederate flag woods can sense at a gas station on “War Stories,” or how, on “I Keep a Mirror in My Pocket,” Elucid asks, “What's life without wartime?” The daily grind gets interrupted by a volley of gunfire, only to resume moments later like an inning after a rain delay. The rappers themselves aren't yet desensitized to it, but they recognize how most people operate: trudging through an existence that's actively being stripped away, so used to the machinations of dehumanization that they've become, as Elucid puts it on “Slewfoot,” “bored of the apocalypse.” We're inundated with terrible news, saturated to the point that fresh horrors don't always register. Work doesn't stop, rent's still due. Their new album, Mercy, asserts that the carnage of our times can no longer be ignored; it looms above all of us, eager to pounce. It's not an option to simply live—how do we survive?

Mercy reunites woods and Elucid with prestige rap kingmaker The Alchemist, who turns in some of his weirdest and most harrowing production since The Skeleton Key. A lot of Alc's recent work has been constructed from daydrunk lounge loops that risked tipping into “type beat” territory, but here, he follows the candlelit sound of Haram, his first collaboration with Armand Hammer, further into the darkness. Gone are the jazzy accents of “Indian Summer” or “Squeegee,” replaced with a palette of sustained piano notes and nervy, unconventional drum patterns. Songs like “No Grabba” and “Nil by Mouth” trudge like a funereal march; the kick drums in “Scandinavia” sound like targeted strike detonations in the distance. It's a fitting complement to woods and Elucid's piercing bars, creating a pervasive tension that oscillates between mournful and paranoid.

If Haram was the Alchemist's entry to Armand Hammer's world, Mercy is a shared vision. There's a greater understanding of what they can create together, and a willingness to add other sounds into their combined vocabulary. “Calypso Gene” could've been unearthed from some lost trove of Dungeon Family recordings, dipping into that collective's gospel and funk-tinged waters; “Crisis Phone” taps into the white-knuckle pressure Alc and Boldy James explored on “Scrape the Bowl” and “Brickmile to Montana”; “California Games” unfolds like a '70s psychedelic soul epic, flutes and wordless vocals intertwining over a splashy groove, wailing up at the heavens. And there are thrilling accents that reveal themselves after a few listens, like the synths on “Dogeared” that overlap to create dissonant siren calls, or the car peeling out during the heist-movie soundtrack of “Glue Traps.” These details become little vortexes, pulling you further into the trio's universe.

There's a pronounced urgency on Mercy, a grounding in the here and now that's not always prevalent on woods or Elucid projects. The two have distinct ways of experiencing time—woods flattens it by meticulously threading historical events together, showing how they rhyme, while Elucid operates in a more metaphysical lane, weaving facts, feelings, and memories into spiraling, nonlinear episodes. Those methodologies appear here, but they're increasingly used to react to the wretchedness of our current age.

On “Peshawar,” woods bemoans the sudden prevalence of AI: “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human/Mind, that's the rubric/Deep Blue versus Vladimir Putin.” The song itself is named after a city in Pakistan that suffered a brutal terrorist attack on a school in 2014, a scenario that now unfolds across the globe. Elucid dreams of “exploding beepers” on “Nil by Mouth” after images of the one-drop rule, the Iran-Contra affair, and “self-made martyrs” stream through his head like a sour meditation. On “Glue Traps,” he paints a picture of the intersecting lives in his neighborhood, reflecting on its beauty while ruing the constant hustle required of its residents. The brief but brutal “u know my body” sounds like woods describing the scenes of destruction livestreaming from Gaza, but could represent any genocide, past or present. After spending seven records anticipating and examining the effects of our ever-curdling history, Mercy presents the results: The war has arrived at everyone's doorstep.

So what is there to do? On “Dogeared,” woods' companion asks him, “What's the role of a poet in times like these?” The question haunts him like an extra shadow, nagging at his brain as he goes about the routines of work and parenting. His relentless pondering makes him that much more present, noticing the bacon grease kept next to the stove, the neglected novel on his nightstand, the splash as his child hops into a puddle. A solution never surfaces, but he's discovered how poignant each small moment can be. Across the album, woods and Elucid's mind-meld feels stronger, more lived-in; they trade bars with a fluidity borne not only from years of practice, but a sincere depth of trust. Perhaps these are the answers to the question: looking for the magic in the ordinary, sharing it with others, recognizing how far collaboration can take us. Perhaps mercy isn't something we beg for, but something we build.

7.0

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

R&R

Reviewed:

November 6, 2025

For an artist with such a distinctive sound, Henry Laufer's music as Shlohmo is unusually pliable. Since 2009, the Los Angeles-based producer has built instrumental arrangements out of tape hiss and grainy textures, gloomy synths and gristled percussion, crunchy guitar and hard-to-identify samples, constructing a world where hip-hop, slowcore, bass music, ambient, R&B, and pop meet in a murky, disorienting middle. He'd already established himself as a leader in the L.A. beat scene when, in 2012, he flipped Jeremih's “Fuck U All the Time” and found himself with an unexpected SoundCloud hit. The original version was all bubblegum and rosé, but in Shlohmo's hands it became dark and unnerving, a shift that morphed the song's meaning: What if telling someone you wanted to fuck them all the time wasn't a cheeky sext but a desperate, life-ruining confession? Though he's gone on to collaborate with plenty of rappers and R&B singers—Drake and Post Malone among them—he seems most comfortable when working alone, in what I imagine to be a pitch-black basement surrounded by candles and voodoo dolls, making ambitious, unruly beats that only he could make.

His fourth studio album, Repulsor, is a bludgeoning listen, one that works hard to earn its fleeting moments of melodic bliss. Though still rooted in lo-fi, abstract hip-hop, Shlohmo tries his hand at death metal and digital shoegaze, splitting songs open with feral, distorted-to-hell drops that erupt with growling synths and guitars. These wall-of-noise centerpieces feel like new terrain for the 35-year-old musician, movements he'd been working up to since 2015's Dark Red but which he unleashes here like a harrowing scream into a neverending void.

On 2019's The End, Shlohmo seemed to be caught between two competing ideas: hone the atmospheric cassette-deck sound he'd been perfecting for years, or fuck around and create something new. The result of this tension was a record rich with melancholy and texture. He molded beats out of sandpapery guitar and sinewy bells, deconstructed trap drums and stomach-churning synth bass. Repulsor adopts the weirdest stuff from The End and goes a step further, distorting and saturating sounds until they become almost unrecognizable. “The Thing,” for instance, spotlights a nasally synth before breaking out into screamo mayhem. “Fistful of Dirt” suffocates any sustained melodic gratification with chugging guitars and gory vocals. These choices aim to generate intense, explosive feeling, though after a few listens they become more affecting in the abstract, rather than viscerally so. The music is big and powerful, but the emotional thrust behind it can feel flat, a faint suggestion buried beneath layers of noise. And with almost half the album devoted to these huge industrial salvos, their shape and sound can begin to feel redundant, their potency fading behind unscalable walls of fuzz and distortion.

Repulsor isn't all brutality, though. Shlohmo slips in several contemplative instrumentals, like the palate-cleansing “Resin” and the ambient chopped-and-screwed number “Light in a Tunnel.” And then there's “Henry's Demise,” a reminder of Shlohmo's brilliance as a beatmaker. Over a haunting piano loop, he turns up the tape hiss and disfigures the drums, the beat prattling about in an anxious gallop, never quite settling into the pocket. It's rewarding to listen to Shlohmo negotiate the limits of form, toying wildly with rhythm and groove while still making a compulsively listenable song.

It's not until Repulsor's closer, “Lola's Theme,” that the album releases a much-needed exhale. It's a spasmodic and genuinely moving electro-rap headspinner, with lasers and synth strings and bit-crushed snares bursting into a field of light. To reach this moment, though, you must wade through a sometimes agonizing, sometimes wonderful world of sludge and screams, of ingenuity and frustration. Shlohmo clearly isn't content with complacency; if he was, he'd likely be producing pop songs and making club-ready remixes. Instead, Repulsor strains with reinvention, searching for the light and life in damp, sometimes decomposing spaces. What more can we ask from a mid-career artist? Shlohmo is, as ever, trying to push himself, and music, toward something new.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","10 of the Best Beats Out Right Now","https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/10-of-the-best-beats-out-right-now/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:33:00 GMT","

This past weekend, I was watching the premiere of Rachel Sennott's new influencer culture HBO comedy I Love LA when I was caught off guard by a name in the credits: Kenneth Blume. If you've been tapped out of the Geese phenomenon, you may be thinking, Who the fuck is that? The answer is simple: That's Kenny Beats. (777 is still good, by the way.) To undergo his transformation from rap production chameleon to acclaimed rock-record producer and film and TV score composer—he also did the music for Alex Russell's thriller Lurker, which is sort of like if The Talented Mr. Ripley were about a Brockhampton stan—he switched up his name, an extension of the thought process that, to be taken seriously by musical institutions, you have to soften your connection to rap. “I named myself Kenny Beats at 15 years old for MySpace—because my name was Kenny and I made beats—and it kind of just stuck,” he said in an interview over the summer. “And whenever I get a Grammy nomination as Kenny Beats, there's times where in my heart I'm just like, ‘But my last name is Blume.'”

It's disheartening that Kenny thinks like that because, hey, man, beats are sick and who cares if some suits on a voting board or in Hollywood don't think so! I was reminded of that last week when I pulled up with my friend to a show in Williamsburg. There, I saw Chicago's Semiratruth fiddle around and improvise on top of their 2024 album, The Star of the Story, reminding me of the most surreal moments on collagist classic Red Burns. Then, later in the night, out came Jersey digital crate digger Doris, whose Ultimate Love Songs Collection, 50 tracks of pitch-shifted sampledelia, was one of my go-to albums of last year. During the performance, Doris' mic was messed up, so all of my attention was on the production and, as he breezed through dozens of one-minute songs, I turned to my friend and said, “I've listened to this album so many times and the beats still blow me away.”

All of that had me thinking about the beats I've come across lately that have been giving me a similar feeling. These days, that tends to be the stuff coming from the bouyon scene of Guadeloupe and Dominica, where they're cooking up inhuman keyboard melodies every week, or on the DMV free car circuit, where layers keep getting added to the blown-out foundation set by producers like Dolan Beatz and Cheecho. Below is a roundup of some of my songs from those scenes and beyond.

I can't front: I'm a little jealous whenever I meet someone from another city who tells me stories of bumping Baton Rouge jig beats at middle school dances. It's a strain of Deep South rap that, despite being infused into so many regional styles (from Milwaukee lowend to L.A. ratchet music) of the last 15 years, never really made it up to New York. Therefore, I don't have a lot of nostalgia for Mouse and Level's “I Bet U Won't,” but what I do know is that the way it is flipped into a ballistic new-age Chicago drill beat on this Lady Binladen cut is unreal. Armed with clipping drums and a slight touch of the fidgety footwork energy that has swept across the scene—Lil M.U.'s “Top of Cars” is probably the best example of that—it's extremely dancey while keeping the cutthroat drill intensity intact.

I've definitely hit a New Edition two-step in the mirror once or twice to XanGang's “Promiscuous Lover.” It's the new jack plugg beat buried at the end of the producer's Love & Cuddles Samples, a collection of snippets he uploaded to SoundCloud to advertise beats he was selling. A long time pillar of plugg, Xan has been teasing this computerized rebirth of new jack swing grooves since “New Jack Story” cut through the scream tour nostalgia of Corey Lingo's Safe 2 Say back in July. “Promiscuous Lover,” with all the drum machine rolls and knocking snares, might be even better. It's like if Teddy Riley grew up in the SoundCloud era.

The Travis Scott industrial complex has had me on an anti-beat switch crusade for the last few years, but I'll drop my beef for “Wa Coco.” Producers Mufasa and Yvng Gucci seamlessly pull off morphing the skittering drums of a somewhat generic UK drill beat into a thudding bouyon rhythm for Guadeloupean trio HollyG to run amok over. Throw in police sirens and bursts of noise that sound like hitting a new high score on an arcade game, and it feels like a beat that just keeps on powering up as it goes on.

On Rage Tape, a compilation KeiyaA quietly put out last year under the moniker dj cowriiie, she really flexes her production chops. One minute she's on an astral-sounding drum'n'bass kick and the next she's breathing new life into a classic Lil' Kim verse; it's a looseness that stood out in comparison to the tight, concision of Forever, Ya Girl. Well, that trying-shit-out ethos carried into the new studio album Hooke's Law, especially with the way “lateeee” mashes together 808s massive enough for OsamaSon with celestial beams. They should spin this when they open the first strip club on the moon.

In the corners of the DMV free car scene dominated by SJR beats, the sound basically went full EDM this year. Dutch producer TrapMoneyBiggie, who is one of the go-to producers in the area despite being thousands of miles away, plays around with that idea by teasing a big festival drop on “Killing Spree” that never actually hits. Heavy on restarting industrial drums and eerie Three 6 Mafia–style vocal chants, the beat sounds like it could have been a Jeff Hardy theme if it came out 20 years ago.

Out in France, they're paying attention to this golden era of DMV production, too, especially 63OG, who has been adding elements of the metallic percussion into his brighter sound for a while now. On his latest tape, 6TR9C9, and its deluxe edition, he landed on a production style that strips away the drill-like atmosphere of free car for the dancefloor-ready feel of West African pop. Seemingly inspired by the Afrojerk that Len has been fiddling with in the United Kingdom, 63OG, on “R.J.C (Belek),” cuts that clink-clanking together with hectic rhythms that have a coupé-décalé bounce. I never thought that free car to catch a grind to would exist.

Kelewya is one of the few producers that can still make a rage beat that moves me. Like the best stuff on A Great Chaos, “Lil Twin” is patient, taking its time with a lengthy build up that finally explodes into colorful madness like a gusher. Thankfully, it's a lot less dark and self-serious than the new touchstones of the subgenre, like Jump Out and Rest in Bass, full of slinky Donkey Kong drums and hangout vibes.

The flickering laser beam beats have been getting passed around from Detroit to South Florida to Memphis for a few years now, but I think Philly rappers have the sharpest ear for them. Here, Jujujumpinout and TOD Buddha grab one that is sparse and dramatic with the way it wraps the percussion and all the fixings around a looped and sped-up John Legend hook. Together, with their shot out of a cannon rapping, it's like the drill equivalent of Knxwledge's Meek Mill remixes.

The washed-out, Nintendo funk beats Raphy has scattered all over Treasures, his new collab tape with fellow Bruiser Brigade rapper J.U.S, make me feel like I'm in a daydream. But not just any daydream, the kind of ones they have in those old French one-last-job movies (probably starring Alain Delon or Jean Gabin) right before the big heist that you just know is going to go wrong. On “Forage,” it's the combination of jazzy whistles, vintage Khayree level thick basslines, and melancholic keyboard grooves that gives off that fantastical yet doomed mood.

There are so many BlaqNmilD beats making the rounds in the New Orleans bounce scene at all times that I tend to take him for granted. But, every once in a while, I'll get smacked in the face by one. Right now, that's “Really Love'm,” which, for whatever reason, starts out with a flip of the Rugrats theme before dropping that idea after a couple of seconds to go into a clash of stuttering dance breaks, airhorns, and multiple R&B interpolations happening all at once. It's so restless that I don't even know if you can dance to it; you kinda just have to do the Jay-Z nod. Perfect for me.

	A journey that began over 50 years ago when former members of Santana formed their own spinoff band is coming to an end. Journey have announced details of a long-rumored Final Frontier farewell tour that will take them all across North America next year.


	The first legs kicks off Feb. 28 in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and wraps up July 2 in Laredo, Texas. There are 60 dates on the books, mostly in secondary and tertiary markets, and more will be announced in the future.


	“This tour is our heartfelt thank-you to the fans who've been with us every step of the way — through every song, every era, every high and low,” Journey founder Neal Schon says in a statment. “We're pulling out all the stops with a brand-new production — the hits, the deep cuts, the energy, the spectacle. It's a full-circle celebration of the music that's brought us all together.”


	“As its founding member, I carry the Journey torch to this day, wherever I go,” he continues. “The sentiment and spirit of the band will always remain. While this marks a farewell to one powerful chapter of the Journey we've shared, I want everyone to know I'm not done. Music is still burning strong inside me, and there are new creative horizons ahead. This tour is both a thank-you and the beginning of what's next.”

	











	Longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain echoed the sentiment: “It's been an incredible ride. We've shared our music with millions and this tour is about gratitude, connection and one last chance to feel that magic together. We wouldn't want it any other way.”

	











	They'll be joined once again by singer Arnel Pineda, who has been delivering Steve Perry's vocal parts since joining the band in 2007. “I'm honored to be part of this legacy and I'm grateful for having been welcomed with such open arms,” he says in a statement. “Every night on stage has been a dream come true.”


	Schon, Cain, and Pineda will be accompanied by keyboardist/singer Jason Derlatka, drummer/singer Deen Castronovo, and bassist Todd Jensen.

	A press release promises an “all new, special evening with stage production across North America with their catalog of global chart-topping hits, including ‘Don't Stop Believin', ‘Any Way You Want It,' ‘Faithfully,' ‘Lights,' and more in a celebration of legacy, love and the fans who made it all possible.”


	Journey went on an extended hiatus in 1987 when Perry decided to walk away from public life. They briefly reformed in 1996 to record the comeback LP Trial by Fire, but they parted ways with Perry before they were able to tour behind it. In 1998, they reconvened with new vocalist Steven Augeri and slowly rebuilt their audience with a relentless tour schedule. Augeri left the band in 2006, and was briefly replaced with Jeff Scott Soto, but everything changed when Schon discovered Pineda singing Journey covers on YouTube. He's been in the band for the past 18 years.


	Along the way, there's been a fair amount of discord between Schon and Cain that played out in legal filings, social media posts, and interviews. There was also a protracted legal battle with the classic-era rhythm section of Ross Valory and Steve Smith following their dismissal from the band in 2020.


	Despite all the bad blood and the many lineup changes, Journey continued to tour, often on bills with fellow Eighties survivors like Def Leppard, Heart, and Toto. But they've only done a handful of gigs this year, and have been completely inactive since an April 24 show at Huntington Bank Field in Cleveland.

	The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony is set to take place this Saturday, November 8 in Los Angeles, with artists like Soundgarden, OutKast, the White Stripes, Cher, Cyndi Lauper and more entering the Cleveland institution. 


	In the weeks leading up to the Rock Hall induction ceremony, organizers have revealed which artists and celebrities will be on hand to present and perform, a roster that includes Chappell Roan, David Letterman, Olivia Rodrigo, Doja Cat, Donald Glover, the Killers, Elton John, Doja Cat, Jim Carrey, Missy Elliott, and many more.


	While surprises are abound for Saturday's event, the induction ceremony previously revealed that Roan will induct Lauper, with Avril Lavigne performing with the “True Colors” singer. Soundgarden's induction will include a supergroup performance featuring fellow Seattle legends like Heart's Nancy Wilson, Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, and Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell, as well as the Pretty Reckless' Taylor Momsen.

	











	“We wanted to keep it as Seattle-centric as possible and include some people that were there with us in the beginning,” Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron told the Seattle Times.

	Twenty One Pilots previously revealed that they'll take part in the tribute to the White Stripes; that duo will not reunite at the induction ceremony, as Meg White isn't expected to attend the event. 


	2025 inductees Bad Company also won't be performing at the event, as singer Paul Rodgers feared it would put a stress on his health, but drummer Simon Kirke will take part in the Rock Hall performance.

	











	Glover will induct fellow ATLiens OutKast into the Rock Hall, with Monae and Killer Mike expected to take part in that performance. Letterman will presumably be on hand to honor his friend, late singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, with the Musical Influence Award, which Salt-N-Pepa will also receive at the Los Angeles event.


	This year's induction ceremony will also welcome Chubby Checker and Joe Cocker into the Rock Hall, while keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, Wrecking Crew bassist Carol Kaye (who declined her invitation), and Philly soul songwriter-producer Thom Bell will receive the Musical Excellence Awards. Former Warner Bros. Records president Lenny Waronker is getting the Ahmet Ertegun Award.

Jimmy Kimmel is pleased that Democrats did well in the election this week, but even more pleased that Donald Trump isn't taking the news very well. 


	“It was a big night for Democrats,” Kimmel said during his monologue on last night's Jimmy Kimmel Live. “I'm glad it was because we needed a big night. Democrats have had fewer wins this year than the Jets. And so, the Democrats won everything—they won big races on the East Coast. They won the little ones in the South. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor with more than 50 percent of the vote. Which means your racist aunt and uncle have a new name to mispronounce this Thanksgiving.”


	Kimmel noted that it was “not a good night for the president” because “everything he touched was a loser.” “Trump hasn't been this embarrassed since he found out there was a Donald Trump Jr.,” Kimmel quipped. 


	He added that Trump, of course, has an excuse “for the losing.” “In fact, he's got two of them,” Kimmel said. “He wrote, ‘Trump wasn't on the ballot, and shutdown were the two reasons Republications lost elections tonight.' Now, if Republicans had won and he wasn't on the ballot, would he take credit for that? Oh yes, he definitely would.”

	Kimmel shared a second post from Trump, which read, “And so it begins.” Kimmel noted, “Which was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race or he just sat down on the toilet.”


	The host went on to recount how Republicans immediately began to “scream” about election fraud. “It's weird how it's only fraud when they lose, right? I mean, what are the chances?”

	Kimmel also reflected on the ongoing government shut down, which is impacting numerous sectors of the country in significant ways. “Trump has been desperately trying to convince anyone who will listen that Democrats are responsible for the shut down and that it has nothing to do with him trying to hide the Epstein files,” Kimmel said. “The gaslighting has reached a fever pitch as Trump cuts off the supply of food to children, families, senior citizens, etc.” 


	Earlier this week, Kimmel announced that he and his show created a food donation center — named the “Big, Beautiful Food Bank,” in reference to President Donald Trump's so-called Big, Beautiful Bill — to aid those in need.

Lily Allen's new album, West End Girl, has pulled the rug out from under happily-married-after dreams. The record is an odyssey of betrayal and heartbreak, an investigation of the way we perceive ourselves and the people we wake up next to every morning, and a litmus test for how honest we're allowed to be in art and life. As a result, her record stands as a marker on the musical landscape where storytelling is laid out in its barest and sharpest form. Impressively, she has found an audience that's ready to listen.


	From the title track — which begins like a whimsical skip down the altar to a brownstone in New York, before abruptly being rerouted to a devastating phone call  — to the shocking confrontation of “Madeline,” where Allen endures the hollow sympathy from a woman who slept with her husband, West End Girl has left every corner of social media knocked off its high horse. Allen deftly channels her pain into a masterful portrayal of modern love and loss, and the damaging moments in between. “Absolutely obsessed and horrified at how specifically relatable every track was,” wrote a commenter on Allen's Instagram, while another observed, “A load of lads'll get triggered cause they've cheated on their birds, but for every woman who's twisted herself into a human pretzel to keep some emotionally constipated bloke happy, this is our national anthem.”

	











	While many songwriters may opt for coy innuendos to discuss similar subject matter, Allen has detailed revelations of butt plugs, condoms, and a husband who is quite possibly a sex addict — all set against honeyed pop scores — making it all feel like the time D. H. Lawrence scandalized Britain by penning the word “fuck” in Lady Chatterley's Lover.












	The album has resonated with not just women in — and after — marriages, but also anyone who has considered the idea of coupling with another person and trusting them enough to hold you at your most vulnerable. There's a headline by satire website Reductress — “Woman Who Has Never Been Married or Cheated On Feeling Seen by New Lily Allen Album” — that rings true here, as each track is rooted in a fear that's at once ubiquitous, timeless, and vividly current. “Pussy Palace” salts infidelity with the discovery of a Duane Reade plastic bag filled with lube, while “Nonmonogamummy” and “Dallas Major” find Allen wandering dating apps and hating it: “You know, I used to be quite famous, that was way back in the day/I probably should explain how my marriage has been open since my husband went astray,” she sings.

	Pulling apart fact from fiction in Allen's story is tricky territory, however, despite the album being widely perceived as a tell-all about her ex-husband, actor David Harbour. As Allen told Vogue, “There are things that are on the record that I experienced within my marriage, but that's not to say that it's all gospel.” Listeners are left to explore the lyrics that echo in their own minds, and that's the bit that strikes the heaviest chord.


	“It broke me. It opened up the floodgates,” says Jessica Resendez when remembering the first time she heard West End Girl. Resendez, a social media editor with two children who is out of a long-term relationship, says that Allen's record has arrived at a time when women are reclaiming their autonomy, chipping away at patriarchal norms, and publicly holding men accountable for their misdeeds. “Women have financially, emotionally, and mentally done the work to advance ourselves, and now we're realizing we don't need to keep putting ourselves in situations where men embarrass us or do things that make us feel ashamed,” she says.


	As journalist Ella Alexander writes in Harper's Bazaar, the “David Harbour character is a recognizable one — a performative soft boy who talks the talk, but can't live up to the standards he sets.” Alexander compares Harbour's 2017 SAG speech, in which he waxed on the finer points of morality and offered marching orders in the battle against narcissism, with Allen's portrayals of the actor as a man who allegedly doubts her ability to lead a play (2:22 A Ghost Story) and gaslights her into thinking his betrayal was her fault all along. Following the release of West End Girl, the note that Harbour wrote Allen ahead of her stage debut resurfaced: “My ambitious wife, these are bad luck flowers 'cause if you get reviewed well in this play, you will get all kinds of awards and I'll be miserable. Your loving husband.”

	And then there's the wreckage of a broken heart and being left to mend it in an era where technology has plunged dating into overdrive. “When you put your trust into someone and they use it against you, or they have no empathy, the hardest part is learning how to navigate other relationships in your life. It puts you in this space where you're walking around and feel like no one is ever going to understand you,” says Resendez. “You see that in Lily's music. She sings about these sad, traumatic experiences, but the beat is uplifting. You still have to go about our day and go to work, take care of our loved ones, and do the song and dance every time you meet someone new on these apps, while still walking around with this gray cloud over you.”


	Yet there's liberation in Allen's ability to strip down the shame, jealousy, fear, and torment into art — something she can remember on her own terms. On the penultimate song, “Let You W/In,” she asks, “All I can do is sing. So why should I let you win?” before declaring, “I can walk out with my dignity, if I lay my truth on the table.”And when the tale of ill-starred lovers-turned-strangers closes with “Fruityloop,” Allen's defiant refrain, “It's not me, it's you,” lands less as a kiss-off and more as a resounding victory. The story's narrator has walked away from the disillusionment of divorce with not just her dignity intact, but also with her voice honed. West End Girl isn't an album about heartbreak — it's about having the audacity to survive it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","UFOs pictured in the night sky years before the Space Age began","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/ufos-orbiting-earth-before-first-36201168","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:58:00 GMT","

Evidence of UFOs visiting Earth may have been discovered in a study of a treasure trove of photos of the night sky from the 1950s.

Scientists have been examining images taken before the beginning of the Space Age and have discovered mysterious flashes of light that appear in one image and then vanish in the next.

Studies suggest that some of those blips may be sunlight bouncing off flat, reflective objects high above Earth, years before Russia launched the first satellite, Sputnik.

Psychopaths' brains unlocked, supersonic travel is coming back, Alzheimer's reversed, plus the difference between diet and zero drinks - all this and more in our latest weird science newsletter

The research comes from the VASCO project (Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations), led by Beatriz Villarroel of Nordita at Stockholm University.

Her team pored over pre–Space Age photographic plates from California's Palomar Observatory (1951–1957), hunting for 'transients' - points of light that appear once and never again.

What they found is eyebrow‑raising. After sifting more than 100,000 candidates, the team reports:

One case lined up with the famed 'flying saucer' cluster over Washington DC on July 27, 1952. The pattern, researchers say, fits flat, highly reflective objects in high orbit - not round space rocks or dust, which would streak during Palomar's 50‑minute exposures.

The plates pre‑date Sputnik in 19657, so if these were glints from orbit, they weren't from human‑made satellites.

That has led the authors to float a few possibilities: unknown reflective objects in high Earth orbit, some UAP operating in space as well as air, or a still‑mysterious atmospheric effect linked to nuclear detonations that somehow produced next‑day flashes seen from Palomar.

BySimon Thompson,

Contributor.

""It fell on my desk through my agent as something with the possibility to adapt. I laughed because I thought it was inherently not theatrical. Still, the idea got its hooks in me because it seems so far from plausible,"" admits playwright Levi Holloway as we discuss the stage production of Paranormal Activity.

The multimillion-dollar film franchise has spawned seven films so far, and now a theatrical production that has garnered solid audiences and reviews in Chicago is headed to Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre, with plans to arrive in London's iconic West End in early 2026. Holloway, working with producer Simon Friend, Punchdrunk's founder and artistic director, Felix Barrett, and illusionist Chris Fisher. 

""I spoke with Felix a couple of times, and we really hit it off. We were so simpatico in our notion of the genre and our love for the uncanny, the strange, and 1970s horror, as well as great films like Don't Look Now and Jacob's Ladder. They are pretty far afield from Paranormal Activity, but we liked the dare of it in terms of adapting it for the stage,"" the writer recalls. ""I came up with a loose pitch that was mostly ridiculous, and Paramount, Simon, and Felix all bit. Paramount didn't lay down a hefty mandate. They just said, 'It should probably be about a couple who are haunted by something,' and that was it. It was tonal and it wasn't prescriptive at all. We did have many masters to serve, so it was our pleasure to run amok all over any mythology they had created, not as a reduction, but because we wanted to do our own thing.""

Whereas the Paranormal Activity movies are set in the US, the stage production moves the action to the UK. In the story, James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape the past, but they soon discover that places aren't haunted, people are. So what made Holloway want to take this transatlantic to a city known for its ghosts?""It's a really boring answer,"" he laughs. ""I live in Chicago, and I had to go to London to meet Felix over the course of a year, and I became completely enamored with the city. I also got deeply involved in my research on the spiritualist movement, Victorian-era mediums, the Davenport Brothers, Spirit cabinets, the UK's relationship with the aftermath of World War One, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Part of it was that it was the life I was living. I was newly married, so I was like, 'Okay, well, how about a couple from Chicago going to London for work?' What a big stretch of the imagination."" 

""You are right, though, in saying London is drenched in ghost stories and folklore, and it just feels a lot more tactile over there. It was an exciting sandbox to be in. In any good horror story, you have to isolate your main characters and you have to answer the question right away, especially in a play."" 

The question Holloway put at the heart of the story was a simple one: Why don't they run? He partly answered it with the production design.

""My goal was to have a single set. When it comes to horror on stage, I think it serves the work well to keep your characters on one set and to make that set a character in itself,"" he reveals. ""I wanted to make them strangers in a strange land that was familiar, but somehow not familiar, with that sheen of bizarro over it. This version of Paranormal Activity isn't about demons, God, the devil, or anything else; it's about ghosts. My idea of a ghost is that people are haunted, not places, so that's another reason you can't run.""

Paranormal Activity takes place on a single set, but that set is a multi-level house, which complicates things and can lead to mishaps.""When I wrote the script, I set it in a two-story house, half imagining what that execution would be. Fly Davis is our scenic designer and has done an incredible job,"" Holloway enthuses. ""I knew that to honor what the film does, you have to immerse the audience and instantly make them into a community, sitting in the dark, watching something they shouldn't be watching. That reminded me of Rear Window or When a Stranger Calls. As the Paranormal Activity movies do, we wanted to weaponize the mundane."" 

""In the films, it's just a couple in a house, and it's unremarkable, but the set is designed within an inch of its life. Everything is alive in that house, but figuratively, and has a narrative responsibility tied to it. If you're an audience member, you can watch the nucleus of the action. You watch a married couple very familiar to you, arguing in the kitchen, but if your eye wanders up to the bedroom upstairs, maybe a little piece of storytelling is up there, too. It felt like a great way to pull the audience in, but, like you say, 100 million things can go wrong. It's a very treacherous piece of design in terms of all those possibilities for error.""

With tension being key to Paranormal Activity's success in keeping things intimate and audiences on the edge of their seats, does that limit the production from playing specific venues? It's a problem easily solved.

""You have to serve a lot of masters when you're trying to dream up something like that, but a lot of it you don't have control over,"" Holloway muses. ""If your biggest problem is that the house you've placed your show in is too big, that's a pretty good problem to have. You do need intimacy. If we were in an arena, I would have some concerns, but I think we're pretty confident that the intimacy holds even in a huge house. Right now, in Chicago, I think we seat around 700, and that's not nothing. The bigger the house, if you're lucky enough to sell tickets, the more community you have out there, and the more buy-in you get from the audience because your neighbor is as freaked out as you are. When you place it in a too small a house, the texture may change, which might cause the audience to withhold their response. There's something about safety and numbers that I think works very well for the show.""

If you've been lucky enough to see Paranormal Activity already and plan to see it again in another city, don't expect the same show, as it continues to evolve. ""I write for the actor, I write for the human, so those scenes would change from what we've done before. We learn more about what's honest, what isn't, and what is more impactful,"" Holloway reveals. ""There's always that gap between intent and impact, but it changes all the time, and it streamlines, and it mostly just gets pared down to the point where over the course of two iterations, I've lost about 30 pages off the script. It's very lean in pages, because it doesn't ask for much more than that."" 

""I always think there's a lot more storytelling in the negative space than in the ink. I only have so much confidence in the ink. I have much more confidence in every other artist in the room, from actor to designer, to fill in that in the negative space of the page, so a lot of the story is in the silence. It's a negative space which is on brand with the films.""

As we conclude our chat, one thing we've been very clear about is steering clear of spoilers. The reason for this is that the best way to experience the show is to know nothing about what happens, except for the basic storyline. Holloway is so grateful that audiences have understood that and not revealed the surprises. 

""You have to guard your monster,"" the playwright concludes. ""There are some things you can't withhold from an audience. They know from the title that they're going to get paranormal activity. In terms of the pieces of spectacle, the rug pulls, and the puzzle box that we tried to create for the audience to work out the math for themselves, I've been grateful that many of the audience members are really engaged. I think that when you're dealing with a piece of work like this, it creates something conspiratorial in the audience, a shared experience that becomes precious to them. That's the hope. They should be like, 'No, I saw Paranormal Activity and you should too. We'll talk when you do.' For now, that seems to be holding.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","other"

In its North American premiere production from Nov 13 to Dec 7

Center Theatre Group presents Paranormal Activity in its North American premiere production, running November 13 to December 7 at the Ahmanson Theatre as the third attraction of its 2025-2026 season. Based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film difranchise, the original story from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at the McKittrick Hotel, promises thrills and chills galore!



The play centers around newly married couple James and Lou who move from Chicago to London to escape the past. But they soon discover that places aren't haunted and deeply hidden secrets about each other will make them question how well can you really know another person? And can you even believe your eyes?

Here's my conversation with Levi Holloway on the development of the play, how it relates to the film franchise, and the creation of the special effects-filled Ahmanson production.

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today, Levi. I have read about your history of night terrors and dreams. How did that draw you to write plays filled with both horror and humor?

My dream life has always been a confounding, critical part of my identity. When I sleep, I rarely find myself at rest - I think some inner, secret me is trying to say something important. A story about who I am or what the world means to me. I don't know. But I'm led by those stories and try to put them down in ink in a shape that makes sense to me as soon as I wake. Most of my plays come from that. To me, plays, like dreams, have no rules. As far as mixing horror and humor, well, I try to bring as much light as I can into dark places.

Describe working with collaborator Felix Barrett on the production in Chicago which runs just prior to the Los Angeles production.

Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London - working to create an actual nightmare - has been a dream. We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror, right alongside all the mischief we're made to trouble their sleep.

I like to think Felix and I are the same species of storyteller, though really that's giving myself too much credit. We do share a language though, especially when it comes to the horror space. He's so thoughtful, agile, and creative. Full of mischief. And I love the way he sees the world. It's very contagious. Working with him has made me a better artist.

Paranormal Activity draws themes from the award-winning film series of the same name, a franchise of seven horror films that follow supernatural hauntings, primarily centered around a demonic entity. Is that part of your play?

When writing Paranormal, I really only ever concerned myself with the first film. To me, it's a very strong lesson in restraint, in the notion of less being more. I wasn't very compelled by the ideas surrounding a ‘demonic entity' which isn't a reduction - just something I don't have much to say about.

I was more interested in a ghost story. I think we're all haunted in some way. And I think a marriage can bring many ghosts. From the past and present, from the dead and the living. I think when we enter into a marriage, we're forced to contend with those ghosts, to appease them somehow. I wanted to write about how sometimes broken people find each other and try to fix one another, and how often that is an entirely tragic and fruitless endeavor.

Are the two characters in Paranormal Activity, newly-married couple James and Lou, related to the first film's characters Katie and Micah? How so? And if not, how did you develop them?

They are not related. James and Lou are my invention and like all my characters, much of me is in them. I think all writers do that, place themselves, however abstracted, within the people they create. It's the only way I know how to do it, anyway.

Have you previously worked with the two actors (Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger) who portray them? Or the others in the cast? (Shannon Cochran, Kate Fry) If so, where and when?

I've never worked with them but have been a fan of their work for a long time. Patrick and I met as teenagers and I've watched and admired his career since. I'm very glad to have gotten the chance to finally collaborate with him. Shannon and Kate, too, are some of my favorite artists working on the stage. It's quite an ensemble we have, quite the weaponry.

Why did you decide to set the play in London, and why do the characters move there from Chicago?

It's partially a product of a limited imagination. I was traveling from Chicago to London over the course of a year while developing the play. So, I was writing from much of my own experience. I also wanted to isolate the characters, give them no connections abroad. Make them alone together. It's another version of a cabin in the woods.

How does staging this play differ from the experience of watching the movies?

Film directors and editors can manipulate the way you see the characters and story through camera focus and stylistic editing. We don't have the luxury of doing that on stage since everything is done live and in the moment. So, we must capture the attention of the audience from moment to moment to make them feel what they are seeing is real, even if they don't believe their eyes. To accomplish this, we like to hide in plain sight and invite audiences in to bear witness to things they should not see.

Does that “we” refer to illusions by Tony Award winner Chris Fisher (Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter & The Cursed Child) which will again haunt us long after leaving the theater? Can you describe the process the two of us use to create that magic onstage?

No matter what uncanny, absolutely strange idea Felix and I came up with, Chris never said no. He's a mischief maker too. He's a brilliant engineer, making our nightmares materialize. I suspect people will talk about his work on this show for a very long time to come.

How did the two of you work in collaboration with the entire production team, including Fly Davis (Scenic & Costume Designer), Anna Watson (Lighting Designer), Gareth Fry (Sound Designer), Luke Halls (Video & Projections Designer), and Melanie J. Lisby (Production Stage Manager) to make them happen realistically?

Felix, myself and the designers worked together over the course of a year developing, horror-scaping the show. We'd meet and throw ideas at the wall, laughing all the while, delighted by each other's messed up imaginations. It felt like kids in a treehouse, holding flashlights in the dark, never picking truth - always only dare. I can't say enough about them as people and artists and what this collaboration has meant to me. I'm very lucky.

Please describe if and how cast members were frightened by any of the special effects the first time they took place in rehearsal.

The actors have been very brave. It's not easy, holding your body in a near constant state of tension and fear day after day. Even when you see how the sausage is made, it doesn't mean you want to eat it.

Please allow me to change direction for a minute. As someone who also works with special needs actors in the theatre, tell me about your reasons behind co-founding the Neverbird Project, a youth based deaf and hard of hearing theatre company specializing in working with deaf children and creating theatre for deaf people. And are you still actively involved with the project?

I spent nearly 20 years as an educator in Chicago, and a lot of that time was spent in Deaf classrooms. Best job I ever had. I saw the opportunity to give those young artists some work and took it. 90% of the plays I write feature a Deaf character. I plan for that to always be the case. I hope very soon to return to those classrooms, when life allows it. I miss it, them.

Thanks so much!

It's a code, it's a frequency, it's ... something extraterrestrial?

Whatever it is, it's about to change Carol Sturka's (Rhea Seehorn) life. Seehorn leads the new Apple TV+ series from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul  creator Vince Gilligan, which sees Earth's population afflicted with a mysterious virus. Well, everyone but Carol it seems.

Entertainment Weekly has an exclusive look at the mystery's beginnings with a sneak peek of the first four minutes of the sci-fi series, which feature a group of people trying to decode a very interesting signal from ... somewhere. It's like Morse Code. But it's also not. It repeats every 78 seconds and uses pulses and frequencies. It's not bouncing off the moon. And perhaps most importantly, it's coming from 600 lightyears away. ""Imagine the power it took to send it,"" one of the characters says.

Apple TV+

Just as someone says, ""I think I know what it is,"" the series' title card appears. Welcome to Pluribus.

Although Gilligan certainly made a name for himself in more recent years with his beloved dramas, a sci-fi series isn't new to the former X-Files writer — though the premise of Earth's most miserable person having to save humanity from happiness certainly is.

Seehorn's Carol is the aforementioned miserable person, a best-selling author of historical romance novels, whose life is turned upside down when a virus sweeps the planet. As maybe the only person immune to said virus, Carol is left with a lot of questions.

“The drama of the show is that the world's most miserable person is desperately trying to save the planet from happiness,” Gilligan previously told EW, later adding, “She doesn't really want to be tasked with saving the world, but she more or less feels like it's her duty.”

Gilligan created the show specifically with Seehorn in mind, whom he'd worked with across six seasons of Saul. “Initially I was thinking in terms of a male protagonist because that's how I think, being a guy,” he said. “But then I thought, well, what about Rhea? She's so good. She's so funny when she wants to be, but can also break your heart when she wants to.”

See how Seehorn's Carol deals when Pluribus premieres Friday, Nov. 7, on Apple TV+.

Riley Keough will soon be honoring her mom's third anniversary since she passed on January 12, 2023. But just because she is no longer on earth, doesn't mean she no longer has moments where she feels connected to her in unexplainable ways - especially since she cowrote her memoir, From Here to the Great Unknown.

Riley attended the Academy x Chanel's Women's Luncheon on Tuesday, November 4, where she told PEOPLE that she believes she has gotten signs from her mom that she approved of the memoir. 

“I think if you're open to those things, they're kind of everywhere,” Keough told PEOPLE.

Riley finished her memoir in 2023 following her passing. “So, I certainly feel connected to whatever that world may be. I do feel connected to it, yeah. There are certainly moments that are very... too weird to not be something,” the Daisy Jones & The Six star shared.

The 36-year-old did not touch on the specific experiences, but said it will be in the afterword of the paperback version of the book, which will be released next week on November 11. 

It's not the first time Riley has had an experience, and it's something she seems to have gotten from her mother.

Lisa Marie, the only child of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, was only nine when her famous father passed away. Leading up to his passing, she seemed to sense what was coming. 

""I'm apprehensive to say this because the headlines can be crazy, but she did have like a thing where she felt connected to… she was very intuitive,” Riley told Drew Barrymore in 2024. 

“And in a way that wasn't like woo-woo, or, you know, in the clouds—it was very kind of grounded and matter-of-fact. And it was pretty incredible,"" she continued. 

Just as her mom sensed her father Elvis' passing, Riley felt a similar intuition when her mother passed. She was on an airplane, trying to reach her mom, texting her dad, musician Danny Keough, when she sensed that “her mom was departing earth,” as Barrymore described it. 

“I did, yeah. I just had a feeling. I don't know. There had been incidents before—health incidents—and I didn't have the same feeling. Like, I just, I don't know. I felt this sort of surrender in the moment, and yeah, I just had a little bit of a sense,” she said.

Riley even texted her dad to ask if she was gone, and he replied, ""Yes, 2 or 3 minutes ago.""

Celebrity medium Anthony Mrocka started as a skeptic, including toward his first mentor, who spotted him at a free public event and offered to help him. He had always felt psychic readings and all their trappings were a money grab, so he declined. Then she offered to mentor him and help him develop his gifts for free. That's when he became open to the possibility that he might actually have a gift. 

Once you start paying attention, you'll probably notice some weird things start happening, weird things Mrocka told Andrea Miller on the Getting Open podcast. Even more fascinating? Halfway through the episode, Miller admits that after meeting Mrocka, even her brilliant skeptic husband was blown away. 

So, how does it work? Mrocka tells Miller It's like a dream that's so vivid, you wake up and feel a revelation. It's not from you. It comes through you. He also believes everyone is a little psychic, in some ways, and shares how to tap into those ""magical"" talents. 

Allow yourself to be open to your own possible psychic abilities. You have to open your mind to your own abilities and what may not be as conventional as you have previously thought.

We talk about intuition, gut feelings, sixth senses, and other terms for what can also be seen as psychic abilities. Everything is made of energy, protons, electrons, neutrons, atoms, and molecules. That energy includes us. We just need to tune in to the vibration.

RELATED: My Mother Was Dying — So I Called A Psychic

Silence will tune you in to your energy, and all the energy around you, all the vibrations, all the molecules and atoms caught in their kinetic dance. To find silence, you can quiet your mind through meditation, listening to word-free music, or being still for a set period of time.

Meditation isn't only about concentration. It's not sitting there for hours, chanting, or following a checklist. Mediation is about learning to quiet your mind. Research shows that it benefits many areas of your health, well-being and success, possibly by allowing our busy brains to rest and recover. 

However you choose to do it, according to Mrocka, is fine as long as you start to breathe and start to focus on your breath, so you can learn how breath moves and vibrates with energy. Then you may start to feel the energy around you and realize your energy within it.

Listen to what you hear or sense when you walk into a room or start talking to a person. You're probably already sensing their energy, and the energy of the room. Mrocka met strangers, a few of whom he was immediately able to sense their backstory and the struggle they were carrying. He was able to sense their energy by being open to it and letting it flow through him.

At the base of who we are, underneath all the roles we play, the masks we wear, and the filters we perceive through, we are subatomic particles that are vibrating at a specific level. That is energy, we are that energy, so pay attention, and you can read it and understand it.

RELATED: 11 Signs You're Not Depressed Or Anxious, You Just Have Good Situational Awareness

In order to read and understand the energy around us, within ourselves, and inside other people is by practice. You have to test it by working to develop your sensitivity, then intuition, then psychic powers. You can practice by playing games with friends who are aware of what you are doing.

Mrocka would watch reality competition shows and practice reading the contestants to see who might be eliminated next. Spoiler alert: he got really good at it and could ruin the suspense for anyone who watched the shows with him. He suggests doing the same with sports or whatever you're interested in, simply for a fun way to hone your skills. 

RELATED: The Art Of Inner Light: 20 Signs You Were Born To Be A Spiritual Healer

Establish your ethics around when and who you try to read. As Mrocka cautions, ""It's so apparent to me how inextricably connected we all are through our energy, and the conduit is hugely in our emotions."" Thus, we need to be responsible with how we use our energy.

You don't want to tune in to someone without their permission. Mrocka told Miller how, at the beginning, it wasn't going around purposely trying to tune into people. When he would walk by these people and immediately understand everything about them, it was part of his awakening. Once he understood what was happening, he gained better regulation, including something akin to an ""off switch"".

RELATED: 5 Questions To Ask Yourself Before You See A Psychic Or Medium

Realize you've taken on other people's energy, so it is important to have some sort of self-protection. Especially going out into the world, and especially in the world we're in right now. 

Mrockas says, ""Grounding is always going to be the easiest number one way. Just going and putting your bare feet onto the grass somewhere. The other thing is Epsom salt baths. It will make you like new. It's the salt. That's why the ocean is so cleansing.""

It's easy to be a skeptic, but there's no real risk in being open to your own sensitivities, even if you don't believe they're psychic. We are all made of the same energy from the same stars.

Legends really don't ever die, we guess


	By Tony Alpsen

With everyone having Google in their pocket at all times, we'd finally have reached a point where we could put this whole urban legend thing behind us. But lo and behold, here we are in 2025 with people still thinking that Steve from Blue's Clues died from a heroin overdose decades ago. Don't even get us started with Little Mikey from the Life cereal commercials dying from a fatal mixture of Pop Rocks and Coke. Both of them are alive and well, by the way—the last we checked, at least. While we're in this area, we thought we'd take a look at some of the more persistent myths out there, particularly the ones that have affected the world of comedy. Such as…

Texas stand-up hero Bill Hicks died in 1994 at just 32 years old after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer. That's how the “official” story goes anyway; “official” in this case meaning “true.” What's the unofficial story, you ask? Well, some would have you believe that Hicks didn't actually die all those years ago, and that he went on to become infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. How do the people who proposed this theory account for Hicks and Jones having wildly different ideologies? To put it as briefly as it should be: He's under the control of the CIA.

Perhaps one of the earliest rumors ever spread on the internet was that Paul Pfeiffer, best friend of Kevin Arnold on the late '80s/early '90s sitcom The Wonder Years, grew up to be controversial rock star Marilyn Manson. Josh Saviano, the actual actor who played Paul, first heard the rumor from his The Wonder Years co-star Danica McKellar when he was in college, and they've both been asked about it ad nauseam ever since. Saviano didn't even know who Manson (whose real name is Brian Warner) was at the time, but hoped to one day get onstage at one of his concerts and put the rumor to bed for good. He's also been told that he was really Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney, but he's pretty sure that's not true either.

Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro was the subject of a persistent rumor following his appearance in a Pepsi commercial with Michael Jackson back in 1984. Shortly thereafter, word had gotten around that the young Ribeiro had broken his neck while breakdancing on the set of the commercial. And although newspapers tried to dispel the rumors, people would still come up to him on the street and ask how he was alive. Apparently, they think he's supposed to be dead, which, of course, can't be true because he's still on TV to this day; and don't you dare try to convince us that Bill Hicks has been hosting America's Funniest Home Videos this whole time.

Well-known prankster Andy Kaufman, like Bill Hicks, passed away from cancer in his 30s. However, his penchant for practical jokes has led many to believe that he faked his death in 1984. Several people who knew him have said in the years since that he talked about doing just that in private conversations, and a documentary exploring the possibility was released in 2023. Kaufman's brother, Michael, even helped keep the idea of the hoax alive when he brought a woman on stage in 2013 who said that she was Andy's daughter and that her comedian father really had faked his death. Michael Kaufman later backtracked, saying he had, in fact, been the victim of a hoax perpetrated by the woman.

How much is Elon Musk worth?

That question is at the core of the debate over the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package. This afternoon, the company will reveal the results of the shareholder vote on the compensation plan, which could be worth up to $1 trillion.

The stakes are high, and not just because we're talking about a salary that would dwarf most countries' GDPs. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm warned voting against it could risk Musk leaving the company entirely.

As of this morning, prediction markets have the pay package getting approved as the heavy favorite. But there have been some vocal opponents, including the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.

So who is for and against the comp package, and what are some of their arguments? Let's break it down.

For the pay package

Key supporters: Cathie Wood, Wedbush Securities, Charles Schwab

Musk has gotten Tesla investors this far: No CEO and company are more intertwined than Musk and Tesla. Love him or hate him, Musk comes with a legion of fans who have heavily supported Tesla. Over the past five years, shares are up more than 215%. That's far better than the S&P 500 and roughly equal or better than most of its Big Tech peers.

Tesla is in the middle of a big shift: Losing someone of Musk's stature is never easy, but it'd be particularly tricky as Tesla pivots from its EV roots to go all-in on AI. It's a big switch into an intensely competitive field, and having to navigate it with a new CEO at the helm isn't something shareholders will likely be interested in.

It's $1 trillion, with a catch: As big as $1 trillion is, the package is contingent on a series of goals, including raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion. If Tesla's valuation were to increase that much over the next decade — it's currently worth roughly $1.43 trillion — some feel that's a fair reward for the work Musk would need to do to get there.

Against the pay package

Key supporters: New York State Retirement Fund, American Federation of Teachers, CalPERS

Hitching your wagon to Elon isn't always smooth: You have to take the good with the bad when it comes to Musk, and recently, the bad has been really bad. Musk's breakup with President Donald Trump proved to be a real low point for Tesla and its share price. And Musk is unlikely to change his shoot-from-the-hip approach.

A distracted Musk: One of the biggest gripes against Musk is that he's too busy. His other endeavors — SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company — suck up a lot of his time. And the ties between the companies, or his ""Muskonomy,"" isn't going anywhere as he calls on Tesla to invest in xAI.

Too much control: A key piece of the package is Musk's voting stake potentially rising to nearly 29% (he's currently at about 13%). Musk has been adamant about the need for this as Tesla enters its new era, but some are uncomfortable with someone so powerful getting even more control over the company.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Thursday said it will start late-stage trials on its experimental amylin obesity drug next month after it showed encouraging results in a mid-stage study.

The highest dose of the weekly injection, called eloralintide, helped patients with obesity or who are overweight lose 20.1% of their body weight on average at 48 weeks. The results support the pharmaceutical giant's efforts to bring next-generation treatments to the blockbuster weight loss drug market, and solidify its dominance in the segment. 

The data bolsters Eli Lilly's chances of bringing a strong competitor to the red-hot amylin space, in particular. Many industry analysts view so-called amylin analogs as the next wave of obesity treatments that could serve as an alternative or complementary option to existing injections targeting gut hormone GLP-1. 

Several large drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie have shelled out billions to buy or license experimental amylin treatments, and Novo Nordisk is developing its own drugs. Novo Nordisk — Eli Lilly's chief rival in the obesity market — and Pfizer are also in the midst of a heated takeover war over Metsera, whose pipeline includes a potential once-monthly amylin drug. 

Amylin analogs mimic a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Amylin treatments have a similar effect to GLP-1s like Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro, but some analysts and researchers say it could be easier for patients to tolerate and help them preserve lean muscle mass. 

The lowest dose of Eli Lilly's injection helped people lose 9.5% of their weight at 48 weeks, compared to 0.4% among those who received a placebo. Patients who used a two-step dose escalation – starting at a 6 milligram dose and increasing to a 9 milligram dose – lost 19.9% of their weight at 48 weeks. People who used a three-step dose escalation that started at 3 milligrams lost 16.4% of their weight.

The most common side effects of the injection were mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue, which were observed more frequently in patients who took higher doses of the drug, according to Eli Lilly. Patients in groups that gradually increased doses of the drug saw lower side effects. 

The company has yet to release detailed data on side effect rates and how many patients discontinued the treatment during the trial. Eli Lilly will present the data at the ObesityWeek scientific conference in Atlanta on Thursday.

            It's the smoking gun behind the most spectacular heist this side of the Millennium.
    


            A French court released a report Thursday slamming the leadership of the Louvre for its focus on headline-grabbing purchases and renovation projects over maintaining the security of on of the world's largest museums.
    


            The audacious daytime robbery, which saw four men walk away with priceless historic jewellery, was a “deafening alarm signal,” Pierre Moscovici, president of the Court of Accounts, which authored the report, told journalists Thursday.
    


            Echoing the report, which was commissioned before the October 19 heist, he said that the museum leadership had prioritized “visible and attractive” projects, like art purchases and revamping the museum layout at the detriment, notably, of the Louvre's security .
    


            Since the heist, information has resurfaced showing that  gaps in security appear to have been known for years – including a 2014 warning that alleged one of the museum's key passwords was simply “LOUVRE.” The new report only adds to a number of security failings exposed by the heist.
    


            So what went wrong?
    


            Within four minutes of arriving at the outside wall of the Louvre, the thieves had scaled the building and were breaking through a window. Only then were internal alarms triggered. Four minutes later, after breaking into a reinforced case and grabbing nine pieces of historic jewelry, the thieves were making their escape.
    


            “The weaknesses of the protection of our perimeter are known and identified,” Louvre director Laurence des Cars told lawmakers after the heist.
    


            Internally too, the situation seems stark.
    


            For the Louvre's 465 museum galleries, security staff had only 432 CCTV cameras to monitor the interior in 2024, according to the report. While that's a nearly 50% increase on the number available in 2019, it still left 61% of the galleries without any CCTV coverage.
    


            The world's largest museum, the Louvre covers some 652,300 square feet.
    


            In comparison, the Detroit Institute of Arts boasts a similar footprint (including a theatre and recital hall) but has over 550 CCTV cameras, according to camera manufacturer Axis.
    


            Des Cars told French senators that she envisions a doubling of the number of cameras within the 37-hectare Louvre property in the years to come.
    


            In its recommendations, the Court of Accounts' report stressed the need for the Louvre to “strengthen its internal control function, which remains underdeveloped for an institution the size of the Louvre.”
    


            The holes in the Louvre's security weren't all physical. In the virtual realm its track record left much to be desired.
    


            A 2014 report from the French information security agency (ANSSI) seen by French daily Liberation claimed that the password for the server managing the museums' sprawling CCTV network was simply “LOUVRE.” Access to software managed by the security technology company Thales was protected by a similarly foolproof password: “THALES” – according to Liberation.
    


            In the security audit, ANSSI reportedly recommended the Louvre boost its cyber security as well as move away from outdated software that could jeopardize its protective stance.
    


            ANSSI did not deny the report to CNN but added that the audit, “cannot be considered representative of the current level of security” of the Louvre's IT systems.
    


            The report focused on the museum's budgetary priorities in recent years, which saw some 27 million euros ($31.1 million) spent on maintenance works between 2018 and 2024, with a further 60 million on restoration of the Louvre palace.
    


            In contrast, that period saw the Louvre splash double that figure on altering the museum layout and buying up artworks.
    


            The museum spent 105 million euros on artworks in the six years to 2024, sweeping up 2,754 pieces in that time.
    


            In 2021, the Louvre spent some 5 million euros on two works by French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In April 2025, the Louvre made a 2.2-million euro purchase of an “exceptional” Fabergé triptych.
    


            Many of the Louvre's purchases are clouded in a certain secrecy, particularly regarding the purchase price. The Court of Accounts' report said the Louvre should pay greater attention to the price of acquired works and specifically warned the museum against buying art works at a higher price if they were sold at auction for less than two years prior.
    


            In contrast to the focus on glitzy, eye-catching purchases, the damning report notes astonishing delays to work on the Louvre's security infrastructure.  Recommended security upgrades from a 2015 audit still won't be completed until 2032, it revealed.
    


            The report examined nearly eight years of museum operations across periods helmed by two executives.
    


            At the time of publication, no executives (or other staff) have been fired or resigned over the theft.
    


            The offer of des Cars to resign as museum director was not accepted by French Culture Minister Rachida Dati.
    


            Dati – known as something of a political bulldog in France – has aggressively defended the Louvre since the embarrassment of the October 19 heist.
    


            “Did the Louvre Museum's security measures fail? No, they didn't. It's a fact. The Louvre Museum's security measures worked,” she told lawmakers on October 21.
    


            The following day, Macron requested an acceleration of improved security measures at the museum.
    


            The following week, Dati had softened her tone, admitting to French senators that although installed security systems had functioned and staff had followed protocol “to the letter,” the “spectacular theft” was obviously a failure for the museum.
    


            “Security failures did indeed occur,” she said.

            A Ukrainian court has found a Russian soldier guilty of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war in a January 2024 incident and sentenced him to life in prison, in the first ruling of its kind.
    


            Dmitriy Kurashov, 27, was convicted by a court in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia for shooting dead a Ukrainian soldier who had just surrendered to his unit.
    


            According to Ukraine's security service, Kurashov had previously served time in a Russian prison for theft, and in November 2023, he signed a contract with the Russian defense ministry in exchange for amnesty.
    


            The court found Kurashov guilty of firing on the Ukrainian soldier at point blank range during an attack in the vicinity of the village of Pryiutne in the Zaporizhzhia region on January 6, 2024.
    


            The soldier  had already surrendered during the battle after running out of ammunition, the security service said. According to the prosecutor, the Ukrainian came out of a dugout unarmed, raised his hands and clearly indicated his surrender. At the request of the Russian soldier, he knelt down, but was shot with an automatic weapon and died on the spot.
    


            In a separate case, a Russian soldier who had been accused of robbing a house in the village of Blystavitsy in the Bucha district of the Kyiv region in March 2022 was found not guilty. This ruling was based on a lack of evidence.
    


            Kurashov's sentencing is unprecedented, marking the first time a Russian soldier has been jailed for killing a captured Ukrainian since the start of the war.
    


            Kyiv says many Ukrainian prisoners of war have been killed by Russia's forces, but there have so far been no legal ramifications.
    


            Earlier this year, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office said it had, as of May 5, opened 75 criminal investigations into the suspected executions of 268 Ukrainian prisoners of war.
    


            It said the number of alleged executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war has been rising, with eight cases involving 57 soldiers in 2022, eight cases involving 11 soldiers in 2023, 39 cases with 149 soldiers in 2024, and 20 cases up to May 5 this year, with 51 soldiers.

Natalie Jamison, senior wealth advisor at ScotiaMcLeod, uses her podcast to teach financial literacy to young people and combat the influence of unlicensed ‘finfluencers.'Supplied

In the Behind the Advice series, Globe Advisor asks advisors about their relationship with money from a young age, lessons learned over the years and how their experiences influence the advice they give to clients. We've also launched a Behind the Advice podcast – find all the episodes here.

Natalie Jamison, senior wealth advisor at ScotiaMcLeod, a division of Scotia Capital Inc., in Oakville, Ont., talks about growing up with a stockbroker dad, getting an inheritance at age 10, and why she went from being a hotelier to an advisor:

Describe your upbringing.

I was born in Toronto and raised in Montreal. My mom, originally from France, wanted my sister and me to have a more immersive French experience. She worked in administration at Air France and Swissair, which meant we could travel for free a lot. It sparked my lifelong love of travel. 

My dad, a stockbroker-turned-wealth manager, had the greatest influence on my career path. He was adamant that my sister and I learn to manage money. I remember him teaching me how to read stock market quotes in the newspaper when I was a kid. 

What was your experience with money growing up?

My father's income was steady, but it fluctuated month to month. We could always sense when it had been a strong commission period or when things were a little tighter. 

I have a very precise memory of Black Monday in 1987, when my dad came home and talked about whether he'd earn any money for the next month. As a kid, that really sticks with you. But he always budgeted and set aside cash for a rainy day, so we didn't panic because we knew we had a fallback. 

My dad taught me that true financial stability doesn't come from how much you earn, but from how well you manage it. Budgeting wisely and setting aside cash for a rainy day are core values I still live by.

Describe your first money lesson.

When I was 10, my great-grandmother left me $5,000 in her will, which was a lot of money back then, and especially for someone my age. I remember my dad asking me if I trusted him to safeguard it until I was older. I said yes, mostly because I was young and didn't know any better, but I'll never forget how that question made me feel. He was saying, ‘This money belongs to you, and you'll decide what to do with it when the time comes.' That was very empowering. 

I earmarked the money for my education. However, I did use a little bit of it to make my first investment when I was 13. I bought shares of Canadian Pacific Railway. At the time, the company owned many of Canada's iconic hotels, including the Banff Springs Hotel, the Château Frontenac in Quebec and the Royal York Hotel in Toronto. 

I remember my dad making a lesson out of it. He took me to the Royal York, and as we walked through the lobby, he said: ‘You own a piece of this.' After that first purchase, I was hooked, especially when the dividend cheques started arriving every three months. 

What did you want to be when you grew up, and how did you get into financial services?

I wanted to be a hotelier and attended a Swiss hospitality business school. I was fortunate to work at renowned properties such as the Beau-Rivage Palace, Montreux Palace, Swissôtel, Sheraton Centre and Park Plaza Hotel. During that time, I met my husband, who was also in hospitality management. 

After we got married, we realized quickly that our careers posed challenges for raising a young family, as hotels never close and we were always on call. I asked my dad if I could transfer my skills to the financial services sector. He agreed but made it clear that I needed to get hired on my own merit. 

So, I interviewed with Richardson Greenshields in 1996 and landed my first job cold-calling prospective investors. After gaining the right credentials, I worked alongside my father for 21 years before starting my own wealth advisory business.

What's the biggest money mistake you've made, and what did you learn from it?

Not signing up for the company stock purchase plan once I became eligible to participate. I missed out on so many free bank shares and dividend reinvestments. Now, when a new team member is onboarded, I make sure they sign up as soon as they can. 

What are you best at when it comes to your own finances? 

Ignoring the noise and buying when others are fearful. I've lived through several major stock market corrections, including the 1998 Asian financial crisis, the dot-com collapse in 2000, the 2008 global financial crisis and the global pandemic in 2020. I've learned to use those moments as opportunities.

What do you worry about when it comes to money, both personally and in the industry?

I'm most worried about the next generation receiving their wealth advice from unlicensed ‘finfluencers.' I think it's why I spend so much time teaching financial literacy to young people, including through my #FinancialFriday podcast. 

It came about after my daughter told me she found it boring to learn about finances at the dinner table. She suggested I create short podcasts she can listen to instead. So, being a good mom and a wealth advisor, that's what I did.

What advice do you have for someone who wants to enter your business?

This is a relationship business. It's about creating client experiences, building trust and delivering exceptional service. You don't just need a finance degree to be a successful advisor; you also need a certain degree of soft skills and emotional quotient. It's a vocation.

Russia says it has nearly surrounded the frontline city and is close to capturing it, after over a year of fighting. Meanwhile, South Africa is probing how 17 of its citizens were lured to fight in the war. DW has more.

Russia says its forces have made advances in Pokrovsk, a crucial battleground in Donetsk

Moscow has been trying to capture the key city for over a year

South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an investigation into how the men were recruited to fight in the war

It is unclear whether the South Africans are fighting for Russia or Ukraine

US and EU energy ministers and executives from top American liquified natural gas (LNG) companies are meeting in Greece to discuss ways to better supply Ukraine

US President Donald Trump is trying to boost gas exports to Europe

Below is a roundup of developments related to Russia's war in Ukraine on Thursday, November 6: 

A court in Ukraine on Thursday sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW).

The life sentence is the first of its kind against a soldier since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine's SBU security service said.

The Russian soldier was found guilty by the court in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia of shooting a Ukrainian soldier who had surrendered in January 2024 when he was captured by Russian forces.

He was later taken prisoner along with other Russian soldiers.

According to Ukrainian authorities, the convicted soldier had recruited into the Russian military in exchange for early release from prison after being convicted of theft.

Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie has visited Kherson on the frontlines in eastern Ukraine. Her trip was supported by the Legacy of War Foundation.

The city, which was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November 2022, remains one of the most dangerous in the country. Russian forces still occupy most of the region of Kherson.  

During her trip Jolie met with medical staff, volunteers and civilians in Kherson, which comes under near-constant attacks from Russian forces.

""The people of Mykolaiv and Kherson live with danger every day, but they refuse to give in,"" Jolie said in a statement released on Thursday.

Jolie, a former special envoy for the UN's Refugee Agency (UNHCR), was pictured in a basement wearing body armor as well as meeting children in a room.

She also visited medical and education centers that have been brought underground amid the Russian onslaught.

Before the war, the city's population was nearly 300,000. In March 2022, Russian troops occupied the city, which is the biggest urban center that is within range of Russian artillery, before they withdrew that November to the other bank of the Dnipro river.

The deputy head of the Kherson regional administration, Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, told Ukrainian television that locals were ""very grateful"" for her visit.

""Sometimes it seems that we have been forgotten, but we can see that this is not the case,"" he said.

Jolie previously visited Lviv in western Ukraine in April 2022.

Russian forces have advanced in the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk amid house-to-house battles with Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday.

Russia said it had captured 64 buildings in the city, which used to be home to some 60,000 people, over the past 24 hours and pushed back Ukrainian attacks.

The strategically located city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region is a major hotspot in the war between Russia and Ukraine.

For more than a year, there has been heavy fighting in this frontline city. Russian troops have been using a pincer movement to surround Pokrovsk and cut the city off from its supply lines.

Kyiv has denied Russian claims that its forces are surrounded, although it acknowledged that the situation in the city has become difficult.  

Moscow says seizing Pokrovsk, which has been dubbed the ""gateway to Donetsk,"" would allow it to move north towards Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the largest of the two remaining Ukrainian-held cities in the southeastern region.

Russia is aiming to take the entire Donbas region, which is known for its heavy industry and coal reserves.

Moscow controls most of the region, with Ukraine still holding about 10% of the territory.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday morning that Russia had launched 135 strike drones overnight.

The strikes were mostly concentrated on the Dnipro region, Zelenskyy said on Telegram. At least eight people were injured in the city of Kamianske, where a residential building and railway infrastructure were damaged.

Russian strikes also targeted the regions of Sumy, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv, the Ukrainian president added.

""The targets are our critical infrastructure, everything that supports normal peaceful life,"" Zelenskyy said.

He said that the continued Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities and civilians was proof that Western pressure on Moscow ""is currently insufficient.""

Ukraine's allies in Europe have been discussing using seized Russian assets to fund Kyiv's defense, but have so far failed to implement the initiative.

""It is time to make a decision regarding Russian frozen assets. The political will is already there, and we count on the prompt implementation of the technical solution. It is absolutely fair that the aggressor's money works to protect against his war,"" Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine's armed forces said Thursday that it had struck an oil refinery in southern Russia, which sparked a fire.

The general staff also said that it had struck several targets in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine, which included a drone base in Donetsk and industrial sites in Crimea.

The drone strike on the refinery in Volgograd killed at least one person, the city's governor said.

Andrei Bocharov said a 48-year-old man was killed by shrapnel. 

According to Russian state media, the Ukrainian drone attack saw flight services at 13 airports across Russia to be suspended.

Energy ministers from Europe and the United States were meeting in the Greek capital, Athens, on Thursday to discuss how to use a regional network of pipelines to provide war-battered Ukraine with gas.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, along with energy ministers from the European Union and leading American liquefied natural gas (LNG) company executives, were taking part in the talks.

The meeting, hosted by Washington-based think tank the Atlantic Council, comes as US President Donald Trump looks to increase exports of LNG to Europe.

The US is the world's leading LNG exporter. The Trump administration is trying to leverage that position to pressure Europe into buying more American gas by tying energy exports to ongoing trade talks.

Wright said he welcomed the European Commission's plans to phase out Russian gas supplies to the bloc in the next two years, which will ""both starve the Russian war machine and build a growing future relationship"" between the US and Europe.

Since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe — already the largest market for US LNG  has been trying to ween itself off of Russian gas supplies.

As part of that diversification of gas sources, Western energy ministers and executives are looking at a north-south gas pipeline initiative linking Greece with central and eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Ukraine, known as the Vertical Corridor.

Speaking late Wednesday during talks with US officials, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Greece is the ""natural entry point for American liquefied natural gas into Europe"" due to the country's ""very unique geographic location.""

""The Vertical Corridor is a project of great geopolitical and economic importance to us,"" Mitsotakis said, adding that ""we are very happy that it's becoming a reality.""

Seventeen South African nationals believed to be fighting with mercenary groups in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine have sent pleas to the government in Pretoria to help bring them home, the South African presidency said Thursday.

In a statement, the presidency said it had ""received distress calls for assistance to return home from seventeen (17) South African men, between the ages of 20-39 years, who are trapped in the war-torn Donbas.""

The men were ""lured to join mercenary forces involved in the Ukraine-Russia war under the pretext of lucrative employment contracts,"" the statement said.

It is not clear whether the men were fighting for Russia or Ukraine. The industrial Donbas region is a key front in the war.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an inquiry into how the men were recruited.

It is illegal for South African citizens to fight for foreign armies without government authorization.

The government issued a warning in August to young people over fake job offers on social media to go to Russia, amid reports that women had been lured there to produce drones.

In March 2024, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed at least 14 South African mercenaries had been killed fighting in Ukraine since the start of the conflict in February 2022.

The South African government said Thursday that it has received what it said were ""distress calls"" from 17 men who are fighting with mercenary forces in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

It is not clear which side the South Africans were recruited to fight for.

Meanwhile, energy ministers from the European Union are meeting with their US counterpart and leading American LNG company executives in Greece to discuss ways to provide war-torn Ukraine with gas supplies.

Russia has regularly struck Ukrainian energy infrastructure during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began over three and a half years ago.

Ukraine has also been targeting Russia's energy production capacities. Kyiv struck an oil refinery in Russia's southern Volgograd city overnight, killing at least one person, Russian officials said.

Andrew Mountbatten Windsor has been summoned to appear before Congress which is investigating abuse claims against him.

In a letter sent to the former Duke of York on Thursday, Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee said they believed he may also have crucial information about co-conspirators and enablers of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.

“The Oversight Committee will investigate allegations of abuse by Mountbatten Windsor, and will seek information on Epstein's operations, network, and associates based on the men's longstanding and well-documented friendship,” they say.

Robert Garcia, the most senior Democratic member of the committee, said: “Rich and powerful men have evaded justice for far too long.

“Now, former Prince Andrew has the opportunity to come clean and provide justice for the survivors.”

Their request was sent a day after the disgraced royal also lost the title of “prince” and the designation “his royal highness”.

Andrew is also moving from Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he has lived for more than 20 years.

He has been under renewed scrutiny after the publication of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir detailed her three encounters with him.

Andrew has denied all wrongdoing and previously said his relationship with Epstein “was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal family”.

In their letter, the representatives said the former Duke's friendship with Epstein reportedly began in 1999 and that they remained close even after the financier's 2008 conviction for procuring minors for prostitution.

“It has also been reported that you travelled with Epstein to his New York residence, the Queen's residence at Balmoral, and to Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands, where you have been accused of abusing minors,” they wrote.

“This close relationship with Epstein, coupled with the recently revealed 2011 email exchange in which you wrote to him ‘we are in this together,' further confirms our suspicion that you may have valuable information about the crimes committed by Epstein and his co-conspirators.”

They ask that he respond to their request by Nov 20, because of the “urgency and gravity” of the matter.

Congress is limited in its powers to compel foreigners to answer questions. It cannot issue subpoenas for foreign nationals living overseas and has to rely on persuasion instead.

As a private citizen with not a single title to his name, there would be nothing to stop him from co-operating with the committee.

His advisors have often pointed out that having been forced by Buckingham Palace to settle his civil claim with Giuffre for the good of the institution, he has never been given the chance to clear his name.

But as his disastrous 2019 Newsnight interview proved, he does not respond well to acute questioning and could easily implicate himself.

His team is likely to warn that in the circumstances, not least following the death of Giuffre, he has little to gain from being interviewed.

Suhas Subramanyam, a Virginia representative, said it was vital that Andrew co-operated with the investigation.

Andrew's relationship with Epstein exploded back into public view with the publication of Giuffre's memoir. She took her own life six months before it was published in October.

The book describes how she was sexually exploited by Epstein and his rich and powerful associates.

She claims she had three encounters with Andrew, starting when she was 17 and he was 41, and accuses him of being “entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright”.

She said she first met Andrew in 2001 at Ghislaine Maxwell's house.

After dinner and dancing at a club, they returned home and she drew him a bath.

“He seemed in a rush to have intercourse. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent,” she wrote. “In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.”

She said Epstein later gave her $15,000 “for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy'.”

Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in February 2022. He paid her a reported £12m but the terms of the settlement included no admission of guilt from the former Duke.

He has strongly denied any allegations of sexual misconduct.

Andrew came under further scrutiny after The Telegraph revealed last month that he had met a senior Chinese official at the centre of a spy scandal at least three times.

The then Duke of York held meetings in 2018 and 2019 with Cai Qi, one of the most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party and a close ally of Xi Jinping, China's president.

Andrew's office said he had “ceased all contact” with the alleged spy. The pair had met through official channels and did not discuss matters of a “sensitive nature”, according to a statement from his office.

The House Oversight Committee earlier revealed that it had obtained financial records from the Epstein estate that included $200 for a “massage for Andrew” on February 11 2000.

The details “raise serious questions regarding the nature of your relationship with Mr Epstein and related financial transactions,” they say in their letter.

Live Updates


• Looming flight cuts: The Trump administration said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports — including major hubs like New York City, Chicago and Atlanta — starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the impasse, potentially impacting thousands of flights. According to an airline official, the administration is also weighing a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow, increasing by 1% each day the shutdown drags on.
    


• Negotiations ongoing: Key sticking points remain as centrist Democrats try to hammer out a deal with Republicans to end the longest shutdown in history. Some Democratic senators — emboldened by their party's wins in Tuesday's elections — are ramping up pressure to not yield to the GOP without a real victory on health care.
    


            • Food aid: The US Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, revised its SNAP reduction plan to provide more partial benefits in November — though some beneficiaries could still see much less aid than usual.
    


            United Airlines will preemptively cancel about 200 flights starting tomorrow, the airline tells CNN.
    


            That's roughly 4% of United's Friday schedule and is comprised of mostly regional flights. United says it will cancel about 4% again on Saturday and Sunday.
    


Some background: The announcement from United came as the Trump administration is considering a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow, an airline official familiar with the proposal told CNN. The proposal is preliminary and nothing is final, a separate source said.
    


            A federal judge in Rhode Island will consider this afternoon whether he should order the Trump administration to provide 42 million Americans with their full food stamp benefits for November amid the government shutdown.
    


            The hearing before US District Judge John McConnell is the latest high-stakes courtroom showdown over the funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, which the administration had attempted to defund amid the government shutdown.
    


            McConnell, of the federal court in Providence, and another judge in Boston said last week that the administration must tap into contingency funds to provide at least partial SNAP benefits this month, leaving it up to government to decide whether to pull money from a separate fund to fully cover this month's benefits. The administration said on Monday that it opted to only use the contingency funds.
    


            But after the government notified McConnell of its plans, a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses that brought the legal challenge pressed the judge to intervene yet again, arguing the USDA's choice did not comport with his requirement that the government work “expeditiously” to ensure payments are made.
    


            The plaintiffs are asking the appointee of former President Barack Obama to issue a new order that would force the administration to tap into the separate pot of money to provide full SNAP benefits for November.
    


            The Trump administration is considering a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow — increasing by 1% each day the shutdown drags on — an airline official familiar with the proposal told CNN.
    


            The proposal is preliminary and nothing is final, a separate source said.
    

The Federal Aviation Administration will reduce flights at dozens of major airports as early as Friday if no shutdown deal is reached, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced at a news conference. CNN's Pete Muntean reports on how airlines are responding.


            More airports are seeing delays today due to air traffic control staffing issues across the country, including at major hubs like Washington, DC and New York.
    


            Here's where the latest issues are being reported:
    


            A total of 434 staffing problems have been reported by the FAA since the start of the shutdown, more than four times the number on the same days last year.
    


            Even if the government reopens tomorrow, travelers should expect there to be residual impacts from the shutdown as the holiday season approaches, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA).
    


                    “It will take us months to come out of all the impacts that it's causing. Regardless, there's probably going to be headaches and delays around Thanksgiving because of just the ripple effect,” Daniels said.
                





            “There were delays before the shutdown. There's obviously delays during the shutdown. There's going to be delays after the shutdown,” he added.
    


            Air traffic controllers are bearing the brunt of the historic government shutdown, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told CNN.
    


                    “Controllers are resigning every day now because of the prolonged nature of the shutdown. We hadn't seen that before. And we're also 400 controllers short — shorter than we were in the 2019 shutdown,” Nick Daniels told CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown.
                





            The Department of Transportation said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports — including major hubs — starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the shutdown. Daniels said the move is necessary to help mitigate safety risks.
    


            He also said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford will need to monitor the situation closely, “but they are taking those proactive steps of putting a smaller level of capacity to the airspace or a smaller number of flights” so that controllers can “provide the best service they can.”
    


            Despite these efforts, Daniels acknowledged that controllers are still experiencing levels of “hopelessness”  the longer the shutdown drags on.
    


            Asked if some controllers are calling out sick in protest, Daniels said the situation is more complicated.
    


                    “They're not calling in sick. They're not calling in protest. They're calling in with real-life situations,” Daniels said. He added that some employees are calling in saying they can't afford gas for their cars to get to work or childcare because they haven't been paid for 37 days.
                





            Daniels went on to explain that while controllers will eventually recieve back pay once the government reopens, “it probably will drag on for over two-and-a-half months for them to actually be made whole from what's going on now. And that's another part of the problem is that they know that it takes so long for the government to catch up in that direction.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a key senator involved in the talks to reach a deal to open the government as soon as this week, touted “productive” bipartisan conversations as lawmakers work through sticking points.
    


            “I think talks continue to be productive, and hopefully we can get to a resolution. I think we need to get government back up,” she said, stressing the importance of restoring SNAP benefits and paychecks to federal employees.
    


            Pressed by on concerns by some in her party that the guarantee of a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies without more substantial assurances it will become law is not sufficient, Shaheen responded, “Everybody will have an opportunity to have their input and to vote on what we do.”
    


                    “We ought to be able to keep the government open and make sure that people are not forced off their health insurance because they can't pay,” she said, noting that she's been talking to Republicans who are also interested in extending the ACA credits.
                





            Shaheen criticized Speaker Mike Johnson declining to commit to bringing an ACA vote to the House floor, telling Raju, “I can't speak for the speaker. If he doesn't understand that people can't afford their health insurance rates, then he's got a problem.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal made clear he wants an extension of ACA credits to be included in the plan to reopen the government, saying the “vague promise” of a separate vote would be a “mistake.”
    


                    “I think voters would rightly see it as a surrender,” he said.
                





            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he will be watching for progress out of this afternoon's Democratic policy lunch to see if there will be enough centrist members of that party who will decide to vote to end the government shutdown.
    


            “There are Democrats who are inclined to do the right thing. They're under an enormous amount of pressure from the left,” he told reporters. “We'll see if they hold sway today and hopefully we'll know more about that as the day rolls on.”
    


            He was asked if he will keep the Senate in session this weekend and into next week's schedule Veterans Day recess if a deal is not reached.
    


                    “That depends a little bit on what happens if there's a path forward to vote, whether that's today, tomorrow, Saturday. We'll stay and do that. If the far left wins out in this and the Dems dig in then, I don't know. We'll see. I think all options will be on the table,” he said.
                





            Thune said he met Wednesday with two of the negotiators from the Democrats' side. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire.
    


            Asked about Democratic concerns that while he has offered to let Democrats have a vote by a date certain on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which is at the center of the debate over the standoff, Speaker Mike Johnson is balking at one in the House.
    


            “I can't speak for the House,” he said. “I think the clear path forward here, with regard to the ACA issue is they get a vote, and we open up the government and we head down to the White House and sit down with the President and talk about it.”
    


            Thune said he did not think it was needed to bring President Donald Trump into the shutdown talks at present.
    


            Top Democrats are praising California Rep. Nancy Pelosi following her announcement this morning that she would not seek reelection after this term.
    


            In a statement, Former President Joe Biden reiterated his belief that Pelosi was the best person to serve as speaker of the US House of Representatives.
    


            “I often said Nancy Pelosi was the best Speaker of the House in American history — it's why I awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” Biden wrote on X. “When I was President, we worked together to grow our economy, create millions of jobs, and make historic investments in our nation's future. She has devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful. Jill and I wish Nancy and Paul all the best.”
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also praised Pelosi as a historic figure in the party and the US House, writing, “Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi is an iconic, heroic, trailblazing, legendary and transformational leader. She is the greatest Speaker of all time.”
    


            He added later: “During her 20 years leading House Democrats, she fiercely navigated many trials and tribulations, including a once-in-a-century pandemic, a horrific attack on the United States Capitol and a violent attempt on her husband's life. Through it all, she led with strength and dignity. Like Esther, she was Speaker and Leader for such a time as this. Personally, Speaker Pelosi has been an incredible mentor, trusted friend and awesome colleague who has profoundly blessed me with her insights, perspectives and leadership values.”
    


            Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene slammed House leadership for not holding a session during the shutdown — which is now the longest in US history.



                    “You know, I was telling my staff on the way here, I said, ‘I voted to fund the government on September 18, and here we are today as November 6.' And the House has not been in session since then. And I just — I truly believe that's an utter failure,” the congresswoman from Georgia told CNN's Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer while discussing Tuesday's election results.
                





            “And you can't expect people to show up and be passionate about voting for you, when you're not even going to work, and they're going to work every single day and struggling to pay their bills,” Greene said.
    


            Greene also said she is happy to hear that President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster to end the shutdown.
    


            Greene said she spoke to Trump about using the so-called nuclear option “some time ago.”
    


            “I said, ‘Mr. President, this is the only way you're going to get your agenda across.' And I called for it,” Greene said. “I think it was early October, I actually started calling saying that, you know, Democrats should vote to fund the government, but Republicans are equally responsible. And if they're serious about funding the government, they should use the nuclear option and override the filibuster to get it done. And so, I'm very pleased to see President Trump saying the same thing I'm saying.”
    


            Asked by CNN whether President Donald Trump's remarks saying Republicans are being blamed for the shutdown were helpful for negotiations, House Speaker Mike Johnson revealed that he spoke with Trump directly to give his own view of the political implications.
    


                    “I've spoken to the president about it. I reminded him, as I said this morning, this is not a surprise to us,” Johnson said. “Blue states elected blue leaders. So what?”
                





            “I don't read too much into that,” he added.
    


            Johnson again sought to downplay the results from Tuesday's elections.
    


            “There were no surprises on Tuesday night, OK? You had blue states and blue cities that voted the glue to the alarm of no one, to the surprise of no one. That was what was expected,” he said.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson said he would not guarantee a vote in the House on extending expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies — even if Senate GOP leaders ultimately make that commitment to end the shutdown.
    


                    “No, because we did our job and I'm not part of the negotiations,” Johnson said. Pressed further on his position, he added: “I'm not promising anybody anything.”
                





            Johnson's remarks underscore some of Democrats' biggest fears in their negotiations: Even if Senate Majority Leader John Thune allows a vote on health care, there would likely be no such vote in the House and would therefore infuriate the rest of their party.
    


            On the state of shutdown talks, Johnson said he is personally “less optimistic” about them.
    


            “I can tell you honestly I'm less optimistic this morning than I was yesterday. Because we were hearing there were some common-sense centrist Democrats who were talking to Republicans but what I understand is that Chuck Schumer has pulled them back from that. They're being instructed and told they can't go there,” Johnson said.
    


            At least three major US airlines are waiving fees for travelers who want to cancel or change their upcoming flights due to tomorrow's looming cuts to 10% of air traffic at 40 major airports.
    


            In a notice to passengers, Delta Air Lines is allowing passengers “to change, cancel or refund their flights, including… basic economy fares, without penalty.”
    


            United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby announced in a letter to employees last night that “any customer traveling during this period is eligible for a refund if they do not wish to fly – even if their flight isn't impacted. That includes non-refundable tickets and those customers with basic economy tickets.”
    


            And American Airlines said in a statement: “Disrupting customers' plans is the last thing we want do to. To provide additional flexibility during the impacted travel period, customers whose flights are cancelled for any reason or who choose not to travel will be able to change their flight or request a refund, without any penalty.”
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            A group of increasingly frustrated Senate Democratic freshmen are currently meeting to discuss potential off-ramps to the 37-day shutdown as anxiety ramps up inside Washington over the funding lapse's escalating effects, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
    


            The group is discussing a long-shot proposal to Republicans to allow the chamber to vote to reopen the government with only 50 votes — instead of the usual 60-vote threshold — in exchange for agreeing to a 50-vote threshold on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, those sources said.
    


            That idea would be a huge lift for the Senate GOP, which has been strongly opposed to changing that 60-vote threshold. But it's an attempt to force any movements within the GOP after President Donald Trump himself called on Republicans to abolish the filibuster in a White House meeting on Wednesday.
    


            The group is also discussing pushing their freshman class to stay in Washington this weekend and into next week as the shutdown drags on — an idea from Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, one of the sources said.
    


            They hope to pitch their ideas to the broader Democratic caucus during a lunch meeting later in the day.
    


            We've gotten some more information on the latest air travel disruptions.
    


            Delays are being reported in Washington, DC, and New York this morning as the Federal Aviation Administration warns of air traffic control staffing shortages and prepares to reduce flights at 40 major airports.
    


Here are some more specifics: 



            A total of 431 staffing problems have been reported by the FAA since the start of the shutdown, more than four times the number on the same days last year.
    


            Negotiations between key senators will continue this morning as they push to announce a deal before the end of the week — or even today — to reopen the government, according to multiple sources in both parties.
    


            There are still some key sticking points, the sources said, so it's not yet clear when an accord will come together nor when the Senate will vote. But even after a deal is reached, it will take several days for it to be processed in both the Senate and the House, which has been out of session since September 19.
    


            So the government shutdown is expected to continue for at least another couple days.
    


            The idea would be to attach a stopgap bill to a larger package to fund several federal agencies. It's still unclear how senators would deal with a key sticking point: expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. Negotiators are discussing a stand-alone ACA vote, far short of the demand of many Democrats who want an extension in the underlying package that President Donald Trump would sign into law.
    


            Republicans have been keeping their leadership and the White House in the loop, one of the sources said.
    


            Airlines are bracing their passengers for disruptions as a 10% reduction in air traffic — impacting some major airport hubs — will go into effect starting tomorrow if the shutdown is not resolved.
    


Here's what some are saying:



            “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram.
    


Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are both offering waivers to allow passengers who do not want to fly to change their tickets without fees.
    


            Try to avoid booking flights with layovers, according to the US Public Interest Research Group. The more planes you have to get on to reach your destination, the more chances there are for a flight to be delayed or canceled.
    


            Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said there will be significant disruptions in the airspace when the Federal Aviation Administration slashes 10% of air traffic at 40 busy airports Friday if there's no shutdown agreement.
    


            “This is not a political decision, this was data-driven to make the right call to get ahead of any issues that could happen in airspace that could have negative consequences,” Duffy said in an interview on Fox.
    


            The DOT announced today that 10% of air traffic at 40 busy airports would be cut, potentially impacting thousands of flights, though the details of how many and which specific airports will be cut was not announced.
    


            Even with the cuts, flights could still be delayed if there are not enough workers to control them safely.
    


                    “As we come into Thanksgiving, if we're still in the shutdown posture, it's going to be rough out there, really rough,” Duffy said on Fox. “We'll mitigate the safety side. But will you fly on time? Will your flight actually go? That is yet to be seen, but there'll be more disruption.”
                





            Controllers will receive their second $0 paycheck next week, and Duffy has said some have taken second jobs to make ends meet or calling out sick in protest.
    


            Air traffic controllers were sent a pay stub reflecting a total “net pay” of $0 for the second time since the start of the now-historic shutdown today.
    


            The “Earnings and Leave Statement” reflects the funds to be paid next week for the pay period ending November 1.
    


Remember: Since the start of the shutdown, controllers and other essential workers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, have been required to do their jobs but won't be paid until after the government reopens.
    


            The administration also said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the impasse, potentially impacting thousands of flights.
    


            Republican Sen. Katie Britt said that while she is working across the aisle to end the government shutdown, President Donald Trump's argument for eliminating the filibuster to end the impasse, is “compelling.”
    


            “President Trump made a very compelling case yesterday. He talked about what is in front of us and what we need to do for the American people. Obviously, he has a robust agenda, and it is on us to get that through,” the senator from Alabama said on CNBC's “Squawk Box” this morning.
    


            Trump has been vocal in recent days for Republicans to end the shutdown by using the “nuclear option,” in other words, eliminating the filibuster — a 60-vote threshold for passing legislation — and voting with a simple majority. He made that pitch again yesterday at a breakfast with Senate Republicans.
    


            Britt added in the CNBC interview that Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the votes are not there to end the filibuster. But, she said, “we do have pathways that we can pursue that ultimately help us achieve his goal.”
    


            The senator said she is working with Democrats and Republicans to try to pass appropriations for critical food assistance programs, military and veteran services and paying Capitol Police officers.

CHICAGO (AP) — A federal judge said Thursday she will order federal agents in Chicago to restrict using force against peaceful protesters and news media outlets, saying current practices violate their constitutional rights.

The preliminary injunction came in response to a lawsuit alleging federal agents have used excessive force in their immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ‘s ruling, which is expected to be appealed by President Donald Trump's administration, refines an earlier temporary order that required agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain riot-control techniques, such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. After repeatedly chastising federal officials for not following her previous orders, she added a requirement for body cameras.

Ellis, who began Thursday's hearing by describing Chicago as a “vibrant place” and reading from poet Carl Sandburg's famous poem about the city, said it is “simply untrue” that the Chicago area is a violent place of rioters. A day earlier, attorneys for both sides repeatedly clashed in court over the accounts of several incidents during the immigration crackdown that began in September, including one where a Border Patrol commander threw a cannister of tear gas at a crowd. 

“I don't find defendants' version of events credible,” Ellis said.

Ellis said agents will be required to give two warnings before using riot control weapons and that agents are restricted from using force unless it is “objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat.”

She described protesters and advocates facing tear gas, having guns pointed at them and being thrown to the ground, saying “that would cause a reasonable person to think twice about exercising their fundamental rights.”




The preliminary injunction stems from a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force during demonstrations. 

In court, an attorney representing the federal government said senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino, has a body-worn camera after Ellis required him to get one and complete the training for using it at a previous hearing.

A message left Thursday for the Department of Homeland Security wasn't immediately returned.

During Wednesday's eight-hour hearing, witnesses gave emotional testimony when describing experiencing tear gas, being shot in the head with pepper balls while praying, and having guns pointed at them when recording agents in residential streets.

Ellis questioned witnesses about how these experiences impacted them and if they prevented them from protesting again. One after another, witnesses described their anxiety about returning to protests or advocacy work.

“I get really nervous because it just feels like I'm not safe,” Leslie Cortez, a youth organizer in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, told Ellis. “And I question my safety when I go out.”

Attorneys also played footage of a five-hour deposition, or private interview, of Bovino where he defended agents' use of force and dodged questions about Border Patrol tactics in the nations' third-largest city.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years.

But access to the drugs has been a consistent problem for patients because of their cost — around $500 a month for higher doses — and insurance coverage has been spotty.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved.

“(It) will save lives, improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” said Trump, in an Oval Office announcement in which he referred to GLP-1s as a “fat drug.”

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Drugmakers Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. 

As with the other deals, it's not clear how much the price drop will be felt by consumers. Drug prices can vary based on the competition for treatments and insurance coverage.

The obesity drugs work by targeting hormones in the gut and brain that affect appetite and feelings of fullness. In clinical trials, they helped people shed between 15% and 22% of their body weight -- up to 50 pounds or more in many cases.

Patients taking these drugs usually start on smaller doses and then work up to larger amounts, depending on their needs. Because of obesity being considered a chronic disease, they need to take the treatment indefinitely or risk regaining weight, experts say. 

The fast-growing treatments have proven especially lucrative for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co. and Novo Nordisk. Lilly said recently that sales of Zepbound have tripled so far this year to more than $9 billion.

But for many Americans, their cost has made them out of reach.

Medicare, the federally funded coverage program mainly for people ages 65 and over, hasn't covered the treatments for obesity. President Donald Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, proposed a rule last November that would have changed that. But the Trump administration nixed it last spring.

Few state and federally funded Medicaid programs, for people with low incomes, offer coverage. And employers and insurers that provide commercial coverage are wary of paying for these drugs in part because of the large number of patients that might use them.

The $500 monthly price for higher doses of the treatments also makes them unaffordable for those without insurance, doctors say.

Medicare now covers the cost of the drugs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but not for weight loss alone.

The effort to lower costs barriers to popular GLP-1 drugs comes as the White House is looking to demonstrate that Trump is in touch with Americans' frustrations with rising costs for food, housing, health care and other necessities.

“Trump is the friend of the forgotten American,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at Thursday's announcement. “Obesity is a disease of poverty. And overwhelmingly these drugs have only been available for people who have wealth.” 

Kennedy had previously expressed skepticism to GLP-1s in fighting obesity and diseases related to the condition. But he was full of praise for Trump for pushing to help a broader segment of Americans have access to the drug.

The announcement came after Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia faced a drubbing in Tuesday's election in which dour voter outlook about the economy appeared to an animating factor in the races. 

Roughly half of Virginia voters said “the economy” was the top issue, and about 6 in 10 of these voters picked Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor, powering her to a decisive win, according to an AP voter poll.

In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won about two-thirds of voters who called “the economy” the top issue facing the state, the poll found. She defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. More than half of New York City voters said the cost of living was the top issue facing the city. The Democratic mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won about two-thirds of this group.

The White House sought to diminish the effort by the previous Democratic administration as a gift to the pharmaceutical industry because the proposal did not include adequate price concessions from the drug makers.

Trump, instead, consummated a “belt and suspenders” deal that ensures that Americans aren't unfairly financing the pharmaceutical industry's innovation, claimed a senior administration official, who briefed reporters ahead of Thursday's Oval Office announcement by Trump.

Another senior administration official said coverage of the drugs will expand to Medicare patients starting next year. Medicare will start covering the treatments for people who have severe obesity and others who are overweight or obese and have serious health problems, the official said. Those who qualify will pay $50 copays for the medicine.

Lower prices also will be phased in for people without coverage through the administration's TrumpRx program, which will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers. starting in January.

The officials said lower prices also will be provided for state and federally funded Medicaid programs. And starting doses of new, pill versions of the obesity treatments will cost $149 a month if they are approved. Administration officials said the average price of the drugs sold on TrumpRx will start at around $350 and then drop to $245 over the next two years.

The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House.

Dr. Leslie Golden says she has roughly 600 patients taking one of these treatments, and 75% or more struggle to afford them. Even with coverage, some face $150 copayments for refills.

“Every visit it's, ‘How long can we continue to do this? What's the plan if I can't continue?,'” said Golden, an obesity medicine specialist in Watertown, Wisconsin. “Some of them are working additional jobs or delaying retirement so they can continue to pay for it.”

Both Lilly and Novo have already cut prices on their drugs. Lilly said earlier this year it would reduce the cost of initial doses of Zepbound to $349.

Dr. Angela Fitch, who also treats patients with obesity, said she hoped a deal between the White House and drugmakers could be the first step in making the treatments more affordable.

“We need a hero in obesity care today,” said Fitch, founder and chief medical officer of knownwell, a weight-loss and medical care company. “The community has faced relentless barriers to accessing GLP-1 medications, which has ultimately come down to the price, despite the data we have supporting their effectiveness.”

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. airports in more than two dozen states are among those facing 10% reductions in air traffic Friday due to the government shutdown.

The Federal Aviation Administration is imposing the reductions to take pressure off air traffic controllers, who are federal employees and have gone without pay during the shutdown. 

In addition to reduced flight traffic, the shutdown has led to more flight delays, with experts advising travelers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport, among other tips.

Here's a closer look at what to know about the reductions. 




The list includes 40 airports with Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Miami, Newark and San Francisco among them. A full list of airports facing reductions is here.

Air traffic controllers have gone without paychecks during the shutdown of the federal government. That's led to controllers calling in sick and contributed to staffing shortages that have been affecting air travel for weeks. 

Most controllers work mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said. 

That leaves little time for a side job unless controllers call in sick to the FAA.

They're set to start Friday, with passengers expected to be notified on Thursday. Airlines have said people could see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. 




It's unclear when the reduced flights could end. Airlines, unions and the travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest on record.

The cuts could include up to 1,800 flights and about 268,000 seats combined, according to one estimate. 

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both said they would offer refunds to travelers who opt not to fly, even if they have tickets that aren't normally refundable.

The cuts also could disrupt package deliveries because two airports with major distribution centers are on the list. FedEx operates at the Memphis, Tennessee, aiport and UPS in Louisville, Kentucky, where there was a deadly cargo plane crash this week.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for controllers to miss their second full paycheck next week.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said this week that he's never seen these kinds of measures taken before in his nearly four-decade experience in the aviation field. 

“We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns,” he said. 

Staffing problems led to delays throughout October, but they were mostly isolated and temporary. Last weekend, though, saw a change. 

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

During weekends from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional control centers and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis.

Urban warfare expert John Spencer explains why the proposed international force for Gaza must not repeat failures of the past.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, presented a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on Wednesday to partner nations aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan, including authorization for an international security force, according to a senior U.S. official. 

Waltz recently met with representatives from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, who are expected to coordinate humanitarian and reconstruction efforts around the proposal. The draft resolution seeks to authorize a two-year international stabilization force in Gaza under U.N. oversight — part of what officials describe as ""phase two"" of the broader postwar plan.

According to Reuters and the Associated Press, the draft would empower the mission to ""use all necessary measures"" to secure Gaza, protect civilians and begin the demilitarization of armed groups once large-scale combat ends. The plan includes forming a transitional ""Board of Peace"" to coordinate with Egypt, Israel and a vetted Palestinian police force.

US MILITARY TO OVERSEE NEXT PHASE OF PEACE DEAL FROM COORDINATION BASE IN ISRAEL

Washington has ruled out sending U.S. combat troops but has asked Muslim-majority countries, including Indonesia, Egypt, the U.A.E. and Turkey, to contribute. Israeli officials have already said they will not allow Turkish troops on their borders.

The meeting, in which the Palestinian Authority took part, marked a rare diplomatic engagement, notable because the U.S. plan envisioned handing authority back to the PA after reforms, a condition Israel opposes, Axios reports.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, said the concept can work — but only if it follows successful precedents. ""For Gaza, I personally would like people to think Kosovo, not Lebanon,"" he said. ""History shows exactly what determines success: a clear mandate, enough troops and the authority to act.""

After the 1999 NATO campaign, the Kosovo Force (KFOR) deployed under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 with about 50,000 troops to stabilize the region, separate combatants and rebuild governance.

""Kosovo gives you the best example,"" Spencer said. ""It had a clear disarmament mandate, a capable coalition and enough troops to enforce peace.""

He warned that Gaza will require similar patience. ""If somebody believes this will just disappear from the news in six months, that's not reality,"" he said, noting that KFOR remains in place decades later, albeit with fewer troops.

The 1995 Dayton Accords ended the Bosnian war and authorized the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), followed by the Stabilization Force (SFOR). About 60,000 troops were deployed to enforce the peace, separate armies and support reconstruction.

""These were significant forces with clear mandates for disarming,"" Spencer said. ""That's what success looks like — a mission with both muscle and legitimacy.""

FRENCH-DRAFTED UNIFIL RESOLUTION COULD SHIELD HEZBOLLAH AS US STAYS SILENT

He added that Gaza's mission must mirror Bosnia's strong command structure and clear legal authority, not rely on unarmed observers.

In East Timor, an Australian-led mission entered under U.N. authority in 1999 after post-independence violence. It restored order and laid the groundwork for local governance.

""East Timor shows how quickly you can start rebuilding governance when the force has legitimacy and local trust,"" Spencer said. ""That legitimacy must exist from day one in Gaza.""

By contrast, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), established in 1978 and expanded after the 2006 war, is what Spencer calls a failure.

""Southern Lebanon was not a success story,"" he said. ""They were glorified observers without a mandate to demilitarize anything.""

Israel has long criticized UNIFIL for allowing Hezbollah to entrench under its watch. Spencer said the same mistake cannot be repeated in Gaza. ""It has to be seen as liberating areas from militant rule, not occupying them,"" he said.

Spencer described an ""inkblot strategy"" — stabilizing cleared districts while combat continues elsewhere. ""You can create safe areas where a stabilization force, under the right mandate and equipped correctly, is stabilizing areas while you are also conducting operations against Hamas,"" he said.

He predicts that the Israel Defense Forces will continue high-intensity operations while the international force focuses on humanitarian aid, demining and restoring order in secured zones. ""Part of the lesson is giving people a vision of life after Hamas,"" Spencer said.

During a recent visit to Gaza, Spencer said he saw ""a glimmer of hope"" in newly established humanitarian zones inside cleared areas. ""If you start quickly, even on a small scale, success builds success,"" he said.

About 200 U.S. personnel are already on the ground in a civil-military coordination center managing logistics and planning for the proposed transition in Israel. Spencer said this small presence will be vital to coordinating aid, reconstruction and stabilization without engaging in combat.

He warned that the mission will face disinformation and attacks from groups opposed to peace. ""There are people who do not want this to succeed,"" he said. ""Thinking through how they'll try to undermine it — especially online — is vital.""

He added that stabilization must move alongside local capacity-building. ""You have to start training a vetted Palestinian police force and governance team,"" he said. ""That's how you build legitimacy.""

A win for Democrats in blue New Jersey's gubernatorial race was not surprising, but the victory was attributed to a larger trend at play: Republicans desperately need to work on voter turnout, and President Donald Trump needs to rethink how he conveys his policies.

Rep. Mikie Sherrill's (D-NJ) decisive win against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, as well as other Democratic victories Tuesday night, have been brushed off by national Republicans as a predetermined outcome, arguing it is not reflective of how voters across the country perceive the GOP.

However, Sherrill managed to flip key counties that Trump won in 2024, and she attracted more of the Latino vote, a historically blue voting bloc that helped the president narrow his margin in the Garden State last November. 

The New Jersey election essentially boiled down to Ciattarelli's inability to motivate Trump voters and supporters to turn out for the election, as well as a larger rebuke nationwide of Republican policies.

Republicans historically do not match Democrats' turnout rates in non-presidential years. GOP voters often do not participate in early or mail-in voting, due to the party harboring suspicions over the method's security in the wake of the 2020 election. 

Since Trump emerged in the political arena, the GOP has consistently faced issues attracting supporters to vote in elections where the president is not at the top of the ballot.

National GOP strategist Brian Seitchik told the Washington Examiner that New Jersey was “always going to be an uphill climb,” but Tuesday was “the latest example of a reality that Republicans need to understand.”

“Trump voters are not reliable Republican voters,” Seitchik said.

“One thing that Republicans have done a very poor job of doing is motivating the Trump voters while attracting anyone else,” Brian Kirwin, a longtime Virginia GOP strategist, echoed. 

And rallying Trump voters was a considerable part of Ciattarelli's campaign. He linked himself closely to the president's agenda, taking a gamble that it would drive out Trump's supporters.

But it also came at a cost. By linking himself to Trump's policies, he opened himself up to credible attacks from the Sherrill campaign. The government shutdown didn't help matters either, playing a “tremendous role” in his eyes, said Hank Sheinkopf, longtime Democratic political consultant.

“Ciattarelli could not walk away from Trump,” he said. “He grabbed Trump's hand and held it too tight. And Mikie Sherril knew how to break that, how to use that.”

Eyes were on the government shutdown, which reached 37 days as of Thursday, to see if it would negatively affect Sherrill, a sitting member of Congress who had voted against the Republican spending deal to fund the government. But the Trump administration's decision to freeze funds for critical infrastructure projects connecting New Jersey to New York likely led to Ciattarelli's demise, Sheinkopf said.

“Ciattarelli ran on merit because he's done it twice before, and he came so close the last time,” Sheinkopf said. “But likely, had Trump not decided to cancel the 100,000 jobs in the [Hudson] Tunnel [Project], the outcome might have been very different.”

Sheinkopf, who advised Hudson County Republicans in New Jersey how to bolster support for Ciattarelli, said he thought Virginia was a rebuke of candidate quality, whereas New Jersey was a rebuke of Trump's policies, plain and simple.

“Why? Because Ciattarelli was within 3 to 5 [points] two weeks out this closing,” the consultant said. “When the Sherrill campaign went smartly up on the air, talking about the cuts to New Jersey, the shutdown, the job loss, and the rest, it negated all the positive arguments that Ciattarelli had made about the mess that the Democrats had created in Trenton and throughout the state.”

In his concession speech, Ciattarelli didn't mention Trump. He said “nobody's more disappointed than me” and noted his chances were slim in a blue state, but he's “proud of the effort we put forth.” 

“Knowing my nature, I will analyze over the next 24, 48, 72 hours, over the next week, over the next month, what we could have done differently,” Ciattarelli said. “But having said that, I stand before you right now, proud of all of you for what you did for this campaign, proud of what my team did on behalf of this campaign, and I'm proud of my effort going out there each and every day.”

“Yes, Republicans are the minority party, but that means also being the loyal opposition and continuing to ensure that our voice is heard,” he added.

Several strategists rebuffed the idea that candidate quality played a large role in the New Jersey race, compared to Virginia. Ciattarelli received a Trump endorsement and the financial backing of national Republicans, whereas Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears faced a more difficult campaign season.

Ciattarelli proved his worth as a candidate before 2025, having won several state and local elections and having attempted to run for governor in 2017 and again in 2021. Four years ago, he came within 3 points. 

But Sheinkopf noted there could have been some “voter fatigue” given this was Ciattarelli's third attempt at the governor's mansion.

“Ciattarelli ran a fine campaign, but he ran it in a very blue state,” Seitchik said. 

Ciattarelli voters told the Washington Examiner in the week leading up to the election that they were supporting him because he was born and raised in New Jersey and that he provided specific ways he'd address the issues Garden State residents are facing. 

Henry de Koninck, a New Jersey strategist and political consultant, agreed that Ciattarelli was a “fine” candidate, pointing out that his vote total of over 1.3 million votes was more votes than outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) received in either of his elections when he won in 2017 and 2021.

But, he said, “Ciattarelli was really just the casualty of the turnout environment where he was running against a candidate who had an energized party behind her, and he had all the baggage of being associated with Trump, but none of the benefit.”

“And the results reflected that.”

Kirwin said that candidate quality is incredibly important when it comes to finding someone who can grow a message and “not just play R vs. D.” 

Kirwin noted that in 2021, Ciattarelli performed significantly better under a Biden White House than under a Trump one. 

“You get the reverse rate wave with a Republican in the White House, and all of a sudden, ‘I was a pretty impressive candidate in 2021 and now I'm horrible,'” the strategist continued. “That's more about the electorate and a rebuke of the White House than it is anything about Jack.”

“He benefited from the wave four years ago, and it drowned him in 2025,” he added.

The 2025 election results sent a strong signal to Capitol Hill that Republicans will not be able to solely ride the wave of Trump back into the White House and maintain any momentum gathered from 2024 victories.

Trump himself told GOP senators on Wednesday morning that he wanted to have a “discussion” about “what last night represented.” He blamed GOP losses on the shutdown, telling the senators behind closed doors that Republicans are “getting killed.” 

The House historically flips to the opposite party of the current presidency in the midterm elections, and Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to regain control of the chamber and break up the GOP trifecta.

Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said that if Trump and Republicans “don't get their act together,” they will face an even worse defeat in 2026.

“Voters pay very little attention to the candidate in congressional midterms; it's basically a national referendum on the president,” Bannon said.

In his eyes, candidate quality matters the least in a midterm election because many voters go to the polls and “don't even know congressional candidates are, may not even know who their incumbent member of Congress is.”

“But they'll vote based on how they feel about the president, and if Trump's job rating is anything like it was last night, that suggests that the Republicans are ready for a big hurt a year from today,” Bannon said.

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, disagrees. He said that at the polls, it often comes down to the likability and quality of the candidate rather than policy issues.

“People can overlook some economic problems and issues if they're excited about a candidate, but if they're not excited about the candidate and they feel like the party in power is to blame, then the party in power is going to suffer,” Richards said.

De Koninck agreed with Richards. He noted that Ciattarelli spoke on the correct issues important to the Garden State: high energy costs, rising taxes, and tariffs.

But, he said, the “economy is a bit of a red herring when it comes to a persuasion factor in campaigns.” 

DEMOCRATS WIN BIG AND SMALL RACES IN THE 2025 ELECTION

“That's something that voters say is really important to them,” de Koninck said. “It is really important to them, but it doesn't move voters off their party preference choice in the way that a lot of pundits and folks in the political consulting class think that it does.”

“So it's not that Ciattarelli spoke about the wrong issues, and it's just that those issues were not ultimately shaping vote preference,” he added.

Those who believe in liberty and dignity must never give in to the forces arrayed against the things we hold dearest.

As America approaches the 250th anniversary of its founding, I have returned again and again to the words of Thomas Paine, who advanced the cause of American freedom with a memorable call to action: The times have found us. 

The times had indeed found Paine, and the rest of our Founders, who summoned the courage to declare independence from a king; to win a war against the strongest empire in the world; and to write our Constitution (thank goodness they made it amendable). In the century that followed, the times found Abraham Lincoln, who saved our union by winning the Civil War. And now the times have found us once again.

In our own lives, and in the life of our nation, great good can come from great trials. But we also know this: Nothing we love ever comes easily. Ours is a nation forged by war and protest, in the loneliness of struggle and the slow work of centuries. We have always sought to perfect our union, even—especially—in the face of forces that seem too strong to ever overcome. This is another moment of extraordinary difficulty. It amazes me that so many people can endure so much suffering of others while doing nothing to address their needs.

It is easy to despair. I know this is the way millions of Americans feel now. Yet the story of this country is the story of patience in tribulation, and hope in the face of fear. What we choose to do in this hour of our history will determine the shape of America and the world for decades.

I am a child of America and a child of great religious faith. Both teach that there is no light without darkness. So what can we do? In the song of Saint Francis, the patron saint of my home city, we ask the Lord to make us an instrument of his peace. Where there is hatred, let us sow love. The way of Saint Francis, the way of soldiers and suffragists, the way of our beloved John Lewis—that must be our way, too. We the people must follow the Golden Rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

That has always been who Americans are. Time and again, we have stepped up for our fellow Americans in times of need; expanded the definition of freedom to include more of us in it; and fended off tyrants seeking to take power away from the people. Once again, we will prove who we are through what we do in this precarious moment. And we can do so through actions both profound and personal. Our democracy depends as much on casting a ballot as lending a hand to a neighbor in need.

Those of us who believe in liberty and dignity, goodness and generosity, must never give in to the forces arrayed against the things we hold dearest. The battle can be exhausting, but it is a battle to which we are called by conscience and by love of country. This is the spirit that has motivated my decades of public service, through moments of great progress, great pain, and even great peril. Through it all, what kept me going were those lessons I learned as a child in Baltimore: to sow love and to help others. Those are unshakable responsibilities that all of us, as Americans, share. And as I soon begin my final year in Congress, I believe as fervently as ever that this must be our path forward.

America has always been a long-standing promise and an ongoing project. Decades of peace and prosperity made it tempting to believe that our democracy was self-sustaining—but in fact, it must be constantly tended to, strengthened, and defended. Democracy has been described as a horizon: unreachable, because inevitably our ambition for more freedom always grows.

So just as patriots launched a revolution against a king, turned the tide at Gettysburg, stormed the beaches of Normandy, and marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, we, too, must be patriots for our time. That means not just holding on to the rights and freedoms our fellow Americans have fought for, but refusing to surrender the courageous spirit that inspired them.

Yes, the times have found us once again. But generations past have always prevailed, and so shall we, for our faith in the goodness of America, and our commitment to the freedom we owe to our children, is what will always give us hope.

What happened to Ryan Borgwardt?

On the afternoon of Sunday, August 11, 2024, a few hours after attending church with his wife and three children, Ryan Borgwardt, a 44-year-old carpenter, left home with his kayak, tackle box, and fishing rod and arrived at Big Green Lake, one of the deepest lakes in Wisconsin. The Perseid meteor shower was expected to peak that night, one of the best times of the year to see shooting stars. Stargazers could glimpse dozens an hour, golden streaks that appeared to fall from the constellation Perseus.

At about 10 p.m., Ryan pushed the kayak into the inky-black water. He glided past the water lilies and cattails and headed toward the lake's deepest part, near its western end. It was so dark, he could barely see beyond the kayak's nose. Above him, the night sky sparkled.

A little after 6 o'clock the next morning, Matthew Vande Kolk, chief deputy of the Green Lake County Sheriff's Office, kissed his wife and daughter goodbye and stepped out of his Victorian farmhouse.

Vande Kolk, 47, was second in command of the department. Just back from a week's vacation, he was hoping for a quiet day to catch up on paperwork. As Vande Kolk pulled onto a two-lane road, he alerted dispatchers that he was signing in for duty. Then he drove the roads he'd traveled since he was a boy, across prairies ripening with sweet corn and soybeans, gently sloping fields that met blue sky at the horizon.

Green Lake County's 19,000 residents are predominantly white, churchgoing, and Republican, many of them farming, or working at gas stations and grocery stores, restaurants and lakeside resorts. To Vande Kolk and the other deputies, Green Lake was a place where people knew their neighbors, compared tractor sizes, and valued common sense above book smarts.

Although murders were rare in the county, deputies handled traffic crashes, child abuse, burglary, fraud—but at a much lower volume than in big cities. They also handled calls more typical of the rural Midwest: trespassing coyote hunters, missing snowmobilers, pickup trucks that had fallen through ice. Deputies knew many of the people they detained. Arrest Frank for a DUI on Monday, and you might find him ringing you up at the Dollar Store register on Thursday.

From the April 2018 issue: The perfect man who wasn't

It wasn't Mayberry, but it was close. Many of the sheriff's deputies had grown up in the area, the older among them driving tractors and milking cows. All of them knew how to skin a deer. All of them had chased suspects into cornfields, a reliable way to evade arrest in Green Lake.

As Vande Kolk headed to the office, he heard deputies on the radio talking about a kayaker who'd gone missing on Big Green Lake. A woman had called 911 at 5:24 a.m. to report that her husband had not returned home the previous evening. He'd last texted from the lake, where he'd gone to fish and stargaze.

Around 5:45 a.m., deputies had driven to public boat launches, searching for the family's minivan, a gray Grand Caravan. In a back lot at Dodge Memorial County Park, a deputy spotted a car fitting that description. He tried the handles—all locked. He peered inside with a flashlight, looking for a note, clothes, anything. He saw a water bottle with Dad written on it. He walked around the car, looking for signs of damage or evidence of a struggle. Everything appeared intact.

Vande Kolk pointed his pickup truck toward the lake, known for a color that could shift from deep forest to nearly jade in different lights. Formed by the retreat of ancient glaciers that left a hole seven miles long and two miles wide, Big Green Lake is 236 feet deep at its cold, dark center. Large muskies, prehistoric-looking fish with canine-style teeth, lurk there. Vande Kolk had spent years on the lake trying to catch one. The shore is lined with multimillion-dollar homes, many of them owned by wealthy out-of-towners who swell the county's population each summer. About once a year, someone drowns. Because of the depth, bodies are hard to find.

Two deputies were searching the lake in a 21-foot Boston Whaler. Around 6:30 a.m., they pulled alongside a fisherman who said he'd spotted a kayak floating upside down near the middle of the lake. They sped that way, slowing as they caught sight of a kayak, its back half submerged. They flipped it over to see if anyone was trapped beneath. Nothing. One of the deputies marked the exact coordinates. Then they towed the kayak to shore.

Vande Kolk pulled into a parking lot where Sheriff Mark Podoll had recommended they gather. He stepped out of his truck and walked toward the lake glittering in the morning light, a thousand diamonds flickering back at him.

Detective Sergeant Josh Ward sat in his car near the water and called the kayaker's wife, Emily Borgwardt. She answered quickly, sounding worried.

Emily told the detective that Ryan had left their home in Watertown, about an hour from Big Green Lake, at around 4:45 p.m. the previous afternoon. He'd driven the family minivan to a friend's house to pick up wood pellets for his stove. Before setting off, he'd mentioned that he might drop the kayak in the water somewhere on his way home, and attached an enclosed trailer with the kayak. He'd told Emily over the weekend that he wanted to fish on Big Green Lake, which would be roughly on his way.

Emily told the detective she'd texted with Ryan the previous evening. She forwarded screenshots of their exchange.

At 10:12 p.m., Emily had written, “Night. Love you.” About 15 minutes later, she'd texted again, telling him that their older son, 17, was spending the night at a friend's house.

Five minutes later, Ryan texted back: “I may have snuck out on a lake.”

Emily: “That would have been nice to know...I was beginning to wonder why you weren't home.”

Ryan apologized, but then added: “Temperature is perfect.”

Emily: “Nothing new. I should be used to it by now. So many nights I have no idea where you are when it's late.”

Ryan: “The meteor shower is awesome in the dark.”

Emily asked Ryan to turn on his location-sharing in the Life360 app, which he did.

Emily: “Again, no communication. Would have been nice to know.”

Ryan: “I'll work on this communication thing.”

Emily: “It sucks going to bed not having any idea where you are. Just saying.”

Ryan told Emily he'd forgotten his paddle and was instead using a fishing net.

Emily: “No paddle is dumb.”

Ryan: “I love you...goodnight.”

Emily: “Night. Love you too. Be safe.”

Ryan: “I'll start heading back to shore soon.”

Emily: “K.”

After her last text, at 10:49 p.m., Emily said she fell asleep. When she woke around 5 a.m., Ryan still wasn't home.

Emily texted him at 5:12 a.m.: “Where are you?????”

Then, at 5:16 a.m.: “Babe?????”

To Sergeant Ward, Emily seemed earnest and cooperative. No, Ryan didn't have any mental-health issues. She definitely didn't think he was suicidal. He was an experienced kayaker, as well as a decent swimmer.

Ward asked Emily to send him screenshots from the Life360 app, which showed Ryan heading northwest toward the center of the lake and then moving eastward. After that, the app showed him taking a hard 90-degree turn north. At 11:55 p.m., his trail stopped. Ward wondered if Ryan had had an accident trying to paddle with the fishing net.

Deputies had blocked off part of Dodge Memorial County Park and were asking fishermen to keep an eye out. In the lot, they parked the county's mobile command center, a large RV with computers and air-conditioning, along with a trailer that carried a search drone and had a big outdoor television on one side. Deputies watched live footage from the drone as it flew across the lake.

Chief Deputy Vande Kolk spent much of the day standing on the bow of the Boston Whaler, looking into the water. It was so clear that he could see at least 10 feet down. Unless Ryan had gotten tangled in the weeds near shore, Vande Kolk felt confident that they'd find him.

The Life360 app, and the location of the minivan and the kayak, had provided clues about where to look. But Ryan might have tried to swim to shore and gotten tired along the way. In the dark, disoriented, he could have headed in any direction.

If Ryan had drowned, his lungs would have filled with water, sinking him to the lake bottom. He'd remain there until his decomposing body built up enough gases to float back to the surface. In aquatic-rescue parlance, this is known as “the pop.” The depth and water temperature determine how long it takes for a body to pop to the surface—anywhere from days to weeks.

Below a certain depth, however, pressure prevents gases from building up, and keeps the body from rising. If Ryan had drowned anyplace deeper than about 100 feet, he might remain in Big Green Lake forever, unless divers or sophisticated sonar equipment were deployed to find him.

As Ward updated Emily throughout the day, he could tell she was struggling to get her mind around the idea that her husband was never coming home again, that she'd be raising three children alone. She was fiercely religious and had begun to say things like “Ryan loved the outdoors. If he had to meet God, that's the place I would have picked for him.”

At sunset, the sheriff's deputies called off the search for the night. When Emily asked Ward how long they would continue searching, he sensed she was worried that they would stop too soon, leaving her trapped in a sort of purgatory, trying not to hope but still hoping.

They resumed at daybreak. Around 9:30 a.m., a fisherman called to say that he'd hooked a fishing rod while trolling in about 20 feet of water. It was in the same area where Life360 had shown Ryan's 90-degree turn north. Sergeant Ward sent a picture of the rod to Emily. She showed it to her younger son, who often fished with his father. He confirmed that it was his dad's.

Around 2:30 p.m., another fisherman alerted deputies that he'd found a tackle box floating near the Heidel House, a resort on the lake's northeastern shore. A deputy retrieved it and brought it to the mobile command center. Ward opened the gray box. The stench of rotted catfish bait filled the air. The deputies, obsessive fishermen, leaned in to study the lures, to see what kind of man the tackle box belonged to. His was a random assortment, the stuff of Walmart value packs, including the clip-on bobber balls that amateurs use. They also saw two sets of keys and a brown wallet. Ward removed the wallet, flipped it open, and found a driver's license. He read the name: Ryan Borgwardt.

Judging by the fact that the kayak was found approximately three-quarters of a mile northeast of Ryan's last known location, and that the tackle box had shown up farther northeast, about where they would have expected after two days of drifting, the deputies' best guess was that Ryan had fallen out of the boat, picked the wrong direction to swim, and drowned.

Deputies discussed whether to enter Ryan as a missing person, which would have triggered checks in state and federal databases to see if he'd been in contact with authorities in other jurisdictions. They decided against it; Ryan wasn't a missing person—he was somewhere in the lake.

Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll believed that the best hope of finding Ryan was Keith Cormican, a search-and-recovery expert who lived a couple of hours away in Black River Falls. He arrived within a few hours, driving a Denali pickup truck hauling his 22-foot search boat. He believed he would quickly find the kayaker, partly because he knew Life360 data to be extremely accurate. He drove to the area of the lake where the last signal had come from and lowered his “towfish”—a four-foot-long, 65-pound device that emits sound waves, which bounce back from the bottom of the lake to create an image the way an ultrasound captures pictures of an unborn baby. Cormican had spent thousands of hours studying sonar images that looked like the desertscapes of Mars, and could quickly discern if a tiny blip was a log or a body.

Cormican and sheriff's deputies spent that afternoon traveling back and forth across the lake at about four miles an hour, as if mowing a lawn, pulling the towfish on a cable behind them. The sonar produced video of the lake bottom, which Cormican squinted at on a small screen. Every so often, deputies would think they'd seen something significant—a round object that looked like a head—and Cormican would quickly dismiss it as a rock or a beer can. Several times when deputies were especially convinced that they'd found a clue or a body part, Cormican lowered his underwater drone, which retrieved the object with a mechanical claw, confirming his assessment.

Once, in the late afternoon, Cormican pointed out a sonar image that looked like an arm and a leg. Word traveled quickly across the lake that they might have found the kayaker. Cormican lowered his drone, navigating it through the water with a remote control, and moved in for a closer look. It was a forked log.

By the end of the second day, Cormican was puzzled. He'd driven the search area dozens of times. With a lake bottom as clean as Big Green's, the kayaker's body should have been easy to find.

Cormican told the sheriff he was expected in Green Bay the next morning, for another water-recovery mission. But he promised he'd come back in a few days. Before they expanded their search area, though, Cormican recommended that the sheriff take another look at the kayaker's history. “Just make sure he's not drinking margaritas on a beach somewhere,” Cormican said.

On Saturday, Sergeant Ward went to meet Ryan's wife and children at their one-story ranch house on an acre of land in Watertown. Emily greeted him with a warm smile. She introduced Ward to her parents and children, who sat on a couch and chairs in the living room.

Detectives had already scoured the couple's social media, trying to get a sense of who the Borgwardt family was. Emily taught first grade at a Lutheran school. On Facebook, she'd shared a recipe for coleslaw orzo salad with toasted almonds and dried cranberries, displaying a photo of how she'd packed it in Tupperware for the coming week. She posted about baking homemade chocolate-chip scones, gardening, laundry. “Whoever invented the delay time feature on my washing machine is my favorite person this busy week! Set the timer now and my laundry will be ready for the dryer when I wake up!”

Emily, who was 44, described Ryan, her husband of 22 years, as a family man, a devoted father. He was a volunteer firefighter who served as an usher at their Lutheran church. He owned a woodworking shop, where he built custom cabinets and furniture. He did not drink much. Emily said Ryan rarely had time to himself and had probably been craving some solitude on the lake.

Ward asked if the family had any financial issues. Emily said Ryan did seem stressed about money at times and complained about not making as much as he'd like. She said he'd recently accumulated some credit-card debt, the details of which she did not fully know.

Ward asked the family about Ryan going out onto the lake so late without a paddle—did that strike them as odd? Not at all, the family said. Emily's father said he believed Ryan had attention deficit disorder; his son-in-law often lost track of things and started projects that he didn't finish. Emily's father didn't say it in a disparaging way—more like That was just Ryan.

Ward asked to speak with Emily alone so he could inquire about their marriage. Emily said their relationship was strong. She had a few gripes—Ryan was not good at communicating, nor was he good at gauging how long a task would take to complete. Ward asked if he'd had any recent health issues or medical procedures. Emily mentioned that he'd gone to the hospital six or seven weeks earlier for a reverse vasectomy. She said he'd ended up being “part of that 2 percent” who had pain after the original procedure. Ward asked Emily if he could look at Ryan's laptop, and she readily provided it. He pulled up Ryan's browser history—nothing unusual.

Ward came away with the sense that the Borgwardts were solid, decent people. The time he spent with them had strengthened his determination to keep searching, because they deserved a proper goodbye.

Cormican kept expanding his search area. It was tedious work, lowering the towfish into the water, driving slowly, returning home at dark with nothing. He got tired of Big Green Lake. Every time he left town, he hoped not to return. Then Sheriff Podoll would call and tell him how nice the Borgwardt family was and how Cormican was their only chance for closure. And he would climb back into his truck and return to the lake that did not seem to want to give up its dead kayaker.

At the sheriff's office, Sergeant Ward had hung a color-coded map of the lake on a wall. He'd highlighted in orange any areas that were less than about 80 feet deep. If the kayaker had drowned in those spots, he already would have surfaced. The deeper parts of the lake, highlighted in pink, were what Cormican called the “hot zone.” Day after day, Ward and Cormican went out onto those parts of the lake, crisscrossing them to capture images from multiple angles.

From the November 2024 issue: Jamie Thompson on the carjacking crisis

Cormican didn't find everyone he searched for, but he found most of them. He'd recovered his first body in the 1990s, after two men who'd been drinking tried to swim across a Wisconsin pond. One disappeared along the way. Cormican, then in his 30s, put on a wetsuit and a scuba mask and tethered himself to his older brother, Bruce, a volunteer firefighter in Black River Falls. Groping through the muck with his hands, he found the body in about 10 feet of water. It was terrifying, but also gratifying to bring closure to the family.

To find the bodies of those who drown in Wisconsin's more than 15,000 lakes, searchers used to drag large grappling hooks across lake beds, but this technique disfigured corpses. The gruesomeness bothered the Cormican brothers, so they assembled a volunteer dive team and worked to devise better methods.

In 1995, an emergency page went out in Black River Falls. A father had drowned while canoeing in Robinson Creek with his daughters. On the third day of their search, as Bruce waded into the water holding a safety line, feeling for the man with his feet, swirling currents swept him away. When rescuers were able to reach Bruce, he'd been too long without air. By the time they got him to the hospital, he was beyond saving; they took him off life support the next day. He was 40, with a wife and two children. Keith Cormican drew some consolation from not having to leave Bruce's body in the cold river, unclaimed. The experience deepened his commitment to his work; he now understood viscerally that the ritualized ways we say goodbye are essential for processing grief.

Cormican closed his landscaping business, invested in cutting-edge sonar equipment, and bought a boat. In the years since, he's become one of the world's most sought-after water-retrieval experts, pulling the dead out of lakes and rivers from Romania to Panama to Nepal.

After searching Big Green Lake for so many days, Cormican was asking himself, Why can't I find this guy? Am I losing my touch? He'd wake at 3 a.m. and click through sonar images on his computer, zooming in on every speck.

What haunted Cormican most about finding drowned bodies was the faces—eyes opened unnaturally wide, mouths frozen with what Cormican could only describe as the fear of God. But for him, the one thing worse than finding drowned bodies was not finding them.

On Friday, October 4, 2024, Chief Deputy Vande Kolk was steering the boat while Cormican monitored the equipment. The leaves were turning. Before long, the lake would freeze.

The whole town seemed weary of the search. Many residents were beginning to think the body would never be found. He's not in the lake, the retired guys who gathered at the local coffee shop each morning kept saying. Sheriff's deputies, feeling defensive about the time and money they were spending, would tell people that the family needed closure. “We're going to keep looking,” they said.

Navigating along the surface, Vande Kolk maintained a consistent speed as the boat moved north to south in a grid pattern. The towfish needed to stay 15 to 20 feet from the bottom to capture good images. Drive too fast, and the towfish would rise too high. Too slow, and it might hit the bottom. Any miscalculation would leave gaps in their search grid and potentially damage a $60,000 piece of equipment.

Later that day, the men returned to shore. Cormican had spent 20 days on the lake. “I've searched this lake like I've never searched another body of water,” Cormican told the sheriff. “You've got to start looking elsewhere.”

The following Monday morning, Sheriff Podoll declared that it was time to investigate new angles. Detective Jeremiah Hanson reached out to the Mid-States Organized Crime Information Center, a group of nine states that shared law-enforcement data, and asked for a historical record of every time someone had searched Ryan's name—during a traffic stop, for example. If Ryan had been involved in criminal activity in another town, the report should reveal that. When Hanson received it, he sent a copy to Sergeant Ward.

Ward saw some recent entries that made sense—a number of searches after Emily, Ryan's wife, had called 911. But an additional entry caught his eye: Canadian authorities had searched Ryan's name at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, an underwater highway that connected Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, at 12:30 a.m. on August 13, 2024—the day after he'd disappeared. That was odd. Ward talked with a U.S. official at the border, asking him if he knew why the Canadian authorities had run Ryan's name on that date. The official said he'd look into it. Ward hung up and sat in silence for a few moments.

He and Hanson walked down to meet Podoll and Vande Kolk in the chief deputy's office. “You guys are going to want to sit down,” Ward said. Then he told them that Canadian officials had searched Ryan's name on August 13.

“What?” the sheriff said.

“His name was run at the Canadian border the day after he disappeared,” Ward said. He watched his colleagues absorb what that meant.

“Well, holy shit,” the sheriff said.

Vande Kolk slammed his fist on the desk. “Motherfucker!”

They'd spent almost two months searching the lake.

Vande Kolk took this the hardest: Weeks earlier, he'd told Ward not to enter Ryan as a missing person, which might have triggered the search earlier. He started cursing so loudly that the sheriff had to tell him to calm down.

Still, all they knew was that someone in Windsor had searched Ryan's name shortly after he'd disappeared. Maybe a police officer there had simply been curious about the case and looked him up. Or maybe someone had stolen Ryan's identity.

Vande Kolk contacted an agent with ICE, who told him that Ryan had obtained a passport in 2017. Ward texted Emily and asked if she knew where her husband's passport was. A couple of minutes later, she texted Ward a picture of it. It had the same number as the one Ryan had been issued in 2017.

Then ICE told Vande Kolk something new: Ryan had reported his passport as lost or stolen around April 30, 2024—about four months before he'd disappeared. A replacement passport was issued on May 22, 2024. That was the passport that had been run at the Canadian border.

Detective Hanson kept calling an official who worked at the border, hoping to learn if it was actually Ryan who'd crossed there, not someone else. “Dude, please,” Hanson implored, pleading for any information. The official apologized, explaining that he wasn't authorized to say anything.

“But if I were you,” the official told him before hanging up, “I'd stop looking in the lake.”

On October 9, 2024, Podoll and Ward met with Emily. The officers still didn't know exactly what had happened, but they were growing more convinced that Ryan had duped them, and they found it hard to believe that he could have pulled this off alone. Had Emily been in on it?

Around 11:30 a.m., as the men took a seat at Emily's dining-room table, they noticed a painting hanging on the wall, which appeared to be an image of Jesus and Ryan, holding hands as they walked away together along the water. You have got to be kidding me, the sheriff thought.

“We've got some information we're going to share with you,” Podoll told Emily. “It's very important that this information stays right here at this table.”

Emily nodded.

“We're changing the direction of our investigation,” he said.

“What?” Emily asked.

“We don't believe Ryan is in our lake,” he said.

Emily looked confused. “What?” she asked again.

“We believe Ryan is still alive.”

The men studied Emily as she absorbed this information. Her face turned so pale, they worried she would pass out.

Warning her that what he was about to say might be hard to hear, the sheriff told her that they believed it possible that Ryan had faked his own death and abandoned his family.

He felt as if he could read Emily's feelings as they passed across her face: relief, then confusion, then anger, then doubt. Tears slid down her cheeks.

“I don't know what's worse—him dying, or knowing that he's alive,” she said. Ward and Podoll had the same thought: She's not faking this.

“What about our kids? How could he do that to them?” she asked. “Was my marriage really that broken, and I didn't know?” Her disbelief seemed to be growing. “Ryan would not do that to us.”

Podoll told Emily what they'd learned about the passports and the Canadian border, but acknowledged that they did not know where her husband had gone or if he was actually still alive.

“This is what I need you to do,” he said. “You cannot say anything to anyone.” They didn't want to suggest publicly that Ryan had deceived everyone until they knew for certain. And a media circus would make their investigation more difficult.

“I will do whatever you need,” Emily said. The sheriff worried that, in asking her to carry this secret alone, he was imposing an impossible burden.

“What about the church?” she asked as the officers prepared to leave. “What about all the people who prayed for him?”

About an hour later, Emily sat in the auditorium of her older son's high school for the annual talent show. A piano melody filled the room as her son stood onstage beneath a spotlight, holding a microphone and singing a duet with another student.

Emily had driven to the school in a fog. She'd considered not going, but her son was expecting her, and how would she explain not being there? She'd taken a seat in the auditorium, struggling to mask her emotions behind a cheerful-mom look. After the teens hit the first verse of the chorus—“Ain't no mountain high enough!”—the crowd began to clap to the beat. Emily felt sick.

She had grown up in Lutheran schools. She spent her days teaching first graders. Raise your hand, be polite, Jesus loves you. She lived in a concrete, simple world where Tuesday follows Monday and two plus two equals four.

She thought back to the morning she'd learned that Ryan had disappeared. She'd been awakened by their puppy, and had been annoyed at Ryan, who hadn't gotten up early with the dog like he was supposed to.

She thought about the look on the face of her older son as he arrived home early from a sleepover that morning, having been told there was a family emergency, to find a patrol car in the driveway. The teenager was crying, hugging his sweatshirt to his face. Mom, what's going on? he'd asked. Buddy, your dad is missing, she'd told him. Family and friends had crowded into the house as they waited for information. By nightfall, Emily had accepted that Ryan had drowned in the lake. A devout Christian, she believed that Ryan's death must have been part of God's plan, and that he was now in heaven.

As the search stretched on for days, then weeks, Emily had kept her cellphone near, waiting for news about Ryan's body. Along with managing her own grief and that of her children, she was taking on the tasks her husband used to do: paying the bills, making sure the garbage cans got to the curb. Every time she felt overwhelmed, people showed up to help. A retired police deputy mowed her lawn every week. Several dozen volunteer firefighters from the station where Ryan had worked came over to trim trees and stack wood. How was she going to explain to them that she was not a grieving widow but … what? A spurned wife? A dupe?

That night, after the talent show and dinner and homework, Emily lay awake in bed, unable to sleep. The peace she'd felt, surrendering herself to God's plan, had been replaced with a cold unease. She struggled to believe that Ryan would have willingly abandoned the family. Had he gotten himself into trouble, something sinister on the dark web? Maybe, she thought, he'd sacrificed himself to protect her and the children.

Whatever had happened, Emily knew she could no longer attribute it to God's plan. This had been her husband's choice, the actions of a mortal man, one locked in what she could only assume was a terrible battle with temptation and sin.

At the sheriff's office, Detective Hanson opened Ryan's laptop, which Emily had given them. Hanson, the department's digital-forensics expert, quickly found evidence suggesting that Ryan had deleted his browser history the day before he disappeared. Huge red flag. He sent the laptop to a state lab.

Poring through gigabytes of data on the hard drive, an investigator at the lab found a document labeled “bank questions.” The first question read: “From the US to my new bank account in Georgia. What is the most common way people do this?”

Another document appeared to detail Ryan's exit plan. He had listed the number for a burner phone as well as old and new email accounts. He'd switched to a new account with Proton Mail, an encrypted service based in Switzerland, a smart move for anyone trying to elude detection abroad: Executing search warrants on Proton is much harder than on U.S.-based services such as Yahoo.

Hanson prepared search warrants for each email address, phone number, and credit-card number he found on the laptop. Among Hanson's discoveries was a Robinhood trading account, which allowed Ryan to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Hanson learned that Ryan had been flagged by the platform for regularly sending funds to a Russian cryptocurrency exchange—about $20,000 between March and May 2024.

From the August 2019 issue: The con man who became a true-crime writer

Hanson also received a copy of the lost-passport form Ryan had filed in April, on which he claimed that he'd probably lost his during a basement cleanup. Making false statements on a passport application is a felony punishable by significant prison time. So is insurance fraud—and Hanson discovered that on January 16, 2024, Ryan had applied for a $375,000 life-insurance policy. It sure looked like Ryan had taken out the policy while planning to fake his death.

When further digital sleuthing revealed that Ryan had flown from Canada to France on the night of August 13, Hanson contacted an FBI agent assigned to the U.S. embassy in France, who was able to confirm that Ryan had landed in Paris, but did not know where he'd gone from there.

Back when everyone assumed that Ryan was still at the bottom of the lake, Emily's mother, going through his computer to help her daughter pay bills, had discovered about $80,000 in credit-card debt that Emily didn't know about. She, along with Ryan's mother and stepfather, had decided to secretly pay off the debt and not tell Emily. Ryan also owed money to his mother and stepfather.

But perhaps the most notable discovery, this one made by the state investigator Hanson was working with, was this: In the spring of 2024, a few months before he disappeared, Ryan had been exchanging messages online with a woman named Ekaterina Vladislavovna, who went by Katya.

In one message, she'd said: “Good luck. I kiss you very hard.”

In another, she'd said: “I just want to be with you!!!”

“Katya,” Ryan responded,“I promise to you that I will love you for the rest of my life. I want no one else. I want to share a life with only you.”

For three weeks, Emily kept quiet about what her husband had done, though the tale seemed to grow more sordid every time the sheriff called—she had learned about the woman abroad and deduced the real reason for the reverse vasectomy, a procedure Emily had driven him to. As she struggled to absorb these terrible truths, not being allowed to tell anyone made her feel lonelier than she ever had.

The last week of October had been particularly hard. School and community fundraisers had raised more than $6,000 for the search for Ryan. Emily asked Sheriff Podoll what she should do about the donations. “Don't say anything,” he told her. “Just go with it.” Emily told him she needed someone to talk to.

Later that week, on Thursday, October 31, Podoll sat with Emily for 90 minutes at her church, explaining to two pastors what was really going on with the investigation. One of the pastors, who had prayed from the pulpit for Ryan, looked confused, a Bible in front of him on the table. The sheriff told them they couldn't tell their congregants. “I'm not telling you to lie,” the sheriff said. “You just can't say anything.”

How could he do this to our children? Emily wanted to know. How could he have treated me the way he did on those last days—helping around the house, watching a movie together?

“Okay, I'm going to tell you why he did that,” Podoll said. “He wanted to get out of a divorce. He wanted you to remember him how he was on those last days, so you would have good memories of him. Then he was going to move on with his life.

“In my book, he's a piece of shit,” the sheriff continued. “I apologize,” he said, turning to the pastors, “but he is.”

In early November, Podoll felt it was time to start revealing what they'd learned more widely. He invited Emily's and Ryan's families to the sheriff's office on Friday, November 8, where he planned to tell them that Ryan was not, in fact, dead. Then he'd hold a press conference to tell reporters.

Early that afternoon, the officers walked into a conference room where about a dozen relatives—including Ryan's mother, stepfather, father, and three siblings, plus Emily's mother and father—sat in chairs in a semicircle. Podoll looked around the room and said: “We're going to talk about a lot of stuff today, and it's going to be pretty shocking.” He told the group that Emily already knew what they were about to hear.

The case, he told them, had taken an unexpected turn. “We don't feel that Ryan is in our lake,” the sheriff said. “We believe he is still alive.”

Absolute silence. Podoll had never seen so much disbelief on so many faces at once. After about 20 seconds, the silence broke. Emily's father sobbed. Her mother dropped her head and wept. Ryan's brother looked at his wife (Oh my God ) and she stared back (Oh my God ). Ryan's mother looked relieved but confused. Ryan's father said, “This is not Ryan—not the Ryan we knew.” Ryan's stepfather sat quietly, appearing shocked and betrayed. The emotion in the room was so palpable that it threatened to infect the sheriff's deputies. Vande Kolk clenched his teeth to avoid crying.

Podoll had also invited Keith Cormican to the meeting. Any thought he might have given to the time he'd wasted on the lake was overwhelmed by the sound of the family's sobs. He'd made all kinds of gruesome discoveries on lake bottoms. But of all the terrible scenes he'd witnessed, he later told me, this was among the worst.

As the meeting was ending, Vande Kolk's cellphone vibrated. He looked down and saw a string of Russian letters. Holy crap, he thought.

Earlier that day, as the meeting with the family approached, Vande Kolk had suggested to his colleagues that they blitz every phone number and email address they'd discovered in an attempt to reach Ryan directly. The sheriff agreed.

After striking out with a few phone numbers, they turned to email, sending notes to Ryan's addresses, and also one to his mistress, Katya, giving it the subject heading “Call us.” They attached a photo of Ryan, one of Katya with two young children, and one of Hanson's badge, to emphasize their legitimacy. “It is very important,” Vande Kolk wrote. “This is the police in Wisconsin USA.” He had sent the email at 9:16 a.m. When he hadn't gotten a response within a few hours, he sent another one.

Realizing this was likely Katya's response, he now stepped out of the room and read the email in translation: “Hello. I do not know who you are and why you contacted me. I know the man in the photograph. His name is Ryan. Over the last year he became my good friend.”

Vande Kolk wrote back that he had something extremely important to discuss and could he please have her number.

“Please forgive me, but I do not give out my number to strangers, especially from another country,” she replied. “Please explain, what happened?”

“When is the last time you spoke with Ryan?” Vande Kolk wrote back. No response. About an hour later, he sent another email, with the subject line “Urgent.” Still no response, so he sent a few more emails, including a link to the sheriff's-office website and a news clip about the case.

At 1:46 a.m. central time, the woman finally responded, and in an email exchange explained that she was struggling to trust an American detective because of the tensions between Russia and the United States. Vande Kolk said he understood, but needed to confirm that Ryan Borgwardt was alive. He asked for a photograph.

The woman wanted assurance that the authorities would not cause her any problems. As far as she knew, she said, neither she nor Ryan had broken any laws.

“Our primary concerns are not whether there were any crimes committed, but to provide some answers to Ryan's 3 beautiful, amazing children,” Vande Kolk wrote. “Help us give his children peace. Is Ryan with you now?”

Vande Kolk worried that Ryan had been catfished, lured overseas by someone pretending to be a beautiful woman only to find himself kidnapped and ransomed or killed.

Soon the woman told him that Ryan was trying to email but his messages weren't getting through. Ryan (or someone purporting to be him) and Vande Kolk began sending messages to each other through Katya.

Hoping to verify his identity, Vande Kolk asked a question to which he thought only Ryan would know the answer: the make, model, year, and mileage of the vehicle he'd left at Big Green Lake. The response: “2015 Dodge Grand Caravan. I honestly dont remember the last mileage reading. Maybe 90k. There is no loan on the van. I was pulling a trailer full of wood pellets for my stove. I just picked them up at my friend Adam's house.”

Definitely Ryan, Vande Kolk thought. He asked him to join a videochat, but Ryan declined. “The truth is I'm terribly afraid to do anything that would help give up my location any more than you or the FBI already know.”

“Please tell me what my future looks like,” he added. “Am I looking at jail time?”

“There are consequences for what has occurred,” Vande Kolk wrote. “Those consequences can be significantly mitigated by your actions going forward.”

Ryan responded by saying he was attaching a video to prove that he was not in danger. It showed him in a bland-looking apartment. “Good evening. It's Ryan Borgwardt,” he said quietly into the camera. “Today is November 11. It's approximately 10 a.m. by you guys. I'm in my apartment. I am safe, secure, no problem.”

Vande Kolk and the detectives watched the video a few times. Ryan looked healthy and surprisingly calm. Wherever he was, he seemed to be there by choice.

Faking one's death is not technically illegal. But the detectives thought there was evidence to support a charge for obstructing an officer—a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months in jail—because Ryan had planted physical evidence meant to mislead them. Maybe further investigation could lead to more serious charges, such as passport or insurance fraud, but they didn't know if the feds would get excited about investigating an otherwise-law-abiding husband in the throes of a midlife crisis. Furthermore, the detectives suspected that Ryan was in a country that didn't have an extradition treaty with the U.S.

For the deputies, the case had become personal. This guy had fooled them. The idea that he might get to disappear without consequence galled them. If nothing else, he needed to reimburse taxpayers for the more than $35,000 they'd spent on the search. So the detectives wanted Ryan in handcuffs. They also wanted him to own up to what he'd done to his wife and children, and to try to make things right with them.

But to bring Ryan to justice, the detectives had to prove that he had planted evidence to mislead them—and they needed him to return to Green Lake.

Vande Kolk set about trying to figure out why Ryan had gone to such lengths to disappear, and what might get him to come back.

An early possibility revealed itself in an email exchange Vande Kolk had with Ryan about his family. “They are amazing people,” Vande Kolk wrote of Ryan's wife and children. “That's because Jesus fills their hearts with love, confidence and hope,” Ryan replied. “Their mom did a great job of that with those 3.”

“I agree with you,” Vande Kolk replied. “I have never seen such love and forgiveness in a group of people, and love like that only comes from Jesus.”

The men settled into near-daily communication. Ryan came across as remorseful and polite. He said he really did want to “fix everything possible that I just destroyed about 3 months ago.” He apologized for the time the sheriff's office had wasted searching the lake.

Soon, though, another side of Ryan emerged. He told Vande Kolk he was angry that the sheriff's office had made him sound like a “200% dirt bag” in the press conference. He was irritated by the implication that he'd been “living ‘large'” abroad. “That couldn't be further from the truth,” he wrote. “I truly tried to take as little as possible with me to LEAVE MY FAMILY WITH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.” Yes, he conceded, he'd moved a “decent amount” of money over before he left, but he said that he'd given it away to people who needed it more than he did, and that now he couldn't even afford a plane ticket home.

Vande Kolk pressed him for information about what he'd done. “If all the people that worked on my case in multiple agencies still don't know how I got to Canada yet,” Ryan responded, “I'm not sure I want to say how I did this.” But Vande Kolk thought he could sense that Ryan wanted to tell his story. This presented another angle of approach. If you need money for a plane ticket, he told Ryan, you could probably get it from a book or movie deal.

“Yes, I think it's possible the story could make for a decent book or movie,” Ryan replied. He said he might consider it to pay off his debts.

Over time, the email conversation had become familiar, even chummy. Vande Kolk could empathize with Ryan's urge to escape his life. He thought about all the hours he himself spent on the lake, away from his family, trying to land a musky large enough to be considered “trophy size.”

Still, he found himself becoming disgusted. He'd been married for 25 years to his high-school sweetheart, and they had two children: a son, and a daughter who'd been born with a rare genetic mutation that caused mental and physical delays. They'd stuck it out through some tough things. How could a man just abandon his family like that? Vande Kolk thought. We've messed around with this guy long enough.

Dropping his friendly tone, Vande Kolk wrote that he'd heard Ryan's own father had left the family when Ryan was young. “I cannot understand how you would want to do something like that to your kids,” Vande Kolk wrote. Was Ryan really just going to hide from his children? What he was doing to them, Vande Kolk wrote, was worse than a divorce. “You move off to live a new life, and your kids get no support from you financially, mentally or spiritually.”

Ryan said he'd had no choice. “I just couldn't handle life anymore,” Ryan wrote. He said he was roughly $200,000 in debt, not including his mortgage, and didn't know how he would begin to pay that off.

“My life in the Watertown area is over,” he wrote. No one would ever forget what he'd done, even if they ultimately forgave him. “Everything is just so much easier if I'm dead.”

Vande Kolk questioned Ryan's faith, suggesting that he was making Christians look bad. “You always talk about how you have this need to help others,” he wrote. But “maybe all you care about is yourself.” Ryan's daughter had recently gotten into a fight with some kids at school. Ryan's younger son had cried that morning because he didn't understand why his dad wouldn't come home. “These kids did nothing to deserve all this. Come back and make it right before it gets worse.”

A day passed with no response. Worried that he'd been too harsh, Vande Kolk sent several recent pictures of Ryan's kids.

“You can fix this,” he wrote. “Show them what a man of God does when times get tough. Show them what bravery is. Show them your love.”

Coming back would be a terrible idea, Ryan responded. He had nowhere to live, no car, no job, no church. He didn't want to force his kids to visit every other weekend. “I was that kid, that life sucks,” he wrote. Soon enough, the kids wouldn't want to spend time with him anyway. “It's how divorce works,” he wrote. “I will become the enemy.”

But what most concerned him, he said, was being separated from Katya, the woman who had saved him from his loneliness. Without her, “I might as well come home in a box.”

Vande Kolk's response was blunt: If Ryan could figure out how to disappear to the other side of the world, he could figure out how to return to Wisconsin. Ryan's parents had each offered him a room to stay in; his mother even said she would welcome Katya.

“For goodness sake Ryan,” Vande Kolk wrote. “Your kids.”

A few days later, Ryan emailed to say that he could come home for up to three months to “fix” as much as possible, but that ultimately he planned to stay with Katya. He said his was a “semi normal American divorce story”—though that semi was doing a lot of work.

He finally told Vande Kolk where he was: Batumi, a city in Georgia, the former Soviet republic. He liked it there, and had gotten to know many Russians, who were “seriously just like us from Wisconsin.”

Vande Kolk kept the conversation light and continued to engage, not wanting to scare off his quarry.

A few days after Thanksgiving, Ryan forwarded a screenshot of his flight confirmation. “Whatever happens now is in God's hands,” he wrote.

On December 10, 2024, Vande Kolk and Detective Hanson met at the Green Lake County Sheriff's Office at 5:30 a.m. to begin the roughly three-hour drive to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, where Ryan was scheduled to arrive at 10:10 a.m. They were nervous. Although the Green Lake detectives believed they had a strong case for an obstruction charge, that was only a misdemeanor—not serious enough to merit an arrest in another state. So they were going to have to persuade Ryan to come to the sheriff's office and give a statement voluntarily. If he declined to talk, or decided to leave O'Hare on his own, they couldn't stop him.

After Ryan's plane landed, U.S. Customs and Border Protection escorted Vande Kolk and Hanson to the secure customs area. As a group of passengers moved toward passport control, Vande Kolk spotted a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt. It's him. Vande Kolk wondered if anyone else would recognize Ryan from all the news coverage. No one seemed to.

An agent brought Ryan over. “Welcome home,” Vande Kolk said.

A few hours later, Ryan was sitting in an interview room. Vande Kolk was at a metal desk to Ryan's right. Hanson sat in another chair and read aloud the Miranda warning.

During the email back-and-forth with Vande Kolk, Ryan had begun to outline how he'd carried out his plot. Now, over three hours in the sheriff's office, Ryan elaborated.

He first crossed paths with Katya online in December 2023, eight months before his disappearance. “A dating website?” Hanson asked. “Online,” Ryan said, declining to specify further. They'd talked once or twice, and he'd promised to contact her again after the holidays. They reconnected in late January 2024 and quickly became good friends, Ryan said.

By February, the friendship had turned romantic. She sent him video messages in Russian, which he translated to English. They began talking about a future together.

At first the notion of faking his death was purely a fantasy, but soon it began to gel into an actual plan. He researched stories of people who'd ostensibly done it, including a German billionaire who'd vanished while skiing. He considered staging his death while duck hunting on the Mississippi River, because people died there all the time, their bodies washing away. But he couldn't figure out how to plan a solo trip that far away without making Emily suspicious. He settled on Big Green Lake, because it had areas deep enough for his body to plausibly never surface.

He ordered an electric bike and two bike batteries for about $1,000 on Amazon, then deleted the account he'd used for the purchase.

By now he was committed to the plan. In the week beforehand, he watched the weather, eventually settling on Sunday. That morning, he went to church with his family, hoping they'd have Communion together one last time. But he got asked to usher, which was disappointing, he said, because he didn't get to sit beside Emily. After church, he went to his shop. One of the things he worked on, he said, was preparing a new laptop for Emily. He explained that he didn't feel confident in his ability to wipe his own laptop, so he'd purchased a replica with a new hard drive for her. He tried to move over financial records and other files to make things easier for her when he was “dead,” but apparently he'd copied over “one too many things” and left evidence for investigators. He returned home for a couple of hours, hooked up the trailer, and said goodbye to Emily and the kids. He drove back to the shop, where he pulled the trailer close to the building so security cameras would not record him loading the bike. At a Walmart in Oshkosh he bought a duffel bag, snacks, and a ball cap to conceal his face.

He arrived at Big Green Lake around 10 p.m. He parked the van about 10 steps from the water. He stashed the bike and two bags in high grass among trees. Then he loaded his fishing pole, fishing net, tackle box, and a large duffel bag into the kayak. As he glided into the night, he saw campfires dotting the shoreline.

A tailwind helped carry him toward the lake's center. He'd studied maps of the lake and reached what he believed to be a deep area. One boat passed by, then another. When all seemed clear, he tossed his phone into the water. He used a manual pump to inflate a child-size raft he'd purchased for about $20, and climbed into it. Steadying himself in the tiny vessel, he flipped the kayak, which drifted out of sight. Around midnight, he began paddling. He said he didn't know how long it took to get back to shore, fighting the wind and the waves with the raft's toy paddles, but he thought at least an hour or two.

When he got close to shore, he hopped out of the raft. His first step found solid ground. On his second, he sank into black mud up to his waist. He traveled about 40 feet with the muck trying to swallow him. When he emerged from the water, he ran across the road, deflated the raft, and packed it into one of his bags. Looking at the road, he saw that he'd left muddy footprints. “I thought, There's no way in the world you guys are going to miss these,” he said. He tried to pour water on them but soon realized it wasn't much use, and he was in a hurry.

Sometime around 1 or 2 a.m., he climbed onto the bike. He rode through the night, pedaling roughly 70 miles, mostly on back roads, all the way to Madison. He stopped a couple of times, to change into dry pants and eat a granola bar. The sky, he thought, had never looked more beautiful.

Around 5 a.m., he said, he'd thought about Emily, because he knew she'd soon be waking and would wonder where he was. Around 9:15 a.m., he stopped in a densely wooded park, where he left the bike. He tossed his damp sweatshirt and the raft in a garbage can. Then he walked 40 minutes to a Greyhound station. He got there just in time for a 10:05 a.m. bus to Toronto, via Milwaukee, Chicago, and Detroit, switching buses twice along the way.

“I'm on the bus,” he said he texted Katya from a burner phone. “So far so good.” Shortly after he boarded, the phone stopped working.

At the Canadian border, agents were suspicious because he had no driver's license and his phone wasn't working. But after about 20 tense minutes, they let him through. He arrived at the Toronto airport, where he used his laptop and a prepaid debit card to buy a plane ticket to Europe. He was carrying $5,500 in cash, below the threshold requiring a customs declaration.

The Air France meal was one of the best of his life. After landing in Paris, another plane took him to Tbilisi, Georgia. Katya arrived to meet him. They spent the next few nights at a hotel.

Facing Ryan in the interview room, Vande Kolk thought he seemed different from the man he'd been communicating with online. This version of Ryan was arrogant, unable to conceal pride in his accomplishment. At times Ryan expressed regret, but these moments were overshadowed by his boasting.

Katya hadn't liked his plan, Ryan said. Faking his own death was “pretty bad,” she told him, worse than divorce. But faking his death, Ryan said, “checked more boxes.”

“Talk to me about that,” Vande Kolk said. “Everybody's a little bit perplexed as to why you took this path.”

“I guess in the end it came down to the feeling of failure in about every aspect of your life,” Ryan said. “Hoping to be remembered for the better things, not all the mistakes.”

When Ryan reached the point in the tale where he arrived in Tbilisi, Vande Kolk asked for more specifics about his planning. For an obstruction charge, he needed to get Ryan talking about whether he'd intentionally set out to convince the detectives that he'd drowned. “The amount of hours that I spent trying to disappear would blow your mind,” Ryan said. His entire plan, he admitted, had hinged on him dying in the lake. “Obviously the whole idea was to sell the death,” Ryan said.

That oughta do it, Vande Kolk thought.

Sergeant Ward was watching the interview on a monitor down the hall. He'd spent the most time on the lake looking for Ryan. He'd watched Emily absorb the news that her husband was dead, then struggle to grasp the news that he was not. With all the money the county had spent on the search, it could have bought a new snowplow and fixed a lot of potholes. One reason he was not in the interview room was because everyone knew he'd have a hard time hiding his disgust.

Some of Ward's disgust was with himself for having gotten played. Of course, he wasn't the only one who'd been duped; Ryan had deceived everyone close to him, along with the general Green Lake County community. Ward liked to say that if you got a flat tire in Green Lake, there would be a traffic jam of people stopping to help. Ryan had exploited that kindness. All because he didn't have the guts to look his wife in the eye and say, “I want a divorce.” He'd chosen to make himself a blameless drowning victim in the memories of his children.

Ward followed intently when Hanson began asking Ryan about the roughly $20,000 he'd taken from his own family in order to help a woman he'd never met. Ryan said he was already in so much debt that $20,000 didn't do much for him. Whereas for Katya, he said, that amount was significant.

But Ryan still owed hundreds of thousands of dollars. Emily, struggling to provide for three kids on her teacher's salary, had begun accepting food stamps.

This is one of the most two-faced criminals I've ever met in 23 years of working in law enforcement, Ward thought.

“Listening to him talk, I get the willies,” he told me later. “He's just a really devious person.”

After nearly three hours, Vande Kolk told Ryan he was placing him under arrest for obstructing an officer. Ryan seemed surprised and indignant: He'd talked to investigators as soon as they'd contacted him. He'd come to Green Lake and answered their questions. Vande Kolk explained that the obstruction charge was based on what he'd done at the lake, not how he'd handled himself afterward. He asked Ryan to stand and clicked the handcuffs.

Ryan spent that night in jail. The next day, he pleaded not guilty. He was released on a $500 bond. The same week, Emily filed for legal separation, calling the marriage “irretrievably broken.” She asked for sole custody of the kids.

One morning this past July, I drove along a two-lane road surrounded by cornfields and arrived at the Borgwardts' stone ranch house. Their minivan was parked out front, along with the trailer Ryan had used to take his kayak to the lake. Snapdragons bloomed in flower beds along the front walk.

Emily greeted me wearing shorts and a tank top, her shoulders tanned from working in the garden. We sat in the living room, where we could hear her daughter, 14, and a friend laughing as they swam in an aboveground pool in the backyard. Her younger son, 15, mowed the lawn out front. A basket of laundry awaited folding.

Emily told me that her younger son and her daughter had seen and texted with their father since he'd returned. Their older son, now 18, had refused to speak with him.

Ryan was living with his mother and stepfather in Appleton, an hour and a half away. He was not helping to support the family, Emily said. Since his return, Ryan had been by the house a couple of times. They were now texting regularly, and she sent him pictures of the kids. She described their relationship as amicable.

How is that possible? 

She said that the man who'd faked his death in Big Green Lake was not the Ryan she'd known for 25 years. Not the one who'd played board games with the kids and coached their basketball teams. She still missed that man.

Their life in Watertown had been ordinary, maybe even dull sometimes. But for Emily, it had felt like enough. Looking back, she could see that she and Ryan had become a little more distant over the years, but in ways that she did not think unusual for busy parents.

From the March 2024 issue: Jamie Thompson on stopping a school shooter

Emily had filed for separation on the advice of a lawyer friend who worried that she might be affected by any civil or criminal judgments against her husband, and they were now legally divorced. But to her, their vows were a different matter. “I'm a Christian and I believe strongly in marriage,” she said.

I asked if she would consider reconciling. I assumed the answer would be a hard no. I was wrong. Emily said she would be willing to try, despite how much work that might take.

“We all sin,” she told me. “Some sins in human eyes are bigger than others, hurt more than others, have more consequences than others. But in God's eyes, they don't. A sin is a sin.” She added, “God forgives us for our sins multiple times every day.”

If God could forgive, so could she.

She knew some people would find that hard to understand. “He's still the father of my kids,” she said, “and I don't want that relationship to be more strained than it already is.”

On Tuesday, August 26, Ryan sat beside his lawyer in Green Lake County Circuit Court. Judge Mark T. Slate had reviewed the agreement Ryan had made with prosecutors: He would plead no contest to obstructing an officer, spend 45 days in county jail, and pay $30,000 in restitution.

The judge turned to the district attorney, Gerise LaSpisa, who summarized Ryan's ruse: how he'd taken out a life-insurance policy, reversed his vasectomy, transferred money overseas. “Certainly any criminal charge, conviction, and sentence that this court today hands down will not be able to come close to undoing the incredible damage that this defendant, by his premeditated, selfish actions, has done not only to his family, but our community,” LaSpisa said.

Ryan's attorney, Erik Johnson, reminded the judge that his client had been charged only with a misdemeanor. “He came back from Europe to take responsibility for his actions,” Johnson said. He noted that Ryan had no criminal record and had already paid the $30,000 restitution. (Ryan has declined to say how he came up with the money.)

Judge Slate asked Ryan if he had anything to say.

“I deeply regret the actions that I did that night, and all the pain that I caused my family and friends,” Ryan said, looking uncomfortable.

When the moment of sentencing arrived, the judge surprised everyone: Noting that Ryan's fraud had lasted for 89 days, from the day he disappeared until the day Vande Kolk emailed him, Judge Slate sentenced Ryan to 89 days in county jail, almost double what the prosecutors had asked for. Ryan needed to begin serving his time within 60 days.

For someone who'd attempted such an audacious caper, Ryan looked sad and small as he walked out of the courtroom, a middle-aged man scurrying off, bald spot shining, as a reporter followed him asking if he'd spoken with his kids.

The next morning, I arrived at the Elsewhere Market & Coffee House in Oshkosh, about 30 miles northeast of Big Green Lake, where Ryan had suggested we meet. When I'd first emailed him, in April, he'd responded that he couldn't discuss what happened, because he feared it would hurt his family. I emailed him again in July. “For the sake of my kids and Emily,” he replied, “I wish you'd find something else to write about”; he suggested Jeffrey Epstein or the Ukraine war. Still, we kept emailing, and as the sentencing neared, we got into a regular back-and-forth. He said that he found it almost impossible to talk about why he'd faked his death without discussing his marriage—but that if he did so, he knew it would sound like he was blaming Emily and painting himself as a victim. He laid out the narrative as he saw it unfolding on the news: “1) I'm the ‘bad guy' in the story. 2) Absolutely NO ONE will want to question otherwise. 3) I NEED to be the bad guy in the story for my kids.”

He suggested that the story could be a cautionary tale for couples about the importance of communication in marriage. He seemed unable to resist shifting blame onto Emily. “Truthfully the very fact I could pull all of this off shows how little interest she had in my daily work,” he wrote.

As we sat eating breakfast, his eyes staring into the middle distance, he told me that he believed a spouse should be like a well you can draw from. “I went around thirsty,” he said.

What he meant was that meeting Katya had given him “the taste of someone caring again.”

Why not just get a divorce?

“Divorce hurts more than people think,” he said. “I was trying to protect the kids.” He said that his own parents had separated when he was 3.

Although he planned to stay with Katya—and, he implied, marry her—he hoped to repair his relationship with his children, he said. (Efforts to reach Katya directly were unsuccessful.) He'd been angry when the prosecutor announced in open court that he'd reversed his vasectomy, he said, because he worried that the kids would think he wanted to replace them.

“I guess I just didn't feel like there was any other way,” he said.

He continued: “Kids grow up, and kids leave.”

A long pause.

“I like what I have now.”

The day of the hearing, Vande Kolk climbed into his truck and headed home, feeling melancholy.

At times he had wondered whether it might have been better if they'd stopped searching and just let Ryan's story end—at least as far as his friends and family would ever know—there in the lake. But he'd had a job to do and he'd done it.

Vande Kolk thought again about the many hours he'd spent fishing instead of at home with his family. He wondered: Was this his own way of fleeing his life? So many mornings he'd crept out of the house at 4 a.m., leaving his wife and kids so he could indulge his own solitary quest to catch that trophy-size musky. He felt some guilt over that. But he also knew it was part of what made everything else work.

As the sun dropped low over the golden fields, Vande Kolk pulled into his driveway.

“Supper is ready,” his daughter texted.

“What is it?” he replied.

“Something amazing,” she wrote.

He could smell it as soon as he walked in the back door. His wife, who'd worked at the bank all day, had cooked the family meal: chicken-bacon-cheese casserole. The family sat together in the living room, chatting about their day as Wheel of Fortune played in the background. Later, maybe he'd mow the lawn, then fall asleep on the couch watching the Brewers game. Living an ordinary life that provided, he thought, everything that mattered.

Vox's Astead Herndon and immigration reporter Molly O'Toole unpack the latest (confusing) polls.

When President Donald Trump won the 2024 election, many American voters wanted immigration reduced, and Trump quickly complied. He boosted funding for immigration enforcement, opened new detention centers, and pushed more Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as Customs and Border Patrol troops, into US cities.

While American disapproval of immigration was key to Trump winning two presidential elections, polls today show a growing divide.

Gallup found 30 percent of Americans want immigration decreased, which is down from 55 percent a year ago. In a New York Times/Sienna national poll, a majority of voters still disapproved of immigration but also said Trump's actions on enforcement have gone too far.

According to immigration reporter Molly O'Toole, the shift is a response to Trump's oversimplified message that “all immigration is bad.” She said it was a successful message with no effective counterbalancing force until people saw firsthand Trump's deportation tactics.

Speaking with Today, Explained fill-in host Astead Herndon, O'Toole explained why capturing voter sentiment on immigration often misses nuance, and why it may not deter the president's push for faster and more extreme methods of arrests. 

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

_____

Recently, I've been curious about how the public is reacting to Trump's immigration raids. Because, on the one hand, he promised all this, and you could argue voters knew what they were signing up for. But now that they're seeing it in real life, are they having buyer's remorse? 

What Trump has done very effectively is shift the American public's perception on immigration to the right. If you look at the polling, there actually is much more bipartisan support for immigration and broadly positive views on immigration writ large than you would think based on the rhetoric that we've heard and the electoral successes.

Instead of a conversation where illegal immigration is “bad” but refugees, asylum seekers, and other forms of legal immigration are “good” — which is how the debate broke down in the pre-Trump era — now, you just have “all immigration is bad.” And, in that way, I think the Trump administration has been remarkably effective at shifting the nature of the conversation.

That speaks to something that Democrats have done over the last several years, which is to kind of agree with Trump's premise rather than offering their own affirmative vision. Is that how you have seen it?

Exactly. Trump has a strategy here, and it has been effective. But it's easier to shift the whole conversation to one side of the spectrum if there is no counterbalance from the other side.Some recent polls have found that, while voters want mostly immigrants who come to this country illegally to be deported, they don't necessarily like the way the administration is doing it. It's kind of weird, right? Voters want deportations, but not like this.

This gets into the complexity of the issue and the fact that political messaging is not a useful tool for communicating something this complicated. Because Trump shifted this conversation to “all immigration bad,” the American voter was not thinking, “Well, wait. Actually, a lot of these actions are targeting people who have permission to be here. They're asylum seekers. They're not these scary sort of criminals that the Trump campaign was talking about.”

There was a Gallup poll this summer that really drove this home for me. In 2024, 55 percent of people wanted to reduce all immigration, which I think is helpful to understand what was fueling Donald Trump's comeback. But this year, the same poll found that number had dropped by almost half; just 30 percent of people wanted to reduce all immigration. It seems as if now that Donald Trump is there, maybe the sentiment or the public effort has at least swung back to the other side.

I think that poll is absolutely fascinating, but it's really hard to know what to attribute it to. It's hard to know to what extent that shift — which is a really quite dramatic shift sort of back towards a pre-2021 feeling on immigration — is because people feel like, “Okay, Trump ‘fixed' the border.” Or does it have to do with people seeing what those promises look like in practice and being like, “Wait a second, I didn't vote for that”?

It seems the White House is still pushing forward with deportations, even though there seems to be growing evidence that the public is liking what it's seeing less and less. Under the normal rules of politics, isn't that a bad thing to do? Why do we think the Trump administration seems completely removed from that more traditional form of political calculus?

I do think that the Trump administration has very effectively used the media to suck up all the oxygen in the room as a way to really magnify their sort of messaging. The Trump administration doesn't really care what the media says about their message; they just want that message to get out. I think that what we saw in 2016 — and I think what we saw in 2024 — is you can have a very impassioned vocal minority that can win an election, even if what they support is not necessarily what a majority of the American public supports.

And so, I think the messaging, even though it seems counterintuitive, that's who it's for. It's for their diehard supporters. Then, I think there's another level, which is: They want people to be afraid, to “self-deport.”

The point is the intimidation.

Not just of immigrant communities; they want people to be afraid to protest. They want people to be afraid to come out. But I think time will tell also whether it turns enough people off that it becomes a less effective political strategy.

Do you know what your job will look like a year from now? How about in three, or even five?

EY, one of the top four global accounting and consulting firms, is using AI to help its employees answer those questions.

The Big Four firm has developed a training program, known as AI Now 2.0, that acts as a ""thought partner"" to help its employees foresee how their roles will evolve as a result of AI, Simon Brown, global learning and development leader at EY, told Business Insider in an interview.

Staff answer a series of questions about their job, day-to-day responsibilities, and overall deliverables, then upload the answers to EYQ, the firm's internal Chat GPT-like tool.

EYQ then generates an analysis of how their current role might change because of the impact of AI, and helps them identify the skills, knowledge, and abilities they might need in the future.

The tool isn't trying to predict with certainty what an accounting or consulting role will be in five years' time, said Brown.

""It's hard to predict where many of these roles will be in the future, so we are not relying on AI to do that,"" he said.

Instead, it's aimed at helping EY staffers identify how they can better use AI in their current jobs and engage with what to expect from their future path at EY and what skills they'll need to succeed in that, said Brown.

EY launched AI Now 2.0 in January this year. Brown said that using the programme is voluntary, but around half of EY's 406,000 global employees have engaged with it, and all new recruits take the training as part of their onboarding process.

Developing an enterprise-wide training that could also be personal to each individual has been key, said Brown. ""It helps to show and bring to life in a totally relevant way where AI might be able to help them,"" he said.

AI is already taking on everyday tasks that employees once handled, reshaping the skills employers prize most, and making workforce transformation a priority for HR departments.

Upskilling the workforce for AI is even more of a business imperative for consulting leaders — who act as advisors to the world's leading companies and must demonstrate to their clients that their own teams successfully embody the AI expertise they promote.

""We all know that 40% of our current skills will be different skills in five years. The technical skills you need to upskill, but you need to have the mentality, to be able to do that,"" Imgard Naudin ten Cate, global leader of talent acquisition at EY, told Business Insider.

""We'll definitely see so much more skills and skills erosion. So making sure that you can make that transition is so important,"" she said.

Fellow Big Four firm PwC has designed a program to train employees in managing risks and leadership in the AI era. The program of resources includes ""appealing online content, in-person training, hackathons, and game show-style competitions.""

At KPMG, Niale Cleobury, global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider the firm has tackled the workforce transformation challenge by developing an AI tool that breaks down roles by tasks, thinks about AI use cases, and looks at capacity savings.

""We can put in every role in the whole organisation and within a couple of minutes we can get all of that insight in terms of skill differences,"" Cleobury said.

Holiday travel is starting to look incredibly dicey.

The shutdown so far has created massive air traffic control delays, leaving some airports so understaffed that they had to temporarily shut down. Starting on Friday, federal officials will reduce 10% of flights at 40 US airports to manage traffic.

Six airports — Anchorage, Atlanta, Charlotte, Boston, Seattle, and Philadelphia — confirmed to Business Insider that they are among those temporarily losing some service.

The FAA has not yet released an official list of all affected airports. The aviation analytics company Cirium compiled a list of 100 major airports that are among the most likely to be included.

It said that up to 1,800 flights representing about 268,000 seats could be cut on Friday.

Here's the full list from Cirium:

CBS News and The Washington Post shared a list of 40 potentially affected airports, citing unnamed sources.

Business Insider contacted the airports on the list. Some airports — including Indianapolis, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Memphis, Detroit, and those in the Houston, New York, and Dallas areas — told Business Insider they were aware of the planned cuts but had not yet been notified that they were on the list. They referred Business Insider to the government and the airlines.

Minneapolis airport told Business Insider that operations are normal as of Thursday, but said ""if reductions are enacted, travelers should be prepared for flight disruptions"" at Minneapolis and other airports across the US.

The affected airports are subject to change. The FAA and the Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The reductions come at an especially bad time, as the busy Thanksgiving and Christmas travel seasons approach. And there appears to be some scrambling among the government, airports, and airlines to determine what can be shaved with just a few days' notice.

Some airlines have given customers a general idea of what to expect, but details are scarce.

Frontier Airlines told Business Insider that most of its flights are expected to ""operate as planned"" come Friday, but will proactively communicate with customers as changes occur. It did not offer exact routes. Southwest similarly said it did not yet have specific figures.

United CEO Scott Kirby provided some information in a Wednesday statement, saying none of the airline's long-haul international or hub-to-hub flights would be affected. Instead, he said reductions will be on regional routes — which connect hubs to smaller airports — and domestic mainline flights that do not travel between hubs.

United has seven main hubs in the mainland US: Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles. It also has a hub in Guam.

United is planning to reduce its flights by 4% from Friday through the weekend, before gradually increasing that to 10%, a source close to the airline told Business Insider. That's roughly 250 to 300 daily cancellations, affecting around 25,000 customers a day, they added.

Cirium data estimates that Chicago O'Hare, if on the list, would be the most affected airport on Friday, with 121 flights canceled across all airlines. Atlanta — where Delta has its major hub — would be second at 104 flights.

The schedule adjustments have created uncertainty for travelers, and some industry experts advise that travelers should prepare for longer lines and potential delays.

""If you're checking bags, plan for long lines with extra time at the airport, and pack any valuables or time-sensitive items in your carry-on,"" Audrey Kohout, Co-CEO of luggage shipping companies LuggageForward and LugLess, said in a media statement.

For those whose flights get canceled, in most cases, airlines would try to rebook them on an alternative flight.

American, Delta, Frontier, and United have said that customers will be able to change or refund their flights at no extra cost.

Southwest said that passengers whose flights are canceled will be eligible for a refund. As of noon ET, Alaska does not have a flexible travel policy in place.

Some airline CEOs are already warning people to prepare for the worst: ""If your flight is canceled, your chances of being stranded are high, so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline,"" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in a LinkedIn post.

In this article

Microsoft on Thursday said it's forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced artificial intelligence research.

Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group that includes Bing and the Copilot assistant, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team, and said in a blog post that he'll be leading it. 

""We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable,"" Suleyman wrote. ""We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.""

The decision comes months after Facebook parent Meta spent billions to hire talent for its new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit that's working on research and products. The term superintelligence typically refers to machines deemed more intelligent than the smartest people.

Suleyman was a co-founder of AI lab DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014. After leaving Google in 2022, he co-founded and led AI startup Inflection. Microsoft hired Suleyman and several other Inflection employees last year.

Top technology companies have rushed to hire leading AI engineers and researchers, augmenting their products with generative AI capabilities. The boom started with OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022. 

Microsoft uses OpenAI models in Bing and Copilot, while OpenAI runs workloads in Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft also owns a $135 billion equity stake in OpenAI following a restructuring.

Microsoft has taken steps to reduce its dependence on OpenAI. After the Inflection deal, the software company also began drawing on models from Google and from Anthropic, which was founded by former OpenAI executives.

The new Microsoft AI research group will focus on providing useful companions for people that can help in education and other domains, Suleyman wrote in his blog post. It will also pursue narrow areas in medicine and in renewable energy production.

""We'll have expert level performance at the full range of diagnostics, alongside highly capable planning and prediction in operational clinical settings,"" Suleyman wrote.

As investors and analysts are increasingly voicing their concerns about overspending on AI without a clear path to profits, Suleyman said he wants ""to make clear that we are not building a superintelligence at any cost, with no limits.""

In this article

Chipotle and Cava pinned weaker sales on younger customers who are pulling back and packing lunches.

But Gen Z shoppers are still spending on Coach handbags to bring to work — even if they're skipping bowls and burritos.

Coach's parent company Tapestry raised its full-year outlook Thursday, after beating Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue and posting double-digit sales gains in North America.

In an interview with CNBC, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said the company's sales in the quarter were fueled by attracting new customers, particularly within Gen Z.

The company, which also includes Kate Spade, acquired over 2.2 million new customers globally in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by growth in Gen Z consumers compared to the prior year. The company said that generation, which is typically defined as spanning in age from roughly 13 to 29, accounted for about 35% of new customers.

""The Gen Z consumer, specifically, is highly fashion engaged, spending slightly more of their budget on fashion,"" she said.

She added those younger customers have a high retention rate, ""maybe busting a myth that these customers, Gen Z customers, aren't sticky or loyal.""

Here's what the company reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Tapestry's net income in the three-month period that ended Sept. 27 rose to $274.8 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $186.6 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

It hiked its full-year outlook for both sales and profits, saying it now expects revenue around $7.3 billion for the year, which would be 4% or 5% growth from the prior year, compared to its prior expectations of nearly $7.2 billion. For earnings per diluted share, it now expects a range of $5.45 to $5.60, higher than its prior guidance of $5.30 to $5.45.

Despite the raised forecast and better than-expected quarterly results, Tapestry's shares fell about 9% in premarket trading.

With its Gen Z strength, Tapestry defied some other companies' assessments on the health of younger shoppers.

Cava saw demand among the 25- to 34-year-old consumers fall as the fast-casual chain entered its current quarter, CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview with CNBC. She attributed a pullback to younger diners' higher unemployment rate, their greater likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring and tariffs creating ""an overall fog for the consumer.""

Chipotle's CEO Scott Boatwright similarly said the chain is seeing younger diners visit less frequently, especially those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old.

And some holiday forecasts have also reflected a predicted drop in spending by Gen Z. According to consulting firm PwC's holiday survey, Gen Z plans to cut average holiday spending the most among generations surveyed compared to the year-ago period — with respondents in that age group saying they plan to spend 23% less.

Deloitte found a similar trend, with Gen Z consumers saying in its separate survey that they plan to spend an average of 34% less this holiday season than a year ago. Weakness carried into the next oldest generation, as millennials — respondents between ages 29 and 44 in the poll — said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season.

Just a day after its last Ethereum deposit that raised eyebrows across the crypto community, leading investment firm BlackRock has executed another massive offload in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On Thursday, October 6th, renowned on-chain crypto tracking platform Lookonchain announced another major deposit of 4,653 BTC and 57,455 ETH into Coinbase Prime.

What is BlackRock up to?

According to data shared by the source, BlackRock transferred about $478.5 million in BTC and $194.9 million in ETH, worth a total of over $673 million, to Coinbase Prime within the last few hours.

It is important to note that the move came just 24 hours after BlackRock deposited 34,777 ETH worth approximately $114.97 million into the same Coinbase Prime address.

Notably, the repeated transfers — executed in multiple batches of roughly 300 BTC or 10,000 ETH at a time— signal a deliberate institutional positioning, likely an attempt to sell off large portions of its holdings.

While BlackRock is known to manage the world's largest Bitcoin ETF and recently launched its Ethereum ETF, it has continued to dominate the ETF ecosystem with consistent daily inflows.

However, the frequent sell attempts the firm has executed recently have raised questions about whether it is still holding on to its bullish stance.

While major Bitcoin funds like BlackRock often move assets to adjust holdings and match inflows or market demand, some commentators believe the firm could simply be providing liquidity for ETF operations rather than exiting its positions.

Nonetheless, the timing of the transaction has triggered greater concern, as it coincides with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins sliding aggressively over the past week.

With speculations suggesting that the market may have already concluded its bullish phase, panic selling has spread across the market as investors gradually lose confidence.

Thus, BlackRock's suspected sell activity has heightened fear among traders as the market continues to remain in deep red territory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Is Ethereum's Volatility Affecting its Market Sentiment?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/ethereum-market-dynamics-crypto-payroll-integration","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:43:47 GMT","

Ethereum's price action currently sits at a precarious point. The support level lingers around $3,130. This aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-week moving average. It's the kind of support every investor and startup hopes will hold, but with Ethereum's price down 3.24% in the last 24 hours and 12.72% over the last week, one has to question if that hope is realistic at all.

OBV is currently on a downtrend. The On-Balance Volume indicator is generally a telltale sign of buying and selling pressure. A downtrend suggests a waning interest in buying. If Ethereum's price breaks below $3,130, support could fall towards $2,828 or even $2,115. This situation might make startups hesitant about adopting crypto salaries.

An OBV downtrend sends a clear signal: investor confidence is faltering. It complicates the prospect of paying employees in cryptocurrencies. If OBV continues to trend down, it places startups in a tough spot when it comes to creating a stable salary structure.

Enter stablecoins, which could be a lifeline. By paying in stablecoins or converting to fiat, startups can offer predictable salaries. It's a way to keep employees from feeling the brunt of market volatility, allowing companies to remain competitive in their offerings.

If OBV continues its downward trajectory, startups might postpone their crypto payroll plans until the market stabilizes. It emphasizes the need for risk management in this fast-changing landscape.

Ethereum's price fluctuations offer a masterclass in what decentralized organizations should consider while planning crypto payroll. The volatility itself can destabilize payroll, suggesting that organizations need to have risk strategies in place. Using stablecoins could help employees avoid sudden drops in value. 

Emerging interest in Ethereum suggests a growing demand for crypto payroll. More organizations are delving into DeFi and Web3, making the case for crypto payroll more convincing. However, caution is key; operational costs can shift with Ethereum's price.

Ethereum's price history also hints at potential price appreciation, serving as a hedge against inflation for employees. Crypto payments can potentially protect purchasing power better than fiat, especially in an inflationary climate. 

Asian fintech startups are leading the charge in adopting Ethereum payroll models. They harness the advantages of blockchain, but volatility is a formidable challenge. Many are adopting risk management tactics, like stablecoin payroll.

Smart contracts can enhance payroll efficiency. Startups can automate salary calculations and payments, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. The cost benefits of crypto payroll are substantial, yet concerns about volatility remain.

The uptick in institutional interest, including ETF inflows from major players, suggests confidence in Ethereum's financial role. This could further motivate Asian startups to adopt Ethereum payroll, despite the risks.

For crypto-friendly SMEs in Europe, volatility is a pressing issue. It complicates risk management, treasury operations, and payroll budgeting. To manage this, diversification in crypto holdings and stablecoin transactions are critical.

Risk mitigation tools, like stop-loss orders, can help protect revenues and secure gains. Timing conversions between Ethereum and fiat or stablecoins is essential for liquidity.

Lastly, SMEs must navigate regulatory compliance in Europe's fragmented market. Solid treasury and risk strategies can help them benefit from blockchain innovations while remaining compliant.

In a nutshell, Ethereum's volatility forces SMEs to adopt flexible financial strategies, balancing risk management and compliance needs with the opportunities that blockchain presents.

Yesterday's 2.35% bounce produced a daily RSI reset but no bullish engulfing candle, unlike prior oversold recoveries on October 10 (5% bounce with bullish engulfing) and early August. This divergence from the established “bounce recipe” suggests the recent rally may lack the momentum needed to launch a sustained uptrend.

Technically, a bull flag is conceivable but weak: overhead resistance remains near $111,000, while immediate support lies under $96,000 (mid-channel low) and approximately $92,000 (October 17 pivot). A break of these levels would likely accelerate bearish sentiment. Although the daily TBO Fast line (~$107,000) offers a recovery target, Bitcoin's close below the $106,000 “line in the sand” and its position beneath the compressed daily TBO Cloud reinforce a “strong bearish” outlook. The recent upward shift of daily TBO Support from $75,000 to $98,000 signals key pivot activity but also narrows the margin for downside containment.



Ethereum closed below the daily TBO Cloud on Monday, confirming “strong bearish” momentum. A minor RSI reset accompanied yesterday's rally, but daily TBO Support levels—having risen in late September—continue to be sequentially undermined as ETH tracks lower. A decisive breach below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement on this pullback reflects deteriorating technical structure.

On the upside, a move above $4,000 would face resistance around $4,100 (daily TBO Fast). Should ETH approach that level, aggressive short positions may be warranted, with a view toward a multi-year bottom. The current pattern favors further declines rather than a sustained rebound.

Combined stablecoin dominance pierced daily RSI resistance on Tuesday, increasing the likelihood of continued upside for the metric. Concurrently, the daily TBO Slow line has begun to slope upward, signaling a macro shift toward bullishness in stablecoin share—traditionally a harbinger of crypto-market caution. Despite this, there are no TBT bearish divergence or TBO Close Long signals on the daily, suggesting stablecoin allocations may keep rising and potentially weigh on crypto asset prices.

Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) closed red yesterday following an altcoin-led recovery, with daily RSI forming a lower high—indicating waning BTC strength. A drop below 57% could ensue, potentially reaching lows near 42% over the next 12 months if current trajectories persist. This anticipated BTC.D decline may spur a final “alt season” rally, as traders misinterpret falling dominance as a buy signal—overlooking the growing stablecoin dominance that truly gauges market risk appetite.

The total crypto market cap ex-stablecoins (TOTALES) closed green but remains below the daily TBO Cloud (“strong bearish”) with no bullish engulfing pattern, marking this week's dip as a potential setup for shorting overbought tokens. Similar conditions prevail on TOTALE50 and TOTALE100.

Conversely, the OTHERS index (smaller altcoins) printed a bullish engulfing candle despite staying under the cloud, reflecting sector-specific interest. On the 4h chart, TOTAL3ESBTC shows a flattened TBO Slow line, hinting at an early-stage recovery—though traders should await a daily TBO Close Short signal for confirmation. Noteworthy moves in privacy coins (XMR, ZEC, DCR) and dormant utility tokens (DASH, DGB, 1INCH) suggest a narrative-driven rally; yet risk management via profit-taking on interim bounces and DCA remains crucial.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) printed a TBO breakout above historical resistance, which may resemble a topping pattern rather than continuation given its late timing, echoing the early-2021 setup. S&P 500 futures shed their TBT bearish divergence after a modest rebound, though weekly RSI and OBV divergence hint at underlying weakness despite strong cloud support.

The VIX eased, alleviating immediate volatility concerns, while the Nikkei retraced to its daily TBO Fast line and remains above the cloud, suggesting a potential shift to bearish consolidation. The Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng recovered modestly. Gold continues in bearish consolidation within the daily TBO Cloud but is gradually building strength, reflecting broader risk-off dynamics.

What to Know:

Gemini just switched on XRP perpetual contracts for EU customers, letting traders go long or short with up to 100x leverage and no monthly expiry.

Perps settle in $USDC and live inside Gemini's regulated EU derivatives stack, and this combo offers access to XRP volatility while keeping operations under an institutional-style framework. The launch adds a fresh venue for XRP price discovery and funding-rate strategies, which tends to attract market makers and bring tighter spreads. 

Why is this important? Because it adds more derivatives liquidity to one of the largest crypto payment assets and pulls capital into alt rotations.

As a result, $XRP has now recovered to above $2.3 in the last day (+3.49%), alongside many of the best altcoins on the market, including Ethereum (2.8%), Solana (+3.1%), and BNB (+1.04%).

When a Tier-1 venue lights up a new perp, traders often start hunting catalysts across the rest of the board. And it's often wallet infrastructure that sees the upside because that's where users bridge, swap, and stake while moving between trades.

That's the setup that can funnel attention toward top altcoin with direct utility.

Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Best Wallet, a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with an integrated DEX aggregator, a curated ‘Upcoming Tokens' presale hub, and a planned debit card.

$BEST owners get fee reductions, governance, staking boosts, and access to some of the best crypto presales on the market. If XRP perps kick off risk-on rotations, a wallet token that monetizes swaps and presale activity is a clean way to play the flow without guessing single-coin winners.

More perp venues usually equal more trading cycles, more bridging, and more on-chain execution. Wallets that compress those steps into one interface capture value at the ‘picks and shovels' layer, and Best Wallet (alongside $BEST) is designed to sit exactly there.To learn more about Best Wallet Token, read our guide.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Multi-Chain Wallet With Built-In Presale Access

Best Wallet is a non-custodial app built for daily use, not cold storage. It supports six major chains (Solana and Ethereum among them), routes same-chain and cross-chain swaps through an integrated DEX aggregator, and offers vetted ‘Upcoming Tokens' so you can join early presales from inside the wallet.

It also offers multi-wallet asset management, buying and selling within the wallet, on-ramp services, and a continuously-evolving DeFi ecosystem.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ties it all together with trading fee reductions, governance rights, and boosted staking rewards (a staking aggregator is in the works as we speak).

The roadmap shows a browser extension, NFT gallery, richer portfolio views, and a debit card to spend crypto are coming in the future.

That mix turns $BEST into a utility token linked to swaps, discovery, and payments.

So, when derivatives activity sends users rotating between majors and alts, $BEST's unified flow helps capture those transactions at the point of execution as the mechanism that returns value to holders.

$BEST's presale has raised over $16.8M, with a current token price of $0.025905. The token has substantial potential come next year – our $BEST price prediction shows a possible price point of $0.05106175 by the end of 2026 (a 97% increase from today's price).

That's not the only way to gain from this presale, though. You can stake your $BEST tokens immediately after purchase for a dynamic 78% APY (it will drop as more holders join the staking pool).

 Here's how to buy $BEST right now.

All in all, Gemini's move signals bullish times for altcoin rotations, and traders are already making moves. And Best Wallet Token can be one of the smartest investments in this period, especially if price predictions come true.

Join the $BEST presale before it ends in 22 days.

                            Algorand's Jorrin Bruns explains how the blockchain makes development faster and more accessible, empowering everyday developers to innovate. | Credit: CCN.com                        

In an industry defined by complexity, Algorand has long positioned itself as the blockchain that just works: fast, efficient, and accessible to developers from all backgrounds. But how does a network designed by cryptography pioneer Silvio Micali stay true to that promise while scaling to global use cases?

To find out, during the Blockchain Futurist Conference 2025 in Miami, CCN's Dr. Guneet Kaur sat down with Jorrin Bruns, Developer Relations Engineer at the Algorand Foundation, who spends his days bridging the gap between the technology and the builders shaping its future.

From hackathons to zero-knowledge tools, Bruns shared how Algorand is making blockchain development more straightforward, faster, and more inclusive, and why, in his view, real innovation comes from giving everyday developers the confidence to experiment.

When Bruns joined the foundation, even he was surprised by how accessible the platform had become. “You can write smart contracts in Python or TypeScript,” he said, smiling.

“That immediately makes Algorand approachable to the largest group of developers in the world.”

Bruns recalls demonstrating AlgoKit at recent hackathons, where developers unfamiliar with Algorand were able to spin up working prototypes within hours.

“People would come up to me afterward saying, ‘Wow, I can't believe it was so easy,'” he said. “That's not just a marketing line; it's genuine feedback.”

He credits this ease to Algorand's developer-first tools and precise documentation. “AlgoKit lets you spin up your own local Algorand blockchain on your laptop,” he explained. “You can deploy contracts, test them, and iterate quickly; it shortens the entire development loop.”

In a world where most blockchains still require navigating through unfamiliar languages like Solidity, Algorand's focus on Python and TypeScript gives it a mainstream edge.

“It's an easy on-ramp for anyone who's already a software developer,” said Bruns. “You don't have to be a crypto native to build on Algorand.”

One of the examples Bruns highlighted was HesabPay, a payments project operating in Afghanistan. The app utilizes Algorand's blockchain to facilitate mobile transactions for individuals who lack access to traditional banking systems.

“With just a smartphone and a QR code, users can buy what they need in local markets,” he said. “It's a simple, elegant solution that removes barriers for those excluded from traditional finance.”

Beyond frontier economies, Algorand is investing in nurturing new startups globally. The Foundation's Ecosystem Success Team runs an ongoing Startup Challenge, helping early-stage projects refine their ideas, build community, and pitch to investors.

“It's like an accelerator,” Bruns said. “At the end, they get to present their projects in a kind of ‘battle of the startups,' and some of them really do take off.”

As the blockchain world buzzes with terms like interoperability, zero-knowledge proofs, and real-world asset tokenization, Algorand isn't standing still.

“Real-world assets like gold being tokenized by Meld and real estate by Lofty are already being built on Algorand,” said Bruns. “That's not theoretical; it's live.”

He's particularly excited about a new toolkit called AlgoPlonk, which simplifies the creation of zero-knowledge circuits and their integration into smart contracts.

“It's still early, but the potential for privacy-preserving transactions is huge,” he said. “I'm building prototypes myself and hope to teach others how to do it.”

For Bruns, Algorand's Pure proof-of-stake consensus model remains its strongest technical asset. Developed by cryptographer Silvio Micali, it enables three-second block times, 10,000 transactions per second, and zero downtime since its inception, a trifecta few blockchains can claim.

“We balance scalability, decentralization, and security,” Bruns noted. “That was once called the blockchain trilemma; Algorand actually solves it.”

When asked how Algorand compares with established giants like Ethereum or Solana, Bruns pointed to developer accessibility.

“TypeScript was a huge factor for me,” he admitted. “If you're a web developer, you can bring your existing skills straight into blockchain. You don't need to learn an entirely new language or architecture.”

That accessibility, he believes, will drive the next wave of adoption. “There are so many developers who don't realize they already have the skills to build decentralized applications,” he said.

“They just need a reason and a platform that doesn't make it painful.”

When the conversation turned philosophical, Bruns reflected on what he hopes to see change in the developer culture itself. “I'd love to see more risk-taking,” he said.

“There are so many developers who have great ideas but hold back because they think blockchain is too hard or too speculative.”

At traditional software events, Bruns often meets programmers who are curious but hesitant about crypto. “They ask me, ‘What can I actually build with blockchain?'” he recalled. “And I tell them, start with the problems you see in the world. Whether it's data transparency, digital identity, or supply-chain trust, blockchain can enhance it.”

He paused before adding with conviction, “We're just scratching the surface. The real innovation will come when people start applying blockchain's core values, decentralization, transparency, verifiable data, to everyday problems. That's where Algorand wants to be.”

Bruns' message to developers is clear: don't wait. With approachable tools, a thriving global community, and a protocol built for speed and reliability, Algorand aims to lower the barrier between great ideas and working blockchain applications.

“Even if your first project doesn't change the world,” he said with a smile, “you'll learn something that leads to the next thing, and that's how innovation happens.”","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Core Scientific, Bitdeer Technologies Group, Globant, Digi Power X,  and Figure Technology Solutions are the five Blockchain stocks to watch today, according to MarketBeat's stock screener tool. ""Blockchain stocks"" are publicly traded companies whose business models depend on or are closely tied to blockchain technology — for example, blockchain platform developers, crypto exchanges, miners, infrastructure providers, or firms that integrate distributed ledger solutions. For stock market investors, these stocks offer a way to gain equity exposure to the potential growth of blockchain (and sometimes crypto) while carrying risks from technology execution, regulatory changes, and crypto-market volatility; the label is also often applied loosely to firms that merely invest in or experiment with blockchain. These companies had the highest dollar trading volume of any Blockchain stocks within the last several days.

Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain MegaETH unveiled token allocations to its initial coin offering (ICO) participants today, and while most investors expected small allocations, some feel slighted.

MegaETH concluded its initial coin offering (ICO) on Oct. 30, with nearly $1.4 billion in commitments competing for a slice of the $50 million MEGA allocation, resulting in a 28x oversubscription. Allocations were distributed based on a mix of criteria, including social and onchain scores, as explained in an article by MegaETH contributor and chief security officer Namik Muduroglu.

Considering the large number of participants, MegaETH whittled ICO contributors down to two categories: community and public. Those who are considered part of the community, as well as MegaETH builders, received preferential distributions due to their perceived long-term alignment. However, the exact criteria for this community allocation remain unclear, and some users who minted multiple Fluffle NFTs and/or contributed to the MegaETH Echo round were not included.

“It is not perfect. We definitely missed people, and for that I am genuinely sorry,” said Muduroglu.

The team also clarified that some in the community category received minimum allocations, while some members of the public received larger distributions, but the methodology enabled the team to maintain control over the average allocation per wallet.

As a result, community members were prioritized over the public, and those who chose to lock their tokens for a year were also prioritized over unlocked bidders, giving them an average allocation of $75,000.

Crypto content creator TylerD called the ICO process “misleading” on X today as he said, “I like MegaETH. I do not like this public ICO allocation methodology, and don't understand why it's being praised.”

“[A] wallet with onchain history, fluffle and early megaeth testnet activity with max bid (unlocked) got min allo. If that wallet gets the same as a fresh wallet, then just give everyone who unlocks the min bid and say you have to lock to get more,” Tyler added.

Upon the conclusion of the sale, MegaETH contributor Bread reminded users who got minimum allocations that it's not over yet.

“We're still nuking sybils who got through. People will cancel their bid. That $MEGA will go to the remainder of the pool, so people who belonged and showed conviction can get more,” he posted.

The cosmological constant, which describes how our universe expands, may not be constant after all.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists have recently used an updated understanding of the math of our universe to theorize that the universe will end in a crunch rather than entropy into oblivion. The field of cosmology may be very vocabulary-dense, but the bottom line is that one of our key numbers—the cosmological constant—may have switched teams from positive to negative. (If you switched from gaining one pound a week to losing one pound a week, you, too, might end in a “Big Crunch.”) And using this math, a team of researchers has estimated that our universe has a lifespan of about 33 billion years. That means we have about 19 billion to go before we become crispity crunchity.

Cosmology is, in broad terms, the study of our universe—how it began, how it exists now, and how it will eventually end. Those who publish research on cosmology must work in a different way than many other sciences, because key moments like the Big Bang and an eventual Big Crunch are almost completely outside current human understanding. We can wind time backward by studying stars, black holes, exotic structures, and even the shadows we believe may lead to dark matter or dark energy. But we're missing huge connecting pieces, like how a tiny amount of matter can explode into a universe.

The cosmological constant is one effort to help answer these huge existential questions. We know that much of the mass and energy in our universe is invisible, or “dark,”  but we don't know the nature of this missing stuff, nor the source of it (though physics indicates that we're likely swimming amid dark matter at all times). Dark energy, including the cosmological constant, is suggested as a way to balance our observation of how the universe is expanding. The gravity we know is everywhere around us would actually shrink our universe, so if we're expanding all the time (as we are), that means something is repelling the universe's parts from each other.

To cosmologists, this meant a positive constant. The universe was “gaining weight,” so to speak, so it would continue to expand at a faster and faster rate because the “weight” grew at a constant rate. But this changed after recent results from both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) earlier this year. Scientists studied the data and found that the cosmological constant may not be constant at all, but rather changing over time and indicating that its influence may be weakening. That would change the most widely believed equation about the beginning of our universe. (Imagine if your math homework changed from “Solve x + 5 = 8” to “Solve x + y = 8”—that's a whole different skillset!)

Cosmology has been rippling from these DES and DESI revelations for months now, leading to research like this new paper—written by scientists based in the U.S., China, and Spain—which appears now in the peer reviewed journal Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics. These scientists have built a new, adjusted model for the expected lifespan of the universe by taking a possible negative cosmological constant into account. If the universe will stop expanding at some point and begin to contract, that's a huge change from the understanding we had of the state of things at this same time a few years ago.

Their conclusions bring with them some newly opened doors. “It is crucial that the DES/DESI observation is confirmed and the aDE model is rigorously tested,” the researchers explain, as science is built on repeated and replicable data that helps researchers refine their conclusions and test new hypotheses. The team also curbs an anticipated question about a so-called Big Bounce, which is a theory in which the universe “crunches” and then re-expands in a predictable cycle:

“Although very unlikely, one cannot rule out that, in the presence of quantum effects, there is a way for the universe to transition to the next cycle. However, this reincarnation will lead to a very different universe from our present one, not to a cyclic universe.”

So, for those hoping to leave a letter for the new universe 18.9 billion years from now, the next paradigm may not have humans, paper, or even stars. Plan accordingly!

For many years, scientists have believed that dark matter and dark energy make up most of the cosmos. But new research challenges that view, suggesting these mysterious components might not exist at all. Instead, the effects we attribute to them could arise naturally if the fundamental forces of the universe slowly weaken as it grows older.

The study, led by Rajendra Gupta, an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Ottawa, proposes that gradual changes in the strength of nature's forces (such as gravity) over time and space could explain several puzzling cosmic behaviors. These include how galaxies rotate, evolve, and cluster, as well as how the universe expands.

Challenging Long-Held Assumptions

""The universe's forces actually get weaker on the average as it expands,"" Professor Gupta explains. ""This weakening makes it look like there's a mysterious push making the universe expand faster (which is identified as dark energy). However, at galactic and galaxy-cluster scale, the variation of these forces over their gravitationally bound space results in extra gravity (which is considered due to dark matter). But those things might just be illusions, emergent from the evolving constants defining the strength of the forces.""

He continues, ""There are two very different phenomena needed to be explained by dark matter and dark energy: The first is at cosmological scale, that is, at a scale larger than 600 million light years assuming the universe is homogeneous and the same in all directions. The second is at astrophysical scale, that is, at smaller scale the universe is very lumpy and direction dependent. In the standard model, the two scenarios require different equations to explain observations using dark matter and dark energy. Ours is the only one that explains them with the same equation, and without needing dark matter or dark energy.""

Gupta adds that the approach provides a single framework for explaining observations like galaxy rotation, clustering, and the bending of light around massive objects. ""It's all just the result of the constants of nature varying as the universe ages and becomes lumpy,"" he says.

A New Model on the Galactic Scale

In earlier work, Professor Gupta questioned the existence of dark matter on a cosmic scale. His latest research extends that idea to smaller, astrophysical scales, examining how galaxies rotate.

In this model, a parameter known as α emerges when the coupling constants -- the quantities describing the strength of fundamental forces -- are allowed to evolve. This α term acts as an additional element in gravitational equations, reproducing the same effects traditionally explained by dark matter and dark energy.

At large scales, α is treated as constant (for example, using supernova data). Locally, within galaxies, α changes depending on how ordinary matter (black holes, stars, planets, and gas) is distributed. In regions rich in matter, the effect is smaller; in sparse regions, it grows stronger. As a result, the model naturally explains why stars in a galaxy's outer regions move faster than expected without invoking unseen dark matter halos.

Rethinking the Universe's Timeline

Gupta believes this approach could help resolve longstanding astronomical puzzles. ""For years, we've struggled to explain how galaxies in the early universe formed so quickly and became so massive,"" he notes. ""With our model, you don't need to assume any exotic particles or break the rules of physics. The timeline of the universe simply stretches out, almost doubling the universe's age, and making room for everything we observe.""

By effectively lengthening the universe's developmental timeline, the model makes it easier to understand how enormous structures -- such as galaxies and black holes -- could have formed so soon after the Big Bang.

This theory could dramatically reshape our understanding of the cosmos. It even suggests that the decades-long search for dark matter particles, which has cost billions of dollars, might not be needed. Even if such exotic particles were discovered, Gupta argues, they would still only account for about six times the mass of ordinary matter.

""Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the best one. Maybe the Universe's biggest secrets are just tricks played by the evolving constants of nature,"" he concludes.

The research, titled ""Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves,"" appears in the peer-reviewed journal Galaxies.

Scientists have described a ‘superflare' from a distant black hole — the most luminous burst of light ever detected from such an object. At its peak, the blaze shone more than 10 trillion times brighter than the Sun and was probably triggered by the black hole's gravity shredding a star that was at least 30 times as massive as the Sun. The flash also seems to be the farthest ever detected at roughly 10 billion light years away from our Solar System.

At a pandemic-research conference this week, immune researcher Runhong Zhou presented results from early studies of a dual-target antibody treatment for H5N1 avian influenza in which the treatment neutralized multiple live strains of the virus. Zhou's research is among a host of antibody therapies in the works, such as those to treat HIV through antibody-driven reactivation of dormant immune cells. Antibodies could also boost the efficacy of other treatments such as vaccines, researchers say, by binding to areas of a virus that don't mutate.

From poetry and music to research proposals, some AI-generated content is indistinguishable from human work, which challenges the standard scientific definitions of creativity. No matter how impressive the models become, however, should they ever be described as truly creative? Researchers on both sides argue that the stakes are high — not just for AI's creative potential, but for our own.

Climate change is devastating the process of mining the minerals we need to fight it, write geographers Tom Savige, Mark Quigley and Tim Werner. In 2023 alone, mining operations were battered by wildfires in Canada, extreme rainfall in Australia and drought in Chile. The authors outline four key strategies to strengthen the resilience of critical-mineral supply chains.

Nature | 11 min read

The very term ‘critical minerals' is flawed because of its links to national security, argue nine mineral-security researchers. “Although minerals are at the centre of contemporary discussions on war, renewable energy and technology, they are also of immense relevance to human development, notably ending poverty in all its forms,” they write. The authors suggest a shift from national security to human security, which “gives us a different perspective, one that is universal and relevant to all people; is human-centred; needs-based; focused on accessibility, affordability and sufficiency; and promotes multilateralism and international cooperation.”

Seattle's Parse Biosciences is teed up for an acquisition by Qiagen, a Netherlands-based holding company, in a $225 million cash deal announced today. 

The transaction is expected to close in December. 

Parse was co-founded in 2018 by Alex Rosenberg, who was a University of Washington postdoctoral fellow at the time, and Charles Roco, who was a UW graduate student. The company was an early entrant in the nascent field of single-cell RNA sequencing.

Rosenberg and his colleagues discovered a new way to profile RNAs while working in the lab of UW synthetic biology professor Georg Seelig. The business initially launched as Split Biosciences, later changing its name and growing to 110 employees. 

Parse raised more than $50 million from investors, including a $41.5 million Series B round announced in 2022.

Parse launched its first products in 2021 and currently serves 3,000 customers in more than 40 countries. The company is expected to add about $40 million in sales to Qiagen's 2026 fiscal year.

There's a vast range of research questions that RNA profiling can help answer. Understanding which RNAs are present in a cell gives scientists a read-out of active genes. That helps distinguish different cell types, for instance in a blood sample or a petri dish of stem cells turning into heart cells. 

Qiagen has developed technologies to isolate and analyze DNA, RNA and proteins from sources including blood, tissue and other materials. The company has about 5,700 employees in 35 locations. It serves 500,000 customers globally.

The acquisition is subject to clearance under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other conditions.

Microsoft has formed a new Superintelligence team within its AI division, aiming to develop what it calls “humanist superintelligence” — advanced AI that remains under human control.

The team, announced Thursday morning in a post by Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, reflects the company's ambitions to shape the next era of artificial intelligence while addressing concerns about safety and control in the development of advanced AI systems.

“We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable,” Suleyman wrote. “We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.”

The approach contrasts with the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the goal of creating AI systems that can match or surpass human capabilities across virtually any task — which is core to the mission of Microsoft's longtime partner, OpenAI, and its CEO Sam Altman.

In his message, Suleyman cited early directions in areas such as healthcare, where Microsoft researchers are developing expert-level diagnostic models, and clean energy, where AI could accelerate breakthroughs in materials, batteries, and fusion research. 

The goal, he wrote, is to advance technology “within limits” — keeping humanity in control while harnessing AI's potential to improve lives on a global scale

Suleyman will lead the new MAI Superintelligence Team, joined by Microsoft AI Chief Scientist Karén Simonyan and other core Microsoft AI leaders and researchers. Key leaders who've been involved in Microsoft's model development work are also expected to be part of the effort.

The company hasn't disclosed how large the group is expected to become.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

A third solution is to pipe it across timezones using HVDC and accept some level of efficiency loss and some geopolitical risks.A fourth solution is to mix lots of wind, which performs better in winter and cancels out the lower insolation.Realistically it's going to be all of the above, with the balance determined by local factors.

Local power costs are over 30 cents per KWh, so that could be pretty competitive.The problem is that, no profit based organization will ever build ""surplus"" solar to enable that kind of thing. If we want surplus power, if we want a strong grid, if we want cheap power, if we want to enable the ability to quite literally waste solar power on inefficient processes (including things like industrial processes that produce less CO2 or generating hydrogen or methane as long term energy storage), we have to get the government to make it happenBut, uh, we hired people who would rather spend $170 billion on harassing random cities and brown people so..... Everyone get ready to pay absurd rates for electricity to support outdated businesses that have been directing American energy policy since Reagan, including paying about 60k coal miners in west virginia for a resource that is economically inferior to other fossil fuels but because they voted for a democrat once they now get a stranglehold on the US economy.

The argument always seemed disingenuous. For sure, China produces a lot of pollution as they are modernizing, but they are also investing a lot in the direction of sustainability. If we take the balance of (pollution produced - pollution prevented) for the two countries, the day will come, if it isn't now, that the US is on the losing side of that comparison, and I wonder what the new argument will be for the US not doing more.

China's numbers did rise quickly on that measure and is above the EU now I think but still way below the US.And if you don't like per capita, then China with 4x as many people is still behind the US when you compare cumulative CO2.

The Chinese leadership understands several things very clearly:- The country has experienced multiple catastrophic natural disasters in the past.-  Such disasters often lead to regime change (losing the mandate of heaven via natural disasters leading to social unrest)- The leadership is comprised of smart people (and a lot of engineers) and they don't play dumb political games like denying the reality of climate change.- Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment.

But none of that matters, China would pursue massive solar power infrastructure regardless, because they want energy independence. Stupid amounts of solar power means they will no longer be importing lots of oil and fuel, and that means they would be less vulnerable to the US blockading them in some sort of conflict, which is one of their primary geopolitical concerns.They would do this even if solar power was dramatically less effective or was significantly more expensive, because solar power is the first kind of power generation that it is economical to way overbuild, and have serious redundancy and surplus and excess, because there's no consumables that scale your running costs like if you tried to build massive amounts of coal power plants.China would like to have that kind of scale for power because they can use it to subsidize things like datacenters running less efficient Chinese made computer components. The fact that power doesn't have to run a profit in China helps this.The US should be taking fucking notes, about how nationalized infrastructure can be a force multiplier economically, and how infrastructure that doesn't have to be profitable can be even more powerful.Slaving ourselves to the enrichment of well connected capital owners is harming our country, and preventing a literal energy revolution. We have the option to, for the first time in human history, actually have energy resources that are too cheap to meter.

So many people did so that at one point last year the government said, ""So many people are exporting it now, and the surplus is so great on the network we may have to charge you for exporting it"". Wholesale power prices become negative during peak solar times - but retail companies will still charge you for using it!.Obviously, that didn't go down too well and this is the response - free electricity during peak solar hours.That said, my understanding is that free electricity is only for people who are on the ""default offer"" from the electricity companies - that is effectively the highest tier of pricing. Most people are not on the default offer.

Somebody has to go and turn it off, and having this person available overwhelms all of your operational costs.Or alternatively, you need the infrastructure to do it automatically, what is currently expensive.

Even if you pay to have the charger installed it will pay back quickly.It's not going to happen overnight, but with literally free electricity things will change quickly, and even huge parking structures or lots will have a stack of chargers that are free or very close to it.

Which utility and plan is this? I'm not aware of any California residential rate plans that charge you for putting power back on the grid, much less $100/month.That said, wholesale electricity rates are set by high frequency supply/demand markets.Recent residential net metering rates are  closely aligned with wholesale supply/demand based rates, so most utilities will compensate your brother in law  near $0 when you are pushing power to the grid when wholesale rates are <= $0, because there are not enough buyers of the power he is generating.He is using the grid as a battery, which comes at a cost.This is of course changing as more grid connected storage comes online and creates demand for off peak electricity.  In that case, you actually get paid for selling power back to the grid during high grid stress periods.  I get paid a few hundred dollars a year in CA for doing that with my measly home backup battery.

Oh yeah, yes, after paying all the money to get the electrical hookup he doesn't want or need - yeah, he's gonna be on the hook for around $100/month.

The ambient vibe of our time, and here on HN, is often really pessimistic. I don't believe such pessimism is realistic. Commercial grade fusion power will come, and we should push very hard to make it happen. It will change the equations at the core of the economy and open up whole new paths for technology -- far beyond the pure digital.

Why focusing on the energy system and large companies is more important than policing individual behavior.

Picture it: I'm minding my business at a party, parked by the snack table (of course). A friend of a friend wanders up, and we strike up a conversation. It quickly turns to work, and upon learning that I'm a climate technology reporter, my new acquaintance says something like: “Should I be using AI? I've heard it's awful for the environment.” 

This actually happens pretty often now. Generally, I tell people not to worry—let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want. 

That response might surprise some people, but I promise I'm not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. Data centers could consume up to 945 terawatt-hours annually by 2030. (That's roughly as much as Japan.) 

But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals, partly because AI concerns remind me so much of another question: “What should I do to reduce my carbon footprint?” 

That one gets under my skin because of the context: BP helped popularize the concept of a carbon footprint in a marketing campaign in the early 2000s. That framing effectively shifts the burden of worrying about the environment from fossil-fuel companies to individuals. 

The reality is, no one person can address climate change alone: Our entire society is built around burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need political action and public support for researching and scaling up climate technology. We need companies to innovate and take decisive action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Focusing too much on individuals is a distraction from the real solutions on the table. 

I see something similar today with AI. People are asking climate reporters at barbecues whether they should feel guilty about using chatbots too frequently when we need to focus on the bigger picture. 

Big tech companies are playing into this narrative by providing energy-use estimates for their products at the user level. A couple of recent reports put the electricity used to query a chatbot at about 0.3 watt-hours, the same as powering a microwave for about a second. That's so small as to be virtually insignificant.

But stopping with the energy use of a single query obscures the full truth, which is that this industry is growing quickly, building energy-hungry infrastructure at a nearly incomprehensible scale to satisfy the AI appetites of society as a whole. Meta is currently building a data center in Louisiana with five gigawatts of computational power—about the same demand as the entire state of Maine at the summer peak.  (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.)

Increasingly, there's no getting away from AI, and it's not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Your email provider's suggested replies? Probably AI. Same for chatting with customer service while you're shopping online. 

Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices. 

Massive tech companies using AI in their products should be disclosing their total energy and water use and going into detail about how they complete their calculations. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that's changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Lawmakers should be mandating these disclosures, and we should be asking for them, too. 

That's not to say there's absolutely no individual action that you can take. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact. 

Ultimately, as long as you aren't relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn't be too worried about your individual AI footprint. But we should all be keeping our eye on what this industry will mean for our grid, our society, and our planet.

They say all roads lead to Rome—but exactly how many Roman roads were there? According to new research, potentially over 68,000 miles (over 110,000 kilometers) more than previously known.

Meet Itiner-e, a new high-resolution digital dataset and map of the Roman Empire's roads around 150 CE. A team of researchers used archaeological and historical records, topographic maps, and satellite imagery to create the behemoth, which charts 185,896 miles (299,171 km) of roads across almost 1,544,409 square miles (4,000,000 square km).

“The Roman Empire's road system was critical for structuring the movement of people, goods and ideas, and sustaining imperial control. Yet, it remains incompletely mapped and poorly integrated across sources despite centuries of research,” the researchers wrote in a study published today in the journal Nature. They describe Itiner-e as “the most detailed and comprehensive open digital dataset of roads in the entire Roman Empire.”

When the Roman Empire peaked in the second century CE, it encompassed more than 55 million people from modern-day Britain to Egypt and Syria. The new map reveals 68,734 miles (110,616 km) more of roads than previous estimates. According to the researchers, the increase comes from a higher coverage of roads in the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and North Africa, as well as the modification of previously proposed roads around the actual landscape, such as winding mountain roads rather than unrealistic straight shots.

“This resource is transformative for understanding how mobility shaped connectivity, administration, and even disease transmission in the ancient world, and for studies of the millennia-long development of terrestrial mobility in the region,” the researchers said.

In total, Itiner-e consists of 14,769 road sections, with 34.6% categorized as main roads and 65.4% categorized as secondary roads. Notably, only 2.7% of the roads' precise locations are certain. 89.8% are known with less precision, and 7.4% are theorized.

“This shows a discrepancy between our knowledge of the existence and location of Roman roads: we know all of the included roads were used at some point during the Roman period, but their precise locations are not certain,” the team explained. They also noted that Itiner-e does not represent how the road system developed over time.

At its most basic level, Itiner-e provides an impressive new visual of the ancient Roman territories that helps you appreciate how well-connected the empire was. If you compare it to a modern map, you might even find some nerdy easter eggs—like the fact that the road that connects modern-day Bologna, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, and Milan is the same as the one that connected ancient Bononia, Mutina, Parma, Placentia, and Mediolanum in 150 CE.

Self-reported nonceliac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS) affects about 1 in 10 people worldwide, and the first comprehensive global study on its prevalence and clinical characteristics has found a strong association with female sex, psychological distress, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

NCGWS may warrant classification within disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), wrote authors, led by Mohamed G. Shiha, MBBCh, with the School of Medicine and Population Health at the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England. Findings of the systematic review and meta-analysis were published in Gut.

“Recognizing NCGWS within the DGBI framework and the development of symptom-based diagnostic criteria are needed to guide a more tailored management approach focusing on individual symptom patterns and dietary triggers beyond gluten and to reduce unnecessary dietary restriction in this common condition,” the authors wrote.

The analysis included 25 studies comprising 49,476 participants from 16 countries. The researchers found that women were more than twice as likely as men to report NCGWS (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; P < .001).

Other findings associated with those reporting NCGWS include:

Prevalence of NCGWS varied widely geographically and ranged from 0.7% in Chile to 35.8% in Saudi Arabia.

Shiha's team writes that future research should center on identifying clinical NCGWS phenotypes, explore the role of the gut-brain axis and psychological comorbidities, and evaluate multidisciplinary interventions beyond the gluten-free diet. They note that many people with self-reported NCGWS continue to experience gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms despite long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet.

It's important to remember that there are no biomarkers or specific tests for NCGWS, Christopher Cao, MD, told Medscape Medical News. Cao is a gastroenterologist and director of the Celiac Disease Program at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Based on studies seen in the past and anecdotal experiences at Mount Sinai, “it seems to be more than just a gluten-mediated process,” Cao said. “It seems it may be related to consumption of nonfermentable carbohydrates, or perhaps it could fall into the realm of disordered gut-brain interaction.”

When celiac has been ruled out and patients are classified as NCGWS, patients may stay on a gluten-free diet, as seen in this study, he said. “But a gluten-free diet is not necessarily healthy for people who don't have celiac [disease] because it has a lot of nutritional deficiencies,” Cao said. “There's a lot of psychosocial burden. And it's more expensive.”

The findings have implications beyond gastroenterology, he said. “I do think our primary care providers are the first to screen for a lot of these symptoms. An important message for everyone is that patients on a gluten-free diet may not have celiac disease and may not benefit from a gluten-free diet.”

A UK survey has shown a more-than twofold increase in the prevalence of self-reported NCGWS over a 3-year period, while celiac disease prevalence was stable. “Therefore, the public perception of gluten may be driving the marked rise in the number of individuals who believe they are “gluten sensitive,” the authors wrote.

This study can't answer many questions about NCGWS, Cao said. “It's still not a well-defined diagnosis. We don't have pathophysiology for what is going on. We don't know if gluten is playing a role at all. Certainly, there needs to be a lot more data.”

Shiha and Cao reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Some might think that residency just ends and your medical training is finally done. That is not the case. Many residents go on to do a fellowship.

What is that? This varies. It could be from 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, or even more, based on which fellowship you choose. Basically, it's additional training that you do after your first residency. 

Then, you are going to apply for a cardiac fellowship, for example, and that could be anywhere from 2 to 3 or 4 years long. This is additional training to be more specialized. The more specialized you are in each field, the more years of fellowship it will probably take.

Among patients with new-onset urticaria, 75% recovered within a week, whereas 17% progressed to chronic urticaria, and higher age at onset, elevated BMI, and early prednisolone use were associated with the development of chronic urticaria.

“This large primary care-based study provides valuable insights into the course of urticaria in an unselected population, demonstrating that most patients recover quickly within 1 week, while a notable 17% develop chronic urticaria,” the authors wrote. “In patients with symptoms persisting beyond 1 week and presenting with the found early determinants of CU [chronic urticaria], a more proactive approach may be considered, as well as timely treatment escalation, referral, and expectation management,” they added.

Reineke Soegiharto, with Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on October 30, 2025, in Clinical & Experimental Allergy. 

This study was limited by its reliance solely on general practitioner consultation data (excluding self-managed cases), the absence of diagnostic codes to distinguish acute from chronic urticaria, and the inability of the International Classification of Primary Care to differentiate spontaneous from inducible urticaria.

Several authors reported receiving institutional sponsorship for research or consultancy, research funding, speaker fees, and reimbursement for attending or chairing a symposium from or serving as members advisory boards for various pharmaceutical companies.

Cesar Hernandez reports on the chances that Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi make the U.S. men's national team. (0:52)

United States men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino on Thursday named his 25-player roster for upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

While it features the return of Borussia Mönchengladbach teammates Giovanni Reyna and Joe Scally, as well as PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi, there are also notable absences, including Juventus' Weston McKennie, AC Milan's Christian Pulisic, Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Marseille's Tim Weah.

The U.S. will face Paraguay in Chester, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 15, and will then take on Uruguay in Tampa three days later.

""As we continue to develop our squad and build on the culture we have created, this is another great opportunity for the players selected for this roster to prove they deserve to be on the final list for the World Cup,"" Pochettino said.

""It's important that they come into this camp prepared to show their qualities on the field and their commitment to being a good teammate. We will keep working on the competitive details in training and have the opportunity to challenge ourselves against two high-quality opponents from South America.""

Pulisic, Richards and Weah have been nursing injuries, with the former sustaining a hamstring injury during the last international window. Weah suffered a thigh injury on Oct. 25, while Richards has been nursing a calf issue.

The reason for McKennie's absence is unknown at the moment, and while he went the distance in Juve's draw against Sporting CP in the UEFA Champions League, he is also trying to impress a new manager in Luciano Spalletti, who was hired last week.

The injury list, which also includes Fulham's Antonee Robinson and Club América's Alejandro Zendejas makes for yet another window where Pochettino will have a roster that is significantly less than full strength.

Reyna and Scally return for the first since both players took part in the 2025 Concacaf Nations League finals back in March. Reyna has also switched clubs in that time, moving to Gladbach from Borussia Dortmund. Both players featured in last week's 4-0 victory over St. Pauli, which was Gladbach's first of the season. The absences of McKennie, Pulisic, Weah and Zendejas could potentially clear the way for Reyna to get considerable playing time.

Pepi returns to the USMNT for the first time since November of 2024, and carries with him considerable momentum, having scored a stoppage time equalizer in PSV's 1-1 draw against Olympiacos in the UCL.

He'll contend with Monaco's Folarin Balogun -- who also scored in the Champions League this week -- as well as Coventry City's Haji Wright for playing time.

The aforementioned November 2024 window was also the last time that Celtic defender Auston Trusty was in the USMNT fold having benefited from injuries to club teammate Cameron Carter-Vickers, as well as the Vancouver Whitecaps' Tristan Blackmon.

Players begin reporting to camp in Philadelphia on Nov. 9.

United States men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino explained what he meant when he recently discussed that he is ""missing"" the Premier League.

Pochettino spent the bulk of his managerial career in the Premier League before being named the USMNT's head coach in September 2024. He specifically made a name for himself with Tottenham, where he spent five years between 2014 and 2019, leading the club to a Champions League final appearance.

""The Premier League is the best league in the world,"" Pochettino told the BBC. ""Of course I am missing it. I am so happy in America, but also thinking one day to come back to the Premier League. It's the most competitive league.""

Pochettino was asked about those comments while speaking with reporters on Thursday following the release of the Americans' 25-player roster for two upcoming 2026 World Cup tune-up matches against Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa. 

""For me, the Premier League is the best league in the world,"" Pochettino repeated. ""I was involved for 12 years in different clubs like Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea. And it's normal to miss the good times when you spent very good times in someplace. 

""Maybe if you ask me in five years, or maybe I extend the contract [with U.S. Soccer] for another four years in the USA, and then after seven years or six years I move [to another job] and they ask me, ‘Oh, how do you feel about when you were manager of the national team of USA?' [I'd say], ‘Yeah, I miss it because I spent a very good time here.' And when you spend good time [somewhere] you miss that good time.""

Pochettino lamented that one of the challenging parts about being an international boss vs. a club coach is the lack of contact with players. His Tottenham team was very close, and he's still getting used to the fact that with the USMNT, the intensity is inherently different because he is not with the players' day in and day out.

""We are going to be spending 10 days in Philadelphia and Tampa and then until March, you cannot be together,"" Pochettino added. ""Yes, you can have contact by phone, [text] message or go visit, but it's never the same as when you are working [every day] and that's what you miss the most. 

""In the way that we work and the way we like to work, how we build our relationship with the player, it is really important to have contact every day. But at the same time, we are learning to build and develop our relationships in a different way. It's never the ideal world, but we will try to evolve as a coaching staff and think of a different strategy to provide the player the possibility to be present even if [there is] distance, and they're in a different environment.""

The highlight of Enzo Maresca's first season in charge of Chelsea was winning the Club World Cup, making it the second trophy of the campaign for the Blues.

After expected triumph in the Conference League, Maresca led the Blues to glory in the United States with arguably their best performance of the season in the final.

Despite facing Champions League holders PSG, Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro inspired Chelsea to a 3-0 victory in the final game of the extended season.

Maresca's gain in the 2024/25 season was Mauricio Pochettino's loss after the Argentine had failed to deliver a trophy or Champions League qualification.

Despite not being present to see some of his foundations turn into glory, there are no sour grapes from the former Blues boss, who remains adamant Chelsea very much earned their win in the final.

He said: “Chelsea was a fair winner, that is your question? Yes, yes. I think they were better than Paris Saint-Germain in that game. That showed that in a short period of tournament, how important it is to arrive in a good form.

“And I think Chelsea was a fair winner.”

It remains to be seen if Chelsea's victory in the first edition of the new format of the Club World Cup will see them automatically qualify for the 2029 version.

With Chelsea players earning £350,000 for winning the competition, they will be hoping they have the opportunity to defend their crown in four years' time.

It was reported that Chelsea hadn't given their players suitable time off following the Club World Cup, due to how soon after the new Premier League season got underway.

With the limited time off, the Blues were always going to be prone to injury issues, and have been severely impacted in the new campaign.

Levi Colwill suffered an ACL injury on the first day of pre-season, and issues to Liam Delap, Cole Palmer and Romeo Lavia have continued to plague them for prolonged periods in the new season.

Victory at the Club World Cup was clearly a high point for the Blues, however the ramifications it has had on their new season are clear to see.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has fired back at Cristiano Ronaldo and urged the club to look to the future, rather than focus on the mistakes made under his regime and those made by previous managers. The United manager has also highlighted the key problem ""he cannot allow"" to continue holding his team back this season. 

In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo criticised Man Utd's continued struggles, stating the club ""don't have a structure"" and are ""not on a good path"". He expressed sadness over the team's decline, despite still loving the club. Ronaldo claimed that Amorim could not perform ""miracles"" with the current set-up and that some players don't have the right mentality for a club of United's stature. The comments came nearly three years after his explosive 2022 interview with Morgan, which led to his departure.  

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said: ""You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have (done) so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary (Neville), Roy Keane, (David) Beckham, they became big players but they had youth. So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the future, present/future, because the potential of the club, it's amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century. 

He added: He's (Amorim) doing his best. What are you going to do? Miracles? Miracles is impossible. We say in Portugal, 'miracles is only in Fatima', and he's not going to do miracles."" 

The Miracle of Fatima occurred in Portugal in 1917,  where observers claimed to have seen the sun dance, spin, and appear to fall towards the earth. 

Amorim said: ""Of course, he knows and he (Ronaldo) has a huge impact in everything he says. What we need to focus on is the future. We know that we as a club made a lot of mistakes in the past and we are trying to change that. Let's not focus on what happened, let's focus on what we are doing now and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things and want the players to behave. We are doing that and we are improving, so let's continue and forget the past.""

Amorim added: ""I think you can attack really well. Sometimes when you defend better, you attack better. I think it's not that, it's the way we defend the box, but the last game we struggled inside the box because we allowed the crosses into the box without any pressure.

""These small details that you watched during the last game, we have worked on that. In our last game, they had 17 shots and we cannot allow that. It's something we need to change. We can attack the same way, score even more goals, but we need to defend better.""

United face Tottenham this weekend, the first time the two teams have met since the Europa League final in May, which the Reds lost 1-0. Spurs have an excellent away record, but have been woeful at home and Amorim believes his side have improved since losing the final in Bilbao. 

Amorim said: ""The characteristics of the players, we have different characteristics in our team, but we also have a lot of players who played last year. We are a better team, we play better and we understand the game better. We are more confident. At this moment, we play with a different confidence. We manage better the moments of the game, but if you remember that game, they had that shot on the goal and won the game. I expect a different game. We can play better, but also have a little bit of luck to win the game.""

He added: ""I think we are more confident. We believe more that we can win any game and we prove already that we can win any game. The last game was tough on us because in some moments we weren't the team we were supposed to be in every minute. And compare that against Brighton, it was a different thing.”","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi has hinted that he will form part of Argentina's squad at the 2026 World Cup, with the all-time great expecting that event to be “extraordinary”. Questions have been asked of whether Messi, who will turn 39 next summer, will grace another international tournament. He is, however, excited about what the United States, Canada and Mexico have to offer.

Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi helped his country to global glory at Qatar 2022. He completed his medal collection there, with the most prestigious of trophies being hoisted aloft in the Middle East.

Ever since that triumph, speculation has raged regarding how much longer the South American GOAT will make himself available to Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni. Messi has reached 195 international caps, scoring 114 goals along the way.

He is considered to have taken in a final competitive outing on home soil, but is expected to remain in contention for selection through to next summer. That will allow him to lead the Albisceleste into a World Cup title defence as captain of his nation.

Messi has been playing cards close to his chest when it comes to potential involvement at that tournament, but he has now spoken of his excitement at seeing the World Cup head to America - where he is currently plying his club trade for MLS side Inter Miami.

Speaking at the American Business Forum in Florida, Messi said: “I have very high expectations that the World Cup is going to be something extraordinary. There are going to be some great matches. Teams from all over the world are coming, and some of them are very big.”

Having previously suggested that he would not make another appearance at FIFA's flagship event, Messi said after bidding an emotional farewell to Argentina supporters during a qualification clash with Venezuela in September: “I said it at the time. I don't think I'll play in another World Cup. Due to my age, it's logical that I won't make it, but we're there and I'm excited. I'm taking it day by day, feeling the sensations. And what's clear is that today was the last game here.”

Messi has been urged to take in a last dance with eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo at the 2026 finals, with both men entering the latter stages of their record-shattering careers. Cope journalist Tomas Guasch has said: “We were all very calm until Leo Messi appeared, questioning his presence at next year's World Cup. He says it's normal for him not to be there. But if that World Cup had any appeal, it was the final dance between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, in what would be one of the most tremendous and grandiose epics in the history of football and world sport. But Leo casts doubt on that.

“I hope he plays in the World Cup even if he's embalmed. Because there are 48 teams playing, hundreds of players, and only Messi is missing? I think it would be a joke for football, and someone should intervene. You can't leave us alone.”

While international retirement appears to be imminent, Messi has extended his contract at Inter Miami through 2028. He is looking forward to helping the Herons move into a new stadium next year, with Sir David Beckham and Co drawing up ambitious plans for the future.

Messi said of penning a new deal: “The fact of renewing goes hand in hand with how well we are doing, how well the family is doing and being able to continue helping in the growth of the club.”

Messi and his wife Antonela have felt settled in South Florida since moving to the United States in 2023. Inter Miami have savoured Leagues Cup and Supporters' Shield triumphs since then, with a crucial playoff decider with Nashville set to be taken in on Saturday as the Herons look to chase down ultimate MLS Cup glory in 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Cameron Norrie overcame a stern test from home hope Kyrian Jacquet at the Moselle Open on Thursday. A finalist last year in Metz, Norrie rallied past the lucky loser 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-4 to reach his second semi-final of the season.

The only seed remaining at the ATP 250, Norrie won the final 11 points of the two-hour, 25-minute match to advance. 

“He surprised me a lot,” Norrie said of Jacquet, the third Frenchman whom the lefty has beaten this week. “He was mixing it up really well. A lot of slicing, then really aggressive at moments. His serve is really, really good.

""The French have so many good players, so many different kinds of players. I really liked the way he competed and he could have easily won the match in the second set as well, but I managed to stay tough.”



Jacquet crushed 48 winners, half of which came from his forehand, to Norrie's 28, but the 30-year-old Briton found his best tennis when he needed it most to earn his place in the last four. He will next meet Lorenzo Sonego after the Italian beat Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(6). Sonego has fond memories in Metz, having clinched the crown in 2022.

Norrie is aiming for his sixth tour-level title and first since 2023 in Rio de Janeiro, where he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

Novak Djokovic captured his 200th indoor win of his career on Thursday at the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Hellenic Championship, where he moved past Nuno Borges 7-6(1), 6-4 to reach the semi-finals in Athens.

The Serbian missed three break-point chances in the opening set but raised his level when it mattered, dominating the tie-break. After racing to a 6–1 lead, he energised the crowd by running courtside to high-five fans before closing out the set to take the lead.

The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings carried that momentum into the second set, delivering a composed and commanding performance to secure victory in one hour and 44 minutes in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.
""It was a very physical battle. I thought Nuno played a high level,"" Djokovic said. ""I was a bit surprised with how good he played. I think we went toe to toe, most of the match. Just a few points decided the winner tonight and he deserves a round of applause for his performance.
""I played a great tie-break in the first set. Not too many opportunities for both of us to break the serve of the other guy. That game was the only game I was able to break him.""
Djokovic is chasing his 101st tour-level title this week, having become just the third man to win 100 trophies when he triumphed in Geneva earlier this year. Jimmy Connors leads the way with 109 crowns, with Roger Federer second on 103.

Djokovic defeated Alejandro Tabilo in his opening match in Athens to score his first victory against the Chilean in his third attempt. The 38-year-old Serbian has been rock-solid through his opening two matches and is in good shape ahead of the upcoming Nitto ATP Finals, which begin on Sunday.
The record seven-time year-end champ Djokovic has been drawn in the Jimmy Connors group alongside Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz and Alex de Minaur.
For now, his focus will remain at the ATP 250 event in Athens, where he will play Marcos Giron or Yannick Hanfmann in his 199th tour-level semi-final on Friday. Djokovic is now 29-0 after winning the first set in 2025, according to ATP Infosys Stats.

After eight consecutive holds to start the match on Thursday night, Djokovic faced double break point serving at 4-all, 15-40 in the opening set—but he won four points in a row to get himself out of trouble, and after the two traded a few more holds, he rolled through the tie-break for a one-set lead.And when Djokovic wins the first set this year, he doesn't lose—after breaking for a 4-3 lead in the second set, the only break of the match for either player, he eventually closed out a straight set victory, improving to 29-0 in 2025 after winning the first set.He sealed the victory with a big forehand winner down the line, his 22nd winner of the match (to 20 unforced errors).""It was a very physical battle,"" Djokovic said.

Ferrari 'making positive progress' - Hamilton upbeat ahead of Sao Paulo GP

'We've got to be ready for any conditions' - Antonelli excited for unpredictable Sao Paulo weekend

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be deployed at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Formula 1 moves on to the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace – also known as Interlagos – for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix this weekend, with tyre supplier Pirelli confirming the compounds that will be in play.

For Round 21 on the calendar – which will also host the penultimate Sprint of the season – a combination of the C2 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft will be deployed across the three days of action, a selection one step harder than those used in 2024.

Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (marked yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (marked red), as well as access to the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required.

An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3 in Qualifying, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during the race, providing the track is dry.

“Last year, the dry weather tyres were not required for the race, but when used on Friday and Saturday morning, they showed high levels of wear, as well as graining, especially on the rear axle,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview.

“The circuit had been completed resurfaced, thus leaving a very smooth surface, less abrasive than in previous years, although still with plenty of bumps around the track.

“If conditions are similar, with the inevitable variations due to the ageing of the asphalt, the decision to bring harder compounds could thus extend the performance life of the tyres, which are already more resistant to degradation than the 2024 range. That might allow the soft to come into play, which last year was only used for Sprint Qualifying.”

Reflecting on the characteristics of the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, the preview continues: “The layout at Interlagos is interesting, with hints of an anti-clockwise oval circuit, which the drivers deal with 71 times in the race.

“It boasts 15 corners with relatively balanced lateral and longitudinal forces that do not put any undue strain on the tyres, as they are subjected to loads distributed equally between the front and rear axles.

“The combination of several straights and much twistier sections offers plenty of overtaking opportunities, although it also means there's a higher risk of Safety Cars and incidents. At this time of year, the weather and temperature can be very variable, with a risk of frequent rain and the inevitable use of wet weather tyres.

“A further peculiarity of Interlagos is the bumpy nature of the track, as a result of it being built on relatively unstable ground: just one more challenge for drivers and teams to deal with in terms of set-up and tyre management.”

Ferrari 'making positive progress' - Hamilton upbeat ahead of Sao Paulo GP

'We've got to be ready for any conditions' - Antonelli excited for unpredictable Sao Paulo weekend

Interlagos is a circuit built for drama – high elevation, fast laps, and unpredictable weather. Which drivers and teams are ready to master the mayhem and deliver big in F1 Fantasy?

Formula 1 heads to Brazil for one of the most iconic stops on the calendar – the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. The historic Interlagos circuit is known for producing unpredictable races, with sudden rain showers, late Safety Cars, and bold overtakes shaping countless moments. So, who's set to thrive in F1 Fantasy this weekend – an F1 Sprint weekend too – as we approach the pointy end of the season?

At just over 4.3 kilometres long, Interlagos (officially the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace) is compact but relentless, with elevation changes and technical corners that punish mistakes. After a run of high-powered yet contrasting tracks that has led us through Europe, Asia and North America since the summer break, Brazil demands a different balance – one that rewards driver rhythm, set-up precision, and strategy under pressure.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Don't forget, George Russell's ‘Russell's Rivals' mini-league is still open to enter. The exciting three-race league, running from the US Grand Prix through to Las Vegas, will see the winner get an exclusive pair of Russell's race-worn boots! Keep your eyes peeled for exciting mini leagues opening throughout the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more opportunities to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

Interlagos' mix of medium and high-speed corners makes it one of the most balanced tracks of the year, favouring cars with both aerodynamic efficiency and mechanical grip. Overtaking is frequent but risky, and with unpredictable weather always in play, consistency and adaptability will be key for those hoping to capitalise on any late-race chaos.

Catch up on the Mexico City highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying begins on Saturday, November 8 at 1500 local time (1800 UTC).

A dominant display across the Mexico City weekend not only notched Lando Norris his sixth victory of 2025, but also propelled him back to the top of the World Drivers' Championship standings.

The McLaren driver recorded his 13th score of 30 or more fantasy points this season – a metric he leads all drivers in.

He has also recorded six fastest laps to his name in 2025 and will be well-positioned to add to his tally in both the Sprint and Grand Prix sessions, based on the strong pace he has demonstrated in recent weeks.

Norris will continue to flex his racing muscle in Brazil, now that he has wrestled the championship lead back in his favour.

This weekend  at Interlagos sees George Russell return to the site of his maiden Formula 1 race victory in 2022.

The Briton has been a pillar of consistency in F1 Fantasy this campaign. He has registered more than 15 fantasy points in 18 of the 20 race weekends this season – better than all other drivers on the grid in this benchmark.

The Mercedes star, who recently re-signed with the team, is the only driver on the grid to score at least 19 fantasy points in all four Sprint weekends this season.

Expect another reliable performance from the five-time Grand Prix winner, who has finished every race this season.

After an unfortunate expedition into the gravel trap during the formation lap in last year's Sao Paulo Grand Prix, Lance Stroll will be looking to make amends this time around in Brazil.

Encouragingly, Stroll averages 21 fantasy points in rain-affected race weekends this season (Australia, Miami, Silverstone), with this average in these races bested only by the McLaren pair and Nico Hulkenberg.

Although perhaps a luxury transfer for teams with a higher cost cap value because of his $8.5m price tag, the Aston Martin driver has flown under the radar recently, with fantasy scores of 14 and 10 in two of his last three race weekends.

Owned by a mere 10% of players in the game, Stroll can be an attractive differential asset – and a safe pair of hands – in what could be treacherous conditions across the race weekend.

Oliver Bearman's recent purple patch has netted him three consecutive points finishes in the World Drivers' Championship, which most recently included a career-best P4 last time out in Mexico.

Between the US and Mexico City Grands Prix, the rookie driver has banked 50 fantasy points, outpaced by only Charles Leclerc (77) and Max Verstappen (74) in that time.

The Haas racer is the best value driver in F1 Fantasy this season, averaging 1.25 points per $1 million spent for Bearman. He also requires at least -20 fantasy points for a $0.6m price rise this weekend.

On a weekend where we have previously witnessed wet weather wreak havoc along the grid, Bearman – a driver that is likely protected by a low points threshold for a price rise – is ready-made for your fantasy line-up.

Gabriel Bortoleto will be motivated by a wave of local support on home soil this weekend.

The Kick Sauber racer averages 10.3 fantasy points dating back to Hungary and has proven to be a fan favourite in his short Formula 1 career, posting two Driver of the Day awards in 2025 – he could be in contention for a third in front of a home crowd.

A word of warning: Bortoleto has failed to finish the Grand Prix in all three rain-affected weekends this season (Australia, Miami and Silverstone).

Encouragingly though, the rookie driver only needs -2 fantasy points or more for a $0.6m price rise this weekend and with an additional session to score points on the cards with the Sprint, he should be in the box seat for it.

Other drivers to monitor: Max Verstappen, Esteban Ocon

After several weeks dogged by inconsistency, McLaren turned things around in Mexico City to record their first victory since the Netherlands.

The disappointment of its 45% in-game ownership over the last three weekends, enduring fantasy scores of less than 65 points, was quickly erased with an 85-point haul on the back of a Norris race win and Piastri finishing fifth.

The Woking-based outfit also lead all teams in fast pit stop points per race between Singapore and Mexico City, averaging 10 fantasy points. With the two-stop strategy typically the most common in Brazil, this offers more opportunities for McLaren to continue their pit stop point stream this weekend.

Expect McLaren to once again feature at the front, as Norris and Piastri continue to tussle for the lead in the World Drivers' Championship.

Where other teams have struggled to string together consistent fantasy performances in recent weeks, Mercedes have been remarkably reliable.

The Toto Wolff-led team has scored at least 58 fantasy points in each of the last four race weekends, including posting the fastest lap (+10 points) in the last two.

As budgets tighten and chip use increases with the upcoming Sprints, value for money assets (Mercedes are the fourth-best constructor in the game at 1.86 points per $1 million) are going to be priority targets.

For F1 Fantasy players who may be a little behind on building their team cost cap, Mercedes can be a set-and-forget premium constructor at a relatively attainable price for the remaining races on the calendar.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Aston Martin

With rain in the forecast for Sao Paolo at the time of writing, the No Negative chip becomes extremely valuable if you are yet to use it this season. This chip resets any negative scoring categories (i.e., DNFs, positions lost) incurred by drivers and teams over the weekend to zero.

Negative scores tend to be more common in race weekends affected by wet weather. With an extra session of fantasy scoring too, which increases the likelihood of driver retirements and the dreaded -20 points assigned to a DNF, the No Negative protects you from that when activated.

Autopilot also provides an insurance policy on your 2X DRS Boost driver. In the event your selected driver struggled to post a competitive score in changeable conditions, this chip automatically re-assigns the 2X points multiplier to the highest scoring driver in your team.

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the earlier sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

Ferrari 'making positive progress' - Hamilton upbeat ahead of Sao Paulo GP

'We've got to be ready for any conditions' - Antonelli excited for unpredictable Sao Paulo weekend

Ferrari currently lead Mercedes in the battle for P2 of the Teams' Championship, but Charles Leclerc is adamant that the Scuderia will ""target higher"" in 2026.

Charles Leclerc believes that taking P2 in the Teams' Championship is “not good enough” for Ferrari, though the Monegasque also acknowledged that the squad's current position still marks a “good improvement” from where they were at the beginning of the season.

The Scuderia have been locked in a close battle for the runner-up spot with Mercedes across recent races, with the Italian outfit currently holding the position by just one point. Red Bull are also catching up in fourth place, having closed to within 10 points of Ferrari.

Should Ferrari end the season in P2, it would mark the second consecutive campaign that they have finished in this place, while the squad's last Teams' Championship triumph dates back to 2008.

Asked ahead of this weekend's Sao Paulo Grand Prix if being runners-up again marks a good enough result for the team, Leclerc responded: “It's not good enough, no. I think when you drive for such a team, the only thing that is good enough is to win.

“But it's also true to say that we are against very strong competition, and also teams that have a lot of history in the sport and that are very special in their own ways. It's not easy, but I think as Ferrari, and when you work for such an incredible brand, it's not good enough and you've got to target winning.

“Having said all that, considering where we started the season and where we are now, it's a good season. It's a very good improvement throughout the season, as it's been very difficult at the beginning of the year to understand exactly what we had to tackle with this new car.

“But to now be fighting for the second in the Constructors' will be our target, and for next year we'll target higher.”

Ferrari are yet to win a Grand Prix in 2025 and, when pushed on whether he would prefer a race victory over second place in the Teams' Championship if he had to choose, Leclerc answered: “I don't know, I'll take both.

“If you win then it's obviously more likely that you get the second in the Constructors'. A very difficult question to answer. I would love to win – I think it's really important to at least be winning once in a season where everything has been so tough for everybody.

“We'd probably be happy as a team after a victory, but the second place needs to be our target and we need to target both of the two things. I won't choose between the two.”

For now Leclerc's focus is on the weekend ahead in Sao Paulo. Despite claiming back-to-back podiums across the last two rounds, the 28-year-old is not necessarily expecting the same result this time out.

“We come here neutral, just like we have approached the last few races,” Leclerc – who announced his engagement to partner Alexandra Saint Mleux in the gap between Mexico and Brazil – explained. “I think it's important for us not to get carried away by the positive results we've had in Mexico and Austin.

“We know that it was thanks to perfect execution from the Friday to the Sunday and that's extremely difficult to do, and probably even more so when conditions are so difficult to predict, like is always the case here in Brazil.

“We'll just focus on the job, just like we've done – it paid off in the last two weekends and I really hope it does this weekend, but we have no guarantee. We know that we don't have the pace of McLaren or Red Bull.

“Mercedes can be very strong in some weekends and some others less, but that doesn't depend on us. We just have to focus on what we do best, and then we'll see how it goes.”

While Leclerc is yet to score a podium at Interlagos, the eight-time race winner enjoys driving at the Brazilian track.

“I love it,” the Ferrari driver said. “Actually it's not been such a poor track for me in terms of performance – I wouldn't say the same thing I said in Budapest earlier this year [a weekend where Leclerc claimed an unexpected pole position] – but for one reason or another on the Sunday it never really went our way.

“But what happened in the past, I don't really think about it, and I'm sure if we do everything perfect we can be on podium for the first time. Seeing how crazy of a weekend it can be sometimes, even better, so we'll see.”

On the other side of the garage, Lewis Hamilton sounded a positive note ahead of the upcoming weekend in Sao Paulo.

Asked if it feels like things are clicking off the back of two good outings in Austin and Mexico – barring a time penalty in the latter – the Briton said: “Definitely.

“We've been going from strength to strength and making positive progress. I'm excited. I love being in Brazil, I feel very much at home here. I get the best welcome here, so [I'm] looking forward to the weekend.”

And in terms of whether ‘Hammer time' could return this weekend, the seven-time World Champion smiled: “I've not heard that for a while! I would like to think so – that's the goal, that's what I'm training towards.

“I'm hoping this weekend can be another step from what we've been working on in the past races.”

Bianca Censori is taking her revealing everyday outfits to new heights.

On Thursday, she returned to the airport in Melbourne, Australia, wearing an all-black outfit comprised solely of a thong bodysuit and a long-sleeve top.

Evidently, Censori put on a pair of sheer black tights, slipped into a high-waisted thong bodysuit, added some heels, grabbed her oversized Hermès Birkin and was ready to catch her flight. 

At least she packs light?

The 30-year-old has worn little more than lingerie while visiting her family over the past few days. 

On Monday morning, she arrived at the same airport in a nude-colored version of her go-to travel look, complete with a long-sleeve tee and high-waisted briefs worn over super shiny tights. She accessorized with a matching pageboy hat.

During her short visit, she was spotted shopping with her mom and sister while wearing undergarments from Marc Jacobs' fall 2025 collection, including a purple bullet bra and sheer pink body stocking as a top.

It seems to be a trend for the designer, as she also caught a flight this past summer wearing briefs and knee-high boots, and kicked off the year with a Tokyo flight in a grey thong bodysuit and heels.

While Censori often takes to Instagram or is spotted out and about with husband Kanye West in barely-there looks, the choice of wearing lingerie on a 14-hour flight, let alone any flight, is questionable.

Most travelers, celebrities included, opt for more comfortable attire, like sweatpants or leggings…

Either way, she probably had to check a bag.

North West isn't keeping up with social media trolls.

Kim Kardashian shared her 12-year-old daughter's unbothered reaction to backlash over the fake tattoos and piercings she rocked in a recent TikTok video.

The Skims co-creator revealed to her “All's Fair” co-star Niecy Nash-Betts in a Complex “GOAT Talk” video on Wednesday that the pre-teen took her phone last month as naysayers raged in the comments.

“She writes back to a comment, and she goes, ‘This is such a non-issue,'” Kardashian, 45, recalled, labeling this a “good clapback.”

The response was pegged to Kardashian in October, which the reality star mentioned in the recent sitdown.

“Online, it was like, ‘Kim defends North to the end on this look,'” she noted.

While the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum did not break down her thoughts on the daring accessories, she did give context.

“Her and her girlfriends, they love doing costumes, they love doing looks,” she explained. “It's Halloween season, so they put on fake tattoos on their face, fake piercings. They all had their colored hair. 

“They looked like an opium Powerpuff Girls,” the “Kardashians” star continued. “[That's] what they were going for.”

Kardashian did, however, defend North's controversial fashion and beauty choices during an Oct. 15 “Call Her Daddy” podcast interview.

At the time, she told listeners it's “really hard and really interesting” when North goes viral for her clothing, as she did in August over a corset and miniskirt.

“All the kids are wearing the same things,” Kardashian said. “But then my daughter tries to wear it and then I'm like, ‘OK, we're never wearing that again.' Unfortunately, we made that mistake in front of the whole world.”

She noted, “As a mom, you're kind of learning at the same time. But what I do know is my baby's such a good girl and such a sweet girl.”

Kardashian went on to ask for “a little bit of grace” since she's “doing the best she can” raising North, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 6, “by [her]self.”

The Hulu personality, notably, welcomed her little ones while married to ex-husband Kanye West.

She revealed on the podcast that the rapper, 48, hadn't called their four children “in a couple months.”

Halloween just ended, and you know what that means: Time to roll out the Christmas trailers. (Seriously, what happened to poor, neglected Thanksgiving?) At least this particular one seems pretty cute. Michael Showalter‘s Oh. What. Fun. centers on Claire Clauster (Michelle Pfeiffer), the overworked and underappreciated mother to a huge gaggle of children and in-laws that somehow seems to keep growing throughout the clip. (Her brood includes Chloë Grace Moretz, Maude Apatow, Dominic Sessa, and Jason Schwartzman, among others.) The lead-up to Christmas is progressing in the typical fashion (i.e. Claire is doing absolutely everything) when a miscommunication on the way to a dance show results in her being left behind, Kevin McCallister style.

Of course, being left home alone is less of a big deal when you're a grown woman, but it feels like a betrayal to Claire nonetheless. She decides to pick up and drive off to enter something called the “Holiday mom contest,” hosted by Eva Longoria (as the delightfully-named talk show host Zazzy Tims), leaving her family behind to fend for themselves.



Oh. What. Fun. seems to take the concept laid out in the Saturday Night Live sketch where Kristen Wiig only gets a robe for Christmas and dial it up to 11. And by 11, we mean televised revenge dancing and Denis Leary literally calling the police because his wife “got in her car, with luggage, and drove away,” as an incredulous officer questions at his door. If the rest of the family had just helped to deck literally one hall, they probably wouldn't be in this situation.

Oh. What. Fun. premieres December 3 on Prime Video. Maybe make a note of that so your mom doesn't have to do it herself.

Former teen heartthrob and Hallmark star Chad Michael Murray‘s most important role is as a father to his three children, and it seems his eldest daughter is following in his footsteps. 

Murray's 8-year-old daughter Audrey made her television debut alongside her father on Wednesday, November 5. 

The “Freaky Friday” star, 44, sat down for a chat with Drew Barrymore on her daytime talk show, “The Drew Barrymore Show,” as Audrey hung out backstage. 

“Would it be possible for us to meet her, is that OK?” Barrymore, 50, hesitantly asked. “If not, I'm so sorry I asked.”

“You know what, she's ready,” Murray said. “My sweet little daughter, no one ever really gets to meet her, but she's ready.”

She and the host became fast friends as they bonded over their favorite foods and the hit Netflix movie KPop Demon Hunters. 

“Where have you been all my life?” the “E.T.” star asked Audrey, whom Murray shares with wife Sarah Roemer. 

“We have Alexa on replay all the time. Her and her little sister are constantly doing KPop Demon Hunters to a tee. She knows them all,” Murray explained of his daughter's musical interests. 

According to Audrey, however, she “lost interest on [her] 300th time.”

Fans rarely get a glimpse of the “Cinderella Story” actor's personal life and children, but it didn't take long to notice the family resemblance. 

“She looks just like her mom! So cute,” one fan commented on Instagram. 

“Awwww! She's such a mini Sarah with a totally unexpected personality! I LOVE HER! ❤️” another wrote.

“Looks so much like her mam xxx,” a third added. 

“Literally moms twin ❤️” yet another fan chimed in.

In addition to Audrey, Murray and Roemer, 41, share a son, born in 2015, and another daughter, born in 2023. 

During a recent episode of Cosmopolitan's Blind Date, Murray was asked about one secret his wife doesn't know about him. 

“Probably that I secretly want more kids. I think four kids would be awesome,” he said in the YouTube video shared on October 30. “However, it's probably not a great idea. This last one is really, whoof, she's a wild card. She's one … She's the baby boss.”

Murray gives major thanks to his dad — who raised five children as a single father — for the life he has today. 

“I wouldn't have the life and the kids I have right now if it weren't for my dad. He gave us the opportunity to have a chance in life, to go get a job, to live out our dreams, and I'm so grateful for that,” he told Parade in July. “He's just got such a big selfless heart.”

Damon Albarn has released another song from the forthcoming Gorillaz album The Mountain. The new single, “The God of Lying,” features Idles. Check it out below.

Albarn wrote “The God of Lying” with Idles frontman Joe Talbot. He recorded it in London and Devon, England, and Mumbai, with bansuri player Ajay Prasanna and percussionist Viraj Acharya. In a statement, Gorillaz's fictional frontman, 2D, said, “Can I tell you a secret? Doubt is very tiring but questioning things is really good for you.”

The Mountain is out March 20. The follow-up to 2023's Cracker Island includes recent singles “The Happy Dictator” (featuring Sparks) and “The Manifesto” (featuring Trueno and the late D12 rapper Proof).

Ice Spice has dropped a new single, “Pretty Privilege.” The rapper shared the track alongside a music video, which sees her strutting and dancing around a mansion. 


	The track sees Ice Spice taking aim at her fellow artists. “Poser, she hear my song and copy everything I say,” she spits. “Like, what the fuck? These bitches dirt/ Just be yourself, this shit could work/ Pretty privilege, that's a perk/ I can't help it, I'm a flirt/ Fine shit, that's a fact.” She adds, “Cancel me, they really tried it/ I'm so cocky, I can't hide it.”


	“Pretty Privilege” follows Ice Spice's comeback single, “Baddie Baddie,” which arrived in September. The song marked Ice Spice's first solo release since she dropped Y2K!: I'm Just A Girl (Deluxe) last December. It was produced by the rapper's longtime collaborator RiotUSA and samples M.I.A.'s 2012 hit “Bad Girls.” She later dropped an Evil Twins-directed music video for the track.

She also made her film debut in Spike Lee's most recent film, Highest 2 Lowest, starring Denzel Washington and A$AP Rocky.

	Ice Spice recently told Rolling Stone her creative process has stayed the same throughout her career. “Everything kind of changes a little bit slowly throughout the years, but, it's pretty consistent,” she said. “Or, like, I have things that I do that I'm comfortable with. I take a lot of breaks in between recording songs. So I don't just, sit and go through it. I get up, do things, eat, or whatever, and then come back to it the next day.”

People reported seeing a strange light moving across the sky in Maine on Tuesday night. But it wasn't an extraterrestrial occurrence.

CBS13 Chief Meteorologist Charlie Lopresti looked into it and said it's likely a rocket fuel dump from the European Space Agency's Ariane 6.



As the rocket fuel freezes in the cold atmosphere, sunlight reflects off it, causing it to look the way it does.

Astronauts could soon be able to move with greater ease, thanks to a soft robotic exosuit developed by researchers at the University of Bristol.Not only does the technology have extraterrestrial benefits, but it could also help people who need support with their mobility on earth, too. The soft robotic exosuit is designed to resemble a garment and is mostly made of fabric material. Worn underneath the spacesuit, the exosuit features artificial muscles that work automatically to help astronauts reduce muscular fatigue while maintaining natural movements during future Moon and Mars missions. Last month, Dr Emanuele Pulvirenti, Research Associate in the University of Bristol's Soft Robotics Lab, travelled to the University of Adelaide, Australia, home to the Exterres CRATER facility – the largest simulated lunar environment in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, the exosuit was tested as part of an international ‘proof of concept' simulated space mission run by the Austrian Space Forum.Dubbed the ‘World's Biggest Analog', the mission saw 200 scientists from 25 countries working together on different experiments and operational simulations across four continents and reporting back to the mission control base in Austria. The ADAMA mission, organised by ICEE.space, was the first time a soft robotic exosuit had been integrated into a spacesuit, and the first field test of its kind. The experiments evaluated comfort, mobility and biomechanical effects when performing planetary surface tasks ,such as walking, climbing and load-carrying on loose terrain. Dr Pulvirenti handmade the exosuit himself, teaching himself to sew as part of the process. “Fortunately, my grandmother worked as a tailor and she was able to give me some advice,” Dr Pulvirenti said. He developed the lightweight exosuit alongside Vivo Hub colleagues at the University of Bristol. The artificial muscles in the suit consist of two layers: an outer nylon layer and an inner thermoplastic layer that allows airtight inflation.The anchoring components, such as the waistband and knee straps, are made from Kevlar for high strength and tension resistance. Dr Pulvirenti said: “The hope is that this technology could pave the way for future wearable robotic systems that enhance astronaut performance and reduce fatigue during extra-vehicular surface activities.   “I would love to continue developing this technology so that it could eventually be tested at the International Space Station.” “It's exciting that this technology could also potentially benefit people too,” Dr Pulvirenti continued. “This exosuit is assistive, meaning it artificially boosts the lower-limb muscles, but we have also separately developed a resistive exosuit, which applies load to the body to help maintain muscle mass. “Our next goal is to create a hybrid suit that can switch between assistance and resistance modes as needed, which could be of great benefit for people in need of support with mobility going through physical rehabilitation.”

Airlines rushed to provide travelers updates after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would reduce flights across 40 airports as the longest government shutdown in history continues to drag on.

Many major airlines said they would waive cancellation fees for even their most basic tickets, which often come with penalties for changes.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said he would reduce flight capacity by roughly 10%, affecting 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.

The FAA has not yet announced which ""high traffic"" airports would be affected.

These are the airports that are expected to be impacted, based on preliminary information before the agency meets with airlines to finalize cuts, CNBC's Phil LeBeau reported. The preliminary list includes some of the country's largest airports and major international hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City.

Preliminary list:

On Wednesday, Duffy said the reduction was a ""proactive"" measure because of the delays and cancellations already occurring due to the shutdown. Air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees required to work during a shutdown, have missed paychecks, and the FAA has said the closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among controllers.

Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time.

""We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing,"" Duffy added.

Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he could ""shut the whole airspace down"" if the shutdown drags on.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday that additional measures may be implemented after the reduction, which he said he has never seen before in his time in the industry. The officials said they were planning to meet with airlines to discuss which flights would be cut.

In a Wednesday memo to United Airlines employees, CEO Scott Kirby said the carrier will not be reducing long-haul international flying and hub-to-hub flying, instead reducing regional and domestic flights that do not fly between hubs.

The airline also offered all customers refunds even if their flights are not impacted. Kirby said that included ""non-refundable tickets and those customers with basic economy tickets.""

On Thursday afternoon, the airline preemptively said it was going to cancel 4% of its flights from Friday through Sunday.

In a statement, Delta Air Lines said it expects to operate the ""vast majority"" of its flights as scheduled and will offer changes, cancellations or refunds for customers' flights during the impacted period. Delta also said that would include basic economy fares, without penalty.

Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said he highly recommends travelers flying Friday or in the next 10 days book a backup ticket on another carrier as the flight reductions begin to avoid getting stranded due to cancellations.

""I'm sorry this is happening. Hopefully the shutdown is over soon,"" Biffle wrote on LinkedIn. ""Just giving everyone practical travel advice.""

American Airlines said it expects that the ""vast majority of customers' travel will proceed as planned,"" adding that the carrier will reach out to travelers proactively as schedule changes occur.

The airline also said that it will offer immediate rebooking options for all impacted travelers and that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason will be able to change their flight or request a refund without penalty. As of Thursday morning, the airline was still awaiting clarifying information from the FAA about which of its flights will be impacted.

Southwest Airlines also released a statement saying that the majority of its flights will not be impacted and that its international flights should operate as usual. The airline said it will ""proactively communicate well in advance and will offer flexibility in travel plans.""

The Association of Flight Attendants, representing 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, released a statement Wednesday urging Congress to end the shutdown so air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers can get paid.

""The false narrative that this shutdown is a choice of either paying federal workers or protecting affordable healthcare is outrageous when both crises were manufactured by the exact people who can fix it,"" the statement read.

Experts recommend consumers who are set to travel in the next week stay on top of flight cancellations and delays through the websites and apps.

Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at travel site The Points Guy, said flexibility ""is going to be key"" as travelers rush to rebook, adding it's important to download each airline's mobile app and enable all notifications.

""A lot of the times, you have to actually enable notifications on individual trips or in your account to text you if there are changes or disruptions,"" Ewen told CNBC.

He recommended anyone with nonurgent travel reschedule their trips, though that likely only applies to a small number of travelers, and consider choosing other forms of transportation instead. For essential trips, Ewen said passengers should be prepared for long wait times, use self-service rebooking tools, and be aware of the fact that many other people will also be rebooking and scrambling for limited seats.

Ewen said he has been covering the industry for many years, and the last time he and his colleagues saw a major, national disruption in air travel like this was 9/11.

""The biggest thing is a lot of kindness goes a long way,"" he said. ""So if you're at an airport and you find out that your flight is canceled, I promise you screaming at that airline employee is not going to get you rebooked any faster — in fact, it's probably going to make them less likely to be willing to help you. So recognize that everyone is in this together.""

AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the company recommends arriving at the airport extra early to avoid long lines and avoid checking in a bag if possible in case flights get canceled.

""Ultimately, there's a lot that's out of travelers' control — so control what you can, and be as flexible as possible,"" Diaz said.

Travel insurance can reimburse consumers for certain costs and inconveniences incurred from a trip disruption, like flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or unforeseen costs for lodging and meals.

Consumers have been buying travel insurance at an elevated rate amid the government shutdown, but travel and insurance experts warn that such policies don't offer blanket protection for shutdown-related travel snafus, and a lot depends on the fine print.

For example, a policyholder generally can't get insurance benefits if they choose to cancel their travel plans to avoid any headaches. Cancel-for-any-reason coverage is an exception, though it also comes with its own caveats.

Whether or not a policyholder gets compensated may come down to the rationale an airline provides for a delayed or canceled flight.

Many insurers only pay benefits if a delay or cancellation is attributable to a ""common carrier"" disruption like a mechanical failure, travel experts said.

""Airlines typically won't cite causes other than operational terms like 'mechanical issues' or general delays, cancellations, or lost belongings, even during a government shutdown,"" Lauren McCormick, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, wrote in a recent blog post. ""So, these are generally still covered under most comprehensive travel insurance plans.""

Bitcoin BTC$101,277.82 is holding around $103,000 having rebounded from Wednesday's sub-$100,000﻿ level. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is up 1.8% in 24 hours.

Still, the largest cryptocurrency remains in a technical downtrend from the Oct. 6 record high of $126,000, having formed a lower high at $116,000 as well as consecutive lower lows.

The altcoin market has fared even worse, demonstrated by bitcoin dominance ticking back up to 60% after dropping to 57% in September.

Several tokens remain well below critical levels of support including ENA$0.3145 and APT$2.7207, both of which posted declines of more than 20% over the past week.

The recent sell-off was spurred by strength in the U.S. dollar following murmurs of indecision from the Federal Reserve in terms of the rate cutting cycle.

                            The Central Bank of West African States is preparing a CBDC pilot. Credit: Michel RENAUDEAU/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images.                        

In 2025, stablecoins have largely stolen the limelight from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). 

However, around the world, central banks are quietly progressing with their various CBDC initiatives.

For instance, the Central Bank of West African States is preparing to launch its CBDC pilot in the new year.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England's regular forums on the matter reveal steady progress on the digital pound.

Not so long ago, CBDCs were at the heart of the conversation around digital money.

Starting around 2019, what had previously been a niche interest among payment nerds captured the public imagination.

In 2020, China's e-CNY pilot garnered significant media attention.

When Nigeria's central bank launched the eNaira a year later, the world watched closely to see how the first nationwide implementation of the concept would unfold.

By 2024, digital pounds, euros, and dollars seemed inevitable, with more than 90 central banks in the exploratory stage and 44 live pilots underway.

However, the U.S. election that year changed everything.

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump slammed CBDCs as a form of government surveillance and vowed to shut down the Fed's digital dollar explorations.

True to his word, once he entered the White House, one of the first executive orders Trump signed explicitly prohibited the creation of a CBDC within the United States.

Subsequent efforts to enshrine a ban in the more enduring form of an Act of Congress are also underway, with the House passing the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act  in July.

Washington's stablecoin push serves as an important corollary to the anti-CBDC movement.

While both technologies address calls for currency digitization, stablecoins present a much more immediate reality.

Significant changes to a nation's monetary base can take years to plan and implement.

By the time more central banks make their move, stablecoins worth trillions of dollars may already be in circulation.

With stablecoins dominating the global conversation, CBDC plans appeared to stall.

Although some central banks have moved them onto the back burner, they continue to make quiet progress.

In a sign that the movement is still alive, the Central Bank of West African States will start piloting a digital version of the West African CFA franc in the new year, Governor Jean-Claude Kassi Brou confirmed  recently.

The announcement follows the launch of Uganda's  digital shilling pilot in October.

Meanwhile, minutes  from the Bank of England's CBDC task force reveal ongoing discussions on the finer details of implementation.

Central bankers' enthusiasm isn't always matched by political appetite. The same concerns that motivate Trump's anti-CBDC agenda continue to fuel resistance elsewhere.

For instance, while the European Central Bank is pressing ahead with plans to launch a digital euro as early as 2029, lawmakers are less convinced.

Ongoing pilots and explorations don't mean CBDCs are guaranteed.

While central banks around the world have been instructed to prepare the ground, ultimately, it will be politicians, not central bankers, who have the final say.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

	A man standing near Donald Trump in the Oval Office collapsed as the president was holding a press event to announce discounts to two popular weight loss drugs.


	Media was rushed out of the Oval Office as figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz tried to assist the man. Fox News, NewsNation and C-SPAN were covering the event live, and NewsNation's White House correspondent updated viewers on the situation.


	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “a representative with one of the companies fainted. The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay. The Press Conference will resume shortly.” The event resumed about a half hour later, and Trump said “He's fine.” The president said the man, who collapsed as Eli Lilly‘s David Ricks was speaking, got “a little bit lightheaded.” He was not identified.

	At the event, Trump announced a White House initiative to lower drug costs, this time over innovative weight-loss treatments.

	Trump said that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to offer their most popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs at “drastic discounts.” The drugs are Zepbound and Wegovy. The president said that the costs will fall from more than $1,000 per month to a couple or several hundred dollars.


	“All these drugs will be available directly to the consumer at trumprx.gov. They wanted to use my name,” Trump said.


	He said that Medicare and Medicaid would cover the cost for patients suffering from obesity.


	Fox News and NewsNation carried Trump's remarks; other cable networks did not. 


	Trump at one point said to Robert Kennedy Jr., his secretary of Health and Human Services, “Is there anything bad about them, Bobby? Someday, maybe it will come out, which we'll notify you immediately.”


	Trump's announcement comes after Tuesday's off-year elections, in which exit polls showed voters showed their top concerns were the economy and affordability. Republicans got a drubbing from Democratic candidates in the handful of races across the country.

Finally, with the shut down that is privately or purposely funding the military and ICE while not funding TSA, FAA, SNAP, etc., the big announcement is not that there has been made a compromise with the government “open” again, but the US citizens may see a reduction in the cost of weight loss drugs.  Lack of benefits and high costs of living, especially at the grocery stores, is plenty to affect weight loss.  Seems like another give away to those who can afford the mostly cosmetic drug anyway (see diet and exercise for most Americans).

Oz tended to him? Weren't there any real doctors nearby?

Great to see weight loss medicine reduced in price, put diabetes, cancer, blood pressure meds on the back burner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Actress Passes Away & Fans Flood Social Media With Tributes","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/pauline-collins-passes-away-fans-tributes/","Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:29:19 GMT","

Oscar-nominated actress Pauline Collins, best known for her role in Shirley Valentine, has sadly passed away. She also appeared in films such as “Quartet” and “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.” The beloved British actress passed away at the age of 85. 

According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, Collins passed away “peacefully” at her home in London in the presence of her family. Her death came after a years-long battle with Parkinson's disease. Collins leaves behind four children and her husband, John Alderton.

Collins appeared in over 70 roles throughout her legendary career. It's for this reason that many fans are flocking to social media to remember the screen legend. One person on X wrote, “Thanks for everything, Pauline Collins. Your quiet talent shone out no matter what the job. RIP”

Another person said on X, “Always guaranteed to light up the screen, either big or small, Pauline Collins has sadly left us. RIP.”

Someone else expressed their disbelief, saying, “Oh, it can't be true!! Shirley Valentine is my all-time favourite film, I must've seen it a million times. I'm so, so gutted and sad about this. Rest in peace, Pauline Collins. Shirley and Joe reunited 😔”

Another fan wrote, “Sad to hear we've lost Pauline Collins. A cracking actress. RIP” A Different fan stated, “RIP the wonderful, funny Pauline Collins. From Upstairs Downstairs to Mrs Caldicot's Cabbages via Shirley Valentine, she never failed to entertain in her own unique style.”

The social media tributes continued as someone else said, “One of my favourite actors – started watching Upstairs Downstairs again on ITVx. She was brilliant in everything she did. RIP Pauline Collins. #PaulineCollins”

Finally, another fan of her work wrote, “RIP Pauline Collins. She was magnificent in Upstairs Downstairs as the fiesty yet vulnerable Sarah, done wrong by that Master James and tragically losing her baby on the night the King came for dinner. Wonderful memories…💔”

According to IMDb, Collins began her on-screen career in 1963 with episodic appearances in “Emergency-Ward 10” and “24-Hour Call.” From there, she appeared in shows like “Pardon the Expression,” “The Three Musketeers,” and “Dr. Who.”

What most would call her big break came when she starred in “Shirley Valentine” in 1989. This is the film that led to her Oscar nomination and Golden Globe and BAFTA wins. Her most recent role was in the 2017 film “The Time of Their Lives.” Collins will be missed, but her legacy will live on.

	A journey that began over 50 years ago when former members of Santana formed their own spinoff band is coming to an end. Journey have announced details of a long-rumored Final Frontier farewell tour that will take them all across North America next year.


	The first leg kicks off Feb. 28 in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and wraps up July 2 in Laredo, Texas. There are 60 dates on the books, mostly in secondary and tertiary markets, and more will be announced in the future.


	“This tour is our heartfelt thank you to the fans who've been with us every step of the way — through every song, every era, every high and low,” Journey founder Neal Schon says in a statement. “We're pulling out all the stops with a brand-new production — the hits, the deep cuts, the energy, the spectacle. It's a full-circle celebration of the music that's brought us all together.


	“As its founding member, I carry the Journey torch to this day, wherever I go,” he continues. “The sentiment and spirit of the band will always remain. While this marks a farewell to one powerful chapter of the Journey we've shared, I want everyone to know I'm not done. Music is still burning strong inside me, and there are new creative horizons ahead. This tour is both a thank you and the beginning of what's next.”

	











	Longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain echoed the sentiment: “It's been an incredible ride. We've shared our music with millions, and this tour is about gratitude, connection, and one last chance to feel that magic together. We wouldn't want it any other way.”

	











	They'll be joined once again by singer Arnel Pineda, who has been delivering Steve Perry's vocal parts since joining the band in 2007. “I'm honored to be part of this legacy, and I'm grateful for having been welcomed with such open arms,” he says in a statement. “Every night onstage has been a dream come true.”


	Schon, Cain, and Pineda will be accompanied by keyboardist-singer Jason Derlatka, drummer-singer Deen Castronovo, and bassist Todd Jensen.

	A press release promises an “all new, special evening with stage production across North America with their catalog of global chart-topping hits, including ‘Don't Stop Believin,' ‘Any Way You Want It,' ‘Faithfully,' ‘Lights,' and more in a celebration of legacy, love, and the fans who made it all possible.”


	Journey went on an extended hiatus in 1987 when Perry decided to walk away from public life. They briefly reformed in 1996 to record the comeback LP Trial by Fire, but they parted ways with Perry before they were able to tour behind it. In 1998, they reconvened with new vocalist Steven Augeri and slowly rebuilt their audience with a relentless tour schedule. Augeri left the band in 2006, and he was briefly replaced with Jeff Scott Soto, but everything changed when Schon discovered Pineda singing Journey covers on YouTube. He's been in the band for the past 18 years.


	Along the way, there's been a fair amount of discord between Schon and Cain that played out in legal filings, social media posts, and interviews. There was also a protracted legal battle with the classic-era rhythm section of Ross Valory and Steve Smith following their dismissal from the band in 2020.


	Despite all the bad blood and the many lineup changes, Journey continued to tour, often on bills with fellow Eighties survivors like Def Leppard, Heart, and Toto. But they've only done a handful of gigs this year, and have been completely inactive since an April 24 show at Huntington Bank Field in Cleveland.
