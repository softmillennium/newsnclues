So he deserves a big applause for his performance. Obviously, serving well always helps in the important moments. I think it was 5-all, or 4-all in the first set, I faced two break points and had big serves—sometimes risks pay off in the big moments and you just have to trust your instincts and go for it. There weren't many opportunities for both of us to break—I think that game I broke him was the only game I was able to break. I want to thank everybody for showing up and supporting both of us tonight. "Awaiting Djokovic in the semifinals will be either American Macros Giron or German qualifier Yannik Hanfmann.

If he doesn't win the title this week, Felix Auger-Aliassime becomes the eighth and final qualifier in Turin.Awaiting Musetti in the semifinals on Friday will be American Sebastian Korda, and it's been a close match-up for the Italian—they're 2-2 head-to-head, but while his two wins have come on clay, Korda's two wins have come on indoor hard courts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron Norrie overcame a stern test from home hope Kyrian Jacquet at the Moselle Open on Thursday. A finalist last year in Metz, Norrie rallied past the lucky loser 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-4 to reach his second semi-final of the season. “He surprised me a lot,” Norrie said of Jacquet, the third Frenchman whom the lefty has beaten this week. “He was mixing it up really well. A lot of slicing, then really aggressive at moments. I really liked the way he competed and he could have easily won the match in the second set as well, but I managed to stay tough.” Jacquet crushed 48 winners, half of which came from his forehand, to Norrie's 28, but the 30-year-old Briton found his best tennis when he needed it most to earn his place in the last four. He will next meet Lorenzo Sonego after the Italian beat Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(6). Norrie is aiming for his sixth tour-level title and first since 2023 in Rio de Janeiro, where he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the final.
