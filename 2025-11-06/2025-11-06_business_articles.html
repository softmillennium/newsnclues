Six airports — Anchorage, Atlanta, Charlotte, Boston, Seattle, and Philadelphia — confirmed to Business Insider that they are among those temporarily losing some service. The FAA has not yet released an official list of all affected airports. It said that up to 1,800 flights representing about 268,000 seats could be cut on Friday. CBS News and The Washington Post shared a list of 40 potentially affected airports, citing unnamed sources. Some airports — including Indianapolis, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Memphis, Detroit, and those in the Houston, New York, and Dallas areas — told Business Insider they were aware of the planned cuts but had not yet been notified that they were on the list. Minneapolis airport told Business Insider that operations are normal as of Thursday, but said "if reductions are enacted, travelers should be prepared for flight disruptions" at Minneapolis and other airports across the US. Some airlines have given customers a general idea of what to expect, but details are scarce. Frontier Airlines told Business Insider that most of its flights are expected to "operate as planned" come Friday, but will proactively communicate with customers as changes occur. United CEO Scott Kirby provided some information in a Wednesday statement, saying none of the airline's long-haul international or hub-to-hub flights would be affected. United has seven main hubs in the mainland US: Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles. That's roughly 250 to 300 daily cancellations, affecting around 25,000 customers a day, they added. Atlanta — where Delta has its major hub — would be second at 104 flights. "If you're checking bags, plan for long lines with extra time at the airport, and pack any valuables or time-sensitive items in your carry-on," Audrey Kohout, Co-CEO of luggage shipping companies LuggageForward and LugLess, said in a media statement. For those whose flights get canceled, in most cases, airlines would try to rebook them on an alternative flight. American, Delta, Frontier, and United have said that customers will be able to change or refund their flights at no extra cost. Southwest said that passengers whose flights are canceled will be eligible for a refund. As of noon ET, Alaska does not have a flexible travel policy in place. Some airline CEOs are already warning people to prepare for the worst: "If your flight is canceled, your chances of being stranded are high, so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline," Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in a LinkedIn post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft on Thursday said it's forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced artificial intelligence research. "We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable," Suleyman wrote. "We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity." The decision comes months after Facebook parent Meta spent billions to hire talent for its new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit that's working on research and products. Suleyman was a co-founder of AI lab DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014. After leaving Google in 2022, he co-founded and led AI startup Inflection. Microsoft hired Suleyman and several other Inflection employees last year. Top technology companies have rushed to hire leading AI engineers and researchers, augmenting their products with generative AI capabilities. The boom started with OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Microsoft has taken steps to reduce its dependence on OpenAI. After the Inflection deal, the software company also began drawing on models from Google and from Anthropic, which was founded by former OpenAI executives. The new Microsoft AI research group will focus on providing useful companions for people that can help in education and other domains, Suleyman wrote in his blog post. "We'll have expert level performance at the full range of diagnostics, alongside highly capable planning and prediction in operational clinical settings," Suleyman wrote. As investors and analysts are increasingly voicing their concerns about overspending on AI without a clear path to profits, Suleyman said he wants "to make clear that we are not building a superintelligence at any cost, with no limits."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday announced deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of some of their obesity drugs, including upcoming pills, in a landmark effort to expand access to the costly blockbuster treatments. The agreements will cut prices of so-called GLP-1 drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026 and offer the treatments directly to consumers at a discount on a website the Trump administration is launching in January called TrumpRx.gov. That means Medicare will start covering obesity drugs for some patients for the first time starting mid-2026, a long-awaited move that could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment. Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month for everyone getting them through Medicare, Medicaid or TrumpRx, a senior administration official who declined to be named told reporters during a briefing Thursday. Novo Nordisk's oral version of its obesity injection Wegovy could enter the market by year-end, while Eli Lilly's pill orforglipron could launch next year. Starting doses of existing injections like Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRX, but will "trend down" to $245 per month over a two-year period, another senior administration official said during the briefing. Wegovy and Zepbound have not been covered by Medicare for weight loss, "and they've only rarely been covered by Medicaid," Trump said in the Oval Office. As part of the president's "most favored nation" policy, he has announced deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from planned pharmaceutical tariffs. All Americans, even those who are not on Medicaid, Medicare, are going to be able to get the same price for their drugs, for their GLP-1s." The list prices of existing obesity drugs – roughly $1,000 to $1,350 per month before insurance – are a huge barrier for patients, many of whom could benefit from their ability to promote weight loss and ease other related health complications such as cardiovascular risks and sleep apnea. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have agreed to cut the price Medicare pays for GLP-1s it already covers for diabetes and other indications, along with those drugs for obesity, to $245 per month. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not. But Medicare coverage could have a bigger impact on who gets the drugs because the program covers about 66 million people, and is the primary source of insurance for people ages 65 and above. The new obesity drug coverage will be enabled through a pilot program designed to cover a majority of beneficiaries under Medicare Part D, which are the program's prescription drug plans. Another senior administration official said around 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Eligible patients will fall into three cohorts. The first includes those who are overweight, with a body mass index greater than 27 or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease. The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure. GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a much broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. The administration official said, "We are constraining the access for patients that will benefit clinically from it, we've worked very hard to strike a balance between broad access that just makes sure to capture patients that will benefit clinically." As part of the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk also made similar pledges to the ones other drugmakers have made as part of Trump's most favored nation agreements. The companies will guarantee most favored nation pricing on all new medicines they bring to market, provide that pricing to every state Medicaid program, offer at least U.S. net prices or most favored nation pricing on nearly all primary care drugs on TrumpRx and share savings from foreign drug price increases on existing products, one senior administration official said. Also on Thursday, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. In a statement Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the deal marks "a pivotal moment in U.S. health care policy and a defining milestone for Lilly," which is focused on "improving outcomes, strengthening the U.S. healthcare system, and contributing to the health of our nation for generations to come." In a separate statement, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said, "today's announcement will bring semaglutide medicines to more American patients at a lower cost." Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic. Biden's proposal would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries. But some health experts contend that covering the drugs could eliminate the downstream costs involved with treating obesity-related conditions. Semaglutide is also included in the next round of Medicare drug price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The sale of the Amadea, a 106-meter luxury yacht that the government said it seized from sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov in 2022, was finalized in October, Business Insider previously reported. New registration documents reveal that an entity linked to Sajwani and his Damac Group is behind the purchase. As of October 10, the owner of the yacht was listed as Beyond Holdings Group Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands — a popular flag for superyachts, given its favorable tax policy and strict confidentiality rules. Beyond Holdings Group's headquarters is located in Dubai, on the 20th floor of the Executive Heights tower, according to Bloomberg's Legal Entity Identifier. The entity's former name, AHS Four Company Limited, also connects to Sajwani. His son Abbas Sajwani's yacht is named AHS, after his initials, and is owned by a company called AHS One Company Limited. The United States Marshals Service declined to comment. A later appraisal put its value closer to $230 million, court documents said. The price fetched at auction has not been publicly revealed. The yacht's maintenance costs — including crew salaries, fuel, insurance, and more — reached nearly $1 million a month for US taxpayers at one point, according to court filings, so the government was eager to offload it. That said, seized yachts are complicated assets, as their true ownership can be contested. Pinned to the top of Hussain Sajwani's Instagram account is a video taken in January at Mar-a-Lago, where he and Trump said that Damac subsidiary Edgnex Data Centers would invest $20 billion in the US. Other posts from the past year include photos of them together in the Oval Office, in the UAE, where Hussain Sajwani was invited during Trump's official visit, and in Scotland, where Hussain Sajwani visited Trump's Turnberry Golf Course. It's a partnership that extends back more than a decade, when Damac signed on to codevelop two Trump-branded golf courses in Dubai. Trump has also turned down deals with Hussain Sajwani. When Trump was first elected in 2016, the elder Sajwani, who attended a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago that year, said he wanted to form a closer relationship with Trump's businesses, NBC reported. More recently, Trump and Hussain Sajwani have continued to do personal business together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airlines rushed to provide travelers updates after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would reduce flights across 40 airports as the longest government shutdown in history continues to drag on. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said he would reduce flight capacity by roughly 10%, affecting 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily. The FAA has not yet announced which "high traffic" airports would be affected. These are the airports that are expected to be impacted, based on preliminary information before the agency meets with airlines to finalize cuts, CNBC's Phil LeBeau reported. The preliminary list includes some of the country's largest airports and major international hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City. Air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees required to work during a shutdown, have missed paychecks, and the FAA has said the closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among controllers. Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday that additional measures may be implemented after the reduction, which he said he has never seen before in his time in the industry. In a Wednesday memo to United Airlines employees, CEO Scott Kirby said the carrier will not be reducing long-haul international flying and hub-to-hub flying, instead reducing regional and domestic flights that do not fly between hubs. The airline also offered all customers refunds even if their flights are not impacted. On Thursday afternoon, the airline preemptively said it was going to cancel 4% of its flights from Friday through Sunday. In a statement, Delta Air Lines said it expects to operate the "vast majority" of its flights as scheduled and will offer changes, cancellations or refunds for customers' flights during the impacted period. Delta also said that would include basic economy fares, without penalty. Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said he highly recommends travelers flying Friday or in the next 10 days book a backup ticket on another carrier as the flight reductions begin to avoid getting stranded due to cancellations. Hopefully the shutdown is over soon," Biffle wrote on LinkedIn. American Airlines said it expects that the "vast majority of customers' travel will proceed as planned," adding that the carrier will reach out to travelers proactively as schedule changes occur. The airline also said that it will offer immediate rebooking options for all impacted travelers and that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason will be able to change their flight or request a refund without penalty. As of Thursday morning, the airline was still awaiting clarifying information from the FAA about which of its flights will be impacted. Southwest Airlines also released a statement saying that the majority of its flights will not be impacted and that its international flights should operate as usual. The Association of Flight Attendants, representing 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, released a statement Wednesday urging Congress to end the shutdown so air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers can get paid. "The false narrative that this shutdown is a choice of either paying federal workers or protecting affordable healthcare is outrageous when both crises were manufactured by the exact people who can fix it," the statement read. Experts recommend consumers who are set to travel in the next week stay on top of flight cancellations and delays through the websites and apps. "A lot of the times, you have to actually enable notifications on individual trips or in your account to text you if there are changes or disruptions," Ewen told CNBC. He recommended anyone with nonurgent travel reschedule their trips, though that likely only applies to a small number of travelers, and consider choosing other forms of transportation instead. For essential trips, Ewen said passengers should be prepared for long wait times, use self-service rebooking tools, and be aware of the fact that many other people will also be rebooking and scrambling for limited seats. Ewen said he has been covering the industry for many years, and the last time he and his colleagues saw a major, national disruption in air travel like this was 9/11. AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the company recommends arriving at the airport extra early to avoid long lines and avoid checking in a bag if possible in case flights get canceled. "Ultimately, there's a lot that's out of travelers' control — so control what you can, and be as flexible as possible," Diaz said. Travel insurance can reimburse consumers for certain costs and inconveniences incurred from a trip disruption, like flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or unforeseen costs for lodging and meals. Consumers have been buying travel insurance at an elevated rate amid the government shutdown, but travel and insurance experts warn that such policies don't offer blanket protection for shutdown-related travel snafus, and a lot depends on the fine print. Cancel-for-any-reason coverage is an exception, though it also comes with its own caveats. Whether or not a policyholder gets compensated may come down to the rationale an airline provides for a delayed or canceled flight. "Airlines typically won't cite causes other than operational terms like 'mechanical issues' or general delays, cancellations, or lost belongings, even during a government shutdown," Lauren McCormick, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, wrote in a recent blog post. "So, these are generally still covered under most comprehensive travel insurance plans." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees required to work during a shutdown, have missed paychecks, and the FAA has said the closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among controllers. Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday that additional measures may be implemented after the reduction, which he said he has never seen before in his time in the industry. In a Wednesday memo to United Airlines employees, CEO Scott Kirby said the airline will not be reducing long-haul international flying and hub-to-hub flying, instead reducing regional and domestic flights that do not fly between hubs. The airline also offered all customers refunds even if their flights are not impacted. In a statement, Delta Air Lines said it expects to operate the "vast majority" of its flights as scheduled and will offer changes, cancellations or refunds for customers' flights during the impacted period. Delta also said that would include basic economy fares, without penalty. Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said he highly recommends travelers flying Friday or in the next 10 days book a backup ticket on another carrier as the flight reductions begin to avoid getting stranded due to flight cancellations. Hopefully the shutdown is over soon," Biffle wrote on LinkedIn. American Airlines said it expects the "vast majority of customers' travel will proceed as planned," adding that the airline will reach out to travelers proactively as schedule changes occur. The airline also said it will offer immediate rebooking options for all impacted travelers and that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason will be able to change their flight or request a refund without penalty. As of Thursday morning, the airline was still awaiting clarifying information from the FAA about which of its flights will be impacted. Southwest Airlines also released a statement saying that the majority of its flights will not be impacted and that its international flights should operate as usual. The Association of Flight Attendants, representing 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, released a statement Wednesday urging Congress to end the shutdown so air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers can get paid. "The false narrative that this shutdown is a choice of either paying federal workers or protecting affordable healthcare is outrageous when both crises were manufactured by the exact people who can fix it," the statement read. Experts recommend consumers who are set to travel in the next week stay on top of flight cancellations and delays through the websites and apps. "A lot of the times, you have to actually enable notifications on individual trips or in your account to text you if there are changes or disruptions," Ewen told CNBC. He recommended anyone with non-urgent travel reschedule their trips, though that likely only applies to a small number of travelers, and consider choosing other forms of transportation instead. For essential trips, Ewen said passengers should be prepared for long wait times, use self-service rebooking tools and be aware of the fact that many other people will also be rebooking and scrambling for limited seats. Ewen said he has been covering the industry for many years, and the last time he and his colleagues saw a major, national disruption in air travel like this was 9/11. AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the company recommends arriving at the airport extra early to avoid long lines and avoid checking in a bag if possible in case flights get canceled. "Ultimately, there's a lot that's out of travelers' control — so control what you can, and be as flexible as possible," Diaz said. Travel insurance can reimburse consumers for certain costs and inconveniences incurred from a trip disruption, like flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or unforeseen costs for lodging and meals. Consumers have been buying travel insurance at an elevated rate amid the government shutdown, but travel and insurance experts warn that such policies don't offer blanket protection for shutdown-related travel snafus, and a lot depends on the fine print. Cancel-for-any-reason coverage is an exception, though it also comes with its own caveats. Whether or not a policyholder gets compensated may come down to the rationale an airline provides for a delayed or canceled flight. "Airlines typically won't cite causes other than operational terms like 'mechanical issues' or general delays, cancellations, or lost belongings, even during a government shutdown," Lauren McCormick, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, wrote in a recent blog post. "So, these are generally still covered under most comprehensive travel insurance plans." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

When Lisa Johnson launched her business strategy career eight years ago and suddenly became a millionaire, many things in her life vanished. And, mysteriously enough, some of her friends, too. "They just ghosted me — disappeared," Johnson told Business Insider. Johnson, who grew up in a housing development in England, said she hadn't changed how she treated the people around her, so "it was a shock. No one ever spoke to me about it. While America's millionaire class continues to grow, making up over 6% of the country's population, some self-made millionaires experience a more bittersweet taste of success: losing their old friends and family. Some might work longer hours or have different spending habits than their social circles — habits that contributed to their wealth in the first place. Over time, they said they've felt judged for living differently, a topic that feels impossible to address and can drive a wedge even further between the closest bonds. Nepo babies are frequently reviled, whether they're Hollywood-dominating celebrity children or New York City homeowners buying their apartments through trust funds. Still, millionaires aren't devoid of relationship issues. In some ways, they can experience wholly unique ones, because "the world is not very compassionate to that kind of trouble and pain," Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist who hosts Fresh Produce Media's Audible series "Emotional Investment," told Business Insider. Loneliness is something not even the wealthy can buy their way out of. If anything, understanding how money changes relationships is the first step to keeping them. Self-made millionaires tend to have a few distinct qualities. When Lane Kawaoka became a millionaire by buying rental properties, he realized his newfound wealth was making him feel lonely. Much of it had to do with differing mindsets. "My coworkers didn't understand things I found important," Kawaoka told Business Insider. He also didn't want people to assume he had lots of money to spare: "Still being frugal at the time, I didn't want any excuse for me to have to pick up the bill all the time for my buddies." The millionaire can find themselves siloing off into a new class bubble because "it's hard to plan and stay in touch with people who just can't do the same things that you can do," Clay Cockrell, a licensed clinical social worker focusing on high-net-worth individuals, told Business Insider. Sometimes, the work schedule required to stay wealthy is what drives away old friends and family. Starting his own company meant working longer hours on the side. "My colleagues at the firehouse started teasing me more and more about how hard I was working," Barker told Business Insider. Even if millionaires believe their feelings — and potential judgments — aren't obvious, the truth usually comes out. Johnson remembers sharing her thoughts on money via social media, how she was working hard to move away from debt. "I often felt like that irritated a few of my friends," she said. "There were lots of comments that felt passive-aggressive, like: 'It's alright for you,' 'It's OK for the lucky ones,' and 'It's how the other half live.'" Over time, the long working hours, declined invitations, and distinctly different financial goals can lead to schisms in millionaires' relationships. Tensions can especially come to a head when lending money is concerned. "I've seen too many family rifts erupt when expectations aren't clearly spelled out," Joy Slabaugh told Business Insider. A millionaire and financial therapist, Slabaugh, asked her relative to sign an agreement to monthly interest-only payments of $100, with the principal due three months after the initial payment, for a $1,000 loan. Privately, Slabaugh questioned if loaning a relative money, even with a repayment plan, was the right move: "I was afraid that giving them money — even as a loan — might be more harmful than helpful," potentially enabling her relative. Slabaugh later learned that they were going through some personal issues and "felt so much shame" about not paying the money back right away that they didn't reply. "If I had been clearer and more emotionally honest from the beginning, we could've avoided months of silence and perhaps reduced their emotional strain," Slabaugh said. For some millionaires, downplaying or even hiding their wealth feels like a Band-Aid to the problem. "It is a barrier to intimacy, in the sense of true knowing and connection for each other's unique set of experiences," Clayman said. To be a healthy, well-rounded person, you need community, Cockrell said. Millionaires, who are still in the vast financial minority, "just happen to have a complicating factor." "People are going to be attracted to you for different reasons," he said, "and it's important for you to own that, but then not let that necessarily cloud your judgment." Kawaoka said meeting other millionaires, particularly fellow first-generation ones, made him feel less alone. "These people — many of them with seven- and eight-figure net worths — weren't arrogant or flashy," he said. "They were people who had lost money, made it back, learned lessons, and kept moving forward." A great way to meet people is through volunteering and giving back, Cockrell said, but beware the impulse to just give away your money. "Don't just write the check," Cockrell said. "Go pick up a hammer, ladle some soup, get out there and meet people so that it's not just about the money. Barker is still a part-time firefighter, picking up shifts every few months. "I take a lot of ribbing; they'll call me Mr. Millionaire, or ask for business or life advice," he said. Sometimes, giving back can mean treating your lifelong crew. Johnson said she takes about 20 of her long-term friends on a yacht trip around Greece every year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Duolingo's stock cratered 27% on lighter-than-expected guidance as the language learning platform zeroed in on user growth in lieu of near-term monetization. "We have made a slight shift over the last quarter in how we invest, and we're investing a lot more in long-term things because we see that as such a big opportunity ahead of us," CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn told CNBC's Jon Fortt. Duolingo grew paid subscribers to 11.5 million and topped the 11.38 million expected by StreetAccount. But daily and monthly active users came up short at 50.5 million and 135.3 million, respectively. Over the last several months, Duolingo has implemented a slew of new artificial intelligence tools, including an interactive video call feature to try and lure more paying subscribers. The company has also rolled out more language courses in record time with the help of AI. "There are experiments that put monetization and user growth at odds, and part of my job has been, always, arbitrating between these two," von Ahn told CNBC. Over the last few months, he said the company has been "really shifting that trade off to be much more towards user growth." Duolingo's revenues grew 41% during the quarter to $272 million, surpassing the $260 million estimate from analysts polled by LSEG. Net income grew to $292.2 million, or $5.95 per share, up from $23.4 million, or 49 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said net income was helped by a one-time tax income benefit of $222.7 million. KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson downgraded shares sector weight from an overweight rating as the company's focus on long-term product initiatives weighs on near-term growth and valuation. He wrote that "meaningful financial benefits" from these initiatives could take "several quarters" to materialize. We want to hear from you.

Do you know what your job will look like a year from now? EY, one of the top four global accounting and consulting firms, is using AI to help its employees answer those questions. The Big Four firm has developed a training program, known as AI Now 2.0, that acts as a "thought partner" to help its employees foresee how their roles will evolve as a result of AI, Simon Brown, global learning and development leader at EY, told Business Insider in an interview. Staff answer a series of questions about their job, day-to-day responsibilities, and overall deliverables, then upload the answers to EYQ, the firm's internal Chat GPT-like tool. EYQ then generates an analysis of how their current role might change because of the impact of AI, and helps them identify the skills, knowledge, and abilities they might need in the future. The tool isn't trying to predict with certainty what an accounting or consulting role will be in five years' time, said Brown. "It's hard to predict where many of these roles will be in the future, so we are not relying on AI to do that," he said. Instead, it's aimed at helping EY staffers identify how they can better use AI in their current jobs and engage with what to expect from their future path at EY and what skills they'll need to succeed in that, said Brown. Brown said that using the programme is voluntary, but around half of EY's 406,000 global employees have engaged with it, and all new recruits take the training as part of their onboarding process. Developing an enterprise-wide training that could also be personal to each individual has been key, said Brown. AI is already taking on everyday tasks that employees once handled, reshaping the skills employers prize most, and making workforce transformation a priority for HR departments. Upskilling the workforce for AI is even more of a business imperative for consulting leaders — who act as advisors to the world's leading companies and must demonstrate to their clients that their own teams successfully embody the AI expertise they promote. Fellow Big Four firm PwC has designed a program to train employees in managing risks and leadership in the AI era. The program of resources includes "appealing online content, in-person training, hackathons, and game show-style competitions." At KPMG, Niale Cleobury, global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider the firm has tackled the workforce transformation challenge by developing an AI tool that breaks down roles by tasks, thinks about AI use cases, and looks at capacity savings.</p>

The bag is the source of all her entertainment: Loaded with portable activities like crossword puzzles, knitting needles, and watercolor paints, it's a deliberately screen-free way for Campbell to spend her in-between moments. The 31-year-old has dubbed this her "analog bag," and considers it a key weapon in her constant battle against doomscrolling and brain rot. "I firmly believe you cannot live a full life while unknowingly addicted to your phone," Campbell told me. "You might be missing really wonderful opportunities to have a fun and deep life. The analog piece is such a cornerstone of that." When Campbell introduced the analog bag concept to her TikTok followers in August, she said the video's views and likes spiked well beyond her norm. In the two months since, a flock of young women have followed her example, with many showing off their own versions of Campbell's whimsical packing list: Disposable camera? It may seem counterintuitive for a trend that celebrates screen-free life to resonate on TikTok, a platform that feeds on the exact habit these bags are fighting against. Rather, it's part of a wider effort to use modern tools with care and intention — especially during the in-between moments of life, like when you're taking the train to work or waiting for a friend at a restaurant. Too often, these analog bag carriers say, we squander this time by ceding our attention to the algorithm. "My parents would always say, 'Count the cost,' and they were never talking about money," Campbell said. Emily Karst, a 32-year-old school principal in Ohio, saw Campbell's video and instantly felt inspired. She, too, believes the key to using technology is moderation, and was looking for small ways to make that middle ground more attainable. "Sometimes it's because I want to check the time or I need to look at my directions or whatever. But more often, it's because there's been some sort of break in the action, and I've conditioned myself. I'm so uncomfortable being bored that I'm just going to instantly get that dopamine hit and watch a couple of TikToks real quick." "Instead, if there's something else that we can grab," she continued, "it allows us to make a better decision." Since she began carrying her own analog bag, which she loaded with a watercolor kit, "memory collecting" book, and needlepoint set, Karst said the number of times she picks up her phone every day has plummeted. Campbell cites "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg as a major inspiration for the concept of an analog bag. The popular self-help book, published in 2012, argues that replacing one habit with another is more effective than quitting cold turkey. As someone with a self-described "addictive personality," Campbell brings her analog bag everywhere because it ensures that phone alternatives are always within reach; the bag's contents offer easy substitutes when she feels that instinctive itch to pick up her phone, like a cigarette smoker who's trying to cut back might reach instead for a stick of gum. Digital content is designed to be addictive, so Campbell's precautions are carefully considered. She even carries a Polaroid camera so she can interrogate whether she really needs a photo of something, or if it's just going to be snapped and then lost in the cloud, never to be seen again. Plenty of tech insiders and researchers have echoed Campbell's observations. "Most people think they spend two hours a day on their phone," Kendall said. "When we look at the data, it's four and a half. So there's a disconnect between reality and your awareness." Indeed, recent studies have found that heavy consumption of short-form media is bad for your brain — it's linked to anxiety, depression, and shorter attention spans — and that even AI models can deteriorate when exposed to low-quality internet junk. Still, the internet has become embedded in our daily routines and work lives. Being totally offline is a lofty and, for many, unappealing goal. Instead, those who carry analog bags or romanticize their #AnalogLife on TikTok simply strive to be mindful about their screen time — actively choosing when and why to engage with their devices, rather than scrolling mindlessly. "We reach for our phones without really thinking first," Hannah Hofstetter, a 23-year-old healthcare worker based in Alabama, told me. Well, that is the opposite of what's happening." Why had she even picked up her phone in the first place? Now, when she's out with friends and she feels a lull in the conversation, Hofstetter doesn't reach for her phone — she reaches for her handy analog bag and pulls out a stack of Tarot cards. "My first reaction was kind of an 'aha' moment," Hofstetter said.</p>

Roomba once reigned supreme in the world of robotic vacuums, conquering both dirty living room floors with its advanced tech and the marketplace it helped create. The debt-burdened iRobot warned in the filing that if it can't find fresh funding soon, it "may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection." An iRobot spokesperson told Business Insider that, consistent with its policy, it does not comment "on matters of this nature beyond our public disclosures." iRobot first publicly warned investors that there was "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue "as a going concern" in a March earnings report. That same month, the company rolled out a new fleet of Roomba vacuums and mops, which CEO Gary Cohen said was aimed at "better positioning iRobot as the leader in the category that we created." "There can be no assurance that the new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies," the company said at the time. iRobot's current financial position marks a stunning fall for a company that introduced the world to the Roomba vacuum more than two decades ago and has sold over 50 million models globally since. iRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — who had a "vision of making practical robots a reality," the company says on its website. This led to the development of iRobot's PackBot, which was later used in search operations at Manhattan's Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. When iRobot went public in November 2005 at an initial share price of $24, it was already known for its innovative robot vacuums. By 2013, iRobot had sold over 10 million home cleaning robots, vastly outnumbering the more than 5,000 defense and security robots it had delivered to military and civil defense forces worldwide the year before. Over the past decade, iRobot's annual revenue peaked in 2021 at $1.56 billion, but sales have been falling ever since. iRobot — which today slings models ranging in price from $269.99 to as high as $1,299.99 — may have set the standard for home robot vacuums, but competition has surged from Chinese rivals like Dreame, Roborock, and Ecovacs, and other brands like Shark and Samsung. Amazon agreed to buy iRobot in 2022 for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, but the deal fell apart two years later with the companies saying there was "no path to regulatory approval in the European Union." The failed deal was a major blow to iRobot. Angle, iRobot's cofounder and longtime CEO, also stepped down as part of the restructuring. iRobot said in last month's regulatory filing that it had further extended its loan waiver period to December 1 as its financial outlook darkens. "We are currently in discussions with the Lenders to provide the additional capital we require to fund our ongoing business operations," iRobot wrote, adding that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection if the lenders "do not provide this necessary funding and we are unable to find other sources of capital in the near term." Meanwhile, iRobot's shares — priced at $2.70 as of Wednesday's market close — have plunged about 65% year-to-date.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Africa's government says it has received distress calls from 17 citizens who joined mercenary forces fighting in the Russia–Ukraine war, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation into how they were recruited. South Africa's government said on Thursday it has received distress calls from 17 of its citizens who joined mercenary forces fighting in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation into their recruitment. According to Reuters, The men, aged between 20 and 39, are reportedly stranded in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region. Officials said the group contacted South African authorities after finding themselves trapped in combat zones with limited means to return home. Earlier this year, reports emerged that Russia was recruiting citizens from several African nations, including Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and South Africa; to support its war efforts in Ukraine. Bloomberg reported that the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, one of Russia's flagship industrial hubs and a key producer of Shahed-type drones used in combat, was among the main recruiters of foreign labour. The recruitment drive, now under South African investigation, is believed to be part of Moscow's wider efforts to address a labour shortage worsened by demographic decline and wartime mobilisation. Lebogang Zulu, chair of the BRICS Women's Business Alliance in South Africa, told Bloomberg the initiative was designed to “match Russia's labour demand with South Africa's unemployment crisis.” Nearly a third of South Africans are unemployed, with youth and women disproportionately affected. However, links between these placements and Russia's military-industrial complex have raised concerns over potential exploitation. Research by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) alleged that many women recruited through the Alabuga programme were unknowingly assigned to drone assembly plants rather than the construction or hospitality roles they were promised. The Alabuga facility has been targeted several times by Ukrainian forces, including one strike in August, underscoring the risks faced by those working there. South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has confirmed a formal investigation into the recruitment activities. “The government is actively probing reports of foreign programmes that recruit South Africans under false pretences,” DIRCO said in a statement. The latest distress calls from 17 citizens reportedly trapped in Ukraine have intensified scrutiny over these operations and raised questions about Pretoria's prior awareness. Russia's labour market is under severe pressure, with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko estimating a shortage of 4.8 million workers following large-scale mobilisation and population decline. South Africa has maintained a policy of non-alignment in the Russia–Ukraine conflict but now faces growing domestic and international pressure to respond to allegations of recruitment and deception involving its citizens.
