                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Yesterday's 2.35% bounce produced a daily RSI reset but no bullish engulfing candle, unlike prior oversold recoveries on October 10 (5% bounce with bullish engulfing) and early August. Technically, a bull flag is conceivable but weak: overhead resistance remains near $111,000, while immediate support lies under $96,000 (mid-channel low) and approximately $92,000 (October 17 pivot). A break of these levels would likely accelerate bearish sentiment. Ethereum closed below the daily TBO Cloud on Monday, confirming “strong bearish” momentum. A minor RSI reset accompanied yesterday's rally, but daily TBO Support levels—having risen in late September—continue to be sequentially undermined as ETH tracks lower. A decisive breach below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement on this pullback reflects deteriorating technical structure. On the upside, a move above $4,000 would face resistance around $4,100 (daily TBO Fast). The current pattern favors further declines rather than a sustained rebound. Despite this, there are no TBT bearish divergence or TBO Close Long signals on the daily, suggesting stablecoin allocations may keep rising and potentially weigh on crypto asset prices. Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) closed red yesterday following an altcoin-led recovery, with daily RSI forming a lower high—indicating waning BTC strength. A drop below 57% could ensue, potentially reaching lows near 42% over the next 12 months if current trajectories persist. This anticipated BTC.D decline may spur a final “alt season” rally, as traders misinterpret falling dominance as a buy signal—overlooking the growing stablecoin dominance that truly gauges market risk appetite. The total crypto market cap ex-stablecoins (TOTALES) closed green but remains below the daily TBO Cloud (“strong bearish”) with no bullish engulfing pattern, marking this week's dip as a potential setup for shorting overbought tokens. On the 4h chart, TOTAL3ESBTC shows a flattened TBO Slow line, hinting at an early-stage recovery—though traders should await a daily TBO Close Short signal for confirmation. Noteworthy moves in privacy coins (XMR, ZEC, DCR) and dormant utility tokens (DASH, DGB, 1INCH) suggest a narrative-driven rally; yet risk management via profit-taking on interim bounces and DCA remains crucial. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) printed a TBO breakout above historical resistance, which may resemble a topping pattern rather than continuation given its late timing, echoing the early-2021 setup. S&P 500 futures shed their TBT bearish divergence after a modest rebound, though weekly RSI and OBV divergence hint at underlying weakness despite strong cloud support. Gold continues in bearish consolidation within the daily TBO Cloud but is gradually building strength, reflecting broader risk-off dynamics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just a day after its last Ethereum deposit that raised eyebrows across the crypto community, leading investment firm BlackRock has executed another massive offload in Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Thursday, October 6th, renowned on-chain crypto tracking platform Lookonchain announced another major deposit of 4,653 BTC and 57,455 ETH into Coinbase Prime. It is important to note that the move came just 24 hours after BlackRock deposited 34,777 ETH worth approximately $114.97 million into the same Coinbase Prime address. Notably, the repeated transfers — executed in multiple batches of roughly 300 BTC or 10,000 ETH at a time— signal a deliberate institutional positioning, likely an attempt to sell off large portions of its holdings. However, the frequent sell attempts the firm has executed recently have raised questions about whether it is still holding on to its bullish stance. While major Bitcoin funds like BlackRock often move assets to adjust holdings and match inflows or market demand, some commentators believe the firm could simply be providing liquidity for ETF operations rather than exiting its positions. With speculations suggesting that the market may have already concluded its bullish phase, panic selling has spread across the market as investors gradually lose confidence. Thus, BlackRock's suspected sell activity has heightened fear among traders as the market continues to remain in deep red territory. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Call it some air slipping out what might be an AI bubble, or the Fed engineering a tightening in liquidity into a growing economic slowdown, or some combination of the two, but markets are pulling back again on Thursday. Crypto prices — in the unfortunate position these past weeks of being uncorrelated with stocks when they were rising every single day, but perfectly correlated when stocks sell off — are again taking it on the chin. Bitcoin is lower by 3% over the past 24 hours and threatening to tumble back below $100,000. Crypto-related stocks are having an even harder time of it. Robinhood (HOOD) is down 8.5% one day after reporting a sizable earnings beat, in part due to surging crypto trading. Markets continue to reel from the Fed's surprise hawkish pivot last week at which Chairman Jerome Powell threw a big bucket of cold water on the settled-idea that the central bank would cut rates at its December meeting. Powell's sentiments have since been echoed by numerous other Fed members. Worried about flying blind as the government shutdown means no official economic statistics, the central bank might be missing or choosing to ignore what's now become a string of other data pointing to underlying weakness. The latest came Thursday with one of the worst Challenger job layoff reports in more than two decades, along with a troubling outlook from used-car sales bellwether CarMax (KMX). That company's CEO also unexpectedly stepped down — shares are lower by 20%. Folks can carp about deficits and bloated government all they want, but the shutdown means many billions of dollars that would otherwise by flowing through the economy (and markets) are not doing so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's shaky October extended into the first week of November, as the broader outlook for crypto appears to be souring. On Tuesday, Bitcoin's price dipped about 21% since its all-time high last month to roughly $99,000, while other cryptocurrencies fell even more sharply. As of Thursday, Bitcoin slightly recovered to just under $103,000 but is still down roughly 5% in the last week. Ethereum is down roughly 12% to just under $3,372, and Solana is down about 19% to just under $158 during that time. Ethereum and Solana—the most prominent non-Bitcoin currencies known as alt-coins—hit record prices earlier in the year but have come down significantly. That day, exchanges liquidated more than $19 billion in leveraged positions. The flash crash followed Trump's Truth Social post in which he said the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China, “over and above” any tariff they were already paying. “The current weakness reflects a mix of [an ongoing effort by markets to digest] 10/10, slightly more hawkish Fed tone, and a broader risk-off across assets,” said Jasper De Maere, an OTC Trader at Wintermute. Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also affected crypto markets. He said his colleagues had “strongly differing views” about future rate cuts and that, “there's a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle.” In the 24 hours following those comments, Bitcoin and Ethereum dipped about 1.6% and 2%, respectively. a lot of you today pic.twitter.com/YxM5qImeLy— Aubrey Strobel (@aubreystrobel) November 4, 2025 Some analysts also believe that crypto might be struggling for a while, “[Many long-term holders] who adhere to the four-year cycle theory…are selling positions, convinced that we are at or near the cycle top,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Central Bank of West African States is preparing a CBDC pilot. In 2025, stablecoins have largely stolen the limelight from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). However, around the world, central banks are quietly progressing with their various CBDC initiatives. For instance, the Central Bank of West African States is preparing to launch its CBDC pilot in the new year. Starting around 2019, what had previously been a niche interest among payment nerds captured the public imagination. In 2020, China's e-CNY pilot garnered significant media attention. By 2024, digital pounds, euros, and dollars seemed inevitable, with more than 90 central banks in the exploratory stage and 44 live pilots underway. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump slammed CBDCs as a form of government surveillance and vowed to shut down the Fed's digital dollar explorations. Washington's stablecoin push serves as an important corollary to the anti-CBDC movement. While both technologies address calls for currency digitization, stablecoins present a much more immediate reality. By the time more central banks make their move, stablecoins worth trillions of dollars may already be in circulation. With stablecoins dominating the global conversation, CBDC plans appeared to stall. Although some central banks have moved them onto the back burner, they continue to make quiet progress. Central bankers' enthusiasm isn't always matched by political appetite. The same concerns that motivate Trump's anti-CBDC agenda continue to fuel resistance elsewhere. For instance, while the European Central Bank is pressing ahead with plans to launch a digital euro as early as 2029, lawmakers are less convinced. Ongoing pilots and explorations don't mean CBDCs are guaranteed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're a cryptocurrency believer but don't want to bother with cold wallets and crypto exchanges, there's an indirect way to invest in  Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). You can get immediate exposure to Ethereum's price movements with shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN:BMNR) stock. Although it's a relatively new company, Bitmine Immersion Technologies is definitely making waves in the crypto-sphere. The chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies is none other than Thomas “Tom” Lee, a co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and a loud-and-proud Ethereum cheerleader. It's not difficult to summarize the business model of Bitmine Immersion Technologies. The company is an Ethereum treasury company, which is a fancy way of saying that it stockpiles large quantities of Ethereum. Lee's objective for Bitmine Immersion Technologies' is to control 5% of Ethereum's circulating supply. At the company's current rate of Ethereum acquisition, Bitmine Immersion Technologies could easily reach that 5% goal. The company also recently had unencumbered cash holdings totaling $389 million, but that's a drop in the bucket when compared to Bitmine Immersion Technologies' cryptocurrency position. If you prefer to invest in stocks rather than cryptocurrency, BMNR stock is a pretty good proxy for directly owning Ethereum. Holding Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock surely felt good a month ago as the ETH price headed toward $4,750 and looked ready to break above $5,000. In what has been described as a crypto flash crash, the Ethereum price recently pulled back below $3,350. Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock crashed to the $40 area. Lee's calm confidence may feel reassuring, but sensible investors should view Ethereum, and hence BMNR stock, as a speculative asset that's prone to bouts of volatility. A price run-up of this magnitude would certainly help Bitmine Immersion Technologies, as the company reportedly paid $4,037 per ETH token on average. Furthermore, according to 10x Research via Bloomberg, Bitmine Immersion Technologies is “sitting on over $1.3 billion in unrealized losses with no dry powder left.” I already mentioned Bitmine Immersion Technologies' $389 million in cash holdings, which may be considered “dry powder” but that's debatable. When all is said and done, there are too many moving parts to easily predict the future price path of Ethereum. Since Bitmine Immersion Technologies' success or failure depends on how Ethereum performs, only stalwart cryptocurrency optimists should consider owning BMNR stock. It's fine to hope that BMNR stock will reach $100, but bullish Ethereum predictions can only carry so much weight in an often unpredictable cryptocurrency market.

Crypto:

Bitcoin is headed for its worst weekk since March.

Bitcoin is headed for what could be its worst week since early March, with few signs that investors are getting ready to buy the dip after a rout that erased about $300 billion of digital-asset market value. 

The original cryptocurrency has lost 6.2% so far this week, a period in which it dipped below $100,000 for the first time since June. Strategists now point to a range of indicators flashing warning signs for Bitcoin and the broader market. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Partner Content UK GDPR Article 32 mandates "appropriate security measures". The ICO has defined what that means: multi-million-pound fines for password failures. Small, familiar, and happening in your organization right now. Your sysadmin shares SSH keys via WhatsApp in "defnotsshkeys.txt". Your HR manager stores employee ID scans in Gmail. Your intern has admin access because it was easier than configuring permissions. And your former contractor from 2017 still receives reports with client data because his email was never removed from the distribution list. These scenarios range from the simplest to more complex, like misconfigured cloud storage with cascading access rights across departments. But they share a common outcome: this is exactly how cybersecurity breaches happen. And when they do, ICO responds with fines that can cripple businesses. Capita plc just learned this expensive lesson — unsecured AWS buckets and extractable passwords cost them £14 million. The pattern continues across industries: Advanced Computer Software received a £3.07 million fine for incomplete MFA coverage. 23andMe paid £2.31 million after credential stuffing attacks exploited password reuse. Even small firms like DPP Law Ltd faced a £60,000 penalty when a brute-force attack breached an admin account that lacked MFA protection. For larger operations, the exposure scales into millions. Recent ICO enforcement actions under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 show a pattern: password failures cost UK businesses millions. Poor credential management, missing MFA, delayed breach notifications — the same fundamental errors appear across companies of vastly different scales, and the ICO is holding all of them accountable. Attackers exploited an unsecured AWS S3 bucket to gain initial access, then used privilege escalation to move laterally across systems. They extracted unencrypted passwords directly from server memory. The ICO's message was clear: if you're handling data at this scale, there's no excuse for basic authentication failures. Advanced had implemented multi-factor authentication across much of its infrastructure. Attackers found a single customer account without MFA protection and used it as an entry point for a LockBit ransomware attack that disrupted NHS services. The ICO's John Edwards was blunt: "I urge all organisations to ensure that every external connection is secured with MFA today… there is no excuse for leaving any part of your system vulnerable." Threat actors launched a credential stuffing attack, using passwords leaked from other breaches to access 23andMe accounts. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond." Once inside, attackers accessed systems containing personal data for thousands of employees and service users. The breach revealed a critical vulnerability: without centralized credential management, a single compromised password can provide attackers with unrestricted access to the entire infrastructure. Don't assume the ICO only goes after big targets. This small law firm learned that lesson when a brute-force attack compromised an administrator account that had no MFA protection. Credentials are scattered across business infrastructure in ways that would horrify any IT-security officer: Only 23% of UK businesses have a formal incident response plan. You need a system that works with human nature, not against it. Phishing attacks were identified by 85% of breached businesses. Despite 73% of businesses having password policies, adoption of advanced controls remains dismal: just 31% use VPNs for remote access, 30% have user monitoring, and only 29% conduct cyber security risk assessments. A mere 19% provide staff training on cyber security. Most organizations lack systematic credential management – no visibility into access, no secure sharing process, and inadequate offboarding procedures. Password policies exist on paper, but enforcement and monitoring remain the exception. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) official guidance on password security has abandoned complexity theater for something that actually works: three random words. "CoffeeTrainFish" is both memorable and secure — far better than "P@ssw0rd123!" The regulatory message is unambiguous: without MFA on every external connection, you're violating Article 32 of UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, which mandate "appropriate technical and organisational measures." With the ICO wielding fines up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover, "appropriate" has suddenly become very well-defined. Enforcing strong, unique passwords across 50, 500, or 5,000 people without a centralized system? Users will write passwords in notebooks or simply reuse them, because remembering 47 different "three random words" combinations is cognitively impossible. Your security policy will be perfect on paper and worthless in practice. This is where enterprise password management becomes non-negotiable under UK GDPR requirements. But here's the problem the vendors don't advertise: most enterprise password managers are awful to actually use. But they require three-day training sessions, have interfaces designed by people who've never watched a normal human try to log into something under time pressure, and come with support teams that respond in 48-72 hours with links to documentation. So IT departments deploy them, users hate them, and within six months everyone's back to saving passwords in Chrome and sharing credentials via WhatsApp. Effective credential management requires quick implementation and intuitive design for end users, supported by advanced capabilities for technical teams. Regular employees need something that works without a manual. Its features address the specific failures from those ICO cases: role-based access controls prevent the lateral movement that burned Capita, policy enforcement ensures passwords meet NCSC standards, and comprehensive audit logs provide evidence of compliance when the ICO comes asking questions. But the real differentiator is this: Passwork has a high adoption rate because users don't hate it. That matters more than any technical specification, because security that people actively avoid using isn't security at all. (Read The Register's review to see how these factors play out in practice). The ICO has made its position crystal clear: basic password security failures are no longer forgivable. You can't fix this with a strongly worded email about password hygiene. You can't fix it by telling people to be more careful. The statistics show that individual users, left to their own devices, will reuse passwords and choose weak passwords. What you can do is implement systems like Passwork that make secure behavior the default. Centralized password management, role-based access controls, and audit trails aren't nice-to-haves anymore. After Capita, Advanced, and 23andMe, you need to ask whether your business can absorb the financial and reputational damage of a preventable breach.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Founded by a prominent large family from British Columbia, the initiative seeks to address what its creators see as a stagnation in the NFT space, introducing fresh perspectives and community-focused innovation to an asset class poised for resurgence. The origins of the Strategic Crypto Reserve trace back to a multi-generational family based in Vancouver with deep roots in technology, art, and entrepreneurship. “We saw the NFT boom of 2021 as a revolutionary moment where digital art gained real-world value, but it quickly became oversaturated with speculative projects lacking substance,” the patriarch said in an exclusive interview. “Our family believed it was time for new players to step in, ones that prioritize creativity, whimsy, and long-term cultural significance over hype. “The family, which numbers over 20 active members across three generations, drew inspiration from their own experiences in collecting traditional art and memorabilia. Growing up in British Columbia's vibrant creative scene, influenced by the province's natural beauty and indigenous artistic traditions, they envisioned NFTs not just as investments but as digital heirlooms. “But in the NFT world, that whimsy got lost amid rug pulls and celebrity endorsements. We wanted to bring it back, making digital art meaningful again by tying it to real stories and communities.” Among the key family members driving the vision is Dark Underlord, a tech-savvy relative known for innovative blockchain ideas, who contributed to the platform's core architecture. Launched after two years of development, the Strategic Crypto Reserve platform offers a curated marketplace for NFTs that emphasize originality and narrative depth. The site, accessible at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca, also includes educational resources for newcomers, demystifying NFTs and highlighting their potential as stable digital assets. As traditional markets face volatility from inflation, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty, digital assets like NFTs offer diversification with unique advantages. “NFTs aren't just JPEGs; they're verifiable ownership of intellectual property in a borderless economy,” noted a financial analyst from the University of British Columbia, who consulted on the project after working the sociological ramifications of returning emails. “With blockchain ensuring transparency and immutability, holding NFTs can provide a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, much like gold or real estate in previous eras. First, the maturation of Web3 infrastructure has reduced barriers to entry, with lower gas fees on networks like Ethereum and Polygon making transactions more affordable. Second, institutional adoption is rising: Major corporations, from sportswear giants to coffee chains, have integrated NFTs into loyalty programs, signaling mainstream acceptance. Third, the scarcity model inherent in NFTs—limited editions backed by smart contracts—creates intrinsic value, especially for collectibles with cultural resonance. Historical data shows that blue-chip NFT collections have appreciated significantly over time, outperforming some stock indices during bull markets. “By focusing on whimsical, story-driven art, we're creating assets that hold emotional and financial value. Imagine passing down a digital family portrait that's also an appreciating investment. They've also support BC-based charities, pledging a portion of proceeds to political causes, aligning with the province's sustainability ethos. Challenges remain in the NFT space, including regulatory scrutiny and environmental concerns over blockchain energy use. “For families like ours, this is about legacy—digital art that endures. Investors eyeing the next wave of digital innovation may find NFTs, particularly those with whimsical appeal, as compelling holdings. “In an increasingly virtual world, owning a piece of digital culture is akin to holding shares in the future of creativity,” the analyst added. The Strategic Crypto Reserve invites artists, collectors, and investors to explore its offerings at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca. With its family-founded roots and forward-looking vision, SCR positions itself as a beacon for meaningful NFT revival.</p>

Africa's largest currency union will pilot a retail central bank digital currency in early 2026, pressing on with a centralised strategy even as momentum shifts increasingly in favour of stablecoins as an alternative. 

“We are at the proof of concept [stage] now, and after that we will move to the pilot stage,” Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, governor of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), told The Banker, with the pilot due to begin in the new year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital currencies have long carried both promise and controversy, hailed as a breakthrough for financial independence yet criticized for their heavy toll on the planet. Now, a project is looking to change how cryptocurrency operates in a world increasingly defined by climate awareness. As detailed by the International Business Times, entrepreneur John Ortmann and his team introduced bitcoin.ℏ in 2024 as a sustainable alternative designed for the next generation of eco-conscious investors. Built on the Hedera Hashgraph network instead of a traditional blockchain, bitcoin.ℏ processes transactions quickly without the massive energy demands that have defined early cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. One of the most resource-intensive cryptocurrencies used 154.9 billion kilowatt-hours in 2013 alone, more than the annual energy use of 167 countries combined. Ortmann's team designed bitcoin.ℏ with this goal in mind. Instead, it is overseen by institutions around the world, which provides added credibility and transparency. Its hashgraph consensus algorithm allows thousands of transactions per second while maintaining security through a "gossip about gossip" protocol and virtual voting. While many cryptocurrencies fluctuate in price depending on network activity, bitcoin.ℏ maintains a fixed translation fee of just $0.001. Though its name echoes the original bitcoin, Ortmann stressed that bitcoin.ℏ is not "associated with any cryptos that still rely on the energy-consuming PoW method." He described it as "common sense cryptocurrency," per the Times. As the crypto industry addresses its environmental issues, bitcoin.ℏ shows that digital currencies can combine efficiency, transparency, and predictable costs while reducing their impact on the planet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He made this statement during a time when the world's most prominent digital currency has repeatedly fallen below $100,000, but has managed to quickly recover, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. Bitcoin prices reached a fresh, all-time high of more than $126,000 early last month, but have declined close to 20% since then. As the digital currency trades near $100,000, market observers have identified several key levels of support, areas where a concentration of buy orders could either slow or stop the digital asset's descent. Going forward, “It would be most constructive if BTC held the zone between 101k and 103k,” said William Noble, an independent crypto analyst, through emailed comments. Interestingly enough, several other market observers mentioned the $98,000 when identifying levels of key support. “Bitcoin is consolidating after a sharp pullback from the $110,000 area, and traders are watching to see whether it can hold key support near $98,000–$100,000,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, stated via email. Several other analysts who offered input for this article also highlighted key price levels to watch should current support fail. Enneking also shed some light on what could happen if support near $100,000 fails to hold up. “Looking lower, there is some support at $94k, but if that breaks, BTC will probably fall to the mid-80s. “For the record, I don't see us testing any of those levels,” Enneking emphasized. “A sustained move above $105,000 would suggest renewed momentum, with resistance around $110,000–$112,000 as the next major hurdle,” said DiPasquale. Aguilar offered a similar take, stating that “The upper resistance level stands at low $105k, followed by high $106k, then mid $108k.” Enneking also weighed in, specifying that “Moving up, BTC will face strong resistance at $107k, $112k, $116k and $123k.” Brickell highlighted some similar levels, stating that “On the upside, a recovery above $107,000 would remove immediate downside pressure, while a sustained break above the $115,000–$117,000 region would put new all-time highs back into view.”</p>

The Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC) brings together leading infrastructure providers to enable frictionless, compliant transactions across networks and borders, laying the foundation for a unified global payments system, for businesses and consumers alike. Stellar has facilitated billions in payments, proving blockchain's ability to move value efficiently at scale. The Blockchain Payments Consortium represents a critical step forward in maturing our industry.

Raja Chakravorti, Chief Business Officer, Stellar Development Foundation Our mission is to define safe, common standards that can shape better payment experiences for everyone. BPC will define a common framework that enhances blockchain transactions with data requirements of traditional payments. We will act as a bridge between blockchain ecosystems, regulators, and traditional financial institutions — offering a consistent, interoperable framework to enhance compliance across jurisdictions. Together, we can lay the foundation for blockchain payments to operate on a global scale: fast, trusted, and truly interoperable.</p>
