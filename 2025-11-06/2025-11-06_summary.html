The detention of Sami Hamdi “is about silencing political dissent to create a chilling effect,” his wife wrote.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) taunted the wife of a British journalist who is being detained by immigration agents on social media on Wednesday, after she publicly urged her husband's release and warned that he was suffering a health emergency in custody.

U.K. journalist Sami Hamdi, a 35-year-old father of three and outspoken critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza, was residing in the U.S. on a travel visa when he was abducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at San Francisco International Airport on October 26. His wife, Soumaya Hamdi, only found out he was being detained after a friend sent her a text message about DHS bragging about the abduction on social media. 

In an interview with The Independent published Monday, Soumaya Hamdi said she was deeply concerned about her husband's health and the conditions he was being subjected to in detention.

“He called me on Saturday and I could barely hear him on the phone,” she told the publication. “He was clearly struggling to speak properly and he said: ‘Soumaya, I'm in a lot of pain. I've been asking for hours to see a doctor. They haven't brought me one. I need you to help me find a way to help me see a doctor.'”

After calls to the British consulate and pressure from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which is providing the family legal representation, Sam Hamdi was finally examined and told he may have a severe case of gastroenteritis. 

In addition to that ailment, the journalist is living in a “very overcrowded” space, sharing a room with around 80 to 90 people, Soumaya Hamdi said. 

Earlier this week, Soumaya Hamdi wrote an op-ed for USA Today, demanding her husband's release and condemning DHS and ICE for violating his speech rights.

Wrote Soumaya Hamdi:

Sami was on a routine speaking tour in the United States when he was arrested — after a far-right social media influencer pressured the Trump administration to revoke his visa. Days later, in an act as unconscionable as it was surreal, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed on social media, of all places, that it had answered the call, as though this were a perfectly ordinary course of action.

“Why are they keeping him against his will? Why are American taxpayers funding Sami's arbitrary detention when they could be used to support American citizens instead — at a time when the American government has been shut down and millions of children risk going hungry by losing their food aid?” she went on, stating that Sami Hamdi's “abduction by ICE is not merely an immigration issue; it is about silencing political dissent to create a chilling effect.”

Soumaya Hamdi concluded her op-ed by asking the U.S. government to release her husband “immediately,” and to “reaffirm that America's strength lies in defending freedom of speech, not silencing it.”

In response, the official account for DHS shared a screenshot of her op-ed on X, baselessly accusing Sami of being a “terrorist sympathizer” for his opposition to Israel's genocide and saying that the U.S. had “no obligation” to host individuals “who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.”

“[DHS Sec. Kristi Noem] has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-American and anti-Semitic violence and terrorism — think again,” the account added.

DHS has not provided any evidence for their allegations, and Hamdi has not been formally charged with any crime. His detention comes as the Trump administration is cracking down on anyone who voices opposition to Israel's genocide; among the people detained have been Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested and faced deportation for writing an op-ed in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and former student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained and nearly deported for leading protests at Columbia University.

            It's the smoking gun behind the most spectacular heist this side of the Millennium.
    


            A French court released a report Thursday slamming the leadership of the Louvre for its focus on headline-grabbing purchases and renovation projects over maintaining the security of on of the world's largest museums.
    


            The audacious daytime robbery, which saw four men walk away with priceless historic jewellery, was a “deafening alarm signal,” Pierre Moscovici, president of the Court of Accounts, which authored the report, told journalists Thursday.
    


            Echoing the report, which was commissioned before the October 19 heist, he said that the museum leadership had prioritized “visible and attractive” projects, like art purchases and revamping the museum layout at the detriment, notably, of the Louvre's security .
    


            Since the heist, information has resurfaced showing that  gaps in security appear to have been known for years – including a 2014 warning that alleged one of the museum's key passwords was simply “LOUVRE.” The new report only adds to a number of security failings exposed by the heist.
    


            So what went wrong?
    


            Within four minutes of arriving at the outside wall of the Louvre, the thieves had scaled the building and were breaking through a window. Only then were internal alarms triggered. Four minutes later, after breaking into a reinforced case and grabbing nine pieces of historic jewelry, the thieves were making their escape.
    


            “The weaknesses of the protection of our perimeter are known and identified,” Louvre director Laurence des Cars told lawmakers after the heist.
    


            Internally too, the situation seems stark.
    


            For the Louvre's 465 museum galleries, security staff had only 432 CCTV cameras to monitor the interior in 2024, according to the report. While that's a nearly 50% increase on the number available in 2019, it still left 61% of the galleries without any CCTV coverage.
    


            The world's largest museum, the Louvre covers some 652,300 square feet.
    


            In comparison, the Detroit Institute of Arts boasts a similar footprint (including a theatre and recital hall) but has over 550 CCTV cameras, according to camera manufacturer Axis.
    


            Des Cars told French senators that she envisions a doubling of the number of cameras within the 37-hectare Louvre property in the years to come.
    


            In its recommendations, the Court of Accounts' report stressed the need for the Louvre to “strengthen its internal control function, which remains underdeveloped for an institution the size of the Louvre.”
    


            The holes in the Louvre's security weren't all physical. In the virtual realm its track record left much to be desired.
    


            A 2014 report from the French information security agency (ANSSI) seen by French daily Liberation claimed that the password for the server managing the museums' sprawling CCTV network was simply “LOUVRE.” Access to software managed by the security technology company Thales was protected by a similarly foolproof password: “THALES” – according to Liberation.
    


            In the security audit, ANSSI reportedly recommended the Louvre boost its cyber security as well as move away from outdated software that could jeopardize its protective stance.
    


            ANSSI did not deny the report to CNN but added that the audit, “cannot be considered representative of the current level of security” of the Louvre's IT systems.
    


            The report focused on the museum's budgetary priorities in recent years, which saw some 27 million euros ($31.1 million) spent on maintenance works between 2018 and 2024, with a further 60 million on restoration of the Louvre palace.
    


            In contrast, that period saw the Louvre splash double that figure on altering the museum layout and buying up artworks.
    


            The museum spent 105 million euros on artworks in the six years to 2024, sweeping up 2,754 pieces in that time.
    


            In 2021, the Louvre spent some 5 million euros on two works by French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In April 2025, the Louvre made a 2.2-million euro purchase of an “exceptional” Fabergé triptych.
    


            Many of the Louvre's purchases are clouded in a certain secrecy, particularly regarding the purchase price. The Court of Accounts' report said the Louvre should pay greater attention to the price of acquired works and specifically warned the museum against buying art works at a higher price if they were sold at auction for less than two years prior.
    


            In contrast to the focus on glitzy, eye-catching purchases, the damning report notes astonishing delays to work on the Louvre's security infrastructure.  Recommended security upgrades from a 2015 audit still won't be completed until 2032, it revealed.
    


            The report examined nearly eight years of museum operations across periods helmed by two executives.
    


            At the time of publication, no executives (or other staff) have been fired or resigned over the theft.
    


            The offer of des Cars to resign as museum director was not accepted by French Culture Minister Rachida Dati.
    


            Dati – known as something of a political bulldog in France – has aggressively defended the Louvre since the embarrassment of the October 19 heist.
    


            “Did the Louvre Museum's security measures fail? No, they didn't. It's a fact. The Louvre Museum's security measures worked,” she told lawmakers on October 21.
    


            The following day, Macron requested an acceleration of improved security measures at the museum.
    


            The following week, Dati had softened her tone, admitting to French senators that although installed security systems had functioned and staff had followed protocol “to the letter,” the “spectacular theft” was obviously a failure for the museum.
    


            “Security failures did indeed occur,” she said.

            A Ukrainian court has found a Russian soldier guilty of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war in a January 2024 incident and sentenced him to life in prison, in the first ruling of its kind.
    


            Dmitriy Kurashov, 27, was convicted by a court in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia for shooting dead a Ukrainian soldier who had just surrendered to his unit.
    


            According to Ukraine's security service, Kurashov had previously served time in a Russian prison for theft, and in November 2023, he signed a contract with the Russian defense ministry in exchange for amnesty.
    


            The court found Kurashov guilty of firing on the Ukrainian soldier at point blank range during an attack in the vicinity of the village of Pryiutne in the Zaporizhzhia region on January 6, 2024.
    


            The soldier  had already surrendered during the battle after running out of ammunition, the security service said. According to the prosecutor, the Ukrainian came out of a dugout unarmed, raised his hands and clearly indicated his surrender. At the request of the Russian soldier, he knelt down, but was shot with an automatic weapon and died on the spot.
    


            In a separate case, a Russian soldier who had been accused of robbing a house in the village of Blystavitsy in the Bucha district of the Kyiv region in March 2022 was found not guilty. This ruling was based on a lack of evidence.
    


            Kurashov's sentencing is unprecedented, marking the first time a Russian soldier has been jailed for killing a captured Ukrainian since the start of the war.
    


            Kyiv says many Ukrainian prisoners of war have been killed by Russia's forces, but there have so far been no legal ramifications.
    


            Earlier this year, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office said it had, as of May 5, opened 75 criminal investigations into the suspected executions of 268 Ukrainian prisoners of war.
    


            It said the number of alleged executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war has been rising, with eight cases involving 57 soldiers in 2022, eight cases involving 11 soldiers in 2023, 39 cases with 149 soldiers in 2024, and 20 cases up to May 5 this year, with 51 soldiers.

Focus shifts to other states where Trump is pushing for redrawn districts as parties race to seize midterm advantage

California voters overwhelmingly approved a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year's midterm elections. Now, the focus will shift to other states, where Trump is pressuring Republican-led legislatures to redraw their districts. Democrats are racing to do the same in an all-out sprint to rejigger district lines ahead of next year's midterms.

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans passed a map that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress. The new California map neuters that effort by adding the same number of Democratic seats.

Republicans currently hold a razor-thin 219-214 majority in the US House. There is one Republican vacancy and one Democratic one.

Republicans in North Carolina and Missouri have already passed new maps that would add one Republican congressional district apiece in each state. In Missouri, however, a citizen-led initiative could block the new map from going into effect in 2026.

Democrats are poised to wipe out those gains by passing a new congressional map in Virginia, where they expanded their majority in the state legislature on Tuesday. That effort could add two to three more Democratic seats. After a court struck down Utah's congressional map for violating state constitutional provisions prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. Lawmakers put a new plan in place, which is still awaiting court approval, that added two competitive districts Democrats could win.

In Ohio, lawmakers were required to redraw the state's map this year because they could not pass a bipartisan plan after the 2020 census. In a somewhat surprising move, Republicans and Democrats on the redistricting commission reached a bipartisan compromise that put one Democrat in a competitive seat, and made one Democratic district much more Republican-friendly. There is an outside shot both Democrats could hang on to their seats next year, according to the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan and well-respected election analysis website.

Trump is also strongly pressuring Republicans in Indiana to redraw their map to target two Democratic seats in the state. The legislature is set to meet in December to consider redistricting, though it's unclear if Republicans have the votes to do so. Chris LaCivita, a co-manager of Trump's 2024 campaign, recently set up an outside group designed to pressure lawmakers on redistricting. “Now the real fun begins,” he posted on X.

In Kansas, a Republican effort to get rid of a Democratic district has also stalled as Republicans have failed to muster the votes for a special session on redistricting.

Republicans may still be able to pick up a significant number of seats in Florida. The GOP-controlled legislature has already convened a committee to work on the issue, and a state supreme court ruling earlier this year could give lawmakers more leeway to dismantle existing districts. A provision in the state constitution prohibits drawing districts for explicitly partisan reasons.

Beyond those states, the redistricting path forward remains unclear in many places. Democrats are not uniformly on board with scorched-earth tactics to redraw maps and gain every possible advantage in the redistricting wars. In Maryland, the Democratic president of the state senate, Bill Ferguson, said he opposed a redistricting effort to get rid of Maryland's lone Republican seat, saying it was too risky and could result in a court-ordered map that might be friendlier to Republicans than the one currently in place. Ferguson tweeted that Democratic wins in Virginia on Tuesday were evidence that Democrats could win without redistricting.

This drew a testy rebuke from L Louise Lucas, the president of the Virginia senate. “Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points. Grow a pair and stand up to this President. This is just embarassing [sic],” she posted on X on Wednesday.

The Maryland governor, Wes Moore, has also announced an advisory commission to gather input on maps. Any potential map would still have to go through the Maryland legislature. Democrats in Illinois are also tepid on redrawing their map to add more Democratic seats.

Beyond those states, there is still much uncertainty about the redistricting landscape before next year's midterms.

Democrats are suing over maps in New York and Wisconsin in hopes of having courts force those states to redraw districts to add more Democratic districts. It's unclear if those lawsuits will succeed at all or if they will force any action ahead of the midterm elections.

The US supreme court is considering whether to scrap a critical provision of the Voting Rights Act that protects the ability of minority voters to elect the candidate of their choice when certain conditions are met. It's unclear if the court will rule in time for the midterms, but getting rid of that protection could enable Republicans to gain about a dozen seats, according to a New York Times analysis.

Kevin Roberts, whose group pushed Project 2025, had defended ex-Fox News host's talk with Nick Fuentes

The leader of the conservative thinktank behind Project 2025 apologized for supporting a white nationalist amid turmoil on the right over the mainstreaming of extremist ideology, but is resisting calls to resign.

Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, previously defended the former Fox host Tucker Carlson for having Hitler fan Nick Fuentes on his podcast without pushing back on his white supremacist views.

In leaked footage of a Heritage town hall from Wednesday, staffers largely said Roberts's decision to align the thinktank with Fuentes was a mistake. “I made a mistake and I let you down and I let down this institution. Period. Full Stop,” he told Heritage staff.

He also claimed he “didn't know much” about Fuentes before he recorded a video and posted it on X in which he defended Carlson as a “close friend of the Heritage Foundation”. He said that a chief of staff, who has since resigned, wrote the video's script.

Some called for him to step down. Roberts, who holds a PhD in history and spearheaded the rightwing manifesto Project 2025, has moved the foundation into more of a Trumpian stance since he joined in 2021.

He has said he will not resign his position, writing on X: “I'm staying. I'm all in.”

The Washington Post reports that “at least” five members of an antisemitism taskforce at the organization have resigned in protest. One staffer in the internal meeting called the issue her “final straw”.

Roberts previously called those speaking out against Carlson a “venomous coalition”, a loaded phrase he subsequently said was a “terrible choice of words” that caused “justified concern” among those who worry about rising antisemitism.

Fuentes – who used to be ostracized by the mainstream right for his views, including support of Hitler and claims that Jews run the country – said on Carlson's podcast that “organized Jewry” held outsize influence and said he was a fan of Joseph Stalin. Fuentes's appearance on Carlson's podcast has roiled the right, with many seeing the interview as a further invitation of extremist views into mainstream conservatism.

Roberts said that, while supporting Carlson, he disagreed with and even “abhors” Fuentes's views. .

Roberts then wrote a detailed post on X explaining the depths of Fuentes's extremist views.

“Fuentes made grotesque analogies to try to cast doubt on the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust and has said ‘I think the Holocaust is exaggerated. I don't hate Hitler,'” Roberts wrote. “Fuentes called for the death penalty for ‘perfidious Jews' and other non-Christians, stating that ‘when we take power, they need to be given the death penalty.'

“Everyone has the responsibility to speak up against the scourge of antisemitism, no matter the messenger. Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging,” he said in a video posted on X.

During the Q&A portion of Wednesday's town hall, a longtime Heritage staffer identified by the Washington Free Beacon as Robert Rector recalled the conservative writer William F Buckley Jr's boundaries for the conservative movement: expunge all antisemitism and “expel the lunatics”.

“And we have them back now,” Rector said. “The issue here is Tucker Carlson … Tucker's show is like stepping into a lunatic asylum.”

A full video of the internal town hall was leaked to the press. Some at Heritage have said the culture of infighting and leaking to media has eroded people's ability to have difficult conversations.

Roberts has sought to cast the turmoil as a needed conversation: “Movements like ours are not weakened by adversity. We are sharpened by it. Let's take what we've learned. Let's recommit and, by all means, let's go win.”

I 've been an organizer for half of my life now. What a strange thing to write.

I've been involved with struggles to abolish the death penalty, worked to kick racists and war criminals off campuses, to fund and expand abortion access, to form unions and strike committees; I've slept on concrete during youth rebellions, navigated supporting criminalized survivors of gender based violence, taught people how to reverse overdoses and test their drugs, built peer education amongst sex workers toward decriminalizing our labor, organized too many vigils for fallen comrades, gotten arrested symbolically and against all my best efforts, and liberated resources from institutional spaces and moved them to community as often as I could. I've done more, but I shouldn't put it in writing (and neither should you, lesson one). 

May this find you grounded in community and living your values, even as your survival, your labor, and your basic needs are vilified, exploited, or criminalized. For some of us, these are all too familiar conditions. For people organizing within the sex trades, or whose harm reduction work occurs outside the law, public scorn and carceral violence come with the territory. As someone who has done (and continues to do) movement work within these spheres, I want to share some thoughts, and lessons I've learned, with people who are trying to do the work of collective survival in these environments. If you are not a sex worker or involved in harm reduction work, you may also have something to learn from people whose political work often occurs outside the law (or in direct opposition to it). As authoritarianism tightens its grip, more and more people are going to face criminalization upon choosing to organize as workers, resist unjust policies, or practice mutual aid. If you are grappling with the difficulties that come with this kind of work, here's what I can share.

I cannot stress enough how crucial it is to have a small, tight-knit crew you call your chosen political family. These can be people you actively organize with, or used to, or maybe you're all involved in different projects now, maybe you met at the club, clinic or on the stroll, but these are your people who know you, trust you, are conflict brave, and can gut check you. You've engaged in political education together, you have shared values, and you have experience — these are qualities that are earned and grown collectively. There are no substitutes for these kinds of relationships. Lots of people will tell you what to do; these are the people whose advice you should consider first and foremost. 

That being said, it is the criminality of the work that I need to focus on. Or at least the impact of criminalization on our waged work, our organizing work — our political work (because all labor is politicized). 

Unlearn the language of “good,” “innocent,” or “wrongfully.” This is not just a rhetorical shift, but a shift in values. Let go of any preconceived notions you had about “criminals.” In fact, let me officially welcome you to the criminal class. Divorcing oneself from respectability politics can be hard, especially when there are so many barriers to resources when you're perceived as criminal or charged as such. There are no “good ones,” there are only people, fellow workers, co-strugglers. Innocence is irrelevant because the laws have already betrayed us. And it is my belief that no one should be caged, tortured, detained, or deported by the state — all carceral violence is done wrongfully. We cannot pick and choose who rightfully and wrongfully experiences the hell of carcerality. If we do this, we are affirming the very system that seeks to kill us. 

You must commit to unapologetic politics. It might be tempting to give into something we call the whorearchy — or the hierarchical stratification of sex working/trading people whose perceived value or worth is ranked based upon the associated stigma of their particular form of sex work (i.e., “I'm better than them because I work indoors instead of on the street”, or “I don't deserve to be arrested because I'm paying for school, not drugs”). Whorearchy exists because of classism, colorism, substance stigma, racism, xenophobia, transmisogyny, ableism and other forms of discriminatory, oppressive ideologies. But whorearchy thrives because of the criminalization and stigma of the sex trades. There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. When building a broad coalition, and involving people who have feminist and abolitionist politics, make sure you're not so quick to win them that you abandon your lived experiences for respectability. Remember, those elites in power don't actually care if you pander to them now, if your existence threatens their agenda, they will never honor your humanity, no matter how “good” and “respectable” you try to be. Remain illegible and unruly. 

Skill up as many people as you know, now. Your skill shares do not need to be large or public or perfect. They just need to happen thoughtfully, carefully, and often. Refreshing your own skill sets on gunshot wound care, overdose reversal, rescue breathing, needle cleaning/disposal, learning the right quantities of misoprostol and mifepristone, and testing drugs for fentanyl and xylazine is a priority. Getting people together in person to build safer sniffing kits, and gather other harm reduction supplies, creates social community opportunities to check-in on each other, engage in risk and movement assessments collectively, and share advice on using and caring for our comrades who use drugs. There is no substitute for off-line, in-person conversations about strategy, tactics, and navigating work outside of the law. It is both urgent and patient work. 

Urgent in that these are timely skills that more of us need to learn and practice, especially since the majority of people will still call 911 even though they may be scared of the potential for police violence. Often this comes down to a lack of self-trust and lack of knowledge on how to intervene without the state in an emergency situation. When you're a sex worker, and your client or fellow worker overdoses, you need to be able to act swiftly and without state intervention whenever possible. Remember, you don't need to reinvent the wheel, radical harm reductionists and sex workers have been making toolkits, zines, and DIY guides for decades. Find what speaks to you, and use it as a template, build from something that already exists and fact check it with trusted friends. It's patient work because new skills may need to be acquired, language and practices change with new knowledge, and because people will say some really upsetting and problematic shit to you about drug use. I'm so sorry but they will. Even the comrades who you think should know better. You can't see through everyone's journey, focus on the skills, recommit to a politics of solidarity and care. It's hard work doing peer to peer education, it can be draining, and you'll need to ask for help, a lot. Take a deep breath, you've got this. 

There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. 

Be discerning, and figure out who's in the room. There's practicing safer communication (what I used to call security culture before the term was wrecked, and the concept debased) and then there's becoming obsessive and gate-keeping. What I'm expressly advocating, especially within criminalized workplace contexts, is moving things offline whenever possible. Learn how to assess risks as an individual within a formation, and collectively for the formation as a whole. Technology will change, adapt, and entrap. Work only with platforms that have clear terms of service that aren't already committed to throwing you under the bus, or expressly work with platforms that are built by community-minded people. We often can't control how we make money, or what platform consolidation means. But when it comes to our organizing work, we can opt in and out of using tools that don't serve us. We can also control what we do and don't say and to who. This is critical — you have to move at the speed of trust. That will likely feel slower than you desire to act. You've got to get to a place where trust, collaboration, and safer outcomes for your communities are prioritized instead of appearing to have all the answers on the internet, jeopardizing your own safety to respond to every direct service ask, or inflating your organization's numbers too rapidly. 

Yes, it will present new challenges and there will be learning curves, but an emphasis on safer communication means talking to the people you are directly organizing with, regularly — checking in on materials, assessing needs and risks, outlining safer methods to trade sex or obtain substances, discussing the political landscape in real terms, and making space to do visioning work beyond immediate crisis-related tasks. If you are doing work outside of the law, you cannot do this on a zoom call with 90 people who you do not know. You also cannot do this at a large general membership meeting of an organization that's open to the public. It will mean you have to repeat yourself, schedule more meetings, and develop an ear for infiltration. Some of these skills feel intuitive, but I promise, if you and your crew are paying attention, they can be learned, practiced and modified for your own needs. 

Sex workers, and really all workers in criminalized economies, have gotten really good at developing new languages, code switching, and sharing information to keep each other safe by getting creative and working both within and against the repressive laws and their enforcement of any given generation. You're being hoisted onto the shoulders of some tough, resourceful worker-organizers. You too will build and experiment with new tech, new skills, new tactics. Something that remains, however, is how you embody your politics and values. Don't let people shut sex workers and drug users out of spaces you find yourself working in —  speak up, point to the outlaw legacies of harm reduction and mutual care, be bold in your comradeship. 

Remember you're not alone — like Eugene Debs said, “While there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

For Kherson journalist Yevheniia Virlych, “difficult” doesn't begin to describe day-to-day life in her city — “critical” is closer to the mark. So when American actress Angelina Jolie visited Kherson on Nov. 5, she and other local residents began to hope the world might finally look closer at how Russia is terrorizing them.

“Thanks to the fact that a star of truly global stature — someone with influence and media recognition — has seen the city's realities firsthand, Kherson residents received a ray of hope: maybe Angelina Jolie can use her influence to help the city somehow,” Virlich told the Kyiv Independent.

If Jolie continues to speak out about what she witnessed in the front-line city firsthand, that could help with the delivery of relief aid, according to Virlich and others.

On Nov. 5, Jolie traveled with the UK-based Legacy of War Foundation to Ukraine's front-line Kherson and Mykolaiv regions in the south, visiting schools and hospitals that have been forced underground to continue functioning despite constant Russian attacks.

Jolie's visit caused a stir not only in Kherson but across Ukraine, with people eager to learn more about the reasons behind her visit to one of the most dangerous parts of the country.

There was also speculation after a Ukrainian man in Jolie's entourage was reportedly detained by military enlistment officers, but local media confirmed that the man, a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue.

The situation in Kherson has remained fraught since the earliest days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces captured most of Kherson Oblast, including its capital, in the early spring of 2022, occupying it until a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive forced their retreat later that November.

While the city of Kherson was liberated from Russian occupation, the Dnipro River now marks a tense front line for the region, dividing Ukrainian-controlled territory on the western bank from Russian-occupied areas to the east.

Day-to-day life in Kherson unfolds under constant threat with Russian forces positioned just across the river. Kherson faces more than relentless shelling, though — Russian forces are increasingly using FPV drones to hunt civilians in what they call a “human safari.”

“Every month, we have dozens of civilians killed and hundreds wounded. Residential buildings, hospitals, museums, ambulances, and rescue workers have all become targets for almost every kind of weapon,” local historian Dementii Belii told the Kyiv Independent.

“Lately, Russian forces have also been trying to block the only main highway that brings food, goods, and people into Kherson. Kherson residents live in these nightmarish conditions every day.”

Given the dangers of visiting Kherson today, Jolie's trip meant a lot more than words of support from afar for some locals — in a country where even safer areas can feel distant from their reality, it reminded them that they were not alone.

“Many people in Kherson feel that the authorities, society, and even Ukraine have forgotten them — that no one is paying attention to the city's suffering and the citizens' problems. These thoughts undermine people's strength and their hope for survival,” Belii said.

“That's why people here deeply respect the courage of Angelina Jolie, because she was not afraid to come under bombs and shelling to support the people of Kherson.”

Experts and civil rights advocates are denouncing Trump's biometric power grab.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A proposed change to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule could impose “biological sex” DNA testing on millions of immigrants and Americans as part of the Department's mass biometric surveillance program — which also includes retinal scans, voice capture, and more.

In addition to the obvious human rights violations posed by the changes — which, among other things, would amend policy to allow children to be targeted by biometric surveillance — it would put a target on the back of trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming people, as well as women and trans people of color, citizens and non-citizens alike.

“Under this proposed rule, DHS may also require, request, or accept raw DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or DNA test results, which include a partial DNA profile, as evidence of genetic relationship, to determine eligibility for immigration and naturalization benefits or to perform any other functions necessary for administering and enforcing immigration and naturalization laws,” the proposal reads. “Where evidence of a relationship is required, this rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results (which include a partial DNA profile) from relevant parties such as applicants, petitioners, derivatives, dependents, and beneficiaries, to prove or disprove the existence of a claimed, or unclaimed, genetic relationship or biological sex.”

For example, it says, “DHS may request DNA evidence to prove or disprove an individual's biological sex in instances where that determination will impact benefit eligibility.”

The policy as proposed doesn't have many safeguards for privacy or constitutionality — the government can retain someone's DNA profile indefinitely. It could further be weaponized to deny bids for immigration or asylum, out trans and intersex women being held in detention (who may not even know they are intersex otherwise), and track individuals in perpetuity through “continuous vetting.”

The DHS claims these changes will enable immigration officials to perform more thorough background checks, prevent fraud, and enforce immigration and naturalization laws. But it's not only new arrivals that could be forcibly subjected to this treatment — longtime residents, naturalized citizens, and the families and sponsors of immigrants may also have to submit to sex tests.

Alejandra Caraballo, an instructor at Harvard's cyber law program who has also provided legal aid to trans immigrants, called the initiative “dystopian.” When paired with troubling innovations in surveillance tech and attempts to criminalize trans people's very existence, she says, the devastating potential of this rule, if finalized, cannot be overstated.

“You can create a digital Panopticon,” Caraballo said.

There is a 60-day public comment period ahead of any formal implementation.

The policy in question falls under the guidelines for the Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It's a revitalized version of a 2020 proposal from Donald Trump's first term empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to launch dragnet surveillance campaigns.

That original bid was struck down by the Biden Administration before it could take effect, but Trump 2.0 brought it back with added provisions greenlighting sex testing via buccal swab — in other words, testing the chromosomal composition of DNA in a person's saliva.

These biometrics can be used to trace and quash dissent, surveil marginalized communities, and add massive obstacles to trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people entering the country, including asylum seekers who may be fleeing gender-based violence abroad. If you can't prove you're a “biological woman” to the White House's liking, then your ability to file for relief under, say, the Violence Against Women Act, may become more difficult.

Depending on a variety of factors, such as a person's country of origin, this kind of sex testing can cost a small fortune. Not to mention the implications of such a policy ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles — if the U.S. government can grant or deny visa requests based on its own unscientific and inexact definitions of “biological sex,” then it can functionally control who gets to compete. And we know from decades of sports scandals that sex testing is also weaponized against cisgender women, and disproportionately, women of color. Think: Imane Khelif, Caster Semenya, or one of the eight women who suddenly found out they were intersex during sex testing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, likely ending their athletics careers.

Even before the DHS added the new sex testing provision, countless medical groups, politicians, legal scholars, and human rights organizations decried Trump's biometric powergrab. During the public comment process for the 2020 version of the policy, the American Medical Association argued that authorities lack “the capability to collect and process DNA at the appropriate scientific level to ensure evidence-based standards,” and that it further robs women and children fleeing violence of “informed, non-coercive consent.”

Meanwhile, The National Center for Lesbian Rights chimed in that the rule tramples privacy rights and “empowers mass and unprecedented surveillance” of the LGBTQ community. And the Congressional Committee on Homeland Security said the rule would increase the already staggering backlog of immigrant applicants under the DHS while endangering the personal data of millions.

“Like any authoritarian regime, they want control over the population, and they feel like they need control over the identification of every single person, in a multitude of ways, so that they can be tracked,” Caraballo told Erin in the Morning. “There's no more anonymity.”

US government shutdown blamed for cuts from Friday, two weeks before busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period

US politics live – latest updates

New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines.

The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation's largest airports.

The Federal Administration Agency has said flights are being reduced to maintain safety during the ongoing federal government shutdown, now the longest recorded and with no sign of a resolution between Republicans and Democrats to end the federal budget standoff, now in its 37th day. 
  Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be canceled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium.

The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the US – including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be affected.

The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. The flights affected by these reductions are scheduled during the hours of 6am to 10pm.

The likely airspace shutdown comes two weeks before the Thanksgiving holiday – typically the busiest travel period of the year – and raises pressures on lawmakers to reach a deal to end the shutdown.

Air traffic controllers, already in short supply, have been working unpaid since 1 October, with many working mandatory overtime and others taking second jobs, according to Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, who said the cuts would be to “alleviate the pressure”.

“Many of the controllers said, ‘A lot of us can navigate missing one paycheck. Not everybody, but a lot of us can. None of us can manage missing two paychecks,'” Duffy said on Wednesday. He accused Democrats of being responsible for any “mass chaos” that ensues even though the shutdown is the result of both Republicans and Democrats refusing to agree to a deal.

In a statement, American Airlines said most customers would be unaffected and long-haul international travel would remain as scheduled, and that customers could change their flight or request a refund. “In the meantime, we continue to urge leaders in Washington to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown,” the statement said, adding thanks to “to the air traffic controllers, TSA officers, CBP officers and other federal employees who are working right now without pay”.

The agency's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is responsible for the scheduling and safety of more than 44,000 flights and more than 3 million airline passengers daily across more than 29m square miles of airspace.

The government shutdown has left shortages of up to 3,000 air traffic controllers, according to the administration, in addition to at least 11,000 more receiving zero wages despite being categorized as essential workers.

Bryan Bedford, the FAA administrator, said the flight reductions are intended to keep the airspace safe during the shutdown.

“I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” Bedford said. “We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.

“Our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. Reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations. This is not based on light airline travel locations. This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure,” Bedford added.

Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association president and CEO, said in a statement that the government shutdown was “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the US air travel experience”.

Aviation expert John Nance told ABC that regulators were “probably trying to do their best” to prevent any reduction in the margins of safety. “We're facing the potential of almost a shutdown of the national airspace … You cannot continue to operate this in a way that ignores the diminution of safety. This is an incredibly serious situation.”

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center. The figure, which is probably an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

During weekends from 1 January to 30 September, the average number of airport towers, regional control centers and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began, the average more than tripled, to 26.2 facilities.

The airports affected by flight cuts cover more than two dozen states and include the busiest ones across the U.S.MARK FELIX/AFP/Getty Images

Airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago along with hubs across the U.S. are among the 40 that will see flights cut starting Friday due to the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines and obtained by The Associated Press.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that it would reduce air traffic by 10 per cent across 40 “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the ongoing government shutdown.

The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the U.S. – including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be affected.

The FAA is imposing the flight reductions to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the government shutdown and have been increasingly calling off work.

Controllers already have missed one full paycheque and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as the shutdown drags on.

The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers.

Passengers should start to be notified about cancellations Thursday. Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice.

United Airlines said it would focus the cuts on smaller regional routes that use smaller planes like 737s. United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly – even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable.

The head of Frontier Airlines recommended that travellers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded.

U.S. to reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 ‘high-volume' markets due to government shutdown

Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be cancelled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

“I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” Bedford said Wednesday. “We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”

Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Most work mandatory overtime six days a week, leaving little time for side jobs to help cover bills and other expenses unless they call out.

Mounting staffing pressures are forcing the agency to act, Bedford said.

“We can't ignore it,” he said, adding that even if the shutdown ends before Friday, the FAA wouldn't automatically resume normal operations until staffing improves and stabilizes.

Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that they would meet with airline executives to figure out how to safely implement the reductions.

Major airlines, aviation unions and the broader travel industry have been urging Congress to end the shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest on record.

The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system and “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience,” said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement.

Duffy warned on Tuesday that there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paycheque next week.

Explainer: Why has the U.S. government shut down? Here's what to know

Duffy said some controllers can get by missing one paycheque, but not two or more. And he has said some controllers are even struggling to pay for transportation to work.

Staffing can run short both in regional control centres that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don't always lead to flight disruptions. Throughout October, flight delays caused by staffing problems had been largely isolated and temporary.

But the past weekend brought some of the worst staffing issues since the start of the shutdown.

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

During weekends from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional control centres and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began, the average more than tripled to 26.2 facilities.

TC Energy TRP-T missed estimates for third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by weakness in the pipeline operator's U.S. operations and in its power and energy solutions business.

AI-driven power demand, industrial applications and LNG exports are driving up natural gas consumption, yet price pressures and competition from coal remain ongoing market challenges.

U.S. natural gas futures fell over 4 per cent sequentially, extending a decline that began in the second quarter after snapping four consecutive quarters of gains.

The drop in prices weighed on TC Energy's transport volumes.

Net income from the company's U.S. natural gas pipelines, its largest segment, fell to $801-million in the third quarter, from $1.3-billion a year ago.

Adjusted core profit in the power and energy solutions business was $266-million in the quarter, down 18.4 per cent from a year ago.

However, its Canadian natural gas pipelines saw adjusted core earnings rise to $913-million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $845-million a year ago.

Climate activists say B.C. needs to conduct new assessment for natural gas pipeline

The company operates a 58,100 mile-long network of pipelines, supplying more than 30 per cent of the clean-burning natural gas consumed daily across North America.

The company expects adjusted core profit for 2026 to be in the range of US$11.6-billion to US$11.8-billion, nearly 6 per cent to 8 per cent growth year-over-year.

It also anticipates 2028 core profit to be in the range of US$12.6-billion to US$13.1-billion, representing a 5 per cent to 7 per cent annual growth rate between 2025 and 2028.

On an adjusted basis, the Calgary-based company earned 77 Canadian cents per share for the three months, compared with analysts' average expectation of 80 Canadian cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Canadian Natural Resources CNQ-T on Thursday posted quarterly earnings that narrowly beat analysts' estimates, as record oil and gas production helped offset a decline in crude prices.

The country's oil sands producers, including Canadian Natural Resources, have shown resilience during the global oil industry downturn, buoyed by years of investment that have made them among the lowest-cost operators in North America.

Quarterly production jumped about 19 per cent from a year earlier to a record 1.62 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), driven by both acquisitions and strong operational performance.

The Calgary-based company raised its 2025 production guidance to between 1.56 million and 1.58 million boepd from a prior range of 1.51 million to 1.55 million boepd, citing newly integrated assets and stable field performance.

Following its asset swap with Shell Canada SHEL-N on Nov. 1, Canadian Natural now fully owns and operates the Albian oil sands mines and associated reserves, and holds an 80-per-cent non-operated stake in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest facilities.

The deal adds about 31,000 barrels per day of low-decline bitumen output, further strengthening its oil sands business.

The company kept its annual capital budget steady at about $5.9-billion.

While weaker Western Canadian Select differentials and maintenance work have tempered margins at times, Canadian producers remain well-positioned heading into 2026 with disciplined capital spending.

For Canadian Natural, realized price of exploration and production liquids fell 8.3 per cent in the reported quarter to $72.57 per barrel.

The quarter included a $700-million charge related to updated cost estimates for its Ninian and T-Block assets in the North Sea.

On an adjusted profit of 86 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of 85 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Ukrainian forces continue to stubbornly defend the pocket around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, despite relentless Russian assaults in and around the two cities, leading to an ever-increasing threat of encirclement. 

Over two weeks since Russian soldiers were filmed breaking into the urban area of the mining city in Donetsk Oblast en masse, the city has descended into a deep gray zone, in which the concept of territorial control is lost in a fog of chaotic movement. 

"The situation hasn't changed that much in Pokrovsk," a Ukrainian drone pilot fighting in the area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Kyiv Independent.

"It's a mess, with a bunch of our soldiers and a bunch of bastards and all of them mixed together."

With more and more Russian forces flowing into Pokrovsk, after Ukrainian lines on the southern outskirts of the city quickly disintegrated, reversing the situation with large-scale clearing operations looks to be an increasingly impossible task.

Meanwhile, for the neighboring industrial city of Myrnohrad, which the brigades deployed that have continued to hold despite an ever-worsening logistical nightmare, the threat of encirclement has only increased.

As of Nov. 6, most of the urban area of Pokrovsk remains in a contested "gray zone" according to most open-source battlefield maps, including the Deep State map, widely trusted in Ukraine. 

Although both the gray zone and the areas assessed as firmly under Russian control have expanded over the past week, Ukrainian positions are still present inside the city, intermixing and overlapping with streets and buildings taken by Russian soldiers.

Ultimately, because of the nature of the fight in the city, talk of an encirclement of Pokrovsk itself is inaccurate, Deep State co-founder Roman Pohorilyi, said.

"Logistics are the most important thing here, because they are what defines an encirclement, which bloggers and analysts try to determine," he said.

"But in reality, Pokrovsk is simply being absorbed; enemy soldiers are seeping in and setting up positions."

As Russia's small assault and infiltration groups continue to move north through Pokrovsk and beyond, the lack of a stable Ukrainian line of defense makes Ukrainian drone teams increasingly vulnerable to being assaulted and caught in firefights themselves. 

This, said the drone pilot, disrupts their ability to focus on their own work, which is crucial for maintaining the kill zone that slows, if not stops, Russian advances. 

The Ukrainian defense is also hampered by Russian drone strikes on logistics further back in the rear, with dozens of drone teams from Russia's elite Rubicon school deployed to the front-line hotspot.

"Thirty days ago, at an intersection on our way to positions, there was only one of our destroyed cars there, close to the enemy," Artem Fysun, a member of the Peaky Blinders drone unit, redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in summer, told the Kyiv Independent.

"When I left the position, there were up to a dozen of our cars; in such a short period of time, in less than a month, the enemy has already destroyed a significant amount of our equipment."

With winter and the cooldown of fighting that will likely come with it just around the corner, the battle of Pokrovsk has taken on a clear political significance, with both Ukraine and Russia keen to round off the year's campaign with a major success story. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin's premature claim on Oct. 29 that Pokrovsk — as well as Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast — was already surrounded by Russian forces of the importance placed on the capture of Pokrovsk by Moscow.

Meanwhile, as he has done with front-line flashpoints throughout the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Ukrainian commanders in the Pokrovsk area entrenched the "fortress" mentality that had characterized the defenses of other Donetsk Oblast cities, especially Bakhmut and Avdiivka. 

But just like with those cities, the near-encirclement of the Pokrovsk pocket by Russian forces has also led to sharp criticism within Ukraine of the decision to defend the city at all costs.

"If someone does not sign an order to withdraw troops from Pokrovsk and Myrnhohrad in the near future, we may find ourselves in a situation where we will not only lose a significant number of highly motivated paratroopers and marines," journalist and volunteer Vitalii Deineha, co-founder of the Come Back Alive fund, wrote on Facebook.

"We may find ourselves in a situation where there is no one to patch the hole in the front, and the fortifications dug in our rear will quickly fall to the enemy."

With less than five kilometers of drone-infested fields north of Pokrovsk left connecting Myrnohrad and the surrounding area, logistics into the pocket has become increasingly fraught.

One Ukrainian battalion commander, who also spoke to the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity due to the unsanctioned nature of his comments, said that during recent rotations, his infantrymen came into direct firefights with Russian soldiers on several occasions. 

According to the commander, the density of Russian drones and mines is so high in the area that no vehicles are able to pass through the corridor, and even unmanned ground vehicles — often used in such conditions — usually don't survive the trip.

On top of the political importance attached by Kyiv to holding Pokrovsk, the reluctance to save lives by ordering a timely withdrawal is linked to the systemic culture of "not one step back," commonly associated with the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.

This, together with the associated problem of false reporting of tactical developments up the command chain, threaten to facilitate an optimistic narrative among the military and political leadership while the situation continues to deteriorate on the ground. 

"The reports of the General Staff sent upwards are made up of more and more lies every day," Deineha wrote. 

"In fact, we have practically lost Pokrovsk, which means that there is no point in holding Myrnohrad either. We must acknowledge this, and work to save those who refuse to leave without an order."

For as long as the Russian pincers fail to properly close, the Pokrovsk pocket — i.e. Myrnohrad and the surrounding area — continues to hold.

In the meantime, on top of the visits of Zelensky and Syrskyi to the front, Ukrainian forces have carried out a couple of flashy operations to let the nation know that the fight is not lost. 

On Oct. 31, reportedly under the personal command of General Kyrylo Budanov, Ukrainian special forces of the country's military intelligence (HUR) landed a Black Hawk helicopter under cover of darkness near Pokrovsk.

Further details of the mission, from its objective to its outcome, were not disclosed, but at the scale the landing carried out at — reportedly two special forces platoons — it was not a force capable of clearing a large urban area like Pokrovsk.

The next week on Nov. 6, the Skelia Assault Regiment, one of the largest units of the controversial new Assault Forces, published a video showing the planting of the Ukrainian flag above the city council building of the city.

Typical of a practice of "flag-raising" carried out by both sides along Ukraine's increasingly porous front line, the mission, while proving briefly that central Pokrovsk was not fully under Russian control, is a far cry from any evidence of a successful Ukrainian clearing of the city.

Hi, this is Francis Farrell, cheers for reading this article. Things are really tough on the front lines at the moment, as illusions of peace talks fade and Russian drones fly further and further past the front line. It's also getting a lot more dangerous for journalists, but while large foreign media outlets have stopped going, we will continue to work everyday to bring the battlefield to you. Please consider supporting our reporting.

            A palliative nurse was convicted on Wednesday of the murder of 10 patients with lethal injections and the attempted murder of 27 others and was handed a life sentence by a German court.
    


            Prosecutors had argued that the nurse injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives to ease his workload at night.
    


            The crime was found to be particularly severe, said a spokesperson for the court in Aachen, meaning the nurse has little chance of being released after 15 years, the minimum time that can be served for a life sentence in Germany.
    


            The nurse committed the crimes between December 2023 and May 2024 in a clinic near Aachen in western Germany.
    


            The verdict can be appealed.
    


            Investigators are looking at several other suspicious incidents during the nurse's career, German media reported.
    


            In the worst killing spree in Germany's post-war history, a former nurse was jailed in 2019 for life for murdering 85 of his patients.

MOSCOW, November 6. /TASS/. Russia responds to Trump's statements about resuming nuclear tests by signaling it may do the same; Canada moves forward with legislation to seize Russia's sovereign assets; and Russia and the US see surge in trade under Trump. These stories topped Thursday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

At a meeting of the Security Council on Wednesday, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin drew President Vladimir Putin's attention to the statement made by US President Donald Trump on October 30, in which Trump instructed the Pentagon to "immediately" prepare for conducting nuclear tests so as not to fall behind China and Russia. A discussion ensued, ending with Putin ordering that the issue of a potential US resumption of nuclear weapons testing be examined and analyzed. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that if the US resumes nuclear testing, it will pave the way for Russia, China, and others to do the same, seriously weakening global non-proliferation efforts. Russia, for its part, has indicated that it won't just stand pat amid the US moves.

Hearing the statements coming out of Washington, the Russian authorities feel they need to show that they are ready to act symmetrically, research fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Alexander Ermakov told the newspaper. The length of time it would take Russia to prepare for nuclear tests depends on the condition of the test site, which is not publicly disclosed. However, most likely, the timeframe would be several months.

If Washington resumes nuclear testing first, it will effectively give Moscow, Beijing, and other states the go-ahead to follow suit, Director of the Center for Military-Economic Studies at the Institute of Global Military Economics and Strategy Prokhor Tebin told Vedomosti. If that happens, it would be a serious blow to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and to international security. "All the more so since the Russian side is demonstrating that, in practice, everything needed for testing is already in place," he added.

Russia is currently signaling its willingness to up the nuclear ante, but it should be noted that it's the US that sent things in this direction, Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics Dmitry Suslov believes.

According to the expert, there are two ways the United States could go now that Russia has made its position clear. The first and more reasonable option would be to accept Russia's proposal to maintain for another year the quantitative limits outlined in the New START Treaty, refrain from escalatory steps such as resuming nuclear testing or conducting exercises simulating preemptive strikes against Russia, and instead begin a dialogue on arms limitation and strategic stability under new conditions. The second path, Suslov continued, is escalatory: rejecting Russia's proposal, issuing unfounded accusations of alleged covert nuclear testing by Russia and China, and resuming US nuclear tests.

 

The Canadian Senate is officially considering a bill on the seizure of Russia's sovereign assets, Russian Ambassador to Ottawa Oleg Stepanov told Izvestia. According to him, Canada will continue coordinating its approach with Brussels and may share its legislative blueprint for asset confiscation. Within the European Union, there is no consensus on using Russian assets to fund a loan to Ukraine, with Belgium, France, and Italy opposing the measure. In the coming days, representatives of the European Commission intend to turn Belgium, while the other EU nations have been given two options by Brussels: confiscate Russia's assets or fund Kiev out of their own national budgets. Russia has already prepared a package of countermeasures should the decision to confiscate assets be adopted, Stepanov emphasized.

"Canada is leading the charge on the issue of confiscating Russian assets and is itself able to share what it comes up with with the Europeans. In particular, it has devised unilateral legal mechanisms through domestic legislation that allow it to seize foreign private property. At present, the Canadian Senate has resumed consideration of the bill on seizing sovereign funds. Ottawa will undoubtedly continue coordinating its approach with Brussels," the diplomat told Izvestia.

"There should be no particular difficulties in moving such a legislative initiative through both houses of the Canadian parliament. This is more of a technical procedural matter. It now depends on the political decision of Prime Minister Mark Carney's government," Evgeny Khoroshilov, head of the Economic Research Department at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Izvestia.

Georgy Ostapkovich, Director of the Center for Market Research at the Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge at the Higher School of Economics, told Izvestia that, so far, the only country to take specific steps toward confiscation has been Estonia. However, the consequences of Canada adopting such a law would be significant.

"This would lead to lawsuits that will drag on for years. Moreover, Russia will almost certainly take reciprocal measures," the expert explained.

Ostapkovich believes that while the formal confiscation of the assets themselves is still unlikely, their return is also improbable for at least the next ten years. "The West will delay that moment, using the interest generated by these funds," he said.

 

Trade between the United States and Russia could double under Donald Trump's administration to $6-8 bln, according to experts interviewed by Izvestia. In the first half of 2025 alone, bilateral turnover increased by nearly one-third, reaching $2.8 bln. The primary reason is the United States' active purchases of Russian fertilizers, enriched uranium, and platinum. Nevertheless, mutual trade with Washington still remains low compared with Russia's other key partners, including China and the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition, the situation is complicated by new US sanctions targeting Russian oil companies.

Overall, Trump's election has brought a moderate sense of optimism to US-Russian relations, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Economics of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia Sergey Zaynullin told Izvestia. In particular, during the first half of 2025, bilateral trade hit $2.8 bln, a relatively modest amount, but still a notable one-third uptick. Most of that amount, $2.5 bln, consists of Russian exports to the United States, the expert noted.

Still, the specialists interviewed by Izvestia expect that by the end of 2025, the volume of trade will grow by 1.5-2 times to $6-8 bln. This expansion could be driven by US purchases of Russian-made fertilizers, enriched uranium, and platinum, Senior Analyst at AMarkets Igor Rastorguev noted. Some experts offered more conservative estimates: according to Freedom Finance Global analyst Vladimir Chernov, turnover may reach $4.8-5.6 bln. Meanwhile, independent expert Andrey Barkhota believes the figure will be in the range of $6.3-6.8 bln.

Meanwhile, the Russian ruble has strengthened by nearly 20% over the past year. On November 2, 2024, the dollar was trading at 97.4 rubles. Fast forward to the beginning of November this year and it was significantly lower at around 80.9 rubles per dollar, according to the Bank of Russia's exchange rate. One factor behind this fluctuation has been political signals from Washington. According to analysts interviewed by Izvestia, the dollar may trade at roughly 85-88 rubles by year's end.

At the same time, the United States' foreign economic strategy of trade wars and sanctions continues to negatively affect Russia, Acting Chair of the Department of Global Financial Markets and FinTech at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics Svetlana Frumina told the newspaper. According to her, increasing trade barriers and expanding export controls are reshaping trade flows and creating less favorable conditions for Russian exports.

 

In its latest report, the European Commission again noted progress made by Ukraine toward its goal of joining the European Union, including the adoption of plans to ensure key principles and the rule of law. In reality, however, Kiev has continued to disregard these declared principles, which has caused dysfunction within the Ukrainian judicial system, as acknowledged by domestic analysts, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Brussels is painting a pretty picture in order to maintain an overall favorable narrative, though it recognizes that Ukraine's EU accession is still decades away, experts emphasized.

In its report, the European Commission stated that, along with other candidate countries such as Moldova, Montenegro, and Albania, Ukraine had made the most progress in reforms over the past year. The Ukrainian government has declared its intention to complete accession negotiations with the EU by the end of 2028. Yet achieving this ambitious goal will require accelerating reforms in fundamental areas, particularly concerning the rule of law, the Commission indicated.

"It is clear that for the leadership of the European Commission, it is important today to ensure at least the appearance of support for Ukraine by a majority of EU member states. To do that, the talk needs to stay positive - for example, regarding the prospects of future enlargement," Professor at the Department of European Studies at the Faculty of International Relations of St. Petersburg State University Stanislav Tkachenko told the newspaper.

Meanwhile, in a statement posted on social media on Wednesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban once again reminded that decisions regarding EU enlargement can only be made with the consent of all member states. Budapest will not support Ukraine's accession to the EU, he said, because doing so would risk bringing the military conflict with Russia onto European territory.

Amid all this, US President Donald Trump could move Hungary off its position, that is, if he wants to, analysts at the US think tank Atlantic Council suggested. They noted that during his upcoming visit to Washington, Orban will likely attempt to secure exemptions from recently introduced US sanctions on Russian oil companies. Trump could use this as leverage to press Orban to stop blocking Ukraine's accession process, the analysts suggested.

However, Tkachenko believes that Trump is unlikely to exert pressure on Budapest to support any EU-backed plans. Rather, the US president will likely acknowledge the legitimacy of Orban's request, given that the Hungarian leader represents pro-Trump forces in Europe, which are now on the rise.

 

After two years of voluntary output cuts under the OPEC+ framework, Russia's oil production is recovering, Kommersant writes. Analysts forecast that by the end of 2025 it will return to a level close to last year's - exceeding 9.5 mln barrels per day. However, due to slowing global demand and the potential for declining oil prices, the prospects for production growth in 2026 remain uncertain.

According to a report by Euler analysts, Russia's oil output in 2025 will exceed 9.5 mln barrels per day (bpd), which is close to the previous year's figure. In their assessment, output in the second half of the year will increase by 5.3%, or 322,000 bpd, compared with the first half, due to the lifting of voluntary OPEC+ restrictions. As a result, the average production volume will remain at last year's level.

In 2026, Euler estimates that if all voluntary OPEC+ limits are removed, Russia's production could reach 9.7 mln bpd. The main risks, analysts warned, stem from a sharp drop in oil prices caused by weakening demand and, consequently, renewed supply constraints imposed by OPEC+.

According to energy expert Kirill Rodionov, one of the factors limiting production growth is the structure of Russia's well stock: unlike the Middle East, Russia has a relatively small share of free-flowing wells capable of rapidly increasing output. Maxim Malkov, partner at Kept, added that the marginal cost of producing an additional barrel often rises, forcing producers to focus on cost optimization and profitability rather than expanding volumes.

Managing Partner at Kasatkin Consulting Dmitry Kasatkin estimates that Russia retains the potential to increase production by 1 mln bpd in 2026, despite constraining factors such as increasingly challenging extraction conditions, oil prices, the ruble exchange rate, the Bank of Russia's key rate, and labor shortages. He noted that competitive production costs remain a key advantage that allows Russia to offset these limitations. According to his forecast, in 2026 Russian oil will likely maintain a discount of around $10 to Brent, with Urals trading in the range of $55-65 per barrel.

Natalie Jamison, senior wealth advisor at ScotiaMcLeod, uses her podcast to teach financial literacy to young people and combat the influence of unlicensed ‘finfluencers.'Supplied

In the Behind the Advice series, Globe Advisor asks advisors about their relationship with money from a young age, lessons learned over the years and how their experiences influence the advice they give to clients. We've also launched a Behind the Advice podcast – find all the episodes here.

Natalie Jamison, senior wealth advisor at ScotiaMcLeod, a division of Scotia Capital Inc., in Oakville, Ont., talks about growing up with a stockbroker dad, getting an inheritance at age 10, and why she went from being a hotelier to an advisor:

Describe your upbringing.

I was born in Toronto and raised in Montreal. My mom, originally from France, wanted my sister and me to have a more immersive French experience. She worked in administration at Air France and Swissair, which meant we could travel for free a lot. It sparked my lifelong love of travel. 

My dad, a stockbroker-turned-wealth manager, had the greatest influence on my career path. He was adamant that my sister and I learn to manage money. I remember him teaching me how to read stock market quotes in the newspaper when I was a kid. 

What was your experience with money growing up?

My father's income was steady, but it fluctuated month to month. We could always sense when it had been a strong commission period or when things were a little tighter. 

I have a very precise memory of Black Monday in 1987, when my dad came home and talked about whether he'd earn any money for the next month. As a kid, that really sticks with you. But he always budgeted and set aside cash for a rainy day, so we didn't panic because we knew we had a fallback. 

My dad taught me that true financial stability doesn't come from how much you earn, but from how well you manage it. Budgeting wisely and setting aside cash for a rainy day are core values I still live by.

Describe your first money lesson.

When I was 10, my great-grandmother left me $5,000 in her will, which was a lot of money back then, and especially for someone my age. I remember my dad asking me if I trusted him to safeguard it until I was older. I said yes, mostly because I was young and didn't know any better, but I'll never forget how that question made me feel. He was saying, ‘This money belongs to you, and you'll decide what to do with it when the time comes.' That was very empowering. 

I earmarked the money for my education. However, I did use a little bit of it to make my first investment when I was 13. I bought shares of Canadian Pacific Railway. At the time, the company owned many of Canada's iconic hotels, including the Banff Springs Hotel, the Château Frontenac in Quebec and the Royal York Hotel in Toronto. 

I remember my dad making a lesson out of it. He took me to the Royal York, and as we walked through the lobby, he said: ‘You own a piece of this.' After that first purchase, I was hooked, especially when the dividend cheques started arriving every three months. 

What did you want to be when you grew up, and how did you get into financial services?

I wanted to be a hotelier and attended a Swiss hospitality business school. I was fortunate to work at renowned properties such as the Beau-Rivage Palace, Montreux Palace, Swissôtel, Sheraton Centre and Park Plaza Hotel. During that time, I met my husband, who was also in hospitality management. 

After we got married, we realized quickly that our careers posed challenges for raising a young family, as hotels never close and we were always on call. I asked my dad if I could transfer my skills to the financial services sector. He agreed but made it clear that I needed to get hired on my own merit. 

So, I interviewed with Richardson Greenshields in 1996 and landed my first job cold-calling prospective investors. After gaining the right credentials, I worked alongside my father for 21 years before starting my own wealth advisory business.

What's the biggest money mistake you've made, and what did you learn from it?

Not signing up for the company stock purchase plan once I became eligible to participate. I missed out on so many free bank shares and dividend reinvestments. Now, when a new team member is onboarded, I make sure they sign up as soon as they can. 

What are you best at when it comes to your own finances? 

Ignoring the noise and buying when others are fearful. I've lived through several major stock market corrections, including the 1998 Asian financial crisis, the dot-com collapse in 2000, the 2008 global financial crisis and the global pandemic in 2020. I've learned to use those moments as opportunities.

What do you worry about when it comes to money, both personally and in the industry?

I'm most worried about the next generation receiving their wealth advice from unlicensed ‘finfluencers.' I think it's why I spend so much time teaching financial literacy to young people, including through my #FinancialFriday podcast. 

It came about after my daughter told me she found it boring to learn about finances at the dinner table. She suggested I create short podcasts she can listen to instead. So, being a good mom and a wealth advisor, that's what I did.

What advice do you have for someone who wants to enter your business?

This is a relationship business. It's about creating client experiences, building trust and delivering exceptional service. You don't just need a finance degree to be a successful advisor; you also need a certain degree of soft skills and emotional quotient. It's a vocation.

Latest: 'She wasn't afraid of the bombs' — Kherson locals in awe over Angelina Jolie's visit

American actress Angelina Jolie visited medical staff, families, and volunteers in Kherson and Mykolaiv, the Legacy of War Foundation confirmed on Nov. 6.

During her visit, Jolie was shown how medical and educational institutions in Ukraine's southern front-line regions have been moved into reinforced underground spaces to continue their operations, according to a press release from the organization.

Jolie was also shown how netting has been placed above a number of roads in an effort to protect locals from near-daily targeting in Russian drone attacks. 

"The people of Mykolaiv and Kherson live with danger every day, but they refuse to give in. At a time when governments around the world are turning their backs on the protection of civilians, their strength, and their support for each other is humbling," Jolie said in a statement released by the Legacy of War Foundation.

"After nearly (four) years of conflict, exhaustion is visible, yet so too is determination. Families want safety, peace, and the chance to rebuild their lives. Diplomacy and the protection of civilians should not be allowed to fall away in a brutal contest of weapons and technology."

The actress previously visited Ukraine in the spring of 2022.

Reports circulated that during Jolie's visit, a Ukrainian man from her entourage was detained by military enlistment officers.

Local outlet MykVisti confirmed with the regional military recruitment office in Mykolaiv that Jolie visited the premises. MykVisti added that a man traveling with Jolie, being a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue.

Those living in Ukraine's south have endured some of the deadliest Russian attacks in the nearly four years of full-scale war.

Kherson Oblast has been a front-line region since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian forces captured the regional capital, Kherson, in March 2022, but Ukrainian troops liberated the city later that year. 

Parts of the oblast remain under Russian occupation, and the civilian population of Kherson continues to face daily deadly attacks.

Russian rebel group 'Freedom of Russia' sabotages dozens of locomotives targeting the logistics infrastructure of the Russian military, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Nov. 6.

Around 40% of Ukraine's roughly $98 billion budget is covered by foreign support. Looking ahead to 2026, Kyiv is short of approximately $19 billion in partner financing to keep the country's finances in order.

A court in Ukraine has sentenced a Russian soldier to life imprisonment for executing a captured Ukrainian serviceman in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on Nov. 6.



The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) is also investigating Zelensky's former partner Timur Mindich on suspicion of aiding the aggressor state, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak. 

During her visit, Jolie was shown how medical and educational institutions in Ukraine's southern front-line regions have been moved into reinforced underground spaces to continue their operations, according to a press release from the organization.

The move aims to protect Bulgaria's only refinery — and a major supplier — from the impact of U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. 

"Seventeen men were lured into joining mercenary forces," the South African Presidency said.



Ukraine's military reportedly struck and damaged Russia's Volgograd oil refinery overnight on Nov. 6, Russian Telegram media channels reported, as explosions rocked several Russian energy sites.

Unmanned Systems Forces leader Madyar described the strike as the result of a "painstaking months-long reconnaissance operation" in a post on Telegram.


Trump's comments come days after Finnish President Alexander Stubb suggested a possible meeting between the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. at the summit.

It is the first time Brussels Airport has closed due to drone activity. More drones were also spotted near Belgium's Kleine Brogel Air Base, which houses F-16 fighter jets. 



The Orion was set to be Russia's flagship unmanned vehicle until that position was usurped by Iranian-designed Shaheds.

            Typhoon Kalmaegi made landfall in central Vietnam late Thursday after killing more than 100 people in the Philippines and cutting a path of destruction.
    


            Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons on record to hit Vietnam, was expected to bring heavy rainfall to an area already saturated by heavy rains last week, raising fears of flash floods as well as damaging winds.
    


            It left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines this week, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 114 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.
    


            The typhoon strengthened as it barrelled towards the coast of Vietnam Thursday, carrying maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed.
    


            Scientists have long warned the human-induced climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.
    


            In the Philippines, survivors have begun the mammoth task of salvaging belongings and digging through the thick mud and debris of their destroyed homes, as the receding floodwaters expose widespread devastation.
    


            Another tropical storm Fung-Wong – or Uwan locally – is expected to intensify and could become a dangerous Category 3 or 4 over the weekend, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, threatening more flooding and damage to the northern portions of the Philippines' Luzon Island.
    


            Here's what to know:
    


            The scale of the disaster in the hardest-hit Cebu province and surrounding areas took residents and local officials by surprise.
    


            Drone footage showed catastrophic flooding that turned streets into rivers, submerged homes and overturned cars as Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, dumped more than a month's worth of rain in only 24 hours in some areas.
    


            In Talisay city, rows of homes were flattened and communities along the Mananga River were buried in mud and debris. In Cebu city, and rescue workers could be seen wading through waist-deep water to free trapped residents from roofs and submerged homes.
    


            “We don't have any home anymore. We weren't able to salvage anything from our house,” Mely Saberon, 52, from Talisay told Reuters news agency. “We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons, but this one was different. Our homes were gone.”
    


            Another survivor in Cebu city said the floodwaters “quickly rushed in” and they had no time to gather belongings.
    


            “I've been living here for almost 16 years and it was the first time I've experienced the flooding,” said Marlon Enriquez, 58.
    


            Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday declared a state of national calamity and promised to continued relief and response operations.
    


            The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons and Kalmaegi was the 20th named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.
    


            Though not the strongest storm to hit, it was slow-moving and dumped huge volumes of water over highly populated areas. Officials said most people died from drowning.
    


            Nearby Leyte and northern parts of Mindanao, both populous islands in the center of the country, saw between 150 and 250 mm (6 to 10 inches) of rain in only 24 hours — well above the typical monthly rainfall for November.
    


            On Cebu, the rugged terrain funnelled water straight into communities that lack sufficient drainage.
    


            “Wind speed is often what the public focuses on and it is in fact how meteorologists categorize these systems, but water is almost always the no. 1 killer,” said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.
    


            The impact of the storm was worsened by clogged waterways in an already flood-prone area, and an apparent lack of understanding of early warnings, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV, deputy administrator for the Philippines Office of Civil Defense told local media.
    


            “We need to check how we issue our early warnings and translate it into actions,” he said
    


            Alejandro also called for the building of better and bigger drainage systems and resilient infrastructure that can withstand the threats of more intense storms fueled by climate change.
    


            “We need to rethink how we build our megacities and improve on our resiliency,” he added.
    


            The Philippines is one of Asia's most flood-prone countries but this year it has also been mired in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects that have brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets.
    


            Dozens of legislators, senators and construction companies have been accused of receiving kickbacks with money that was supposed to go toward establishing thousands of flood control projects.
    


            Kalmaegi will weaken to a tropical storm as it tracks farther inland from central Vietnam before moving on to northern Cambodia, Laos and eastern Thailand through Friday, local time.
    


            Around 350,000 people were expected to be evacuated from central Vietnam's Gia Lai province, according to Reuters.
    


            The typhoon comes as the region struggles to recover from devastating flooding last week that submerged historical sites including the ancient town of Hoi An.
    


            At least 13 people were killed and over 116,000 houses and 5,000 hectares of crops flooded, Reuters reported, citing the government's disaster agency. Roads and railways were damaged and power disrupted in several areas.
    


            Usually packed with tourists wandering through the lantern-lit streets lined with iconic wooden houses and bustling markets, images showed the UNESCO World Heritage listed Hoi An submerged in water and mud after record rainfall.
    


            The western Pacific is the most active tropical basin on Earth but global ocean temperatures have been at record levels for each of the last eight years.
    


            Hotter oceans, fueled by human-caused global warming, provide ample energy for storms to strengthen.
    


            The climate crisis is supercharging rainfall events – like those seen in Vietnam and with Typhoon Kalmaegi – as warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities.
    


            In September, Typhoon Ragasa brought destructive winds and torrential rain to the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China as the strongest storm in the region this year.

 If Deterrence Fails, Could America Thwart China?

 Zack Cooper

In recent years, many in Washington have focused on deterring China from invading Taiwan. Before taking office earlier this year, Elbridge Colby, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, asserted that Taiwan should be “laser focusing on implementing a denial defense against invasion.” Indeed, an array of small, inexpensive weapon systems holds great promise for repelling a Chinese amphibious landing. The Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy is therefore correct to embrace a strategy of denial for stopping an invasion of Taiwan.

But rebuffing an invasion might not end the war. Joel Wuthnow, an expert on the Chinese military, has warned, “There is no scenario in which China, following an unsuccessful invasion, accepts responsibility, acknowledges that military solutions are impractical, or pivots to a fundamentally different set of political objectives toward Taiwan.” In the wake of a failed invasion, Chinese leader Xi Jinping (or his successor) would be unlikely to simply pack up and go home. Instead, Chinese leaders might reason that they have less to lose by continuing the fight.

This is why the political scientist Michael Beckley has argued that “war over Taiwan likely would become protracted, as nearly all great power wars have since the Industrial Revolution.” World War II ended only when Allied forces captured Germany's capital and the United States dropped nuclear weapons on Japan. Neither option seems advisable in the context of a U.S.-Chinese war; Washington needs to find other ways to end it. And so, in the years to come, the United States must prepare two forces: one to stop a Chinese invasion and another to end the conflict. Preventing a war from starting in the first place will rely to some extent on the innovative forms of deterrence by denial on which the Trump administration and others have focused. But denial capabilities on their own will not be enough. Ending a war that churns on even after a failed invasion will also require old-fashioned power projection.

In the twentieth century, the United States perfected the art of projecting power around the globe. A combination of forward bases and aircraft carriers allowed U.S. forces to operate worldwide. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the U.S. military's dominance also meant that one set of forces could employ two distinct forms of deterrence simultaneously: denial and punishment.

Consider the role of U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis. At the time, China was staging military exercises and testing missiles in the waters around Taiwan. As tensions rose, Washington maneuvered two carriers near the island. Those strike groups practiced deterrence by denial by threatening to physically repel an attack. But they also performed deterrence through punishment by threatening severe consequences if Beijing went through with it, since carrier-based aircraft could strike ships heading toward China and even targets on the Chinese mainland.

In the last few years, however, the United States has begun tailoring its forces—and those of its allies and partners—for more specific missions. Forward bases and aircraft carriers are expensive to build and maintain, yet still vulnerable to ballistic missiles and other asymmetric systems. Pentagon officials are therefore pushing to acquire more “attritable” systems, which are relatively cheap to produce and designed to be expendable, for use by small units operating within the expanding area that China threatens. As David Berger, the former commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, explained at a defense industry conference in 2021, the United States must “get comfortable with throwaway things.”



But attritable systems are of limited use against China's day-to-day coercive operations in the air and sea around Taiwan. Last year, Taiwan detected 5,105 Chinese sorties into its airspace. Defending against these aircraft requires expensive jets rather than low-flying drones. In the maritime context, responding to Chinese naval incursions in the waters around Taiwan will require vessels that can monitor those activities and challenge Chinese forces if necessary.

Even after open conflict begins, denial is still only a partial answer. U.S. mines and missiles can sink Chinese vessels, killing thousands of troops in the process, but Chinese leaders might still seek at least a partial victory. The People's Liberation Army could attempt to seize Taiwan's outlying islands or conduct a maritime blockade while its military arsenal makes the waters around Taiwan a no man's land. “There is no path to U.S. victory that does not include the long blockade,” the former intelligence officer Lonnie Henley has argued.

That is why the United States must be able to convince China that it will face unacceptable costs if it continues fighting in the wake of an unsuccessful invasion. A strategy of denial is only step one; the threat of punishment will be the United States' ultimate trump card.

The war in Ukraine illustrates the difficulty of terminating a conflict even after an initial invasion has bogged down. With small and cheap systems such as drones and mines, Ukraine was able to deny Russia a swift victory but has failed to impose costs high enough to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop fighting. Russia has suffered terrible losses in the war, but Putin appears to have calculated that the costs of continuing are lower than the costs of admitting defeat.

Russia's example serves as a warning about China's likely behavior. Ideally, the prospect of a failed invasion of Taiwan would deter China, but Chinese leaders might perceive several incentives for protracting a war following an initial loss. First, China's industrial capacity far outstrips that of the United States, so it could recapitalize its forces more rapidly. Over the last three decades, China has undergone a massive military buildup. The Office of Naval Intelligence has assessed that China has over 230 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. Meanwhile, U.S. armed forces face significant munitions shortages, with some experts predicting that American stockpiles would be expended after just weeks, or even days, of a conflict with China.

Beijing might believe it can outlast Washington and Taipei in terms of other supplies, as well. Getting provisions across land into Ukraine has proved challenging; delivering even basic necessities over water to Taiwan amid a conflict with China would be an order of magnitude more difficult. Taiwan is a relatively small island with limited food and energy stockpiles. Conversely, Beijing's rapid expansion of wind, solar, and nuclear power would help insulate it against a U.S. energy blockade.



A conflict over Taiwan could eventually become a contest of wills—which Beijing believes it could win. Chinese officials have described Taiwan as “the very core of China's core interests.” U.S. President Donald Trump's take is decidedly different: “Taiwan is 9,500 miles away,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. “It's 68 miles away from China. I just think we have to be smart . . . it's a very, very difficult thing.” The American people support Taiwan, but many do not want a direct conflict with China: when asked in 2024 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs about their commitment to defending Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, the majority of Americans surveyed either opposed such a policy or were unsure.

A Chinese failure in a conflict over Taiwan could also threaten Xi or his successor's hold on power and undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi would want to avoid an admission of failure and thus might order the Chinese military to keep waging an unsuccessful war. Without the prospect of punishment, the CCP might decide that failure poses a greater risk than continuing the conflict.

For all these reasons, Chinese leaders might prefer to keep fighting even after an initial defeat. To bring the conflict to a close, the United States would need to credibly threaten punishment. Colby and other Trump administration officials clearly recognize this; he co-authored a 2022 report advocating “selective punishment operations” and “cost-imposition to favorably manage escalation and seek to terminate a war with China.” These operations could include an embargo or the seizure of Chinese assets held abroad. But Beijing has been insulating itself against political and economic pressure, so military escalation might well be required, including strikes on critical infrastructure and parts of China's defense-industrial base. These moves would raise the costs for China of continuing a conflict, but they also present a strategic dilemma.

A number of factors would complicate any threat of punishment. First is what researchers at the RAND Corporation have termed the “Goldilocks challenge”: threats of punishment must be high enough to persuade Beijing to end a conflict in which it is deeply invested but low enough to avoid provoking unacceptable escalation, such as nuclear use. Finding this middle ground would not be an easy task.

It will therefore be important to try to keep an initial fight over Taiwan limited in order to provide Chinese leaders a pathway for deescalation. Chinese leaders might back down after claiming to have taught Taiwan a lesson or taken some contested territory. Yet China's own messaging before a conflict could set a higher bar: Chinese leaders might demonize Taiwan and the United States to rally public support, while trumpeting the PLA's military superiority and China's great rejuvenation. An invasion of Taiwan might start with Beijing metaphorically burning its ships so there would be no turning back.

In the aftermath of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, politicians in Washington, Taipei, and elsewhere might themselves raise the stakes. They could seek to use Beijing's moment of weakness to constrain China's ambitions, formalize Taiwan's independence, or undermine the CCP's hold on power. There would be a fine line between “too hot” and “too cold” policies, and the tradeoffs would become more difficult as the war grew longer, bloodier, and more destructive.

A second challenge is that U.S. “horizontal escalation”—widening the scope of the conflict—may not be as effective today as it once might have been. Devoting more funding to denial capabilities risks cannibalizing resources for military platforms more capable of threatening punishment, such as stealthy bombers and submarines armed with cruise missiles. And although American strategists have discussed the possibility of a blockade to prevent China from importing energy supplies, the country's nuclear power plants and renewable energy sources now account for a third of its energy production, so that Beijing is less vulnerable to an energy blockade. Cutting China's fossil fuel imports would hurt over time, but Taiwan would be in a far more dire position.

Therefore, the biggest challenge for the Trump administration's National Defense Strategy is not whether it allocates resources to a strategy of denial but how it integrates denial and punishment into a holistic deterrence framework. Rebuffing an initial attack on Taiwan is necessary but not sufficient. Without a plan for terminating a war, Washington would risk repeating the pattern of U.S. strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan that many Trump officials critiqued: winning the first battle but losing the war. If the United States is to deter China, it will have to persuade Chinese leaders that Washington has a strategy not only for the early stages of a conflict but also for the end stage of a war.

MOSCOW, November 6. /TASS/. It is important to clearly understand Russia's intentions, which currently involve assessing whether preparations for nuclear tests are necessary rather than actually beginning them, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a TASS question on whether the presidential administration shares the view that the world is closer to nuclear war today than during the Caribbean crisis.

"President [Vladimir] Putin reiterated that Russia remains committed to all its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We remain faithful to our undertakings. However, given everything that the participants in the Security Council's operational meeting said at the beginning of the session, Putin has instructed to assess whether it is necessary to begin preparations," Peskov said.

"Thus, we are not starting preparations right now; we are first trying to figure out whether we need to start them, given what we are hearing from the United States. It is very important to understand this and to clearly see Russia's intentions," the Kremlin spokesman emphasized.

A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Nov. 3 that the Los Angeles Police Department SWAT team is not liable for damage done to a business while chasing a criminal in 2022.

NoHo Printing & Graphics Owner Carlos Pena will ask the full court to rehear the case, his attorneys from the Institute for Justice said in a statement posted to the Institute's webpage.

Live Updates


• Looming flight cuts: The Trump administration said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports — including major hubs like New York City, Chicago and Atlanta — starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the impasse, potentially impacting thousands of flights. According to an airline official, the administration is also weighing a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow, increasing by 1% each day the shutdown drags on.
    


• Negotiations ongoing: Key sticking points remain as centrist Democrats try to hammer out a deal with Republicans to end the longest shutdown in history. Some Democratic senators — emboldened by their party's wins in Tuesday's elections — are ramping up pressure to not yield to the GOP without a real victory on health care.
    


            • Food aid: The US Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, revised its SNAP reduction plan to provide more partial benefits in November — though some beneficiaries could still see much less aid than usual.
    


            United Airlines will preemptively cancel about 200 flights starting tomorrow, the airline tells CNN.
    


            That's roughly 4% of United's Friday schedule and is comprised of mostly regional flights. United says it will cancel about 4% again on Saturday and Sunday.
    


Some background: The announcement from United came as the Trump administration is considering a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow, an airline official familiar with the proposal told CNN. The proposal is preliminary and nothing is final, a separate source said.
    


            A federal judge in Rhode Island will consider this afternoon whether he should order the Trump administration to provide 42 million Americans with their full food stamp benefits for November amid the government shutdown.
    


            The hearing before US District Judge John McConnell is the latest high-stakes courtroom showdown over the funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, which the administration had attempted to defund amid the government shutdown.
    


            McConnell, of the federal court in Providence, and another judge in Boston said last week that the administration must tap into contingency funds to provide at least partial SNAP benefits this month, leaving it up to government to decide whether to pull money from a separate fund to fully cover this month's benefits. The administration said on Monday that it opted to only use the contingency funds.
    


            But after the government notified McConnell of its plans, a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses that brought the legal challenge pressed the judge to intervene yet again, arguing the USDA's choice did not comport with his requirement that the government work “expeditiously” to ensure payments are made.
    


            The plaintiffs are asking the appointee of former President Barack Obama to issue a new order that would force the administration to tap into the separate pot of money to provide full SNAP benefits for November.
    


            The Trump administration is considering a 4% reduction in flights starting tomorrow — increasing by 1% each day the shutdown drags on — an airline official familiar with the proposal told CNN.
    


            The proposal is preliminary and nothing is final, a separate source said.
    

The Federal Aviation Administration will reduce flights at dozens of major airports as early as Friday if no shutdown deal is reached, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced at a news conference. CNN's Pete Muntean reports on how airlines are responding.


            More airports are seeing delays today due to air traffic control staffing issues across the country, including at major hubs like Washington, DC and New York.
    


            Here's where the latest issues are being reported:
    


            A total of 434 staffing problems have been reported by the FAA since the start of the shutdown, more than four times the number on the same days last year.
    


            Even if the government reopens tomorrow, travelers should expect there to be residual impacts from the shutdown as the holiday season approaches, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA).
    


                    “It will take us months to come out of all the impacts that it's causing. Regardless, there's probably going to be headaches and delays around Thanksgiving because of just the ripple effect,” Daniels said.
                





            “There were delays before the shutdown. There's obviously delays during the shutdown. There's going to be delays after the shutdown,” he added.
    


            Air traffic controllers are bearing the brunt of the historic government shutdown, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told CNN.
    


                    “Controllers are resigning every day now because of the prolonged nature of the shutdown. We hadn't seen that before. And we're also 400 controllers short — shorter than we were in the 2019 shutdown,” Nick Daniels told CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown.
                





            The Department of Transportation said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports — including major hubs — starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the shutdown. Daniels said the move is necessary to help mitigate safety risks.
    


            He also said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford will need to monitor the situation closely, “but they are taking those proactive steps of putting a smaller level of capacity to the airspace or a smaller number of flights” so that controllers can “provide the best service they can.”
    


            Despite these efforts, Daniels acknowledged that controllers are still experiencing levels of “hopelessness”  the longer the shutdown drags on.
    


            Asked if some controllers are calling out sick in protest, Daniels said the situation is more complicated.
    


                    “They're not calling in sick. They're not calling in protest. They're calling in with real-life situations,” Daniels said. He added that some employees are calling in saying they can't afford gas for their cars to get to work or childcare because they haven't been paid for 37 days.
                





            Daniels went on to explain that while controllers will eventually recieve back pay once the government reopens, “it probably will drag on for over two-and-a-half months for them to actually be made whole from what's going on now. And that's another part of the problem is that they know that it takes so long for the government to catch up in that direction.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a key senator involved in the talks to reach a deal to open the government as soon as this week, touted “productive” bipartisan conversations as lawmakers work through sticking points.
    


            “I think talks continue to be productive, and hopefully we can get to a resolution. I think we need to get government back up,” she said, stressing the importance of restoring SNAP benefits and paychecks to federal employees.
    


            Pressed by on concerns by some in her party that the guarantee of a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies without more substantial assurances it will become law is not sufficient, Shaheen responded, “Everybody will have an opportunity to have their input and to vote on what we do.”
    


                    “We ought to be able to keep the government open and make sure that people are not forced off their health insurance because they can't pay,” she said, noting that she's been talking to Republicans who are also interested in extending the ACA credits.
                





            Shaheen criticized Speaker Mike Johnson declining to commit to bringing an ACA vote to the House floor, telling Raju, “I can't speak for the speaker. If he doesn't understand that people can't afford their health insurance rates, then he's got a problem.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal made clear he wants an extension of ACA credits to be included in the plan to reopen the government, saying the “vague promise” of a separate vote would be a “mistake.”
    


                    “I think voters would rightly see it as a surrender,” he said.
                





            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he will be watching for progress out of this afternoon's Democratic policy lunch to see if there will be enough centrist members of that party who will decide to vote to end the government shutdown.
    


            “There are Democrats who are inclined to do the right thing. They're under an enormous amount of pressure from the left,” he told reporters. “We'll see if they hold sway today and hopefully we'll know more about that as the day rolls on.”
    


            He was asked if he will keep the Senate in session this weekend and into next week's schedule Veterans Day recess if a deal is not reached.
    


                    “That depends a little bit on what happens if there's a path forward to vote, whether that's today, tomorrow, Saturday. We'll stay and do that. If the far left wins out in this and the Dems dig in then, I don't know. We'll see. I think all options will be on the table,” he said.
                





            Thune said he met Wednesday with two of the negotiators from the Democrats' side. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire.
    


            Asked about Democratic concerns that while he has offered to let Democrats have a vote by a date certain on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which is at the center of the debate over the standoff, Speaker Mike Johnson is balking at one in the House.
    


            “I can't speak for the House,” he said. “I think the clear path forward here, with regard to the ACA issue is they get a vote, and we open up the government and we head down to the White House and sit down with the President and talk about it.”
    


            Thune said he did not think it was needed to bring President Donald Trump into the shutdown talks at present.
    


            Top Democrats are praising California Rep. Nancy Pelosi following her announcement this morning that she would not seek reelection after this term.
    


            In a statement, Former President Joe Biden reiterated his belief that Pelosi was the best person to serve as speaker of the US House of Representatives.
    


            “I often said Nancy Pelosi was the best Speaker of the House in American history — it's why I awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” Biden wrote on X. “When I was President, we worked together to grow our economy, create millions of jobs, and make historic investments in our nation's future. She has devoted much of her life to this country, and America will always be grateful. Jill and I wish Nancy and Paul all the best.”
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also praised Pelosi as a historic figure in the party and the US House, writing, “Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi is an iconic, heroic, trailblazing, legendary and transformational leader. She is the greatest Speaker of all time.”
    


            He added later: “During her 20 years leading House Democrats, she fiercely navigated many trials and tribulations, including a once-in-a-century pandemic, a horrific attack on the United States Capitol and a violent attempt on her husband's life. Through it all, she led with strength and dignity. Like Esther, she was Speaker and Leader for such a time as this. Personally, Speaker Pelosi has been an incredible mentor, trusted friend and awesome colleague who has profoundly blessed me with her insights, perspectives and leadership values.”
    


            Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene slammed House leadership for not holding a session during the shutdown — which is now the longest in US history.



                    “You know, I was telling my staff on the way here, I said, ‘I voted to fund the government on September 18, and here we are today as November 6.' And the House has not been in session since then. And I just — I truly believe that's an utter failure,” the congresswoman from Georgia told CNN's Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer while discussing Tuesday's election results.
                





            “And you can't expect people to show up and be passionate about voting for you, when you're not even going to work, and they're going to work every single day and struggling to pay their bills,” Greene said.
    


            Greene also said she is happy to hear that President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster to end the shutdown.
    


            Greene said she spoke to Trump about using the so-called nuclear option “some time ago.”
    


            “I said, ‘Mr. President, this is the only way you're going to get your agenda across.' And I called for it,” Greene said. “I think it was early October, I actually started calling saying that, you know, Democrats should vote to fund the government, but Republicans are equally responsible. And if they're serious about funding the government, they should use the nuclear option and override the filibuster to get it done. And so, I'm very pleased to see President Trump saying the same thing I'm saying.”
    


            Asked by CNN whether President Donald Trump's remarks saying Republicans are being blamed for the shutdown were helpful for negotiations, House Speaker Mike Johnson revealed that he spoke with Trump directly to give his own view of the political implications.
    


                    “I've spoken to the president about it. I reminded him, as I said this morning, this is not a surprise to us,” Johnson said. “Blue states elected blue leaders. So what?”
                





            “I don't read too much into that,” he added.
    


            Johnson again sought to downplay the results from Tuesday's elections.
    


            “There were no surprises on Tuesday night, OK? You had blue states and blue cities that voted the glue to the alarm of no one, to the surprise of no one. That was what was expected,” he said.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson said he would not guarantee a vote in the House on extending expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies — even if Senate GOP leaders ultimately make that commitment to end the shutdown.
    


                    “No, because we did our job and I'm not part of the negotiations,” Johnson said. Pressed further on his position, he added: “I'm not promising anybody anything.”
                





            Johnson's remarks underscore some of Democrats' biggest fears in their negotiations: Even if Senate Majority Leader John Thune allows a vote on health care, there would likely be no such vote in the House and would therefore infuriate the rest of their party.
    


            On the state of shutdown talks, Johnson said he is personally “less optimistic” about them.
    


            “I can tell you honestly I'm less optimistic this morning than I was yesterday. Because we were hearing there were some common-sense centrist Democrats who were talking to Republicans but what I understand is that Chuck Schumer has pulled them back from that. They're being instructed and told they can't go there,” Johnson said.
    


            At least three major US airlines are waiving fees for travelers who want to cancel or change their upcoming flights due to tomorrow's looming cuts to 10% of air traffic at 40 major airports.
    


            In a notice to passengers, Delta Air Lines is allowing passengers “to change, cancel or refund their flights, including… basic economy fares, without penalty.”
    


            United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby announced in a letter to employees last night that “any customer traveling during this period is eligible for a refund if they do not wish to fly – even if their flight isn't impacted. That includes non-refundable tickets and those customers with basic economy tickets.”
    


            And American Airlines said in a statement: “Disrupting customers' plans is the last thing we want do to. To provide additional flexibility during the impacted travel period, customers whose flights are cancelled for any reason or who choose not to travel will be able to change their flight or request a refund, without any penalty.”
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            A group of increasingly frustrated Senate Democratic freshmen are currently meeting to discuss potential off-ramps to the 37-day shutdown as anxiety ramps up inside Washington over the funding lapse's escalating effects, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
    


            The group is discussing a long-shot proposal to Republicans to allow the chamber to vote to reopen the government with only 50 votes — instead of the usual 60-vote threshold — in exchange for agreeing to a 50-vote threshold on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, those sources said.
    


            That idea would be a huge lift for the Senate GOP, which has been strongly opposed to changing that 60-vote threshold. But it's an attempt to force any movements within the GOP after President Donald Trump himself called on Republicans to abolish the filibuster in a White House meeting on Wednesday.
    


            The group is also discussing pushing their freshman class to stay in Washington this weekend and into next week as the shutdown drags on — an idea from Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, one of the sources said.
    


            They hope to pitch their ideas to the broader Democratic caucus during a lunch meeting later in the day.
    


            We've gotten some more information on the latest air travel disruptions.
    


            Delays are being reported in Washington, DC, and New York this morning as the Federal Aviation Administration warns of air traffic control staffing shortages and prepares to reduce flights at 40 major airports.
    


Here are some more specifics: 



            A total of 431 staffing problems have been reported by the FAA since the start of the shutdown, more than four times the number on the same days last year.
    


            Negotiations between key senators will continue this morning as they push to announce a deal before the end of the week — or even today — to reopen the government, according to multiple sources in both parties.
    


            There are still some key sticking points, the sources said, so it's not yet clear when an accord will come together nor when the Senate will vote. But even after a deal is reached, it will take several days for it to be processed in both the Senate and the House, which has been out of session since September 19.
    


            So the government shutdown is expected to continue for at least another couple days.
    


            The idea would be to attach a stopgap bill to a larger package to fund several federal agencies. It's still unclear how senators would deal with a key sticking point: expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. Negotiators are discussing a stand-alone ACA vote, far short of the demand of many Democrats who want an extension in the underlying package that President Donald Trump would sign into law.
    


            Republicans have been keeping their leadership and the White House in the loop, one of the sources said.
    


            Airlines are bracing their passengers for disruptions as a 10% reduction in air traffic — impacting some major airport hubs — will go into effect starting tomorrow if the shutdown is not resolved.
    


Here's what some are saying:



            “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram.
    


Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are both offering waivers to allow passengers who do not want to fly to change their tickets without fees.
    


            Try to avoid booking flights with layovers, according to the US Public Interest Research Group. The more planes you have to get on to reach your destination, the more chances there are for a flight to be delayed or canceled.
    


            Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said there will be significant disruptions in the airspace when the Federal Aviation Administration slashes 10% of air traffic at 40 busy airports Friday if there's no shutdown agreement.
    


            “This is not a political decision, this was data-driven to make the right call to get ahead of any issues that could happen in airspace that could have negative consequences,” Duffy said in an interview on Fox.
    


            The DOT announced today that 10% of air traffic at 40 busy airports would be cut, potentially impacting thousands of flights, though the details of how many and which specific airports will be cut was not announced.
    


            Even with the cuts, flights could still be delayed if there are not enough workers to control them safely.
    


                    “As we come into Thanksgiving, if we're still in the shutdown posture, it's going to be rough out there, really rough,” Duffy said on Fox. “We'll mitigate the safety side. But will you fly on time? Will your flight actually go? That is yet to be seen, but there'll be more disruption.”
                





            Controllers will receive their second $0 paycheck next week, and Duffy has said some have taken second jobs to make ends meet or calling out sick in protest.
    


            Air traffic controllers were sent a pay stub reflecting a total “net pay” of $0 for the second time since the start of the now-historic shutdown today.
    


            The “Earnings and Leave Statement” reflects the funds to be paid next week for the pay period ending November 1.
    


Remember: Since the start of the shutdown, controllers and other essential workers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, have been required to do their jobs but won't be paid until after the government reopens.
    


            The administration also said it will cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports starting tomorrow if a deal isn't reached to end the impasse, potentially impacting thousands of flights.
    


            Republican Sen. Katie Britt said that while she is working across the aisle to end the government shutdown, President Donald Trump's argument for eliminating the filibuster to end the impasse, is “compelling.”
    


            “President Trump made a very compelling case yesterday. He talked about what is in front of us and what we need to do for the American people. Obviously, he has a robust agenda, and it is on us to get that through,” the senator from Alabama said on CNBC's “Squawk Box” this morning.
    


            Trump has been vocal in recent days for Republicans to end the shutdown by using the “nuclear option,” in other words, eliminating the filibuster — a 60-vote threshold for passing legislation — and voting with a simple majority. He made that pitch again yesterday at a breakfast with Senate Republicans.
    


            Britt added in the CNBC interview that Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the votes are not there to end the filibuster. But, she said, “we do have pathways that we can pursue that ultimately help us achieve his goal.”
    


            The senator said she is working with Democrats and Republicans to try to pass appropriations for critical food assistance programs, military and veteran services and paying Capitol Police officers.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. airports in more than two dozen states are among those facing 10% reductions in air traffic Friday due to the government shutdown.

The Federal Aviation Administration is imposing the reductions to take pressure off air traffic controllers, who are federal employees and have gone without pay during the shutdown. 

In addition to reduced flight traffic, the shutdown has led to more flight delays, with experts advising travelers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport, among other tips.

Here's a closer look at what to know about the reductions. 




The list includes 40 airports with Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Miami, Newark and San Francisco among them. A full list of airports facing reductions is here.

Air traffic controllers have gone without paychecks during the shutdown of the federal government. That's led to controllers calling in sick and contributed to staffing shortages that have been affecting air travel for weeks. 

Most controllers work mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said. 

That leaves little time for a side job unless controllers call in sick to the FAA.

They're set to start Friday, with passengers expected to be notified on Thursday. Airlines have said people could see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. 




It's unclear when the reduced flights could end. Airlines, unions and the travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest on record.

The cuts could include up to 1,800 flights and about 268,000 seats combined, according to one estimate. 

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both said they would offer refunds to travelers who opt not to fly, even if they have tickets that aren't normally refundable.

The cuts also could disrupt package deliveries because two airports with major distribution centers are on the list. FedEx operates at the Memphis, Tennessee, aiport and UPS in Louisville, Kentucky, where there was a deadly cargo plane crash this week.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for controllers to miss their second full paycheck next week.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said this week that he's never seen these kinds of measures taken before in his nearly four-decade experience in the aviation field. 

“We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns,” he said. 

Staffing problems led to delays throughout October, but they were mostly isolated and temporary. Last weekend, though, saw a change. 

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

During weekends from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional control centers and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis.

CHICAGO (AP) — A federal judge said Thursday she will order federal agents in Chicago to restrict using force against peaceful protesters and news media outlets, saying current practices violate their constitutional rights.

The preliminary injunction came in response to a lawsuit alleging federal agents have used excessive force in their immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ‘s ruling, which is expected to be appealed by President Donald Trump's administration, refines an earlier temporary order that required agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain riot-control techniques, such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. After repeatedly chastising federal officials for not following her previous orders, she added a requirement for body cameras.

Ellis, who began Thursday's hearing by describing Chicago as a “vibrant place” and reading from poet Carl Sandburg's famous poem about the city, said it is “simply untrue” that the Chicago area is a violent place of rioters. A day earlier, attorneys for both sides repeatedly clashed in court over the accounts of several incidents during the immigration crackdown that began in September, including one where a Border Patrol commander threw a cannister of tear gas at a crowd. 

“I don't find defendants' version of events credible,” Ellis said.

Ellis said agents will be required to give two warnings before using riot control weapons and that agents are restricted from using force unless it is “objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




She described protesters and advocates facing tear gas, having guns pointed at them and being thrown to the ground, saying “that would cause a reasonable person to think twice about exercising their fundamental rights.”




The preliminary injunction stems from a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force during demonstrations. 

In court, an attorney representing the federal government said senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino, has a body-worn camera after Ellis required him to get one and complete the training for using it at a previous hearing.

A message left Thursday for the Department of Homeland Security wasn't immediately returned.

During Wednesday's eight-hour hearing, witnesses gave emotional testimony when describing experiencing tear gas, being shot in the head with pepper balls while praying, and having guns pointed at them when recording agents in residential streets.

Ellis questioned witnesses about how these experiences impacted them and if they prevented them from protesting again. One after another, witnesses described their anxiety about returning to protests or advocacy work.

“I get really nervous because it just feels like I'm not safe,” Leslie Cortez, a youth organizer in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, told Ellis. “And I question my safety when I go out.”

Attorneys also played footage of a five-hour deposition, or private interview, of Bovino where he defended agents' use of force and dodged questions about Border Patrol tactics in the nations' third-largest city.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that it will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 “high-volume” markets beginning Friday morning to maintain safety during the ongoing government shutdown.

Airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are among 40 of the busiest across the U.S. where flights will be cut starting Friday due to the government shutdown, according to a list distributed to the airlines and obtained by The Associated Press.

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday it would reduce air traffic by 10% across “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers go unpaid and exhibit signs of strain during the shutdown.

The affected airports in more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the U.S., including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities — such as New York, Houston and Chicago — multiple airports will be affected. 




The FAA is imposing the flight reductions to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the government shutdown and have been increasingly calling off work. The move also comes as the Trump administration is ramping up pressure on Democrats in Congress to end the shutdown.

Controllers already have missed one full paycheck and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as the shutdown drags on.

The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers.



Passengers should start to be notified about cancellations Thursday. Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. 

What to do if you're facing flight disruptions during the government shutdownStaffing shortages have caused flight delays at a growing number of airports as disruptions pile up nationwide. Here is what to know about your rights as a passenger.

My flight was canceled. Now what? If you are already at the airport, it is time to find another flight. Airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. You can ask to be booked on another airline, but airlines aren't required to put you on another carrier's flight. It is often hit or miss.

Am I owed a refund? If your flight is canceled and you no longer want to take the trip, or have found another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. 



United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly, even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable. 

The head of Frontier Airlines recommended that travelers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded.

The cuts also could disrupt package deliveries because two airports with major distribution centers are on the list — FedEx operates at the airport in Memphis, Tennessee, and UPS in Louisville, Kentucky, the site of this week's deadly cargo plane crash.

The cuts could affect as many as 1,800 flights, or upward of 268,000 passengers, per day, according to an estimate by aviation analytics firm Cirium.

Airlines are used to dealing with cutting thousands of flights on short notice during severe weather, but the difference now is that these cuts during the shutdown will last indefinitely until safety data improves. 

“I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday. “We're in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”

Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said that few cities will be spared because some airlines have indicated they will focus on reducing routes to and from small and medium-sized cities.

“This is going to have a noticeable impact across the U.S. air transportation system,” said Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group.



Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Most work mandatory overtime six days a week, leaving little time for side jobs to help cover bills and other expenses unless they call out. 

Mounting staffing pressures are forcing the agency to act, Bedford said. 

“We can't ignore it,” he said.

Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that they would meet with airline executives to figure out how to safely implement the reductions. 

Major airlines, aviation unions and the broader travel industry have been urging Congress to end the shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest on record.

The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system and “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience,” said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman in a statement.

Duffy warned earlier this week that there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paycheck next week.

He said some controllers can get by missing one paycheck, but not two or more. 



Staffing can run short both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don't always lead to flight disruptions. Throughout October, flight delays caused by staffing problems had been largely isolated and temporary.

But the past weekend brought some of the worst staffing issues since the start of the shutdown.

From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.

Powerful Democratic former speaker Nancy Pelosi won't seek reelection to the U.S. House. Pelosi's announcement brings to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.




WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi will not seek reelection to the U.S. House, bringing to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday.

“I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said in a video address to voters.

Pelosi, appearing upbeat and forward-looking as images of her decades of accomplishments filled the frames, said she would finish out her final year in office. And she left those who sent her to Congress with a call to action to carry on the legacy of agenda-setting both in the U.S. and around the world.

“My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,” she said. “We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way.”

Pelosi said, “And now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.” 

The decision, while not fully unexpected, ricocheted across Washington, and California, as a seasoned generation of political leaders is stepping aside ahead of next year's midterm elections. Some are leaving reluctantly, others with resolve, but many are facing challenges from newcomers eager to lead the Democratic Party and confront President Donald Trump.

Pelosi, 85, remains a political powerhouse and played a pivotal role with California's redistricting effort, Prop 50, and the party's comeback in this month's election. She maintains a robust schedule of public events and party fundraising, and her announced departure touches off a succession battle back home and leaves open questions about who will fill her behind-the-scenes leadership role at the Capitol.




Former President Barack Obama said Pelosi will go down in history as “one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.”

An architect of the Affordable Care Act during Obama's tenure, and a leader on the international stage, Pelosi came to politics later in life, a mother of five mostly grown children. She has long fended off calls for her to step aside by turning questions about her intentions into spirited rebuttals, asking if the same was being posed of her male colleagues on Capitol Hill.

In her video address, she noted that her first campaign slogan was “a voice that will be heard.”

And with that backing, she became a speaker “whose voice would certainly be heard,” she said.

But after Pelosi quietly helped orchestrate Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, she has decided to pass the torch, too.

Last year, she experienced a fall resulting in a hip fracture during a whirlwind congressional visit to allies in Europe, but even still it showcased her grit: It was revealed she was rushed to a military hospital for surgery — after the group photo, in which she's seen smiling, poised on her trademark stiletto heels.

Pelosi's decision also comes as her husband of more than six decades, Paul Pelosi, was gravely injured three years ago when an intruder demanding to know “Where is Nancy?” broke into the couple's home and beat him over the head with a hammer. His recovery from the attack, days before the 2022 midterm elections, is ongoing.

Ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, Pelosi faced a potential primary challenge in California. Newcomer Saikat Chakrabarti, who helped devise progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's political rise in New York, has mounted a campaign, as has state Sen. Scott Wiener.

While Pelosi remains an unmatched force for the Democratic Party, having fundraised more than $1 billion over her career, her next steps are uncertain. First elected in 1987 after having worked in California state party politics, she has spent some four decades in public office.

Pelosi's legacy as House speaker comes not only because she was the first woman to have the job but also because of what she did with the gavel, seizing the enormous powers that come with the suite of offices overlooking the National Mall.

During her first tenure, from 2007 to 2011, she steered the House in passing landmark legislation into law — the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in the aftermath of the Great Recession and a repeal of the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy against LGBTQ service members.

With President Barack Obama in the White House and Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada leading the Senate, the 2009-10 session of Congress ended among the most productive since the Johnson era.

But a conservative Republican “tea party” revolt bounced Democrats from power, ushering in a new style of Republicans, who would pave the way for Trump to seize the White House in 2016.

Determined to win back control, Pelosi helped recruit and propel dozens of women to office in the 2018 midterm elections as Democrats running as the resistance to Trump's first term.

On the campaign trail that year, Pelosi told The Associated Press that if House Democrats won, she would show the “power of the gavel.”

Pelosi became the first speaker to regain the office in some 50 years, and her second term, from 2019 to 2023, became potentially more consequential than the first, particularly as the Democratic Party's antidote to Trump.

Trump was impeached by the House — twice — first in 2019 for withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine as it faced a hostile Russia at its border and then in 2021 days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Senate acquitted him in both cases.

Pelosi stood up the Jan. 6 special committee to probe Trump's role in sending his mob of supporters to the Capitol, when most Republicans refused to investigate, producing the 1,000-page report that became the first full accounting of what happened as the defeated president tried to stay in office.

After Democrats lost control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi announced she would not seek another term as party leader.

Rather than retire, she charted a new course for leaders, taking on the emerita title that would become used by others, including Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California during his brief tenure after he was ousted by his colleagues from the speaker's office in 2023.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for their popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

The drugs are part of a new generation of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity in recent years.

But access to the drugs has been a consistent problem for patients because of their cost — around $500 a month for higher doses — and insurance coverage has been spotty.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved.

“(It) will save lives, improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” said Trump, in an Oval Office announcement in which he referred to GLP-1s as a “fat drug.”

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Drugmakers Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay. 

As with the other deals, it's not clear how much the price drop will be felt by consumers. Drug prices can vary based on the competition for treatments and insurance coverage.

The obesity drugs work by targeting hormones in the gut and brain that affect appetite and feelings of fullness. In clinical trials, they helped people shed between 15% and 22% of their body weight -- up to 50 pounds or more in many cases.

Patients taking these drugs usually start on smaller doses and then work up to larger amounts, depending on their needs. Because of obesity being considered a chronic disease, they need to take the treatment indefinitely or risk regaining weight, experts say. 

The fast-growing treatments have proven especially lucrative for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co. and Novo Nordisk. Lilly said recently that sales of Zepbound have tripled so far this year to more than $9 billion.

But for many Americans, their cost has made them out of reach.

Medicare, the federally funded coverage program mainly for people ages 65 and over, hasn't covered the treatments for obesity. President Donald Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, proposed a rule last November that would have changed that. But the Trump administration nixed it last spring.

Few state and federally funded Medicaid programs, for people with low incomes, offer coverage. And employers and insurers that provide commercial coverage are wary of paying for these drugs in part because of the large number of patients that might use them.

The $500 monthly price for higher doses of the treatments also makes them unaffordable for those without insurance, doctors say.

Medicare now covers the cost of the drugs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but not for weight loss alone.

The effort to lower costs barriers to popular GLP-1 drugs comes as the White House is looking to demonstrate that Trump is in touch with Americans' frustrations with rising costs for food, housing, health care and other necessities.

“Trump is the friend of the forgotten American,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at Thursday's announcement. “Obesity is a disease of poverty. And overwhelmingly these drugs have only been available for people who have wealth.” 

Kennedy had previously expressed skepticism to GLP-1s in fighting obesity and diseases related to the condition. But he was full of praise for Trump for pushing to help a broader segment of Americans have access to the drug.

The announcement came after Republican gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia faced a drubbing in Tuesday's election in which dour voter outlook about the economy appeared to an animating factor in the races. 

Roughly half of Virginia voters said “the economy” was the top issue, and about 6 in 10 of these voters picked Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor, powering her to a decisive win, according to an AP voter poll.

In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won about two-thirds of voters who called “the economy” the top issue facing the state, the poll found. She defeated a Trump-endorsed Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. More than half of New York City voters said the cost of living was the top issue facing the city. The Democratic mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won about two-thirds of this group.

The White House sought to diminish the effort by the previous Democratic administration as a gift to the pharmaceutical industry because the proposal did not include adequate price concessions from the drug makers.

Trump, instead, consummated a “belt and suspenders” deal that ensures that Americans aren't unfairly financing the pharmaceutical industry's innovation, claimed a senior administration official, who briefed reporters ahead of Thursday's Oval Office announcement by Trump.

Another senior administration official said coverage of the drugs will expand to Medicare patients starting next year. Medicare will start covering the treatments for people who have severe obesity and others who are overweight or obese and have serious health problems, the official said. Those who qualify will pay $50 copays for the medicine.

Lower prices also will be phased in for people without coverage through the administration's TrumpRx program, which will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers. starting in January.

The officials said lower prices also will be provided for state and federally funded Medicaid programs. And starting doses of new, pill versions of the obesity treatments will cost $149 a month if they are approved. Administration officials said the average price of the drugs sold on TrumpRx will start at around $350 and then drop to $245 over the next two years.

The officials briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House.

Dr. Leslie Golden says she has roughly 600 patients taking one of these treatments, and 75% or more struggle to afford them. Even with coverage, some face $150 copayments for refills.

“Every visit it's, ‘How long can we continue to do this? What's the plan if I can't continue?,'” said Golden, an obesity medicine specialist in Watertown, Wisconsin. “Some of them are working additional jobs or delaying retirement so they can continue to pay for it.”

Both Lilly and Novo have already cut prices on their drugs. Lilly said earlier this year it would reduce the cost of initial doses of Zepbound to $349.

Dr. Angela Fitch, who also treats patients with obesity, said she hoped a deal between the White House and drugmakers could be the first step in making the treatments more affordable.

“We need a hero in obesity care today,” said Fitch, founder and chief medical officer of knownwell, a weight-loss and medical care company. “The community has faced relentless barriers to accessing GLP-1 medications, which has ultimately come down to the price, despite the data we have supporting their effectiveness.”

House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., shredded Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for failing to get his party to vote to end the ongoing federal government shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sharply diverged from his Senate counterpart on Thursday as the upper chamber continues to negotiate a way out of the government shutdown.

Johnson said he would not commit to holding a vote on extending COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year without congressional action.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., however, had been floating a vote on such an extension in exchange for Democrats voting to end the shutdown — which is now in its 37th day.

"Leader Thune has bent over backwards. He's offered them a vote. You know what they told him in response? ‘No, we need you to guarantee the outcome of that vote.' Well, that's ridiculous," Johnson said when asked about holding such a vote by a guaranteed date in the House if the deal succeeds in breaking the logjam.

When pressed again on a vote, he said, "No, because we did our job, and I'm not part of the negotiation."

"The House did its job on Sept. 19. I'm not promising anybody anything. I'm going to let this process play out," Johnson said.

The issue of enhanced Obamacare subsidies has been a matter of debate within the GOP, with some Republicans in more moderate districts calling for at least a year-long extension to give lawmakers time to create a new healthcare deal in its place.

But House conservatives are rejecting any such extension out of hand. Fox News Digital first reported that leaders of the 189-member Republican Study Committee issued an official position earlier Thursday demanding the credits not be extended.

It's been a key ask for Democrats, however, that such an extension be paired with any federal funding bill before they agree to help end the shutdown.

Senate Democrats are huddling on Thursday afternoon to discuss what they could and could not accept out of a deal to end the government shutdown.

There are a dozen in the caucus who have been meeting to find a way out of the shutdown, but following Democrats' Tuesday night election sweep, many in their caucus feel emboldened that their shutdown strategy is working and don't want to let up yet.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he believed Tuesday's election was "having an impact" on the caucus.

"It would be very strange for the American people to weigh in, in support of Democrats, standing up and fighting for them, and then within days, for us to surrender without having achieved any of the things that we've been fighting for," Sen. Chris Murphy said.

The majority of the caucus demands a guarantee on a deal rather than the promise of a process, given that a proposal to extend the expiring subsidies from Democrats without major reforms to the program would likely fail in the Republican-controlled chamber.

But Thune has remained adamant that he can't promise anything more than a vote and can't predict an outcome.

"I made this very clear to them, I can't guarantee them an outcome," Thune said. "I can guarantee them a process, and they can litigate the issue, get the vote on the floor, and presumably they have some way of getting a vote in the House at some point, but I can't speak for the House."

Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of ISIS murder victim Kayla Mueller, exclusively spoke with Fox News Digital on their endorsement of Kash Patel to lead the FBI.

EXCLUSIVE: The parents of slain American aid worker Kayla Mueller, Carl and Marsha Mueller, have written an emotional open letter to President Donald Trump, asking him to use his upcoming meeting with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to bring their daughter's remains home 10 years after she was killed by ISIS.

The letter, shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, comes just days before al-Sharaa's first visit to Washington since taking power following the collapse of the Assad regime. The Muellers called the encounter "a providential opportunity" to close one of the most painful chapters of the war in Syria.

SYRIA'S NEW PRESIDENT TAKES CENTER STAGE AT UNGA AS CONCERNS LINGER OVER TERRORIST PAST

American Kayla Mueller, 26, was killed while in the hands of ISIS, her family said Tuesday. 

"Ten long years have passed since our daughter's body found its resting place, unmarked and unknown, somewhere in the crimson folds of Syria's hills," the Muellers wrote. "Kayla's body has not been returned home to us; her story remains incomplete.

Kayla Mueller was a 26-year-old humanitarian aid worker from Arizona who was kidnapped by ISIS in 2013 while helping Syrian refugees near the Turkish border. She was enslaved by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who reportedly abused and murdered her in 2015. Her body was never recovered.

The family's letter recounts how, in 2019, Operation Kayla Mueller — ordered by President Trump — led to the death of al-Baghdadi in northern Syria. Standing with Trump at the 2020 Republican National Convention, the Muellers credited him for "delivering the iron fist of justice against unspeakable evil."

With Assad's ouster and Syria now under an interim government, the Muellers say the political landscape has shifted dramatically. They praised growing regional cooperation to locate missing Americans and cited Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., who has personally visited Damascus to advocate for her return.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Hamadeh said, "I was sworn into Congress with my hand resting on Kayla Mueller's Bible, with my family and Kayla's parents standing by my side. I vowed to them that I would do everything I could to bring her home. In their letter to President Trump, Kayla's parents wrote about how Kayla was killed attempting to ‘bring light to the darkest corner of the earth — and in her own darkest hour her spirit refused to break.' That is why I refuse to give up on bringing this remarkable young woman home to her family."

"The Assad regime has fallen, and with new leadership brings new opportunity to write the final chapter on Americans still missing in Syria," the Muellers wrote. "Through your leadership, we believe the torch Kayla was forced to drop has roared back to life."

The Muellers described Trump's meeting with al-Sharaa as a defining moment — both for U.S. foreign policy and for their family's decade-long quest for closure.

They ended the letter with a plea: "Your meeting is sure to inspire real hope across Syria's war-torn streets. Bringing Kayla's body home will do the same for every American heart, and together we will slam shut the era of terror's reign in Syria and finally bring closure to Kayla's story. This is a moment to reaffirm America's resolve: that we never abandon our own. One more push could bring Kayla home."

Hours after Democrats scored major wins in elections nationwide, President Donald Trump addressed the results, saying they're not “good for anybody.” Trump blamed the government shutdown in part for GOP losses and demanded the Senate end the filibuster.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Elections this week that energized Democrats and angered President Donald Trump have cast a chill over efforts to end the record-breaking government shutdown, raising fresh doubts about the possibility of a breakthrough despite the punishing toll of federal closures on the country.

Trump has increased pressure on Senate Republicans to end the shutdown — now at 37 days, the longest in U.S. history — calling it a “big factor, negative” in the poor GOP showings across the country. Democrats saw Trump's comments as a reason to hold firm, believing his involvement in talks could lead to a deal on extending health care subsidies, a key sticking point to win their support.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune opened what's seen as a pivotal day in efforts to end the government shutdown by saying the next step hinges on a response from Democrats to an offer on the table. 

“It's in their court. It's up to them,” Thune told reporters Thursday.

But Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer held firm in opening remarks Thursday, saying voters “fired a political torpedo at Trump and Republicans” in Tuesday's election. 

“Donald Trump clearly is feeling pressure to bring this shutdown to an end. Well, I have good news for the president: Meet with Democrats, reopen the government,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

Trump is refusing to meet with Democrats, insisting they must open the government first. But complicating the GOP's strategy, Trump is increasingly fixated instead on pushing Republicans to scrap the Senate filibuster to speed reopening — a step many GOP senators reject out of hand. He kept up the pressure in a video Wednesday, saying the Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass legislation should be “terminated.”




“This is much bigger than the shutdown,” Trump said. “This is the survival of our country.”

Senate Democrats face pressures of their own, both from unions eager for the shutdown to end and from allied groups that want them to hold firm. Many see the Democrats' decisive gubernatorial wins in Virginia and New Jersey as validation of their strategy to hold the government closed until expiring health care subsidies are addressed.

“It would be very strange for the American people to have weighed in, in support of Democrats standing up and fighting for them, and within days for us to surrender without having achieved any of the things that we've been fighting for,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.

Meanwhile, talks grind on, but the shutdown's toll deepens. On Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced plans to reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 high-volume markets beginning Friday to maintain safety amid staffing shortages. Millions of people have already been affected by halted government programs and missed federal paychecks — with more expected as another round of paydays approaches next week.

Grassroots Democratic groups nationwide touted Tuesday's election results as voter approval of the shutdown strategy — and warned lawmakers against cutting a deal too soon.

“Moderate Senate Democrats who are looking for an off-ramp right now are completely missing the moment,” said Katie Bethell, political director of MoveOn, a progressive group. “Voters have sent a resounding message: We want leaders who fight for us, and we want solutions that make life more affordable.”

Some Senate Democrats echoed that sentiment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats and a leading voice in the progressive movement, said Democrats “have got to remain strong” and should secure assurances on extending health care subsidies — including “a commitment from the speaker of the House that he will support the legislation and that the president will sign.”

Still, how firmly the party remains dug in remains to be seen. Some Democrats have been working with Republicans to find a way out of the standoff, and they held firm after the election that it had not impacted their approach. 

“I don't feel that the elections changed where I was,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo. “I still feel I want to get out of the shutdown.”

Some Republicans also shared in Trump's concerns that the shutdown is becoming a drag on the party. 

“Polls show that most voters blame Republicans more than Democrats,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “That's understandable given who controls the levers of power.”

While some Democrats saw Trump's comments on the shutdown Wednesday as evidence he'd soon get more involved, he's largely stayed out of the fray. Instead, the talks have intensified among a loose coalition of centrist senators trying to negotiate an end to the shutdown.

Trump has refused to negotiate with Democrats over their demands to salvage expiring health insurance subsidies until they agree to reopen the government. But skeptical Democrats question whether the Republican president will keep his word, particularly after his administration restricted SNAP food aid despite court orders to ensure funds are available to prevent hunger.

Trump's approach to the shutdown stands in marked contrast to his first term, when the government was partially closed for 35 days over his demands for money to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. At that time, he met publicly and negotiated with congressional leaders. Unable to secure the money, he relented in 2019. 

This time, it's not just Trump declining to engage in talks. The congressional leaders are at a standoff, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent lawmakers home in September after they approved their own funding bill, refusing further negotiations.

Johnson dismissed the party's election losses and said he's looking forward to a midterm election in 2026 that'll more reflect Trump's tenure.

In the meantime, food aid, child care money and countless other government services are being seriously interrupted. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or are expected to work without pay.

Central to any resolution will be a series of agreements that would need to be upheld not only by the Senate but also by the House and the White House, which is not at all certain in Washington.

Asked if the House would guarantee a vote on extending health care subsidies if the Senate struck a deal, Johnson said Thursday, “I'm not promising anybody anything.”

Senators from both major parties, particularly the members of the powerful Appropriations Committee, are pushing to ensure the normal government funding process in Congress can be put back on track. Among the goals is guaranteeing upcoming votes on a smaller package of bills to fund various aspects of government such as agricultural programs and military construction projects at bases.

More difficult, a substantial number of senators also want some resolution to the standoff over the funding for the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at year's end. 

With insurance premium notices being sent, millions of people are experiencing sticker shock on skyrocketing prices. The loss of enhanced federal subsidies, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic and come in the form of tax credits, are expected to leave many people unable to buy health insurance.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has promised Democrats at least a vote on their preferred health care proposal, on a date certain, as part of any deal to reopen government. But that's not enough for some senators, who see the health care deadlock as part of their broader concerns with Trump's direction for the country.

On Wednesday's episode of "Straight Shooter," host Stephen A. Smith asked where the money to fund New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's initiatives will come from, arguing his biggest fans aren't "people who pay bills every day."

FIRST ON FOX: A House GOP lawmaker is proposing to block federal funds from New York City for as long as Zohran Mamdani is mayor.

Forthcoming legislation led by Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., is called the Moving American Money Distant from Anti-National Interests Act, or the "MAMDANI Act" for short.

The two-page bill text stated that "notwithstanding any other provision of law, during any period in which Zohran Mamdani is mayor of New York, New York" that "any unobligated Federal funds available" for the city "are hereby rescinded" and that "no Federal funds may be obligated or expended for any purpose to New York, New York."

It is expected to be introduced on Friday, Fox News Digital was told.

The 34-year-old socialist won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, defeating former Gov. Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.

His victory was not a surprise to election watchers; New York City has not elected a Republican mayor since Michael Bloomberg won a second term in 2005.

While Carter's bill is not likely to be taken up in the House, it's a symbol of how the GOP has been hyper-focused on Mamdani's win, with Republican leaders in the House positioning him as the new leader of the Democratic Party.

A House Republican campaign operative signaled to Fox News Digital on Wednesday that the GOP would seek to tie vulnerable Democrats across the country to Mamdani and his far-left platforms.

Carter, who is running for U.S. Senate in Georgia, said taxpayer dollars from his state "should not be wasted on programs that will bankrupt the financial capital of the world."

"If New Yorkers want communism, we should let them have their wish and not artificially prop them up with our successful capitalist system," Carter said. "Any New Yorker with common sense is welcome to move to the great, FREE state of Georgia."

Historically, New York State has sent more taxpayer dollars to the federal government than it takes in federal dollars.

Urban warfare expert John Spencer explains why the proposed international force for Gaza must not repeat failures of the past.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, presented a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on Wednesday to partner nations aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan, including authorization for an international security force, according to a senior U.S. official. 

Waltz recently met with representatives from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, who are expected to coordinate humanitarian and reconstruction efforts around the proposal. The draft resolution seeks to authorize a two-year international stabilization force in Gaza under U.N. oversight — part of what officials describe as "phase two" of the broader postwar plan.

According to Reuters and the Associated Press, the draft would empower the mission to "use all necessary measures" to secure Gaza, protect civilians and begin the demilitarization of armed groups once large-scale combat ends. The plan includes forming a transitional "Board of Peace" to coordinate with Egypt, Israel and a vetted Palestinian police force.

US MILITARY TO OVERSEE NEXT PHASE OF PEACE DEAL FROM COORDINATION BASE IN ISRAEL

Washington has ruled out sending U.S. combat troops but has asked Muslim-majority countries, including Indonesia, Egypt, the U.A.E. and Turkey, to contribute. Israeli officials have already said they will not allow Turkish troops on their borders.

The meeting, in which the Palestinian Authority took part, marked a rare diplomatic engagement, notable because the U.S. plan envisioned handing authority back to the PA after reforms, a condition Israel opposes, Axios reports.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, said the concept can work — but only if it follows successful precedents. "For Gaza, I personally would like people to think Kosovo, not Lebanon," he said. "History shows exactly what determines success: a clear mandate, enough troops and the authority to act."

After the 1999 NATO campaign, the Kosovo Force (KFOR) deployed under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 with about 50,000 troops to stabilize the region, separate combatants and rebuild governance.

"Kosovo gives you the best example," Spencer said. "It had a clear disarmament mandate, a capable coalition and enough troops to enforce peace."

He warned that Gaza will require similar patience. "If somebody believes this will just disappear from the news in six months, that's not reality," he said, noting that KFOR remains in place decades later, albeit with fewer troops.

The 1995 Dayton Accords ended the Bosnian war and authorized the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), followed by the Stabilization Force (SFOR). About 60,000 troops were deployed to enforce the peace, separate armies and support reconstruction.

"These were significant forces with clear mandates for disarming," Spencer said. "That's what success looks like — a mission with both muscle and legitimacy."

FRENCH-DRAFTED UNIFIL RESOLUTION COULD SHIELD HEZBOLLAH AS US STAYS SILENT

He added that Gaza's mission must mirror Bosnia's strong command structure and clear legal authority, not rely on unarmed observers.

In East Timor, an Australian-led mission entered under U.N. authority in 1999 after post-independence violence. It restored order and laid the groundwork for local governance.

"East Timor shows how quickly you can start rebuilding governance when the force has legitimacy and local trust," Spencer said. "That legitimacy must exist from day one in Gaza."

By contrast, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), established in 1978 and expanded after the 2006 war, is what Spencer calls a failure.

"Southern Lebanon was not a success story," he said. "They were glorified observers without a mandate to demilitarize anything."

Israel has long criticized UNIFIL for allowing Hezbollah to entrench under its watch. Spencer said the same mistake cannot be repeated in Gaza. "It has to be seen as liberating areas from militant rule, not occupying them," he said.

Spencer described an "inkblot strategy" — stabilizing cleared districts while combat continues elsewhere. "You can create safe areas where a stabilization force, under the right mandate and equipped correctly, is stabilizing areas while you are also conducting operations against Hamas," he said.

He predicts that the Israel Defense Forces will continue high-intensity operations while the international force focuses on humanitarian aid, demining and restoring order in secured zones. "Part of the lesson is giving people a vision of life after Hamas," Spencer said.

During a recent visit to Gaza, Spencer said he saw "a glimmer of hope" in newly established humanitarian zones inside cleared areas. "If you start quickly, even on a small scale, success builds success," he said.

About 200 U.S. personnel are already on the ground in a civil-military coordination center managing logistics and planning for the proposed transition in Israel. Spencer said this small presence will be vital to coordinating aid, reconstruction and stabilization without engaging in combat.

He warned that the mission will face disinformation and attacks from groups opposed to peace. "There are people who do not want this to succeed," he said. "Thinking through how they'll try to undermine it — especially online — is vital."

He added that stabilization must move alongside local capacity-building. "You have to start training a vetted Palestinian police force and governance team," he said. "That's how you build legitimacy."

Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's effort to denuclearize Russia, how Putin has responded to the remarks and him presenting the first-ever Honor Award at the Patriot Awards.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday his country will draw up plans to conduct nuclear tests after President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would do the same last week.

The Kremlin leader said he has asked relevant departments to "submit coordinated proposals regarding the possible commencement of work to prepare for nuclear weapons testing."

"Russia has always strictly adhered and continues to adhere to its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and we have no plans to deviate from these commitments," Putin said at a meeting of the Russian national security council.

The treaty was signed but never ratified by the U.S.

If the U.S. or other signatories of the treaty begin nuclear testing, "Russia would also have to take appropriate and proportionate responsive measures," Putin added.

In the past week, Trump has both announced the U.S. will reignite nuclear testing and suggested he is working on a deal to denuclearize with Russia and China.

"We redid our nuclear — we're the number one nuclear power, which I hate to admit, because it's so horrible," Trump said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami.

"Russia's second. China's a distant third, but they'll catch us within four or five years," he added. "We're maybe working on a plan to denuclearize, the three of us. We'll see if that works."

Last week, Trump announced on Truth Social, "because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately."

The War Department handles the testing of nuclear-capable weapons, while the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) would be responsible for testing explosives.

Some 1400 workers, 80% of the NNSA, are currently on furlough due to the government shutdown.

The U.S. regularly tests nuclear-capable vehicles, missiles and rockets, but the U.S. has not conducted an explosive nuclear test since 1992. Russia's last known test was in 1990.

Russia last week did claim to test two delivery vehicles: an undersea torpedo known as Poseidon and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.

The U.S. conducted a nuclear-capable weapon test on Wednesday, launching the intercontinental ballistic missile Minuteman III into the air from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. It landed 4,200 miles away at a U.S. test site in the Marshall Islands.

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president who holds a top post on its security council, wrote on X that "No one knows what Trump meant about ‘nuclear testing'," adding, "he probably doesn't himself."

"But he's the president of the United States. And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself," Medvedev added.

Russia's defense minister, Andrey Belousov, said Wednesday that he believes the U.S. in general is "actively increasing its strategic offensive capabilities."

"We must, of course, focus not only — or even primarily — on statements and remarks made by American politicians and officials, but above all on the actual actions of the United States of America."

Federalism: It matters!

So far, the biggest successes against President Donald Trump's second-term assault on democracy have come not from Congress and the Supreme Court, but more unusual sources: lower-court judges, “No Kings” protests, a Disney+ subscriber boycott, and Trump's own indiscipline and incompetence.

After the 2025 elections, we can add the states to the list. And in some ways, this avenue of resistance may prove to be the most consequential one (at least until the 2026 midterms).

Tuesday's election results have, specifically, created a major barrier to one of Trump's most dangerous authoritarian ambitions — an attempted one-sided national gerrymander. But this major development should also be an opportunity for most people, who focus on national politics, to evaluate the power of state governments. The United States is unusual among backsliding democracies in the strength of its federal system, and that creates some major opportunities for institutional pushback that may not have been possible elsewhere.

This is somewhat ironic: For most of American history, states (most notably in the South) have been places where pockets of authoritarianism could exist in a nationally democratic society.

Yet today, as the national government moves in an authoritarian direction, the comparatively major powers invested in states — like control over election administration — are now creating opportunities for small-d democratic to resist a national authoritarian power grab.

For much of his second term, Trump has been preoccupied with the threat of losing the midterm elections. Convinced that such a defeat would spell disaster for his presidency, he has pushed state-level Republicans to engage in a highly unusual round of mid-cycle redistricting: basically, a nationwide attempt to rig the maps in the GOP's favor.

Of all the many anti-democratic things Trump has been doing, from illegally taking Congress's power of the purse to abusing regulatory powers to try to silence late-night comedy hosts, this was probably the greatest immediate-term threat to the integrity of the electoral system itself.

Because election administration is almost entirely devolved to the states in the American system, Trump has very limited powers to actually try and rig elections from DC. Instead, gerrymandering at the state level — threatening and cajoling governors and state legislatures into drawing as many safe seats for Republicans as possible — is his best shot at actually stacking the deck in the GOP's favor in 2026.

There is precedent for this abroad. After coming to power in 2010, Hungary's Viktor Orbán created a series of single-member districts that were drawn specifically to give disproportionate power to his Fidesz party's voters. This was a key reason he could maintain power despite rising unpopularity: In the 2014 election, Fidesz maintained over two-thirds of seats in parliament, a majority large enough to amend the constitution at will, despite winning only 44 percent of the national vote.

After last night's elections, Trump's pathway to a similarly unfair victory in 2026 got a lot dicier.

The most obvious reason is that Democrats gained new powers to counter-gerrymander. California voters endorsed a ballot referendum in support of Gov. Gavin Newsom's mid-cycle redistricting plan. And Virginia voters handed Democrats a super-majority in the statehouse, giving them the numbers they needed to pass their own new map. The Democratic gains in the two states put together could, per one calculation, cancel out or even exceed GOP gains from currently proposed gerrymanders in states like Texas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri.

This is hardly an ideal solution to the problem of gerrymandering. As my friend Kelsey Piper writes in The Argument, gerrymandering in any sense is bad for democracy: It decreases voters' ability to make meaningful political choices. The best-case scenario would be a national ban on partisan map-drawing, one that would allow Republicans in blue states and Democrats in red ones equally fair levels of representation in the House.

But in criticizing counter-gerrymandering, Piper misses two other important factors: national representativeness and power.

If only one party gerrymanders, then the effect is to give that party an unfair advantage relative to their true level of national support. If both parties gerrymander in ways that cancel each other out, then the results of the national House election look a lot more like the will of the national electorate as a whole. That makes the outcome meaningfully more democratic than a one-sided gerrymander, even if on a district-by-district level it is far less fair and representative than it should be.

More fundamentally, though, counter-gerrymandering is necessary to put a break on Trump's authoritarian ambitions.

In competitive authoritarian systems like Hungary's, no individual move is decisive in ending democracy. Democracy instead dies from an accumulation of incremental advantages, each working in tandem to make it nearly impossible for the opposition to win fairly. Of those, gerrymandering is among the most singularly important weapons. It directly raises the threshold of national unpopularity that the incumbent party needs to reach to lose the legislature, and thus lose its power to pass legislation empowering an authoritarian executive.

Preventing the party from attaining that advantage, then, is a direct blow to their attempt to stay in power indefinitely and undemocratically. If Democrats had not won approval for counter-gerrymandering in California and Virginia, Trump would be meaningfully closer to creating a system like Hungary's.

There is, internationally, a fairly well-worn playbook for an elected leader who wishes to seize autocratic control. They consolidate formal power in their own hands, neuter independent checks on their authority, undermine the fairness of election administration, and impose political constraints on civil society and big business.

In Trump's second term, he has attempted to check every box — helped along by a completely pliant GOP majority in Congress and a Supreme Court that has only rarely ruled against him on executive power. On paper, this seems like a recipe for democratic failure. In recent cases of resistance, such as Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro failed to consolidate power and lost his 2022 reelection bid, and South Korea, where activists and legislators stopped President Yoon Suk Yeol's overnight coup attempt in 2024, presidents lacked meaningful control over the other two branches of government.

But in the American system, control over the federal government isn't the entire ball game. Many of the key functions of state, like election administration and policing, are handled at the local level. That has, as my colleague Ian Millhiser points out, presented significant legal barriers to Trump's authoritarian consolidation. It is much harder to rig elections or successfully prosecute your political opponents when a real measure of power in those areas is delegated to localities that you do not control.

That being said, federalism is not a panacea against authoritarian takeovers. A recent study by three political scientists found four cases of countries with federal systems where the national leadership attempted an authoritarian power seizure: the US during Trump's first term, Brazil, India, and Venezuela. In Brazil and the United States, they found that states posed a major barrier to said takeovers. By contrast, states in India and Venezuela were less effective in stymying national backsliding.

In their view, the key differences were the balances of formal and partisan power. In the US and Brazil, states have greater control over core government functions than they did in India and Venezuela. Moreover, the opposition had control over greater numbers of states in the first pair of countries than in the second.

It's not that strong federalism guarantees democracy: Any look at American history shows that, in fact, federalism can allow authoritarianism to rise and thrive at the local level. Rather, it's that the US federal system creates opportunities for contestation when the national government is moving in an authoritarian direction — one that people in non-federal collapsed democracies, like Hungary and Turkey, simply didn't have.

These fights do not just matter for the state in question, but rather directly implicate the powers available to the executive branch. It's possible to think of states as a kind of “fourth branch” of the federal government, one imposing constraints on the executive's efforts at power consolidation even when the federal firewalls are failing.

We can see this at work, very obviously, in the 2025 Virginia election results. But there will be many fights to come in statehouses and governors' mansions, ranging from red-state decisions on complying with Trump's demands to gerrymander to blue-state decisions over checking abusive federal law enforcement, that can serve as a crucial backstop in the year-plus before the midterm elections provide an opportunity to stiffen federal resistance.

A federal judge in Illinois ordered authorities at an ICE facility near Chicago to improve the living conditions for detainees following complaints this week.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman ordered the facility to ensure that detainees have access to a clean bedding mat and sufficient space to sleep, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste, menstrual products and prescribed medications.

"People shouldn't be sleeping next to overflowing toilets," Gettlemen wrote. "They should not be sleeping on top of each other."

The ruling comes after detainees filed a lawsuit last week. They complained at a Tuesday hearing of crowded sleeping conditions, non-functioning toilets and water that tasted like "sewer."

Gettlemen's order further requires that detainees' living facilities must be cleaned twice per day and that detainees be given the chance to shower at least once every other day. They must also have access to three meals a day and bottled water upon request, according to NBC News.

DOJ attorney Jana Brady, who represented the government at Tuesday's hearing, argued that conditions at the facility had already been improving for several months. She said the lack of bed space is a result of the facility not being intended for long-term housing.

Wednesday's order comes as President Donald Trump continues to lean on ICE to ramp up deportations, saying in a "60 Minutes" interview that raids "haven't gone far enough."

"You have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from, frankly, mental institutions," Trump said. "I feel badly about that, but they're released from insane asylums. You know why? Because they're killers."

The White House has repeatedly said federal agents are targeting criminal illegal migrants who are the "worst of the worst."

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities confirmed Thursday that the remains of a hostage returned the previous day from Gaza are of a Tanzanian agricultural student in Israel who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023 in the Hamas-led attack that started the war.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the remains were identified as those of Joshua Loitu Mollel and that his family has been notified. The development was the latest step forward under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. 

Mollel, 21, had arrived at kibbutz Nahal Oz only 19 days before the attack, after finishing agricultural college back home and looking to gain experience in Israel he could apply in Tanzania. He is survived by two parents and four siblings in Tanzania.

“Joshua's return offers some comfort to a family that has endured unbearable uncertainty for over two years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement.




There are now six bodies of hostages that remain in Gaza. The territory's militants have released 22 bodies of hostages since the ceasefire began last month. Among the six bodies still in Gaza is that of Sudthisak Rinthalak, an agricultural worker from Thailand, the only non-Israeli.

Hamas returned 20 living hostages to Israel on Oct. 13. The subsequent exchanges of the dead are the central component of the initial phase of the deal which requires Hamas return all hostage remains as quickly as possible. 

The exchanges have gone ahead even as Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching other terms of the agreement.

Israel has handed over 285 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which handles the exchanges. 

Health officials in Gaza have said identifying the remains handed over by Israel is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits. Israel has not disclosed how many bodies it is holding or where they were recovered, but has been returning 15 for each set of hostage remains handed over. 

Hamas has said that recovering bodies is complicated by the widespread devastation in the coastal enclave and has returned one to three bodies every few days. Israel has pushed to speed up the returns. In several cases, the remains have turned out not to be those of hostages. 

Separately, Israeli concerns over weapons smuggling with the use of drones along its 200-kilometer (130-mile) border with Egypt prompted the the country's defense minister on Thursday to order a border area be designated as a closed-off military zone to curb the illegal activity. 

Israel Katz said troops would also be authorized to fire on smugglers operating in the zone, according to a statement from his office.

“Anyone who enters the unauthorized area will be harmed,” said Katz.

Katz on Wednesday met with top military and security officials who also agreed to work on designating arms smuggling as a terrorist threat so that “security forces deploy appropriate tools to combat the threat.” 

U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan calls for an international stabilization force for Gaza and diplomats are working to define its role, persuade Arab countries to take part, and win wider international support.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the force would need the legitimacy of a U.N. Security Council mandate. 

The United States said Wednesday that representatives from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates met with 10 non-permanent U.N. Security Council members about getting support for a U.N. Security Council resolution on Gaza.

Also, the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said Wednesday the bloc is looking to extend the mandates of its two current missions helping the Palestinian Authority train a police force and bolster security procedures as a way to contribute to the stabilization force. 

A freed Israeli hostage said he was stripped naked and beaten by Palestinian militants who held him for two years in Gaza. His testimony makes him the latest of several hostages released from Gaza to report being sexually abused in captivity.

Parts of Ron Braslavski's account was published in the Daily Mail newspaper, ahead of the full interview set to air on Israel's Channel 13 later on Thursday night.

In the clips, Braslavski said his captors had starved and sexually abused him and he recounts how he prayed for the abuse to stop.

“It was sexual violence and its main purpose was to humiliate me,” he said. “While I was there — every day, every beating — I'd say to myself, ‘I survived another day in hell.'” 

Braslavski was a guard at the Nova musical festival and was captured by the militants who overran the grounds during the October 2023 attack on southern Israel. He was released last month as part of the ceasefire agreement.

Released Palestinians who had been seized from Gaza during the war and held in Israeli prisons have reported being stripped down to their underwear during their initial detention and frequent beatings by guards, as well as sexual abuse, being bound for days, causing infections that led to amputations of limbs in some cases, and insufficient food or medical care. 

At least 75 Palestinians have died in Israeli prisons and detention facilities during the war, according to the U.N. The Israeli military has said it abides by international standards in its prisons.

The 2023 attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel sweeping military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

            Millions of Americans expecting to fly this month could have their plans grounded if the government shutdown drags on.
    


            Starting Friday, the Trump administration will reduce flights at 40 airports nationwide if the shutdown continues.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration's “Core 30” airports are among those on a preliminary list of sites expected to be impacted, an FAA source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN. 



            Here's what to know if the travel nightmare turns into reality Friday:
    


The “Core 30” high-traffic airports include New York City's three major hubs and large airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington, DC, the source said.
    


            Another 10 airports across the country are expected to be impacted.
    


            “As we start to implement this drawdown in service, it will be restricted to these 40 high-volume traffic markets,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We're going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules.”
    


Trump administration will reduce traffic at 40 airports across the US starting Friday if shutdown continues



            Flight volume will be reduced by 10%, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Thursday. But he did not say whether that's 10% of the flight volume at the 40 impacted airports, or 10% of all US flights – which would be significantly more.
    


            Either way, a 10% reduction could result in thousands of canceled flights a day – an unprecedented cut.
    


            “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram.
    


            “Don't book a basic ticket. For example, book Economy on Frontier so you can reuse the ticket value as changes are free or you can get a credit,” Biffle wrote. “If your flight is cancelled your chances of being stranded are high so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline.”
    


            Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are both offering waivers to allow passengers who do not want to fly to change their tickets without fees.
    


Is it safe to fly during the government shutdown? Here's what aviation experts say



            It's also helpful to book directly with an airline instead of through a third-party website. That's because if your flight gets canceled, you might have to deal with another party to resolve the problem.
    


            And try to avoid booking flights with layovers, the US Public Interest Research Group says. The more planes you have to get on to reach your destination, the more chances there are for a flight to be delayed or canceled.
    


            The government shutdown, which started on October 1, has prevented many federal employees from getting paid.
    


            Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are considered essential employees during the shutdown and are expected to go to work. But they're not getting paid, and some have needed to find other sources of income to pay the bills.
    


            More than 400 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis.
    


            The longer the shutdown drags on, the more risks could emerge – especially as controllers go longer without pay, a union leader said earlier this week. But federal officials say reducing the number of flights will improve safety.
    


            “We're supposed to go to work and be 100%, 100% of the time. I'm going to work right now, and I'm thinking about, how do I pay my rent?” said Nick Daniels, the president of the union.
    


            “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” Daniels told CNN earlier this week.
    


            But the newly announced flight cuts will help maintain safety, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
    


            “THIS is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system, and it's the right thing to do,” National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy posted on X.
    


            “NTSB has repeatedly stated low air traffic control staffing levels, mandatory overtime, and six-day work weeks have a direct impact on #safety.”

            For nine months, congressional Republicans have largely stood idly by as President Donald Trump has gone to great lengths to try to expand the power of the presidency, demolish norms and disregard laws.
    


            But increasingly, the implications of those power grabs are starting to come into focus – and specifically, what they might mean when the shoe is on the other foot the next time Democrats are in charge.
    


            And Republicans seem to be starting to reckon with that.
    


            Perhaps most striking was a scene Wednesday at the Supreme Court, during oral arguments in a challenge to Trump's worldwide tariffs.
    


            The day prior, a CNBC host had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent whether he worried about a Democratic president abusing the power Trump was claiming. Host Joe Kernen posited that this future president could levy large tariffs on energy based solely on a declaration that there was a climate change emergency. Bessent demurred, saying, “I would question whether there's a climate emergency.”
    


            But that's not really the point. The point is that the Trump administration has more or less argued that it wouldn't matter if there was actually a climate emergency; it says all that really matters is that a president would say there's one, and that the courts lack the authority to question that.
    


            While Bessent was able to squirm out of this hypothetical on Tuesday, the Trump administration wasn't so fortunate at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
    


            In fact, three justices – including Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch – pressed the Trump administration's solicitor general, D. John Sauer, on this exact hypothetical.
    


            Gorsuch asked whether a president could impose a 50% tariff on gas-powered cars and auto parts by simply claiming a climate emergency.
    


            Sauer, like Bessent, cast doubt on whether that declaration would be accurate. But he otherwise acknowledged: “It's very likely that could be done. Very likely.”
    


            When Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether anyone would be able to challenge that declaration, Sauer suggested the bar would be sky-high.
    


            “That would be a situation where at least there'd be a very, very, very deferential judicial review of that kind of determination,” Sauer said. He again emphasized the courts' review should be “very, very deferential and easily satisfied.”
    


            The exchanges laid bare the potential cost of tariff-skeptical Republicans' acquiescence to Trump.
    


            Trump is attempting to set a precedent that his own administration says could be wielded by a liberal president in huge ways that Republicans would very much not like.
    


            (Of course, Congress could simply assert its power over tariffs and prevent all that. But that would require actually standing up to Trump.)
    


            Another example in recent days is the burgeoning GOP debate over getting rid of the filibuster.
    


            Trump seems to have settled on the so-called “nuclear option” as his recipe for ending the now-record-breaking federal government shutdown. He wants Republican senators to make it so that legislation only requires a bare majority (which Republicans currently have) rather than the currently required 60 votes.
    


            Trump has long desired this, of course. But the current debate has apparently given him a good opportunity to break down one of his most significant remaining obstacles.
    


            But it's also led to some rather unusual and pretty firm pushback among Republicans. Their argument: This would be a disaster when Democrats have power.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly predicted Democrats would add Democratic senators by making Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states. He's said they would pack the Supreme Court to overturn the current conservative advantage. And he's said they would restrict gun rights, among other liberal grab-bag policies.
    


            “(The filibuster) holds us back from the Democrats' worst impulses,” Johnson said this week.
    


            Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania have made similar points.
    


            “And listen: Just imagine a world where there's no filibuster and you have the crazy radical part of the Democratic Party in charge,” McCormick told Fox News over the weekend. “We would become a country of socialism.”
    


            Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered similar warnings after Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel over a joke about Trump and Charlie Kirk. Cruz compared it to mob tactics and called it “dangerous as hell.”
    


            “Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again – wins the White House … they will silence us,” Cruz said. “They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.”
    


            We even saw a smattering of these kinds of objections to Trump's extraordinary deployments of the National Guard around the country.
    


            “I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina,” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told The Hill last month.
    


            Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt in comments to the New York Times warned his fellow Republicans about the precedent set by a president working with governors of other states to impose National Guard troops on a state where officials didn't want that.
    


            “We believe in the federalist system — that's states' rights,” Stitt said, adding: “Oklahomans would lose their mind if (Gov. JB) Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”
    


            Washington state Republican Party Chairman Jim Walsh has also reportedly raised concerns about future presidents overusing the National Guard.
    


            And Vice President JD Vance last week was pressed on such a hypothetical during a Turning Point USA event. A student told him the Guard deployments were “kind of disturbing me a little bit,” because of how Democrats might use such a precedent against conservatives.
    


            Vance urged the student not to worry about such things.
    


            “It's an important part of my entire political philosophy – is we cannot be afraid to do something, because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said. “The left is already going to do it, regardless of whether we do it.”
    


            Of course, there is no actual evidence Democrats have prepared to do such things with the National Guard.
    


            Indeed, former President Barack Obama recently wondered aloud what the right would say if he imposed the National Guard on a red state like Texas. “It is mind-boggling to me how Fox News would have responded,” Obama said.
    


            And this is also an area in which the administration has basically claimed unchecked presidential power when pressed by judges.
    


            During an appeals-court hearing back in June, a Trump-appointed judge asked top DOJ official Brett Shumate if it was the Trump administration's position that a president's decision to call up militias from all 50 states and the District of Columbia was un-reviewable by the courts. Shumate said that it was.
    


            In other words, Obama, under this line of thinking, would indeed have been able to send the Guard into Texas, no questions asked.
    


            These kinds of hypotheticals haven't caused Republicans to truly move to check Trump's power, at least not yet. But if anything, the elections this week, in which Democrats won pretty resoundingly, should remind them that the shoe could be on the other foot relatively soon.
    


            Of course, Trump has an answer for that, too. Maybe if he just gets all the power, he'll make it so Democrats never actually win power again.
    


            “Now, if we do what I'm saying (on the filibuster), they'll most likely never attain power,” Trump told GOP senators on Wednesday. “Because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.”
    


            It seems unlikely GOP senators will actually buy into that.

LEESBURG, VIRGINIA — When Winsome Earle-Sears's campaign bus caught fire on a Virginia highway days before the election, it offered a fitting metaphor for a gubernatorial bid that never found its footing and ultimately went up in flames.

Earle-Sears, the Republican lieutenant governor who once made history as the first Black woman elected in Virginia, lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger by nearly fifteen points on Tuesday. Earle-Sears's blowout even stunned veteran operatives accustomed to Virginia's blue tilt. What began as an attempt to extend Gov. Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) conservative blueprint ended in disarray, undone by weak fundraising, muddled messaging, and a candidate critics say never fully engaged the grind of a modern statewide campaign.

Virginia Republican strategist Brian Kirwin said Earle-Sears faced “the wind in her face the entire time,” noting that off-year elections typically punish the party in the White House. But he said her problems went far beyond the political environment. “Her campaign was pretty haphazard,” he said. “She ran a social-issues campaign on transgenders and bathrooms when everybody in the world is screaming [about the] economy.”

As of October 23, Spanberger had raised $65.6 million to Earle-Sears's $35.5 million, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. That gap shaped everything while Spanberger flooded the airwaves with ads on affordability and later tied Republicans to the October government shutdown. Earle-Sears stayed focused on cultural fights, spending more than $2 million in September alone on commercials about transgender athletes and school bathrooms, more than on any other topic.

The shutdown, which began just two weeks before Election Day, shuttered parts of the federal government and left tens of thousands of Virginians temporarily out of work or without pay. It became a rallying cry for Democrats, especially in Northern Virginia, where Spanberger blamed Republican dysfunction in Washington, D.C., for the disruption. 

Republican operatives say it was nearly impossible for Earle-Sears to blunt the impact. One strategist described it as “a perfect storm that juiced Democratic enthusiasm in exactly the parts of the state she needed to win.”

Rather than closing the race with a forward-looking pitch to voters, Earle-Sears poured millions into ads defending herself.  One of her final statewide spots, a six-figure buy, tried to reframe a viral moment when she told hecklers, “I'm speaking now.” Spanberger's campaign had looped the clip in a string of attack ads painting her as combative and unprepared. Earle-Sears's response, opening with, “They pick your worst day,” sought to cast the moment as proof of her grit as a Marine, but it only reinforced the image of a candidate more focused on explaining herself than persuading voters.

Kirwin said Earle-Sears's message never adjusted. “You can be a victim of your own polling,” he said. “You come off as tone-deaf when people are worried about paying their mortgage or being able to afford rent.”

Behind the scenes, Earle-Sears's campaign never gained traction. Even before the general election began, her candidacy showed signs of strain. In the spring, she narrowly avoided a primary challenge from former state Sen. Amanda Chase, a staunch Trump ally whose fiery brand of politics threatened to pull the race further right. Party officials ultimately ruled that Chase failed to submit enough valid signatures to make the ballot, sparing Earle-Sears a costly fight, but exposing early fractures among Virginia Republicans. 

By April, those divisions had deepened. Earle-Sears and her running mate, lieutenant governor hopeful John Reid, stopped speaking for weeks after Gov. Glenn Youngkin privately urged Reid, a Richmond radio host and the state's first openly gay statewide nominee, to suspend his campaign. The request came after allegations surfaced that Reid had reposted nude photos of men years earlier on a Tumblr account linked to his social media. The episode left the Republican ticket splintered for much of the spring, with candidates campaigning separately at a time when they needed to project unity.

The sense of dysfunction soon spilled into public view. In one embarrassing episode, the campaign's website featured watermarked stock photos on its issues page, prompting veteran GOP strategist Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 campaign, to deride Earle-Sears's team as “amateurs.” The blunder deepened doubts about whether Earle-Sears had assembled a team capable of running a modern statewide campaign.

Under mounting pressure from donors, Earle-Sears replaced her campaign manager, a pastor with no prior political experience, in an attempted reset. It didn't take. The shake-up did little to steady the campaign, as public events were limited, and advisers struggled to sharpen the message, with polls showing her trailing.

“She could never stay on message, could never drive a message, didn't grind it the way that you just have to in a place as difficult to win as Virginia,” said a Republican strategist based in Virginia.

Earle-Sears's aversion to fundraising added to the frustration. Several Republicans familiar with the operation said she often went days without making donor calls or holding events, instead taking “personal admin days.” By late summer, conservative radio host John Fredericks publicly urged Youngkin to “take control” of her campaign, calling its lack of visible activity “embarrassing.”

National GOP strategist Brian Seitchik was even blunter: “She was a miserable candidate. Ran a miserable campaign, and her loss was a foregone conclusion. She had no ability to connect with voters, no ability to raise the resources necessary, and was unable to win the confidence of Virginia independents.”The Washington Examiner reached out to Sears's campaign for this story.

The campaign's press operation was highly unorganized and largely unresponsive until the final stretch. Earle-Sears appeared on Fox News several times but granted few interviews elsewhere. Several Virginia outlets reported that their requests had been denied or ignored, including VPM News, which said it had reached out multiple times over two months to schedule an interview for its statewide candidate series, with no success.

Business groups had similar experiences. Cardinal News reported that Virginia FREE, a pro-business organization that meets with major candidates each cycle, tried for three months to secure a meeting with Earle-Sears while her Democratic opponent had already met with them. The pattern left reporters and business leaders uncertain about her positions on key issues as the race entered its final months.

The Earle-Sears campaign's struggles were compounded by the silence from the top of her party.

Trump's distance from Virginia politics is nothing new. In 2021, he endorsed Glenn Youngkin's campaign for governor. Still, he stayed off the trail as Youngkin kept him at arm's length, avoiding joint appearances and downplaying the MAGA agenda to win over suburban voters. The dynamic, though, was far different today. Back then, Trump was an unpopular former president. Now he's back in the White House.

Throughout this year's race, Trump kept Earle-Sears at a distance. He phoned into two brief get-out-the-vote calls for Virginia Republicans ahead of the election, urging voters to “vote Republican up and down the line” but never mentioning Earle-Sears by name. The gesture stood in sharp contrast to former President Barack Obama, who spent the weekend campaigning in person for Spanberger.

The omission appeared deliberate. Trump declined to issue a formal endorsement, referring to Earle-Sears only as “the Republican candidate” and saying he “hadn't been too involved in Virginia.” His list of social-media endorsements in the campaign's final days included dozens of other GOP hopefuls, but not her.

The distance reflected both political pragmatism and personal history. Earle-Sears drew Trump's ire in 2022 after suggesting he had become “a liability” to the party following midterm losses. Trump shot back, labeling her “a phony.” The two have maintained a polite but distant relationship ever since.

Strategists say that dynamic left Earle-Sears stranded, too cautious to embrace Trump but unable to energize his base without him. 

In the end, Earle-Sears's biggest problem wasn't money or organization; it was the message.

She built her candidacy around cultural flashpoints, devoting more time to transgender issues than to the economy, even as polls showed inflation and the cost of living were voters' top concerns. A September survey of likely Virginia voters by Christopher Newport University found that affordability was the dominant issue across the electorate, followed by threats to democracy. Democrats overwhelmingly named threats to democracy as their biggest concern, while Republicans were divided among economic pressures, immigration, and crime.

“Spanberger ran a pretty textbook good campaign,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “She didn't make any major mistakes, didn't leave a door open for Earle-Sears to get in very easily.”

“At the end of the day, people were worried about the economy,” Richards added. “It was going to be very difficult for Earle-Sears to really run on that when her party is supposedly in charge of everything.”

When Democrats called a surprise redistricting session in early October, forcing her back to Richmond just as early voting ramped up, Earle-Sears barely mentioned it on the trail, beyond holding a press conference a week before the election. 

While other Republicans running blasted the move as “election interference,” she glossed over it for days before adopting the same language, a sign, strategists said, of her difficulty adapting to fast-moving events.

The same problem surfaced with the controversy surrounding Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, whose leaked text messages appeared to reference violence toward Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. The story dominated headlines for a week, and Republicans across the state seized on it. But rather than folding the episode into a broader argument about Democratic governance or accountability, Earle-Sears and the entire Republican ticket made it their singular focus, hammering it long after voters had moved on.

“It was appropriate to call attention to something that outrageous,” said a Virginia Republican strategist. “But it shouldn't have been the centerpiece of the message. You can use it to motivate turnout, not as your entire argument for why people should vote for you.”

Earle-Sears's stump speech evolved little over the course of the race, though she frequently returned to familiar themes and routines. At many campaign stops, she performed a recurring bit in which she mimed speaking directly to Spanberger, responding to the Democrat's reaction to the Jay Jones controversy. She would raise her voice and imitate her opponent's tone, “Abigail, all she said was unhappy, she was disgusted. Oh, so it's all about you, Abigail,” drawing laughter from loyal supporters. The act became a regular feature of her rallies in the campaign's final weeks.

To many strategists, that moment summed up the problem. “It's not that voters disagreed with her,” said a separate GOP operative in Virginia. “It's that she wasn't talking about what they cared about. When people are worried about paying their bills, they don't want a lecture on bathrooms or a comedy bit onstage.”

The fallout extended beyond her own race. “This could have been a closer contest,” the operative added. “But the margin that she lost by isn't just the wave; a good chunk of that percentage is her campaign messaging and her actual campaign organization. That margin brought other Republicans down with her.”

For Virginia Republicans, the scope of Earle-Sears's defeat was devastating. Her fifteen-point loss to Spanberger didn't just end a campaign; it wiped out the gains the party made under Glenn Youngkin and left Republicans without a single statewide officeholder for the first time in nearly a decade. 

“It's a low point right now for sure,” said Zack Roday, a Republican strategist based in Virginia. “We were at rock bottom in 2017 and 2019, then Youngkin came along and the pendulum swung back. It can happen again, but only with great candidates, real money, and flawless campaigns.”

DEMOCRATS WIDEN MAJORITY IN VIRGINIA STATE HOUSE TO MAINTAIN LEGISLATIVE CONTROL

Roday said the party's challenge now is rebuilding credibility in a state that has steadily trended blue. “There absolutely could be a snapback election,” he said. “But you need to run really good campaigns with really good candidates that are really well funded. There aren't a lot of Glenn Youngkins out there.”

The bus fire that came days before the election captured the state of her campaign, overheated, off-course, and unable to recover. For Virginia Republicans, the blaze may be out, but the scorch marks remain.

    CNN's Isobel Yeung traveled to Libya to investigate refugees being tortured for ransom. Subscribe to watch the full report.



            From the living room of her third-floor apartment in rural Germany, Abeba winces as she stares at her phone.
    


            “This will be my final message,” her younger brother Daniel says in an audio message. “I understand that you may not have the financial means to assist me directly, and I never expected that from you. Please, just make sure my message reaches those who might be able to help.”
    


            She and her husband don't know exactly where her brother is. Somewhere in southern Libya. They've heard it's an area called Kufra. What they do know is that every time he calls, or they receive a video, he's being mercilessly tortured by men who remain off camera. Videos seen by CNN show Daniel being tied up, urinated on, kicked, and beaten with a metal pole. CNN is using pseudonyms for Daniel and Abeba because they fear retribution.
    


            If his family doesn't manage to gather the $10,000 being demanded by his captors, he may soon be dead.
    


            CNN has spoken to dozens of individuals and families in their situation. Daniel is just one of an unknown number of migrants who are currently being tortured on a near daily basis, somewhere in Libya's Sahara Desert.
    


            Libya, in North Africa, has long been the transit country of choice for those hoping to travel across the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe. At the northeast corner of the Sahara Desert, its vast wilderness marks the final leg on the African continent for those fleeing war, persecution, and lack of opportunity in search of a better life.
    


            The passengers on this dangerous route change over time as conflicts ebb and flow. Recently, the vast majority have been coming from Sudan, embroiled in a brutal civil war which has displaced millions.
    


            Inevitably, human smuggling is big business.
    


            Much of it is relatively functional – insofar as clients pay several hundred dollars to be transported in bare-bones conditions to Libya's coast, and onto an overcrowded inflatable dingy bound for Italy or Greece.
    


            But if someone is unlucky enough to come from a country perceived to have a large diaspora – wealthy, at least compared to everyone else – then they stand a good chance of falling into the hands not of smugglers, but of traffickers, who coerce and exploit those in their control.
    


            Eritreans, who make up the second largest share of refugees recorded in Libya according to the United Nations, fall into this group. Their dictatorial hermit nation is often called Africa's North Korea. Many thousands flee its mandatory, indefinite military service – and some fall prey to exploitative trafficking gangs.
    


            This is what happened to Abeba's brother.
    


            Flying over the Sahara in the back of a Soviet-era Mi-17 twin-turbo helicopter, it's clear to see how the traffickers operate with such impunity.
    


            The desert is vast. The barren Martian landscape stretches as far as the eye can see, interrupted only occasionally by the faintest of tire tracks marking the unpaved road on Libya's north-south route.
    


            “We are doing our best with the capabilities that we have,” Col. Mohammad Hassan Rahil says from the desert hilltop post he commands near the Sudanese border.
    


            His forces are part of the Libyan National Army and live in a small, air-conditioned compound, surrounded by hundreds of miles of desert on all sides. They drive up and down the sandy tracks and stop any suspicious vehicles. But the traffickers know this terrain far better than they do. To an observer, their efforts appear futile in the extreme.
    


            That's plain to see in Al Jawf, the first major settlement migrants encounter as they transit Libya's vast Kufra province from south to north.
    


            From the fetid and overcrowded cells of the town's migrant detention center, officers pick out a Sudanese man who had been arrested the day before.
    


            They believe him to be “a money man” – helping to transfer money between relatives of trafficking victims who live abroad, like Abeba, and the traffickers both in Libya and in foreign safe havens who profit from the industry.
    


            “I receive them, then deduct my commission,” he readily tells the interrogator of the payments. CNN is not identifying him because he was not formally charged.
    


            The industry is highly compartmentalized. Many of the payments are sent through an informal money transfer system known as “hawala.” Because it is widely used to send legitimate remittances and operates entirely on a human-to-human level via text messages and phone calls, it is nearly impossible to track.
    


            “Does he torture them?” the interrogator asks the Sudanese man of the trafficker to whom he allegedly transfers money.
    


            It is entirely feasible that this man has no idea the extent of the sordid industry he is facilitating.
    


            “Only God knows,” the Sudanese man replies.
    

Torture videos are currently circulating on social media – and being sent to families around the world. Thousands of dollars in ransoms are demanded in exchange for their freedom. CNN traveled to Libya's Sahara Desert to investigate this global trafficking ring.


            But he does have some useful information. The trafficker and his “passengers” were operating from a farm not even a kilometer from the police base.
    


            The police set off to raid the premises. But by the time the convoy of pickup trucks arrives there, it's too late. Foreign passports and bedding are strewn across the rooms, but both captors and victims are long gone.
    


            When the traffickers are stopped, it's usually because of luck, not advanced police work. Three years ago, two Sudanese men stumbled into a police station in the desert town of Tazirbu.
    


            They explained that they'd just escaped from a nearby farm, where hundreds of other men were being held for ransom – beaten as their families were extorted for money.
    


            Police geared up and stormed the compound, using a hoe to knock the padlock off a door inside. In grainy footage taken that August day, dozens of men streamed out of the cramped room in which they were confined and yelled “Allahu Akbar!” as they walked into the sunlight, their arms held to the sky.
    


            As the police gathered them in the courtyard, they began yelling and pointing at one man who had not been in the room with them: their captor.
    


            His name is Tsinat Tesfay – an Eritrean man in his mid 30s. Convicted last year of “forced disappearance,” he is now serving a life sentence at Benghazi Central Prison, where CNN was granted extraordinary access to speak with him. Benghazi is controlled by the Libyan National Army, under commander Khalifa Haftar, rather than the divided country's internationally recognized Government of National Unity.
    


            “I didn't do anything,” Tesfay told CNN. “I only say that it was a mistake that I came to Libya. Just that.”
    


            The trafficker groups are often an eclectic mix – Libyans alongside nationals from the migrants' native lands, who translate on the ransom calls to families, and are often the enforcers for payments.
    


            The money rarely stays in Libya. In 2023, Emirati forces operating in Sudan arrested Kidane Zekarias Habtemariam, an alleged Eritrean trafficking kingpin, and rendered him to the UAE. He is awaiting extradition to the Netherlands, where prosecutors are planning to try him. He has not yet entered a plea, according to prosecutors.
    


            A Dutch court is already set to hear a case this month against another Eritrean man, who has been charged with allegedly being part of a criminal organization that specializes in human smuggling, taking hostages, extortion, and violence including sexual violence.
    


            Tesfay claims that he himself was trafficked by Kidane's network – a victim, not a perpetrator. He denies seeing anyone tortured.
    


            “I haven't seen or heard anything,” he said. “I haven't seen anything in front of me. I am in a warehouse, I eat, I drink, paid my money (to be smuggled through Libya), then I was taken out.”
    


            There is nothing, he said, to read into the fact that he was free to roam the compound when police arrived on the scene. And yet, when questioned on why so many Eritreans join the trafficking networks in Libya, the explanation he gives is clear.
    


            “They want money,” Tesfay said. “They want money, so they work in trafficking. They want to change their lives.”
    


            It's a simple explanation with profound consequences.
    


            In Benghazi's Ganfuda Detention Center, dozens of young women and girls crowd the floor of a warehouse strewn with foam mattresses and the plastic-bag detritus of an itinerant life.
    


            Most of the people here have already paid the ransoms demanded and been released from captivity in the Sahara. They've since been picked up by local authorities and detained for illegal entry into Libya. Now they await help from the United Nations or non-governmental organizations – help that often takes months to arrive.
    


            Among them is a 16-year-old Eritrean teenager, whom CNN is calling Abrihet because she is a minor.
    


            “These guys, they touched me,” she says of her former captors. “They touch you. Your hand. Your leg. I can't explain it.”
    


            A government-provided doctor in Benghazi has confirmed she's not pregnant, but that's the extent of the help she's received so far. Every day, the women and girls around her sob in traumatic memory of what happened to them. Each has their own heart-wrenching story of abuse and misery.
    


            Abrihet looks down at her forearms, which are criss-crossed with the scars of self-harm.
    


            “I want to die too much. I want. But I can't… I want to die, but I cannot do it.”
    


            For girls like Abrihet, it is impossible to contemplate how this network of abuse is allowed to continue, year after year.
    


            Responsibility for stopping it falls on Col. Mohammed Al-Fadhil, from Libya's Department for Combating Illegal Migration (DCIM). In a divided country, with rival governments, the agency is an oddity in operating nationwide, in both the internationally recognized west and the Haftar-controlled east and south.
    


            The situation, he insists, is much better than it once was. But the international community needs to step up.
    


            “Look, this matter requires participation by states,” he said. “It's a partnership issue. All countries should share it. The whole European Union, the countries impacted by illegal migration. They should all be partners to eradicate the phenomenon.”
    


            In 2016, the European Union struck a deal with Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli that funded Libyan forces to prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. It resulted in a sharp drop in people taking what is known as the Central Mediterranean route from North Africa to Europe over the next few years, but also meant they were often held in squalid Libyan detention centers.
    


            The number of migrants braving the dangerous crossing has been rising in recent months, particularly between eastern Libya and Greece, where it is up more than three-fold in a year. And Eritreans are among those most likely to take the risk – they are now the second-largest national group arriving in Italy, after Bangladeshis.
    


            Human rights groups have accused DCIM of maintaining inhumane conditions and using violence against migrants. A UN experts panel alleged that those migrants freed during the Tazirbu raid were subject to further abuses at the hands of DCIM. Al-Fadhil said that the accusation was “useless if it is not accompanied by clear evidence.”
    


            There were just over 100,000 refugees and asylum-seekers registered in Libya as of October. But the true number of those in Libya fleeing conflict is undoubtedly much larger, because the UN – which registers refugees – only operates in areas controlled by the internationally recognized government in western Libya. UN officials have appealed for help in expanding their efforts to help the influx of Sudanese refugees in Libya.
    


            Haftar, who controls eastern and southern Libya, runs a government unrecognized by the United States or European powers. It is just one of the many reasons why increasingly heightened anti-immigration sentiment in Europe has not translated into more cooperation to stop southern Libya's smugglers and traffickers.
    


            Following months of agony and fundraising, Abeba was eventually able to send enough money to pay for her brother Daniel's release. He is now in Libya's western city of Tripoli: still far from being reunited with his family.
    


            But her distress over seeing him so brutally abused – and losing her entire family's life savings to secure his freedom – has broken her.
    


            “May God punish them for what they did,” she cried. “How many mothers are crying blood and tears for their children and loved ones? I beg you, tell this story to the world.”

A win for Democrats in blue New Jersey's gubernatorial race was not surprising, but the victory was attributed to a larger trend at play: Republicans desperately need to work on voter turnout, and President Donald Trump needs to rethink how he conveys his policies.

Rep. Mikie Sherrill's (D-NJ) decisive win against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, as well as other Democratic victories Tuesday night, have been brushed off by national Republicans as a predetermined outcome, arguing it is not reflective of how voters across the country perceive the GOP.

However, Sherrill managed to flip key counties that Trump won in 2024, and she attracted more of the Latino vote, a historically blue voting bloc that helped the president narrow his margin in the Garden State last November. 

The New Jersey election essentially boiled down to Ciattarelli's inability to motivate Trump voters and supporters to turn out for the election, as well as a larger rebuke nationwide of Republican policies.

Republicans historically do not match Democrats' turnout rates in non-presidential years. GOP voters often do not participate in early or mail-in voting, due to the party harboring suspicions over the method's security in the wake of the 2020 election. 

Since Trump emerged in the political arena, the GOP has consistently faced issues attracting supporters to vote in elections where the president is not at the top of the ballot.

National GOP strategist Brian Seitchik told the Washington Examiner that New Jersey was “always going to be an uphill climb,” but Tuesday was “the latest example of a reality that Republicans need to understand.”

“Trump voters are not reliable Republican voters,” Seitchik said.

“One thing that Republicans have done a very poor job of doing is motivating the Trump voters while attracting anyone else,” Brian Kirwin, a longtime Virginia GOP strategist, echoed. 

And rallying Trump voters was a considerable part of Ciattarelli's campaign. He linked himself closely to the president's agenda, taking a gamble that it would drive out Trump's supporters.

But it also came at a cost. By linking himself to Trump's policies, he opened himself up to credible attacks from the Sherrill campaign. The government shutdown didn't help matters either, playing a “tremendous role” in his eyes, said Hank Sheinkopf, longtime Democratic political consultant.

“Ciattarelli could not walk away from Trump,” he said. “He grabbed Trump's hand and held it too tight. And Mikie Sherril knew how to break that, how to use that.”

Eyes were on the government shutdown, which reached 37 days as of Thursday, to see if it would negatively affect Sherrill, a sitting member of Congress who had voted against the Republican spending deal to fund the government. But the Trump administration's decision to freeze funds for critical infrastructure projects connecting New Jersey to New York likely led to Ciattarelli's demise, Sheinkopf said.

“Ciattarelli ran on merit because he's done it twice before, and he came so close the last time,” Sheinkopf said. “But likely, had Trump not decided to cancel the 100,000 jobs in the [Hudson] Tunnel [Project], the outcome might have been very different.”

Sheinkopf, who advised Hudson County Republicans in New Jersey how to bolster support for Ciattarelli, said he thought Virginia was a rebuke of candidate quality, whereas New Jersey was a rebuke of Trump's policies, plain and simple.

“Why? Because Ciattarelli was within 3 to 5 [points] two weeks out this closing,” the consultant said. “When the Sherrill campaign went smartly up on the air, talking about the cuts to New Jersey, the shutdown, the job loss, and the rest, it negated all the positive arguments that Ciattarelli had made about the mess that the Democrats had created in Trenton and throughout the state.”

In his concession speech, Ciattarelli didn't mention Trump. He said “nobody's more disappointed than me” and noted his chances were slim in a blue state, but he's “proud of the effort we put forth.” 

“Knowing my nature, I will analyze over the next 24, 48, 72 hours, over the next week, over the next month, what we could have done differently,” Ciattarelli said. “But having said that, I stand before you right now, proud of all of you for what you did for this campaign, proud of what my team did on behalf of this campaign, and I'm proud of my effort going out there each and every day.”

“Yes, Republicans are the minority party, but that means also being the loyal opposition and continuing to ensure that our voice is heard,” he added.

Several strategists rebuffed the idea that candidate quality played a large role in the New Jersey race, compared to Virginia. Ciattarelli received a Trump endorsement and the financial backing of national Republicans, whereas Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears faced a more difficult campaign season.

Ciattarelli proved his worth as a candidate before 2025, having won several state and local elections and having attempted to run for governor in 2017 and again in 2021. Four years ago, he came within 3 points. 

But Sheinkopf noted there could have been some “voter fatigue” given this was Ciattarelli's third attempt at the governor's mansion.

“Ciattarelli ran a fine campaign, but he ran it in a very blue state,” Seitchik said. 

Ciattarelli voters told the Washington Examiner in the week leading up to the election that they were supporting him because he was born and raised in New Jersey and that he provided specific ways he'd address the issues Garden State residents are facing. 

Henry de Koninck, a New Jersey strategist and political consultant, agreed that Ciattarelli was a “fine” candidate, pointing out that his vote total of over 1.3 million votes was more votes than outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) received in either of his elections when he won in 2017 and 2021.

But, he said, “Ciattarelli was really just the casualty of the turnout environment where he was running against a candidate who had an energized party behind her, and he had all the baggage of being associated with Trump, but none of the benefit.”

“And the results reflected that.”

Kirwin said that candidate quality is incredibly important when it comes to finding someone who can grow a message and “not just play R vs. D.” 

Kirwin noted that in 2021, Ciattarelli performed significantly better under a Biden White House than under a Trump one. 

“You get the reverse rate wave with a Republican in the White House, and all of a sudden, ‘I was a pretty impressive candidate in 2021 and now I'm horrible,'” the strategist continued. “That's more about the electorate and a rebuke of the White House than it is anything about Jack.”

“He benefited from the wave four years ago, and it drowned him in 2025,” he added.

The 2025 election results sent a strong signal to Capitol Hill that Republicans will not be able to solely ride the wave of Trump back into the White House and maintain any momentum gathered from 2024 victories.

Trump himself told GOP senators on Wednesday morning that he wanted to have a “discussion” about “what last night represented.” He blamed GOP losses on the shutdown, telling the senators behind closed doors that Republicans are “getting killed.” 

The House historically flips to the opposite party of the current presidency in the midterm elections, and Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to regain control of the chamber and break up the GOP trifecta.

Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said that if Trump and Republicans “don't get their act together,” they will face an even worse defeat in 2026.

“Voters pay very little attention to the candidate in congressional midterms; it's basically a national referendum on the president,” Bannon said.

In his eyes, candidate quality matters the least in a midterm election because many voters go to the polls and “don't even know congressional candidates are, may not even know who their incumbent member of Congress is.”

“But they'll vote based on how they feel about the president, and if Trump's job rating is anything like it was last night, that suggests that the Republicans are ready for a big hurt a year from today,” Bannon said.

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, disagrees. He said that at the polls, it often comes down to the likability and quality of the candidate rather than policy issues.

“People can overlook some economic problems and issues if they're excited about a candidate, but if they're not excited about the candidate and they feel like the party in power is to blame, then the party in power is going to suffer,” Richards said.

De Koninck agreed with Richards. He noted that Ciattarelli spoke on the correct issues important to the Garden State: high energy costs, rising taxes, and tariffs.

But, he said, the “economy is a bit of a red herring when it comes to a persuasion factor in campaigns.” 

DEMOCRATS WIN BIG AND SMALL RACES IN THE 2025 ELECTION

“That's something that voters say is really important to them,” de Koninck said. “It is really important to them, but it doesn't move voters off their party preference choice in the way that a lot of pundits and folks in the political consulting class think that it does.”

“So it's not that Ciattarelli spoke about the wrong issues, and it's just that those issues were not ultimately shaping vote preference,” he added.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Ciattarelli for comment.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Curio is a CNN Style series spotlighting small objects and the big ideas behind them.



            In an age when clocks are found in most pockets and on every screen, watchmaker Col&MacArthur's selling point is not just time, but history itself.
    


            Known for using unconventional materials — from Pearl Harbor seawater to meteorite moondust — in the name of horological storytelling, the brand is now commemorating the D-Day landings with a series of watches made from US soldiers' helmets and haversacks, as well as sand from the beaches of Normandy.
    


            “People are not buying this watch because it tells the time,” the company's CEO Sébastien Colen said on a call from Belgium, where the former energy executive co-founded the company in 2013. “It's because it is bringing them back somewhere in the past.”
    


            Colen had spent three years developing a prototype for his Normandie 1944, a luxury watch featuring metal from an M-1, the standard-issue helmet used by the US Army during World War II. Sourced from a military memorabilia trader in Dallas, Texas, the helmet was flattened in a press, rather than with a hammer, to preserve its original markings and imperfections. The resulting metal sheet was then cut into circles that can be incorporated into dials and inserted in the watches' 43-millimeter cases at the brand's studio in Liège, Belgium.
    


            The pieces are being produced to order, meaning the number of helmets required depends on how many are sold. (One M-1 contains enough metal for “about 20” watches, Colen said.) The watchmaker is currently accepting orders via a Kickstarter campaign, which has raised over $86,000 at the time of publication.
    


            Elsewhere, the design features a small capsule of Normandy sand and a strap made from an M-1928 haversack, the backpacks widely used by the US Army during World War II. The dial displays a historical map of Omaha Beach, a codename given to one of the five landing areas — alongside Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword Beaches — used by Allied troops on D-Day.
    


            Operation Neptune, as it is also known, was the largest amphibious invasion in history, marking a major turning point in the war. The M-1 was worn by the vast majority of the 73,000 US troops who landed in Normandy — either on the beaches or as airborne troops — on June 6,1944. The helmets' one-size-fits-all design comprised a manganese steel outer shell and an adjustable inner lining that was attached to a leather chinstrap.
    


            In the absence of markings identifying the wearer, it is often impossible to trace individual helmets to specific soldiers or battles. And although Col&MacArthur cannot guarantee that each M-1 helmet it uses was worn during the D-Day landings, certificates of authenticity from the dealer, Gustafsons, confirm that they were used during the wider liberation of Europe.
    


            Col&MacArthur will produce two versions of the watch, the varying prices reflecting differences in their internal mechanisms. The premium “Legacy” edition (priced at $1,749 and limited to a symbolic run of 1,944 units) features a Swiss-made movement, while the standard version (priced at $699) uses a cheaper Japanese movement.
    


This watch was carved from a meteorite that hit Earth a million years ago



            Colen came up with the idea while at Belgium's Ciney Militaria, one of the world's largest military collectibles fairs. He then visited Normandy to speak to locals and familiarize himself with the landings' geographical context. “It's very important that we go on site, to feel it,” he explained.
    


            Unlike the helmets and haversacks, the sand presented a legal hurdle: Taking sand from any French beach is prohibited by law. Normandy's D-day sites are commonly targeted by souvenir-seekers (France's Ministry of Culture has meanwhile asked UNESCO to afford them World Heritage status), and although authorities tolerate people taking small amounts for personal use, doing so at scale or for commercial purposes can attract fines of 1,500 euros ($1,724).
    


            Colen instead sought permission from a local mayor, whose office advised him to collect sand that had naturally blown from Sword Beach onto a neighboring road. “If we want to respect the memory, it's very important that we do these things properly,” Colen said.
    


            Other ethical considerations will arise as the watches go into production. Among them is the question of whether to use stained parts of the haversacks — possibly containing blood — on the straps' reverse side, or to cut around them entirely. “It's tricky, because some people could be offended. But on the other hand, for me, it's something that's very important to show,” Colen said, without offering a definitive answer to how he will approach this dilemma. “It's a question of authenticity.”
    


            Then there is the wider moral question of whether historical artifacts should ever be intentionally destroyed. M-1 helmets were mass produced, with over 20 million made between 1941 and 1945 — and they are relatively common on the collectors' market, where they typically fetch hundreds, rather than thousands, of dollars each. But Colen understands why people might criticize his decision to recycle them into luxury items.

            “Every time we do a project, we really question ourselves, ‘Is it is it respectful?'” he said, before referencing Winston Churchill's quote that those who “fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”
    


            “This is exactly what is happening today,” he argued. “So, instead of having a helmet sitting in a warehouse, it's on a watch, it's providing emotion and it's reminding us, every single day, of events of the past.”
    


            Col&MacArthur's short history is rooted in British, rather than American, military tradition. Originally a collaboration between Colen and former British serviceman Iain Wood, the company was founded 12 years ago to produce watches for the country's Scots Guards, the latter's erstwhile regiment. The pair later designed pieces for various regiments of the Royal Guards, the sentries protecting Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace in London.
    


            In 2017, Col&MacArthur began work on a line of watches marking the centenary of World War I — one of which was presented to French president Emmanuel Macron. The watch's success heralded a pivot towards timepieces centered on major historical figures and events. “Without knowing at the time, I was already working on our first commemorative watches,” Colen said.
    


            In the years since, the watchmaker has released collections based on more than a dozen themes, from Leonardo da Vinci to the Battle of Britain. Many of them contain “tangible” artifacts, including moon dust from a lunar meteorite (used in watches dedicated to the Apollo 11 mission) and water from Pearl Harbor (trapped between sapphire crystals in watches commemorating the Japanese attack on America's naval base there in 1941).
    


            If its latest crowdfunding campaign exceeds $100,000, Col&MacArthur will start putting money toward its next collection: timepieces memorializing the Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany's last campaign on the Western Front. Colen plans to incorporate fragments of a shell, dropped on the Belgian city of Bastogne, into the watches' design.
    


            “For every single watch, we really try to integrate something unique,” he said.

The Department of Transportation announced on Wednesday that the government shutdown was resulting in a 10% reduction in flights at 40 airports across the United States. 

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy made this revelation at a press conference announcing the cuts, as previously reported by the Washington Examiner. It was a precautionary measure to avoid any disasters or emergencies, given the effect the shutdown has had on air traffic controllers. Duffy explained that reducing the number of flights was necessary to “reduce the risk profile in the national airspace.” 

Among the airports reportedly affected by the reduction are Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. According to ABC News, here is a list of the 40 airports that will see a reduction in flights:

The reduction in flights is scheduled to begin on Friday morning, according to reports. It will commence with a 4% reduction and ramp up to the 10% total, ABC News reported. One exception is that international flights are not included in the cuts, and at least one airline company announced that “hub-to-hub flights will not be impacted.”

DUFFY SAYS ‘CERTAIN PARTS' OF AIRSPACE MAY BE CLOSED NEXT WEEK DUE TO PROLONGED SHUTDOWN

“Our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. Reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations. This is not based on light airline travel locations. This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure,” said Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford, who joined Duffy at the press conference on Wednesday.

“I anticipate there will be additional disruptions, there will be frustration,” Duffy said on Wednesday. “We are working with the airlines. They're going to work with passengers, but in the end, our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. The administrator is going to talk about all of the tools we're going to deploy. One of them, though, is going to be that there is going to be a 10% reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations.”

Holiday travel is starting to look incredibly dicey.

The shutdown so far has created massive air traffic control delays, leaving some airports so understaffed that they had to temporarily shut down. Starting on Friday, federal officials will reduce 10% of flights at 40 US airports to manage traffic.

Six airports — Anchorage, Atlanta, Charlotte, Boston, Seattle, and Philadelphia — confirmed to Business Insider that they are among those temporarily losing some service.

The FAA has not yet released an official list of all affected airports. The aviation analytics company Cirium compiled a list of 100 major airports that are among the most likely to be included.

It said that up to 1,800 flights representing about 268,000 seats could be cut on Friday.

Here's the full list from Cirium:

CBS News and The Washington Post shared a list of 40 potentially affected airports, citing unnamed sources.

Business Insider contacted the airports on the list. Some airports — including Indianapolis, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Memphis, Detroit, and those in the Houston, New York, and Dallas areas — told Business Insider they were aware of the planned cuts but had not yet been notified that they were on the list. They referred Business Insider to the government and the airlines.

Minneapolis airport told Business Insider that operations are normal as of Thursday, but said "if reductions are enacted, travelers should be prepared for flight disruptions" at Minneapolis and other airports across the US.

The affected airports are subject to change. The FAA and the Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The reductions come at an especially bad time, as the busy Thanksgiving and Christmas travel seasons approach. And there appears to be some scrambling among the government, airports, and airlines to determine what can be shaved with just a few days' notice.

Some airlines have given customers a general idea of what to expect, but details are scarce.

Frontier Airlines told Business Insider that most of its flights are expected to "operate as planned" come Friday, but will proactively communicate with customers as changes occur. It did not offer exact routes. Southwest similarly said it did not yet have specific figures.

United CEO Scott Kirby provided some information in a Wednesday statement, saying none of the airline's long-haul international or hub-to-hub flights would be affected. Instead, he said reductions will be on regional routes — which connect hubs to smaller airports — and domestic mainline flights that do not travel between hubs.

United has seven main hubs in the mainland US: Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles. It also has a hub in Guam.

United is planning to reduce its flights by 4% from Friday through the weekend, before gradually increasing that to 10%, a source close to the airline told Business Insider. That's roughly 250 to 300 daily cancellations, affecting around 25,000 customers a day, they added.

Cirium data estimates that Chicago O'Hare, if on the list, would be the most affected airport on Friday, with 121 flights canceled across all airlines. Atlanta — where Delta has its major hub — would be second at 104 flights.

The schedule adjustments have created uncertainty for travelers, and some industry experts advise that travelers should prepare for longer lines and potential delays.

"If you're checking bags, plan for long lines with extra time at the airport, and pack any valuables or time-sensitive items in your carry-on," Audrey Kohout, Co-CEO of luggage shipping companies LuggageForward and LugLess, said in a media statement.

For those whose flights get canceled, in most cases, airlines would try to rebook them on an alternative flight.

American, Delta, Frontier, and United have said that customers will be able to change or refund their flights at no extra cost.

Southwest said that passengers whose flights are canceled will be eligible for a refund. As of noon ET, Alaska does not have a flexible travel policy in place.

Some airline CEOs are already warning people to prepare for the worst: "If your flight is canceled, your chances of being stranded are high, so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline," Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in a LinkedIn post.

Microsoft on Thursday said it's forming a team that will be tasked with performing advanced artificial intelligence research.

Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the Microsoft AI group that includes Bing and the Copilot assistant, announced the formation of the MAI Superintelligence Team, and said in a blog post that he'll be leading it. 

"We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable," Suleyman wrote. "We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity."

The decision comes months after Facebook parent Meta spent billions to hire talent for its new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit that's working on research and products. The term superintelligence typically refers to machines deemed more intelligent than the smartest people.

Suleyman was a co-founder of AI lab DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014. After leaving Google in 2022, he co-founded and led AI startup Inflection. Microsoft hired Suleyman and several other Inflection employees last year.

Top technology companies have rushed to hire leading AI engineers and researchers, augmenting their products with generative AI capabilities. The boom started with OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022. 

Microsoft uses OpenAI models in Bing and Copilot, while OpenAI runs workloads in Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft also owns a $135 billion equity stake in OpenAI following a restructuring.

Microsoft has taken steps to reduce its dependence on OpenAI. After the Inflection deal, the software company also began drawing on models from Google and from Anthropic, which was founded by former OpenAI executives.

The new Microsoft AI research group will focus on providing useful companions for people that can help in education and other domains, Suleyman wrote in his blog post. It will also pursue narrow areas in medicine and in renewable energy production.

"We'll have expert level performance at the full range of diagnostics, alongside highly capable planning and prediction in operational clinical settings," Suleyman wrote.

As investors and analysts are increasingly voicing their concerns about overspending on AI without a clear path to profits, Suleyman said he wants "to make clear that we are not building a superintelligence at any cost, with no limits."

In this article

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of some of their obesity drugs, including upcoming pills, in a landmark effort to expand access to the costly blockbuster treatments.

The agreements will cut prices of so-called GLP-1 drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026 and offer the treatments directly to consumers at a discount on a website the Trump administration is launching in January called TrumpRx.gov.

That means Medicare will start covering obesity drugs for some patients for the first time starting mid-2026, a long-awaited move that could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.

Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month for everyone getting them through Medicare, Medicaid or TrumpRx, a senior administration official who declined to be named told reporters during a briefing Thursday. Novo Nordisk's oral version of its obesity injection Wegovy could enter the market by year-end, while Eli Lilly's pill orforglipron could launch next year.

Starting doses of existing injections like Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRX, but will "trend down" to $245 per month over a two-year period, another senior administration official said during the briefing.

Wegovy and Zepbound have not been covered by Medicare for weight loss, "and they've only rarely been covered by Medicaid," Trump said in the Oval Office. "They've often cost consumers more than $1,000 per month, some a lot more than that. ... That ends starting today."

The deals are among the most politically significant announcements to date in the Trump administration's push to rein in high U.S. drug costs by tying them to the lowest prices abroad. As part of the president's "most favored nation" policy, he has announced deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from planned pharmaceutical tariffs.

"This is the biggest drug in our country, and that's why this is the most important of all the [most favored nation] announcements we've made," Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the briefing. "This is going to have the biggest impact on the American people. All Americans, even those who are not on Medicaid, Medicare, are going to be able to get the same price for their drugs, for their GLP-1s."

Kennedy claimed the American public will lose 125 million pounds by this time next year, saying the expanded access will have "dramatic effects on human health" in the U.S.

The list prices of existing obesity drugs – roughly $1,000 to $1,350 per month before insurance – are a huge barrier for patients, many of whom could benefit from their ability to promote weight loss and ease other related health complications such as cardiovascular risks and sleep apnea. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk already have programs to sell their weight loss drugs at a discount directly to cash-paying consumers, but the new agreements appear to take those efforts to boost access a step further. 

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have agreed to cut the price Medicare pays for GLP-1s it already covers for diabetes and other indications, along with those drugs for obesity, to $245 per month. The companies agreed to extend lower government pricing for their GLP-1 drugs – $245 per month across all other nonstarting doses – to all 50 Medicaid programs for all covered uses. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not.

But Medicare coverage could have a bigger impact on who gets the drugs because the program covers about 66 million people, and is the primary source of insurance for people ages 65 and above. The new obesity drug coverage will be enabled through a pilot program designed to cover a majority of beneficiaries under Medicare Part D, which are the program's prescription drug plans.

Another senior administration official said around 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Eligible patients will fall into three cohorts. The first includes those who are overweight, with a body mass index greater than 27 or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.

The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure. The third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35.

GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a much broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. The administration official said, "We are constraining the access for patients that will benefit clinically from it, we've worked very hard to strike a balance between broad access that just makes sure to capture patients that will benefit clinically."

As part of the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk also made similar pledges to the ones other drugmakers have made as part of Trump's most favored nation agreements. The companies will guarantee most favored nation pricing on all new medicines they bring to market, provide that pricing to every state Medicaid program, offer at least U.S. net prices or most favored nation pricing on nearly all primary care drugs on TrumpRx and share savings from foreign drug price increases on existing products, one senior administration official said. 

Also on Thursday, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. 

Eli Lilly's pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per month. 

In a statement Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said the deal marks "a pivotal moment in U.S. health care policy and a defining milestone for Lilly," which is focused on "improving outcomes, strengthening the U.S. healthcare system, and contributing to the health of our nation for generations to come."

In a separate statement, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said, "today's announcement will bring semaglutide medicines to more American patients at a lower cost." Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic.

It's not the first time the government has floated Medicare coverage of obesity drugs. Former President Joe Biden proposed a rule at the end of his term that would have allowed the program to cover those treatments, but the Trump administration in April declined to finalize the measure. 

Biden's proposal would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries. But it was controversial at the time, as it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over nine years, a congressional analysis found.

But some health experts contend that covering the drugs could eliminate the downstream costs involved with treating obesity-related conditions. 

Semaglutide is also included in the next round of Medicare drug price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022. Trump is expected to unveil the new prices of the 15 drugs selected for those talks by Nov. 30. 

Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro, likely won't be eligible for those negotiations until the end of the decade.

A company linked to Hussain Sajwani, a Dubai-based billionaire and associate of President Donald Trump, bought the Amadea, the superyacht auctioned off by the US government in September.

The sale of the Amadea, a 106-meter luxury yacht that the government said it seized from sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov in 2022, was finalized in October, Business Insider previously reported.

New registration documents reveal that an entity linked to Sajwani and his Damac Group is behind the purchase.

As of October 10, the owner of the yacht was listed as Beyond Holdings Group Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands — a popular flag for superyachts, given its favorable tax policy and strict confidentiality rules.

Beyond Holdings Group's headquarters is located in Dubai, on the 20th floor of the Executive Heights tower, according to Bloomberg's Legal Entity Identifier. That exact address is the headquarters of Damac, the conglomerate owned by billionaire Sajwani.

The entity's former name, AHS Four Company Limited, also connects to Sajwani. His son Abbas Sajwani's yacht is named AHS, after his initials, and is owned by a company called AHS One Company Limited. Both yachts, AHS and the Amadea, are managed by the Monaco-based firm Superyacht Partners, which charters out the former for as much as $600,000 a week.

Hussain Sajwani, Abbas Sajwani, and Superyacht Partners did not respond to requests for comment. The United States Marshals Service declined to comment.

The Amadea was believed to be worth at least $300 million at the time of its seizure, the Department of Justice said in a press release. A later appraisal put its value closer to $230 million, court documents said. The price fetched at auction has not been publicly revealed.

The yacht's maintenance costs — including crew salaries, fuel, insurance, and more — reached nearly $1 million a month for US taxpayers at one point, according to court filings, so the government was eager to offload it. That said, seized yachts are complicated assets, as their true ownership can be contested.

Hussain Sajwani, who is worth $13.3 billion, according to Bloomberg, has several ties to the president.

Pinned to the top of Hussain Sajwani's Instagram account is a video taken in January at Mar-a-Lago, where he and Trump said that Damac subsidiary Edgnex Data Centers would invest $20 billion in the US. Soon after, Hussain Sajwani and Abbas Sajwani attended events around Trump's 2025 inauguration, including an official inaugural ball.

Other posts from the past year include photos of them together in the Oval Office, in the UAE, where Hussain Sajwani was invited during Trump's official visit, and in Scotland, where Hussain Sajwani visited Trump's Turnberry Golf Course.

It's a partnership that extends back more than a decade, when Damac signed on to codevelop two Trump-branded golf courses in Dubai.

Trump has also turned down deals with Hussain Sajwani.

When Trump was first elected in 2016, the elder Sajwani, who attended a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago that year, said he wanted to form a closer relationship with Trump's businesses, NBC reported. A few months later, Trump said he had declined a $2 billion deal with him.

More recently, Trump and Hussain Sajwani have continued to do personal business together. Trump earned more than $6 million in fees from transactions related to Damac from January 2024 to June 2025, according to a disclosure report filed in June.

Airlines rushed to provide travelers updates after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would reduce flights across 40 airports as the longest government shutdown in history continues to drag on.

Many major airlines said they would waive cancellation fees for even their most basic tickets, which often come with penalties for changes.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said he would reduce flight capacity by roughly 10%, affecting 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.

The FAA has not yet announced which "high traffic" airports would be affected.

These are the airports that are expected to be impacted, based on preliminary information before the agency meets with airlines to finalize cuts, CNBC's Phil LeBeau reported. The preliminary list includes some of the country's largest airports and major international hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City.

Preliminary list:

On Wednesday, Duffy said the reduction was a "proactive" measure because of the delays and cancellations already occurring due to the shutdown. Air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees required to work during a shutdown, have missed paychecks, and the FAA has said the closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among controllers.

Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time.

"We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing," Duffy added.

Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he could "shut the whole airspace down" if the shutdown drags on.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday that additional measures may be implemented after the reduction, which he said he has never seen before in his time in the industry. The officials said they were planning to meet with airlines to discuss which flights would be cut.

In a Wednesday memo to United Airlines employees, CEO Scott Kirby said the carrier will not be reducing long-haul international flying and hub-to-hub flying, instead reducing regional and domestic flights that do not fly between hubs.

The airline also offered all customers refunds even if their flights are not impacted. Kirby said that included "non-refundable tickets and those customers with basic economy tickets."

On Thursday afternoon, the airline preemptively said it was going to cancel 4% of its flights from Friday through Sunday.

In a statement, Delta Air Lines said it expects to operate the "vast majority" of its flights as scheduled and will offer changes, cancellations or refunds for customers' flights during the impacted period. Delta also said that would include basic economy fares, without penalty.

Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said he highly recommends travelers flying Friday or in the next 10 days book a backup ticket on another carrier as the flight reductions begin to avoid getting stranded due to cancellations.

"I'm sorry this is happening. Hopefully the shutdown is over soon," Biffle wrote on LinkedIn. "Just giving everyone practical travel advice."

American Airlines said it expects that the "vast majority of customers' travel will proceed as planned," adding that the carrier will reach out to travelers proactively as schedule changes occur.

The airline also said that it will offer immediate rebooking options for all impacted travelers and that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason will be able to change their flight or request a refund without penalty. As of Thursday morning, the airline was still awaiting clarifying information from the FAA about which of its flights will be impacted.

Southwest Airlines also released a statement saying that the majority of its flights will not be impacted and that its international flights should operate as usual. The airline said it will "proactively communicate well in advance and will offer flexibility in travel plans."

The Association of Flight Attendants, representing 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, released a statement Wednesday urging Congress to end the shutdown so air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers can get paid.

"The false narrative that this shutdown is a choice of either paying federal workers or protecting affordable healthcare is outrageous when both crises were manufactured by the exact people who can fix it," the statement read.

Experts recommend consumers who are set to travel in the next week stay on top of flight cancellations and delays through the websites and apps.

Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at travel site The Points Guy, said flexibility "is going to be key" as travelers rush to rebook, adding it's important to download each airline's mobile app and enable all notifications.

"A lot of the times, you have to actually enable notifications on individual trips or in your account to text you if there are changes or disruptions," Ewen told CNBC.

He recommended anyone with nonurgent travel reschedule their trips, though that likely only applies to a small number of travelers, and consider choosing other forms of transportation instead. For essential trips, Ewen said passengers should be prepared for long wait times, use self-service rebooking tools, and be aware of the fact that many other people will also be rebooking and scrambling for limited seats.

Ewen said he has been covering the industry for many years, and the last time he and his colleagues saw a major, national disruption in air travel like this was 9/11.

"The biggest thing is a lot of kindness goes a long way," he said. "So if you're at an airport and you find out that your flight is canceled, I promise you screaming at that airline employee is not going to get you rebooked any faster — in fact, it's probably going to make them less likely to be willing to help you. So recognize that everyone is in this together."

AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the company recommends arriving at the airport extra early to avoid long lines and avoid checking in a bag if possible in case flights get canceled.

"Ultimately, there's a lot that's out of travelers' control — so control what you can, and be as flexible as possible," Diaz said.

Travel insurance can reimburse consumers for certain costs and inconveniences incurred from a trip disruption, like flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or unforeseen costs for lodging and meals.

Consumers have been buying travel insurance at an elevated rate amid the government shutdown, but travel and insurance experts warn that such policies don't offer blanket protection for shutdown-related travel snafus, and a lot depends on the fine print.

For example, a policyholder generally can't get insurance benefits if they choose to cancel their travel plans to avoid any headaches. Cancel-for-any-reason coverage is an exception, though it also comes with its own caveats.

Whether or not a policyholder gets compensated may come down to the rationale an airline provides for a delayed or canceled flight.

Many insurers only pay benefits if a delay or cancellation is attributable to a "common carrier" disruption like a mechanical failure, travel experts said.

"Airlines typically won't cite causes other than operational terms like 'mechanical issues' or general delays, cancellations, or lost belongings, even during a government shutdown," Lauren McCormick, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, wrote in a recent blog post. "So, these are generally still covered under most comprehensive travel insurance plans."

This feature is part of Lonely at the Top, a series that examines the link between wealth and loneliness.

When Lisa Johnson launched her business strategy career eight years ago and suddenly became a millionaire, many things in her life vanished. Her £35,000 debt (around $44,800). Her need to meticulously budget or worry about childcare costs for her twins. And, mysteriously enough, some of her friends, too.

"They just ghosted me — disappeared," Johnson told Business Insider. Johnson, who grew up in a housing development in England, said she hadn't changed how she treated the people around her, so "it was a shock. No one ever spoke to me about it. I just felt dropped."

Johnson isn't the only one whose wealth has gotten in the way of her lifelong relationships. It's happening across the pond as well. While America's millionaire class continues to grow, making up over 6% of the country's population, some self-made millionaires experience a more bittersweet taste of success: losing their old friends and family.

Some might work longer hours or have different spending habits than their social circles — habits that contributed to their wealth in the first place. Over time, they said they've felt judged for living differently, a topic that feels impossible to address and can drive a wedge even further between the closest bonds.

To add insult to isolation, no one wants to hear rich people complain. Nepo babies are frequently reviled, whether they're Hollywood-dominating celebrity children or New York City homeowners buying their apartments through trust funds. In the entertainment world, TV shows and films like "The White Lotus," "Succession," and "Parasite" have dominated culture for years, skewering the ultrawealthy to consistent acclaim (often from the well-to-do themselves).

This story is part of a series, "Lonely at the Top," which examines the impact of wealth on the relationships of millionaires. Read more:

Still, millionaires aren't devoid of relationship issues. In some ways, they can experience wholly unique ones, because "the world is not very compassionate to that kind of trouble and pain," Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist who hosts Fresh Produce Media's Audible series "Emotional Investment," told Business Insider.

Loneliness is something not even the wealthy can buy their way out of. If anything, understanding how money changes relationships is the first step to keeping them.

Self-made millionaires tend to have a few distinct qualities. For one, their relationship with money can differ from that of their friends. They might focus more on long-term financial goals and be more stringent about saving.

When Lane Kawaoka became a millionaire by buying rental properties, he realized his newfound wealth was making him feel lonely. Much of it had to do with differing mindsets.

"My coworkers didn't understand things I found important," Kawaoka told Business Insider. "It wasn't because those people were less intelligent than I am; we were just concerned about different things."

Eventually, he stopped talking about his goals because he worried it sounded like he was bragging. He also didn't want people to assume he had lots of money to spare: "Still being frugal at the time, I didn't want any excuse for me to have to pick up the bill all the time for my buddies."

The millionaire can find themselves siloing off into a new class bubble because "it's hard to plan and stay in touch with people who just can't do the same things that you can do," Clay Cockrell, a licensed clinical social worker focusing on high-net-worth individuals, told Business Insider.

Sometimes, the work schedule required to stay wealthy is what drives away old friends and family. Jeremy Barker, a millionaire CEO of a company that sells unique doors, was a firefighter. Starting his own company meant working longer hours on the side.

"My colleagues at the firehouse started teasing me more and more about how hard I was working," Barker told Business Insider. "I wasn't spending as much time with them because I had different priorities — they wanted to hang out on days off, while I was always working on the business." Soon, they stopped inviting him.

His attempts to split his time between both jobs left him distracted and distant. On the day his fire chief encouraged him to resign from the firehouse to better prioritize his company and family, Barker remembered coming home to near silence.

"Only my dog greeted me — my wife and daughter didn't even look up," he said. "My wife noticed I was frustrated and told me if I wanted to be treated like a dad, I needed to start showing up like one."

Even if millionaires believe their feelings — and potential judgments — aren't obvious, the truth usually comes out. Johnson remembers sharing her thoughts on money via social media, how she was working hard to move away from debt.

"I often felt like that irritated a few of my friends," she said. "There were lots of comments that felt passive-aggressive, like: 'It's alright for you,' 'It's OK for the lucky ones,' and 'It's how the other half live.'"

Over time, the long working hours, declined invitations, and distinctly different financial goals can lead to schisms in millionaires' relationships. Tensions can especially come to a head when lending money is concerned.

"A family member recently asked me for money after telling me he'd been 'lounging' lately," Barker said. "I just wish I could teach that guy — who is smart and physically capable — to work hard."

"I've seen too many family rifts erupt when expectations aren't clearly spelled out," Joy Slabaugh told Business Insider. A millionaire and financial therapist, Slabaugh, asked her relative to sign an agreement to monthly interest-only payments of $100, with the principal due three months after the initial payment, for a $1,000 loan.

Privately, Slabaugh questioned if loaning a relative money, even with a repayment plan, was the right move: "I was afraid that giving them money — even as a loan — might be more harmful than helpful," potentially enabling her relative.

The relative kept up with the payments at first, but then there were months of silence. Slabaugh later learned that they were going through some personal issues and "felt so much shame" about not paying the money back right away that they didn't reply.

"If I had been clearer and more emotionally honest from the beginning, we could've avoided months of silence and perhaps reduced their emotional strain," Slabaugh said.

For some millionaires, downplaying or even hiding their wealth feels like a Band-Aid to the problem. Over time, the omissions can stiffen relationships.

"It is a barrier to intimacy, in the sense of true knowing and connection for each other's unique set of experiences," Clayman said.

To be a healthy, well-rounded person, you need community, Cockrell said. Millionaires, who are still in the vast financial minority, "just happen to have a complicating factor."

He said the first step is to slowly open up to people, knowing that some may struggle with the truth — or try to take advantage of it — but that it's not one's job to manage other people's reactions. Cockrell said being wealthy is a lot like being exceptionally beautiful. "People are going to be attracted to you for different reasons," he said, "and it's important for you to own that, but then not let that necessarily cloud your judgment."

Kawaoka said meeting other millionaires, particularly fellow first-generation ones, made him feel less alone. "These people — many of them with seven- and eight-figure net worths — weren't arrogant or flashy," he said. "They were people who had lost money, made it back, learned lessons, and kept moving forward."

Befriending others like him was a huge relief and a moment of self-discovery. "I wasn't introverted like I thought; I was just an extrovert who'd never found his tribe," he said.

Connections, of course, don't have to be limited to people with the same net worth. A great way to meet people is through volunteering and giving back, Cockrell said, but beware the impulse to just give away your money.

"Don't just write the check," Cockrell said. "Go pick up a hammer, ladle some soup, get out there and meet people so that it's not just about the money. It's having relationships and contributing."

Barker is still a part-time firefighter, picking up shifts every few months. "I take a lot of ribbing; they'll call me Mr. Millionaire, or ask for business or life advice," he said. Still, it's a way to stay connected to his old friends.

Sometimes, giving back can mean treating your lifelong crew. Johnson said she takes about 20 of her long-term friends on a yacht trip around Greece every year. "I didn't realize how much I took them for granted, but I'm so grateful for them now," she said. "I know I can trust them because they liked me before I made my money."

Duolingo's stock cratered 27% on lighter-than-expected guidance as the language learning platform zeroed in on user growth in lieu of near-term monetization.

"We have made a slight shift over the last quarter in how we invest, and we're investing a lot more in long-term things because we see that as such a big opportunity ahead of us," CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn told CNBC's Jon Fortt.

For the current quarter, Duolingo expects bookings to range between $329.5 million and $335.5 million, falling short of a $344.3 million estimate from FactSet. Adjusted EBITDA was forecasted to range between $75.4 million and $78.8 million, versus the $80.5 million expected.

Duolingo grew paid subscribers to 11.5 million and topped the 11.38 million expected by StreetAccount. But daily and monthly active users came up short at 50.5 million and 135.3 million, respectively. Analysts polled by StreetAccount had forecasted 51.2 million daily and 137.4 million monthly users.

Over the last several months, Duolingo has implemented a slew of new artificial intelligence tools, including an interactive video call feature to try and lure more paying subscribers. The company has also rolled out more language courses in record time with the help of AI.

"There are experiments that put monetization and user growth at odds, and part of my job has been, always, arbitrating between these two," von Ahn told CNBC.

Over the last few months, he said the company has been "really shifting that trade off to be much more towards user growth."

Duolingo's revenues grew 41% during the quarter to $272 million, surpassing the $260 million estimate from analysts polled by LSEG. Total bookings jumped 33% year over year to about $282 million and also beat estimates.

Net income grew to $292.2 million, or $5.95 per share, up from $23.4 million, or 49 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said net income was helped by a one-time tax income benefit of $222.7 million.

Duolingo also boosted its full-year revenue guidance to between $1.0275 billion and $1.0315 billion. That's up from its previous guidance of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion.

KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson downgraded shares sector weight from an overweight rating as the company's focus on long-term product initiatives weighs on near-term growth and valuation.

He wrote that "meaningful financial benefits" from these initiatives could take "several quarters" to materialize.

A federal judge in Texas on Thursday dismissed a criminal conspiracy case against Boeing over two crashes of its 737 Max jetliner that killed 346 people, despite expressing sharp skepticism about the wisdom of the Department of Justice's request that he toss the case.

Some families of victims of the crashes had strongly opposed the DOJ's move in May asking Judge Reed O'Connor to dismiss the case in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth.

The DOJ, which had accused Boeing of deceiving federal regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes, at the time of the dismissal request said Boeing had agreed to pay or invest $1.1 billion in fines and compensation for victims' families.

The dismissal comes more than a year after Boeing and the DOJ said they had reached an agreement that required the company to plead guilty and serve a term of probation.

The first crash, of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia occurred in late October 2018, and the second crash, of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, occurred nearly five months later, in March 2019.

O'Connor, in his dismissal order, said that victims' families who opposed the dismissal "are correct" that a nonprosecution agreement that the DOJ reached with Boeing "fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public."

O'Connor agreed with them that the agreement "disregards the need for Boeing to be subject to independent monitoring."

But the judge wrote that he did not have authority to deny the dismissal request even though he "disagrees with the Government that dismissing the criminal information in this case is in the public interest."

"The Court recognizes that 'in every political institution a power to advance the publichappiness involves a discretion that may be abused.,'" O'Connor wrote, citing one of the Federalist Papers.

"Nevertheless, poor discretion may not be countered with judicial overreach," he said.

Boeing on Wednesday reached settlements in three lawsuits filed by families of victims of the second crash, after a jury had been selected for the trial of one of those cases in Chicago federal court.

In a statement Thursday about the dismissal of the criminal case, Boeing said, "We are committed to honoring the obligations of our agreement with the Department of Justice."

"We are also committed to continuing the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs," the company said.

The DOJ criminally charged Boeing in January 2021 with conspiracy to defraud the United States for the company's alleged obstruction of the Federal Aviation Administration's evaluation of the Max's maneuvering characteristics augmentation system.

At the same time that case was filed, the DOJ said it had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing, which effectively suspended the case's prosecution.

But in May 2024, the DOJ told O'Connor that Boeing had breached the deferred prosecution deal by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations."

In July 2024, the DOJ and Boeing submitted a plea agreement to O'Connor that called for the company to plead guilty.

O'Connor rejected the plea agreement because its terms "were not in the public interest," the judge noted in his order Thursday.

In May, months after President Donald Trump entered the White House for a second term, the DOJ asked O'Connor to dismiss the case altogether.

O'Connor in his order questioned the DOJ's rationale for the nonprosecution agreement that was part of the dismissal request.

"The Government now believes that Boeing can be trusted to select a compliance consultantbecause Boeing has made 'meaningful progress in improving its anti-fraud compliance and ethics programs,'" O'Connor wrote.

"In summary, the Government's position in this lawsuit has been that Boeing committed crimes sufficient to justify prosecution, failed to remedy its fraudulent behavior on its own during the [Deferred Prosecution Agreement] which justified a guilty plea and the imposition of an independent monitor, but now Boeing will remedy that dangerous culture by retaining a consultant of its own choosing."

"Given Boeing's history related to this case (and the Government's continued failure to gain Boeing's compliance), the Movants are correct that this agreement fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public," O'Connor wrote.

The judge also wrote that he found the DOJ's claim that there was "uncertainty and litigation risk" from going to trial in the case to be "unserious."

"The Government has a confession from Boeing, signed by the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, admitting to all the elements of the conspiracy charge against it in the DPA," O'Connor said. "As such, the assertion that there is a legitimate risk that Boeing would be acquitted at a trial lacks support."

Do you know what your job will look like a year from now? How about in three, or even five?

EY, one of the top four global accounting and consulting firms, is using AI to help its employees answer those questions.

The Big Four firm has developed a training program, known as AI Now 2.0, that acts as a "thought partner" to help its employees foresee how their roles will evolve as a result of AI, Simon Brown, global learning and development leader at EY, told Business Insider in an interview.

Staff answer a series of questions about their job, day-to-day responsibilities, and overall deliverables, then upload the answers to EYQ, the firm's internal Chat GPT-like tool.

EYQ then generates an analysis of how their current role might change because of the impact of AI, and helps them identify the skills, knowledge, and abilities they might need in the future.

The tool isn't trying to predict with certainty what an accounting or consulting role will be in five years' time, said Brown.

"It's hard to predict where many of these roles will be in the future, so we are not relying on AI to do that," he said.

Instead, it's aimed at helping EY staffers identify how they can better use AI in their current jobs and engage with what to expect from their future path at EY and what skills they'll need to succeed in that, said Brown.

EY launched AI Now 2.0 in January this year. Brown said that using the programme is voluntary, but around half of EY's 406,000 global employees have engaged with it, and all new recruits take the training as part of their onboarding process.

Developing an enterprise-wide training that could also be personal to each individual has been key, said Brown. "It helps to show and bring to life in a totally relevant way where AI might be able to help them," he said.

AI is already taking on everyday tasks that employees once handled, reshaping the skills employers prize most, and making workforce transformation a priority for HR departments.

Upskilling the workforce for AI is even more of a business imperative for consulting leaders — who act as advisors to the world's leading companies and must demonstrate to their clients that their own teams successfully embody the AI expertise they promote.

"We all know that 40% of our current skills will be different skills in five years. The technical skills you need to upskill, but you need to have the mentality, to be able to do that," Imgard Naudin ten Cate, global leader of talent acquisition at EY, told Business Insider.

"We'll definitely see so much more skills and skills erosion. So making sure that you can make that transition is so important," she said.

Fellow Big Four firm PwC has designed a program to train employees in managing risks and leadership in the AI era. The program of resources includes "appealing online content, in-person training, hackathons, and game show-style competitions."

At KPMG, Niale Cleobury, global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider the firm has tackled the workforce transformation challenge by developing an AI tool that breaks down roles by tasks, thinks about AI use cases, and looks at capacity savings.

"We can put in every role in the whole organisation and within a couple of minutes we can get all of that insight in terms of skill differences," Cleobury said.

Chipotle and Cava pinned weaker sales on younger customers who are pulling back and packing lunches.

But Gen Z shoppers are still spending on Coach handbags to bring to work — even if they're skipping bowls and burritos.

Coach's parent company Tapestry raised its full-year outlook Thursday, after beating Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue and posting double-digit sales gains in North America.

In an interview with CNBC, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said the company's sales in the quarter were fueled by attracting new customers, particularly within Gen Z.

The company, which also includes Kate Spade, acquired over 2.2 million new customers globally in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by growth in Gen Z consumers compared to the prior year. The company said that generation, which is typically defined as spanning in age from roughly 13 to 29, accounted for about 35% of new customers.

"The Gen Z consumer, specifically, is highly fashion engaged, spending slightly more of their budget on fashion," she said.

She added those younger customers have a high retention rate, "maybe busting a myth that these customers, Gen Z customers, aren't sticky or loyal."

Here's what the company reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Tapestry's net income in the three-month period that ended Sept. 27 rose to $274.8 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $186.6 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

It hiked its full-year outlook for both sales and profits, saying it now expects revenue around $7.3 billion for the year, which would be 4% or 5% growth from the prior year, compared to its prior expectations of nearly $7.2 billion. For earnings per diluted share, it now expects a range of $5.45 to $5.60, higher than its prior guidance of $5.30 to $5.45.

Despite the raised forecast and better than-expected quarterly results, Tapestry's shares fell about 9% in premarket trading.

With its Gen Z strength, Tapestry defied some other companies' assessments on the health of younger shoppers.

Cava saw demand among the 25- to 34-year-old consumers fall as the fast-casual chain entered its current quarter, CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview with CNBC. She attributed a pullback to younger diners' higher unemployment rate, their greater likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring and tariffs creating "an overall fog for the consumer."

Chipotle's CEO Scott Boatwright similarly said the chain is seeing younger diners visit less frequently, especially those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old.

And some holiday forecasts have also reflected a predicted drop in spending by Gen Z. According to consulting firm PwC's holiday survey, Gen Z plans to cut average holiday spending the most among generations surveyed compared to the year-ago period — with respondents in that age group saying they plan to spend 23% less.

Deloitte found a similar trend, with Gen Z consumers saying in its separate survey that they plan to spend an average of 34% less this holiday season than a year ago. Weakness carried into the next oldest generation, as millennials — respondents between ages 29 and 44 in the poll — said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season.

Metropolis, which uses AI and computer vision to identify vehicles and take parking lot payments without any physical transaction, has raised $1.6 billion in combined debt and equity in a new fundraising round at a $5 billion valuation.

Already the largest parking lot network in the U.S., handling more than 7% of licensed drivers (nearly 20 million people) across over 4,000 locations, the Santa Monica, California-based company is planning to use the capital for a major expansion across the retail sector, including gas stations and quick-service restaurant drive-thru windows, as well as into hotels and office buildings.

"With this new capital, we're continuing to scale our platform and forge the foundation of the Recognition Economy, building a new paradigm for how AI is deployed in the real world," said Alex Israel, CEO and co-founder of Metropolis, in the deal announcement.

The $1.6 billion capitalization includes a $1.1 billion senior secured loan and $500 million in Series D equity funding, led by a fund managed by existing investor LionTree. Additional investors included Eldridge, SoftBank, DFJ, Tekne Capital, Vista and BDT & MSD Partners' affiliated credit funds. It's the largest round that the company has raised across its $2 billion in deals not specifically tied to an acquisition — Metropolis took parking lot operator SP Plus private in 2024, the largest private M&A deal of 2024. The company doubled the debt it was able to raise since its last credit market deal in 2024 in a new financing led by J.P. Morgan, which the company attributed to its expanding gross margins.

"Metropolis is demonstrating that AI can be thoughtfully commercialized at real-world scale," said Ramin Arani, head of investments at LionTree, in the deal announcement.

Metropolis ranked No. 13 on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

Any driver that has used a Metropolis parking lot knows that the payment can be conducted with no waiting, no tickets, machines, credit cards, or apps. The company's proprietary computer vision platform recognizes a "vehicle fingerprint" based on their unique characteristics. Users do have to first set up an account in the company's app or on its website with basic profile information including a license plate number, though its technology is not limited to license plate scanning.

The company says it has been growing by one million members per month and sees a total addressable market of at least 50 million individuals. Across its current operations, Metropolis is handling $5 billion in annual transactions.

"The physical world remains hopelessly analog," said Courtney Fukuda, chief integration officer and co-founder of Metropolis, at the recent CNBC AI Summit in Nashville. "We started by fixing parking, partially because it's ubiquitous and because it's a nightmare," she added.

As the company expands into retail locations including fueling and drive-thrus, it will be focused on a software-as-a-service model, with retail and real estate owners benefitting from offering the technology to their consumers. "We're not going to go and buy 1,000 McDonald's and suddenly franchise McDonald's with our computer vision technology," Fukuda said. "We're going to be licensing our technology to those operators."

While the parking lot experience is more limited to making the payment transaction frictionless, Metropolis is betting that as it moves deeper across retail and the physical world, its ability to gather and analyze data on individuals will lead to a level of personalization that consumers prefer and that increases revenue opportunities for businesses, ushering in a "post-device world."

"We know where people are actually moving in the real world, and we can start to put together essentially a member graph of their physical world footprint and insights," Fukuda said, data analysis that will be valuable to commercial real estate owners, and hotel companies. "It gives them information about what used to be a black box and used to just be kind of cash collections," Fukuda added.

Cybersecurity startup 1Password, backed by Ryan Reynolds, Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson, has topped more than $400 million in annual recurring revenue, the company said Thursday.

"We believe we're at a pretty significant inflection point in our journey," CEO David Faugno told CNBC. "We're set up for this next wave of disruption, which I think is an even bigger opportunity for us."

Faugno said he expects the company to surpass a billion dollars in ARR over the next "several years," benefiting from a shift in the threat landscape due to artificial intelligence and more complex protection needs.

In 2023, 1Password announced that it had surpassed $250 million in ARR.

AI innovation has accelerated demand for better cybersecurity tools to counteract sophisticated and complex cyberattacks. Big deals from Palo Alto Networks and Alphabet, and initial public offerings from Netskope and SailPoint have also put the sector in the spotlight.

Toronto-based 1Password was founded in 2005 and counts IBM, Perplexity AI, Salesforce and the Golden State Warriors among its customers, and it's also signed a multiyear deal with Formula 1 team Oracle Red Bull Racing. The company says it secures more than 1.3 billion human and machine credentials and works with 180,000 business customers.

Additionally, 1Password on Thursday announced it is bringing on former ChargePoint and Barracuda Networks executive Michael Hughes. Former Qualtrics and SAP executive John Torrey will join as chief business officer.

Faugno said both executives complement the company's strategy to lure larger enterprise customers.

Over the last year, 1Password has undergone a major C-suite shake-up.

Longtime leader Jeff Shiner, who ran 1Password for 13 years, transitioned into executive chair of the board in July. Faugno, who had been promoted to co-CEO a few months earlier, took over the role solely at that time. Faugno joined 1Password in 2023 as president and operating chief.

To date, 1Password has raised about $950 million and is valued at $6.8 billion, according to Pitchbook data. Other investors include actor Justin Timberlake, comedian Trevor Noah, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz and investment firm Iconiq, according to Pitchbook.

Faugno told CNBC that the company is weighing a possible IPO in 2026 or 2027, but isn't "rushing out to go public." He said 1Password remains focused on providing the best tools for its customers.

"We control our own destiny," he said. "From a profitability perspective, we have investors that are playing the long game with us."

Google is making its most powerful chip yet widely available, the search giant's latest effort to try and win business from artificial intelligence companies by offering custom silicon.

The company said on Thursday that the seventh generation of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), called Ironwood, will hit the market for public use in the coming weeks, after it was initially introduced in April for testing and deployment.

The chip, built in-house, is designed to handle everything from the training of large models to powering real-time chatbots and AI agents. In connecting up to 9,216 chips in a single pod, Google says the new Ironwood TPUs eliminate "data bottlenecks for the most demanding models" and give customers "the ability to run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence."

Google is in the midst of an ultra high-stakes race, alongside rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, to build out the AI infrastructure of the future. While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), Google's TPUs fall into the category of custom silicon, which can offer advantages on price, performance and efficiency.

TPUs have been in the works for a decade. Ironwood, according to Google, is more than four times faster than its predecessor, and major customers are already lining up. AI startup Anthropic plans to use up to 1 million of the new TPUs to run its Claude model, Google said.

Alongside the new chip, Google is rolling out a suite of upgrades meant to make its cloud cheaper, faster, and more flexible, as it vies with larger cloud players Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

In its earnings report last week, Google reported third-quarter cloud revenue of $15.15 billion, a 34% increase from the same period a year earlier. Azure revenue jumped 40%, while Amazon reported 20% growth for AWS. Google said it's signed more billion-dollar cloud deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the previous two years combined.

To meet soaring demand, Google upped the high end of its forecast for capital spending this year to $93 billion from $85 billion.

"We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions," CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call. "It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that."

DETROIT – Shares of CarMax Inc. fell more than 12% during morning trading Thursday after the used car retailer announced a weak preliminary outlook for its current fiscal quarter and said CEO Bill Nash would be unexpectedly stepping down.

The preliminary outlook for its third fiscal quarter includes an 8% to 12% decrease in comparable store used unit sales and net earnings per diluted share of between 18 cents and 36 cents, including 9 cents in non-recurring expenses related primarily to the leadership shakeup and other workforce reductions.

Regarding its CEO, the company said board member David McCreight, a retail clothing executive who has served as CEO of Lulu's Fashion Lounge Holdings and president of Urban Outfitters Inc., will replace Nash on an interim basis until a permanent replacement has been found.

CarMax also said Chair Tom Folliard, an executive with a 30-year history with the company, including as CEO from 2006 to 2016, has been appointed interim executive chair.

"The Board has decided that more direct involvement from David and me will help strengthen the business in this transitional period. During this time, we are focused on driving sales, enhancing profitability and reducing cost," Folliard said in a release, adding that the company's recent results "do not reflect that potential and change is needed."

The announced changes are effective Dec. 1, according to CarMax.

In connection to the announced changes and outlook, William Blair downgraded CarMax stock to market perform from outperform.

CarMax has struggled this year, with its stock price down roughly 50% in 2025. That compares with other car retailer stocks being up double digits, including a 52% increase this year for online used car retailer Carvana.

Nash on CarMax's most recent quarterly earnings call in September admitted that results that "fell short" of the company's expectations, as well as Wall Street's. The results included notable declines in nearly all key earnings including sales, net earnings and gross profit.

Those September results led to a significant decline in shares of the company and negative analyst reactions, including a $24 price cut by Morgan Stanley.

CarMax is scheduled to report its current fiscal quarter results on Dec. 18.

Peloton is recalling its original Bike+ after receiving reports that the seat post broke and detached from the equipment during use, leading to two injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a news release Thursday. 

The recall impacts 833,000 units, touching every original Bike+ the company sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022. The bikes were sold between January 2020 and April 2025, but Peloton stopped manufacturing them in 2022. 

The recall comes after Peloton received two reports of injuries "due to a fall" after the post broke off, the CPSC said in its release. It received three reports in total about the issue.  

The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using the bikes and contact Peloton for free repair. The company is offering a free seat post that users can install at home, the agency said. 

In a statement Thursday, Peloton said, "The integrity of our products and our Members' well-being are our top priorities." The company encouraged users to request the new part "as soon as possible."

The notice Thursday marks the second time Peloton has had to recall one of its bike models due to issues with the seat post. 

In May 2023, the company recalled every base Bike model that it ever sold, totaling 2.2 million units, after receiving 35 reports of the seat post breaking and detaching during use. The issue led to 13 injuries, including a fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises.

At the time, the company said the recall led to higher-than-expected membership churn, as between 15,000 and 20,000 people paused their monthly subscriptions while waiting for the seat post to be replaced. Replacing the parts cost at least $40 million during its fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, the company said at the time. 

The recall Thursday, the fifth since Peloton's founding, comes as CEO Peter Stern looks to get the fitness company back to growth and move past the many issues it has faced since its founding. 

Changing consumer dynamics have plagued the company since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, but so have its recalls, including one for its Tread+ treadmill in 2021 after a child was killed. 

Just over a month ago, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, raised prices and unveiled new features ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. 

The current quarter is Peloton's biggest for hardware sales. 

The company is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings after the bell on Thursday.

Clarification: This story was updated to clarify that the recall affects every original Bike+ sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022.

Tesla is expected to announce on Thursday the results of a shareholder vote determining whether CEO Elon Musk should receive a pay package of nearly $1 trillion worth of stock over the next decade.

There's little mystery to the outcome.

The electric vehicle company has suggested that shareholders approve the plan. Between Musk's substantial ownership and a hefty base of retail investors who almost always vote with the CEO, the numbers are difficult for the opposition, even though top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against the package.

Results of the vote are expected to be shared after Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas.

Board Chair Robyn Denholm, and other Musk fans, have argued that the outsized pay plan would keep Musk at the helm of the company, and that he's critical to Tesla's future and its ability to compete in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Baron Capital's Ron Baron said in a lengthy post on X, Musk's social network, that he's supporting the Tesla CEO.

"Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk," Baron wrote. "Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla."

But there are some vocal opponents. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said it would vote no. Norges is one of Tesla's top shareholders.

"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk — consistent with our views on executive compensation," NBIM said in a statement this week.

Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases.

"Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars," McRitchie said. "There's a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks."

Tesla shares are up 14% this year after a steep third-quarter rally lifted the stock into the green following a brutal start to 2025. Musk's purchase of $1 billion worth of stock aided the rebound.

Tesla introduced the new pay plan in September. The package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2024.

"If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?" Musk said to analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call last month. "I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence."

The full award would give Musk, who holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

Musk would receive the first tranche of stock if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla's current market cap is $1.54 trillion.

The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla's value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package.

Other goals tied to the pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD subscriptions​, 1 million bots delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement.

The proposed plan doesn't specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as "FSD Supervised" in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don't require human supervision on board.

Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion.

As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals.

There are also a list of "covered events" in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones.

Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to "international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction," that could hamper the company's ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line.

There are other benefits to Musk.

The pay plan doesn't require him to dedicate a minimum amount of time to Tesla, nor does it at all limit his involvement in politics.

In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company.

He's also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper last month estimating that Tesla sales from October 2022 through April of this year in the U.S. would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's "polarizing and partisan actions."

Shareholders are voting on the plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk's earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.

Nell Minow, a corporate governance expert and chair of ValueEdge Advisors, said she would vote against the new pay plan for Musk, describing him as a "part-time CEO" today.

"If they said we're going to pay him a trillion dollars, but he's going to give up all of his outside activities, he's going to shut up about politics, and really spend all this time making this a great company, then I'd say, OK, let's talk about it," Minow said. "But he's not doing any of those things."

Eli Lilly on Thursday said it will start late-stage trials on its experimental amylin obesity drug next month after it showed encouraging results in a mid-stage study.

The highest dose of the weekly injection, called eloralintide, helped patients with obesity or who are overweight lose 20.1% of their body weight on average at 48 weeks. The results support the pharmaceutical giant's efforts to bring next-generation treatments to the blockbuster weight loss drug market, and solidify its dominance in the segment. 

The data bolsters Eli Lilly's chances of bringing a strong competitor to the red-hot amylin space, in particular. Many industry analysts view so-called amylin analogs as the next wave of obesity treatments that could serve as an alternative or complementary option to existing injections targeting gut hormone GLP-1. 

Several large drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie have shelled out billions to buy or license experimental amylin treatments, and Novo Nordisk is developing its own drugs. Novo Nordisk — Eli Lilly's chief rival in the obesity market — and Pfizer are also in the midst of a heated takeover war over Metsera, whose pipeline includes a potential once-monthly amylin drug. 

Amylin analogs mimic a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Amylin treatments have a similar effect to GLP-1s like Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro, but some analysts and researchers say it could be easier for patients to tolerate and help them preserve lean muscle mass. 

The lowest dose of Eli Lilly's injection helped people lose 9.5% of their weight at 48 weeks, compared to 0.4% among those who received a placebo. Patients who used a two-step dose escalation – starting at a 6 milligram dose and increasing to a 9 milligram dose – lost 19.9% of their weight at 48 weeks. People who used a three-step dose escalation that started at 3 milligrams lost 16.4% of their weight.

The most common side effects of the injection were mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue, which were observed more frequently in patients who took higher doses of the drug, according to Eli Lilly. Patients in groups that gradually increased doses of the drug saw lower side effects. 

The company has yet to release detailed data on side effect rates and how many patients discontinued the treatment during the trial. Eli Lilly will present the data at the ObesityWeek scientific conference in Atlanta on Thursday.

Sierra Campbell has four key necessities she won't leave home without: her phone, her keys, her wallet, and a small tote bag.

The first three she uses only for practicalities, like paying for things and looking up directions. The bag is the source of all her entertainment: Loaded with portable activities like crossword puzzles, knitting needles, and watercolor paints, it's a deliberately screen-free way for Campbell to spend her in-between moments.

The 31-year-old has dubbed this her "analog bag," and considers it a key weapon in her constant battle against doomscrolling and brain rot.

"I firmly believe you cannot live a full life while unknowingly addicted to your phone," Campbell told me. "You might be missing really wonderful opportunities to have a fun and deep life. The analog piece is such a cornerstone of that."

When Campbell introduced the analog bag concept to her TikTok followers in August, she said the video's views and likes spiked well beyond her norm.

"It struck a nerve," she said.

In the two months since, a flock of young women have followed her example, with many showing off their own versions of Campbell's whimsical packing list: Disposable camera? Check. Needlepoint set? Check. Puzzle book? Check.

It may seem counterintuitive for a trend that celebrates screen-free life to resonate on TikTok, a platform that feeds on the exact habit these bags are fighting against. But all the women I spoke to for this piece said the appeal of the analog bag isn't anti-technology or anti-social media. Rather, it's part of a wider effort to use modern tools with care and intention — especially during the in-between moments of life, like when you're taking the train to work or waiting for a friend at a restaurant.

Too often, these analog bag carriers say, we squander this time by ceding our attention to the algorithm.

"My parents would always say, 'Count the cost,' and they were never talking about money," Campbell said. "The cost for the convenience of our phones has gotten too high."

Emily Karst, a 32-year-old school principal in Ohio, saw Campbell's video and instantly felt inspired. She, too, believes the key to using technology is moderation, and was looking for small ways to make that middle ground more attainable.

"What can I do to make it just as easy to pick up something that isn't my phone?" she said. "Sometimes it's because I want to check the time or I need to look at my directions or whatever. But more often, it's because there's been some sort of break in the action, and I've conditioned myself. I'm so uncomfortable being bored that I'm just going to instantly get that dopamine hit and watch a couple of TikToks real quick."

"Instead, if there's something else that we can grab," she continued, "it allows us to make a better decision."

Since she began carrying her own analog bag, which she loaded with a watercolor kit, "memory collecting" book, and needlepoint set, Karst said the number of times she picks up her phone every day has plummeted.

"I've been so serious about this, mostly because I was alarming myself," Karst said. "I don't want to live my whole adult life losing my ability to engage with good art and long books and novels and movies because I'm ruining my attention."

Campbell cites "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg as a major inspiration for the concept of an analog bag. The popular self-help book, published in 2012, argues that replacing one habit with another is more effective than quitting cold turkey.

As someone with a self-described "addictive personality," Campbell brings her analog bag everywhere because it ensures that phone alternatives are always within reach; the bag's contents offer easy substitutes when she feels that instinctive itch to pick up her phone, like a cigarette smoker who's trying to cut back might reach instead for a stick of gum.

Digital content is designed to be addictive, so Campbell's precautions are carefully considered. She packs a physical planner in her analog bag so she doesn't feel tempted to scroll if she needs to check her calendar. She even carries a Polaroid camera so she can interrogate whether she really needs a photo of something, or if it's just going to be snapped and then lost in the cloud, never to be seen again.

"If it's you versus your phone, the phone's going to win," Campbell said. "Willpower alone won't work."

Plenty of tech insiders and researchers have echoed Campbell's observations. The psychological concept of "technostress" has been in the public lexicon since at least 2018. Tim Kendall, a former executive at Facebook and Pinterest, told Yahoo Finance in 2020 that phone overuse is a stealthy phenomenon, describing it as a serious health issue.

"Most people think they spend two hours a day on their phone," Kendall said. "When we look at the data, it's four and a half. So there's a disconnect between reality and your awareness."

Indeed, recent studies have found that heavy consumption of short-form media is bad for your brain — it's linked to anxiety, depression, and shorter attention spans — and that even AI models can deteriorate when exposed to low-quality internet junk.

Still, the internet has become embedded in our daily routines and work lives. Being totally offline is a lofty and, for many, unappealing goal. Instead, those who carry analog bags or romanticize their #AnalogLife on TikTok simply strive to be mindful about their screen time — actively choosing when and why to engage with their devices, rather than scrolling mindlessly.

"We reach for our phones without really thinking first," Hannah Hofstetter, a 23-year-old healthcare worker based in Alabama, told me. "A lot of times, it's because we're thinking we want to rest. We want it to give our brains a moment to rest. Well, that is the opposite of what's happening."

When Hofstetter first saw an analog bag on her feed, she said she was struck with sudden clarity. Why had she even picked up her phone in the first place? Why had she opened the TikTok app? She couldn't remember the answers.

Now, when she's out with friends and she feels a lull in the conversation, Hofstetter doesn't reach for her phone — she reaches for her handy analog bag and pulls out a stack of Tarot cards.

"My first reaction was kind of an 'aha' moment," Hofstetter said. "Like, wow, I'm not using my free will like I could be."

Roomba once reigned supreme in the world of robotic vacuums, conquering both dirty living room floors with its advanced tech and the marketplace it helped create.

But iRobot, the maker of the iconic self-cleaning disc-shaped vacuum, is now finding itself left in the dust as it teeters on the edge of bankruptcy. The Massachusetts-headquartered company, a pioneer in the robotics industry, has warned that it's running out of options — and cash.

iRobot has grappled with mounting financial strain in recent years, and the collapse of Amazon's planned $1.4 billion acquisition of the Roomba maker in early 2024 has only exacerbated the company's troubles.

After months of trying to find a new buyer, iRobot said in a regulatory filing last month that its last remaining potential acquirer pulled out "following a lengthy period of exclusive negotiations."

The possible iRobot buyer offered a price per share that was "significantly lower than the trading price" of its stock over recent months, the company said in the October 22 Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The debt-burdened iRobot warned in the filing that if it can't find fresh funding soon, it "may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection."

An iRobot spokesperson told Business Insider that, consistent with its policy, it does not comment "on matters of this nature beyond our public disclosures."

With the holiday season approaching, the spokesperson said the company remains "focused on executing our strategy and delivering for our valued customers, partners, and consumers."

iRobot first publicly warned investors that there was "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue "as a going concern" in a March earnings report.

That same month, the company rolled out a new fleet of Roomba vacuums and mops, which CEO Gary Cohen said was aimed at "better positioning iRobot as the leader in the category that we created."

"There can be no assurance that the new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies," the company said at the time.

iRobot's current financial position marks a stunning fall for a company that introduced the world to the Roomba vacuum more than two decades ago and has sold over 50 million models globally since.

Before there was Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, there was iRobot.

iRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Colin Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — who had a "vision of making practical robots a reality," the company says on its website.

Before iRobot had its consumer breakthrough with the launch of the Roomba vacuum in 2002, the company focused on designing robots for space-related research and military use.

In 1998, iRobot won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, to build a tactical mobile robot. This led to the development of iRobot's PackBot, which was later used in search operations at Manhattan's Ground Zero following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

iRobot boasts on its website that its robots have "revealed mysteries of the Great Pyramid of Giza, found harmful subsea oil in the Gulf of Mexico, and saved thousands of lives in areas of conflict and crisis around the globe."

When iRobot went public in November 2005 at an initial share price of $24, it was already known for its innovative robot vacuums.

By 2013, iRobot had sold over 10 million home cleaning robots, vastly outnumbering the more than 5,000 defense and security robots it had delivered to military and civil defense forces worldwide the year before.

The company sold its defense and security business to the private equity firm Arlington Capital Partners in 2016 for up to $45 million.

Over the past decade, iRobot's annual revenue peaked in 2021 at $1.56 billion, but sales have been falling ever since.

iRobot — which today slings models ranging in price from $269.99 to as high as $1,299.99 — may have set the standard for home robot vacuums, but competition has surged from Chinese rivals like Dreame, Roborock, and Ecovacs, and other brands like Shark and Samsung.

In an August SEC filing, iRobot acknowledged that it has, in recent years, "seen increased competition with new product offerings in the robotic floorcare segment and have conceded some market share."

Amazon agreed to buy iRobot in 2022 for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction, but the deal fell apart two years later with the companies saying there was "no path to regulatory approval in the European Union."

The failed deal was a major blow to iRobot. The same day the companies announced that the proposed merger was off, iRobot said it would lay off 350 employees, or about 31% of its workforce. Angle, iRobot's cofounder and longtime CEO, also stepped down as part of the restructuring.

As the cash-strapped iRobot awaited the completion of the Amazon deal that never came, it took out a $200 million loan from the private equity firm Carlyle Group in July 2023.

iRobot said in last month's regulatory filing that it had further extended its loan waiver period to December 1 as its financial outlook darkens.

"We are currently in discussions with the Lenders to provide the additional capital we require to fund our ongoing business operations," iRobot wrote, adding that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection if the lenders "do not provide this necessary funding and we are unable to find other sources of capital in the near term."

The iRobot spokesperson told Business Insider, "As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC, we have reached an agreement with our primary lender to extend our covenant waiver under our loan agreement through December 1, 2025, in order to continue our active and ongoing review of strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, exploring a potential sale or strategic transaction and refinancing our debt."

Meanwhile, iRobot's shares — priced at $2.70 as of Wednesday's market close — have plunged about 65% year-to-date.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tatiana Teppoeva, a 49-year-old entrepreneur in Redmond, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I'm an entrepreneur with a Ph.D. in economics and two master's degrees, and I'm currently pursuing an MBA. I'm also a US patent holder in predictive AI, a certified personality profiler, and certified in nonverbal communication, voice, and speech analysis.

At the start of my career, I worked at Boeing as a business analyst, where I led global customer satisfaction initiatives and internal employee engagement analytics.

In May 2011, I joined Microsoft as a senior research manager. From 2015 to 2025, I transitioned into a senior data and applied scientist role, where I developed and patented an AI model for predicting hardware failures.

When I was laid off from Microsoft after 14 years, I started a company, One Nonverbal Ecosystem, rather than seeking a new corporate job. Now I teach executives how to command the room and project the presence they want.

My first reaction was disbelief and pure happiness. I picked up the phone and called a friend to share the news.

For more than a year, I had been thinking about leaving to start my own company, but it was not an easy decision after a 17-year stable career at Boeing and Microsoft.

I even had a resignation letter saved in my drafts, waiting for the right moment. When the layoff happened, I felt it was a green light, and I was grateful.

Microsoft provided me with clarity and a financial cushion with severance and medical coverage, which allowed me to start building my business without the immediate pressure of financial concerns.

I watched him start from nothing and build something impressive as a business owner in the construction space. He wasn't interested in college, and I didn't know how it would turn out, but I told him it was the perfect time to experiment. If it worked, wonderful. If not, he would still gain valuable experience. I've always believed we either win or we learn; there are no failures.

Watching his journey encouraged me to take the same leap. I had wanted to start my own business since I was 30, but life circumstances made me put that dream on hold.

But now, my kids are older, and I have my degrees and experience. I know I could always return to employment if I want to.

One time while at Microsoft, we were in the middle of a high-stakes incident review, the kind where everyone is under pressure because millions of users could be affected.

On the surface, the team looked motivated and fully engaged, but when we talked privately afterward, many colleagues admitted they were working out of fear of being blamed if something went wrong.

That moment showed me how often performance in corporate settings is powered by fear rather than real drive. Fear can create short bursts of results, but it's not sustainable in the long run. I learned that people do their best work when they feel trust and clarity, not when they're trying to avoid punishment.

I officially launched my business in spring 2025. Some days I work 16 hours and I love it, and other days I might work zero. I decide when and what I do. I really enjoy learning new things, and this is a completely new world for me.

At times, it feels overwhelming because I have 100 ideas competing in my head, so I have to work on focusing.

I've been published in the media, spoken on podcasts, created my first online course, trained small business teams, and worked with high-level individuals — all things I had never done before. Recently, I hired my first employee part-time.

For me, it's actually the opposite. I'm part of many communities and groups, so I often have to step back to focus on my top priorities.

The real difference from corporate life is that now, even when I feel overwhelmed, it's because of my own choices — and that feels like freedom.

The first time I saw that ICE was investing up to $2 billion in Polymarket, I did a double take. What do the immigration police want to do with a prediction market? I quickly realized the ICE in question was actually Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. That makes more sense, I thought — but also, only slightly? I thought the stock exchange guys were supposed to be the serious ones in the room, helping companies grow and people save for retirement, not teaming up with the guys who let you guess when the US government will admit aliens exist. But thus is reality in the year of our Lord 2025: Americans have a growing appetite for leaving their fortunes to the fates, and businesses are eager to capitalize.

"When people are given the means to bet, they're going to bet," says Jordan Bender, an equity research analyst at Citizens JMP.

The modern explosion of gambling in America began with the Supreme Court's 2018 decision to strike down a federal law prohibiting sports betting, leading to its proliferation across dozens of states. Now, much of the conversation is being dominated by another type of wagering: prediction markets. These platforms, which allow people to put money on a wide range of outcomes, from election results to natural disasters, have long been limited in the US. But recently, they've taken advantage of lax federal regulators and what they say are legal loopholes to offer their services in a growing number of states.

"It definitely looks, smells, and feels like gambling," says Steve Ruddock, a gambling-industry analyst and consultant and the author of Straight to the Point, a newsletter about the sector.

So do a lot of things these days. The lines between gambling and investing are increasingly blurred, from the crypto market to the stock market to sports, and, increasingly, everyday events. Arguments that this type of activity is beneficial because it shows us something about the wisdom of crowds, market inefficiencies, price discovery, or capital allocation are becoming harder and harder to buy. And businesses, even stodgy incumbents and unexpected players, are increasingly willing to capitalize on Americans' urge to risk their hard-earned cash. Everything's casino, and you're either getting in on the action or getting left behind.

I think a lot about a conversation I had a few years ago with Chris Grove, a sports-gambling-industry investor at Acies Investments, about the growth of sports betting apps such as DraftKings and FanDuel. He made a point that I discounted at the time: Once people get a taste for betting on one thing, they'll bet on a lot of things. This kind of gateway gambling represented a major opportunity not only for sportsbooks but also for investing apps and cryptocurrency platforms. When I relayed this to people, it felt like I was wearing a paranoid little tinfoil hat, but that case has quite clearly borne out in reality.

The recent hotspot has been prediction markets, most notably Kalshi and Polymarket, which match users willing to wager on either side of a discrete event. Kalshi has made a major push into sports, including in states such as California and Texas, where traditional sports betting is illegal. And as part of its push to become a "financial super app," investing platform Robinhood has started branching into betting markets in partnership with Kalshi. ICE has invested in Polymarket and will distribute the prediction market's data to investing customers trying to gauge sentiment on issues such as politics, business developments, and current events. Polymarket, once blocked for users in the US, is on the verge of becoming available nationwide. The NHL has signed licensing agreements with both Kalshi and Polymarket.

More traditional sportsbooks, which set the odds and against which gamblers bet, aren't only expanding their offerings with things like online casino apps, they're also taking a page out of their new competitors' book, too. FanDuel is partnering with CME Group, a derivatives marketplace, to build an events contracts platform in the US that will let customers put money on where the price of gold and oil are headed, as well as economic indicators such as GDP and inflation. DraftKings has acquired the predictions platform Railbird.

When reached for comment, a FanDuel spokesperson pointed to a press release about the CME deal. DraftKings pointed to comments its CEO, Jason Robins, made at a gaming conference in October, downplaying concerns about competition from prediction markets, saying that sports betting apps are a "vastly superior experience." Polymarket didn't respond to a request for comment.

If your head is spinning at all of this, it's understandable — this is all fast-moving and precarious. For one thing, it appears to be a reversal of previous regulatory approaches. Gambling has historically been regulated by states in the US, and at the heart of the matter now is whether prediction markets are considered gambling and, therefore, whether states should regulate them. Prediction markets say they're OK because they're simply offering contracts on the outcomes of future events and aren't on the other side of the trade. Since these are futures contracts, like those offered for gold or oil, the theory — and current reality — is that prediction markets should be federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not by individual states. The CFTC may be going along with this for the time being, but there's a lot of gray area. Basically, an 18-year-old in California can bet on a Dodgers game on Kalshi now, if it's considered a federally-regulated event contract. If it's sports gambling, that's illegal in California, and even if it were allowed, most states put the age limit at 21. Sportsbooks have state tax obligations that prediction markets avoid. Winnings are taxed differently, too.

"The vast majority of people that I deal with in this industry look at this and say, 'This is gambling, it's insane that we're having this conversation,'" Citizens JMP's Bender says.

Multiple states, including Massachusetts and Nevada, have sued or sent cease-and-desist letters to prediction markets, alleging they're offering illegal sports gambling. Native American tribes that operate casinos and sports betting operations in certain states have made similar claims. The answer to, "Hey, is all of this activity on prediction markets kosher?" seems to be ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

"The big question is, do these contracts violate all of the sports betting regulations? And that's kind of where things are right now," says Chad Beynon, an equity analyst at Macquarie. "It's tricky investing a lot of money in this space right now, because it might completely go away."

In an emailed statement, a Kalshi spokesperson told me the company is "confident" in its legal standing. "Federal and state turf wars over commodities markets have been going on for decades in America, and the law is clear — Kalshi exists under the sole jurisdiction of the CFTC." they said.

All the trickiness hasn't stopped some major players from getting involved. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund has invested in Polymarket. Donald Trump Jr. is involved with both Kalshi and Polymarket. The president's social media company, Trump Media, is planning to allow its Truth Social users to jump into prediction markets.

"You look at the money that is lined up behind these two names, and that's not money that has historically been involved with regulated gambling," Grove says.

To be sure, what counts as gambling has always been hazy to define, says Peter Malyshev, a partner in the financial services group at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. What constitutes a legitimate commodity futures contract is something regulators and courts battled over in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and when they arrived at their current definition, they couldn't have envisioned a world of sports betting taking place on mobile phones.

"The whole notion of what gambling is, what is not, is very, very loosey goosey and it's arbitrary," he says.

It's almost astounding to think about how commonplace speculation has become across the economy. A survey by the American Gaming Association found that 55% of US adults gambled in 2024, and Americans bet almost $150 billion on sports alone. That doesn't include activities that very much resemble gambling, such as exotic stock options, crypto, and prediction markets. I recently discovered members of my family are crossing the Wisconsin-Illinois border to place sports bets on NFL Sundays, as gambling is legal in the latter state but not the former. And I have not been immune to the allure. On a recent trip to Chicago, I stopped at a DraftKings bar outside Wrigley Field, where I could place bets. During a pre-season Bulls game, I checked out a FanDuel lounge to catch some contemporaneous baseball and hockey games and placed a few small bets from my phone. This is all stuff that would have been unimaginable five years ago.

"Once upon a time, you had to know a bookie or a broker or go to a casino, that's a lot more steps, and now it's just a few taps away," Parker Bach, a Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, who is studying digital political culture and prediction markets.

The less-than-ideal possible outcomes of gambling's expansion were put on full display in recent days with the NBA betting scandal. Federal prosecutors allege that current and former basketball players, as well as people in their orbit, passed along insider information about players ahead of games to place bets on them. Sportsbooks are the victims of the alleged crimes — they're the ones that were defrauded. However, the case has made clear opportunities for funny businesses that widespread gambling affords.

Consumer protection and legal issues aside, it's worth considering how some of this activity is distorting the economy and blurring the lines between investing and pure speculation. Investing is intended to drive capital allocation in ways that foster good businesses, good services, and good products, and, ultimately, grow the economy. Gambling is entertainment. But when money from the former pot goes into the latter pot, that could become a problem — it's not capital that's going toward creating anything, it's just a transfer of wealth. Tyler Gellasch, the president and CEO of the Healthy Markets Association, a nonprofit focused on increasing transparency for investors, says that the drive to funnel more money into speculative activities isn't just a concern for individual bettors or investors. "It also takes real money out of the real economy and into essentially side bets," he tells me.

Proponents of prediction markets say they have real value. They tap into the "wisdom of the crowd" and, in elections, may rival polling in predicting who will come out ahead. They can be used as a hedge against the possibility of different events — you place a little money on something that would hurt you, like your house burning down in a California wildfire, so that if the worst comes to pass, you'll make money to offset the loss. These arguments can be shaky: Pretty much everyone on prediction markets was wrong about the 2025 papal conclave.

I don't want to say everything's casino, but a lot of things are casino.

"I mean, if we're just being completely honest, it's all gambling," Ruddock says.

It speaks to a sort of nihilism within the American public — this idea that the system's flawed, so you may as well go for it with a gamble. It also says something about just how alluring speculation can be; people do it because it's exhilarating and fun and, for most, not a problem. We can quibble over legal and regulatory definitions all day, but the demand for speculation is there, and the supply is ever-expanding to meet it.

Business Insider Edition 

South Africa's government says it has received distress calls from 17 citizens who joined mercenary forces fighting in the Russia–Ukraine war, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation into how they were recruited.


        South Africa's government said on Thursday it has received distress calls from 17 of its citizens who joined mercenary forces fighting in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to order an investigation into their recruitment.
    


        According to Reuters, The men, aged between 20 and 39, are reportedly stranded in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region. “President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an investigation into the circumstances that led to the recruitment of these young men into these seemingly mercenary activities,” the government said in a statement.
    


        Officials said the group contacted South African authorities after finding themselves trapped in combat zones with limited means to return home.
    


        Earlier this year, reports emerged that Russia was recruiting citizens from several African nations, including Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and South Africa; to support its war efforts in Ukraine.
    


Bloomberg reported that the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, one of Russia's flagship industrial hubs and a key producer of Shahed-type drones used in combat, was among the main recruiters of foreign labour.
    


        The recruitment drive, now under South African investigation, is believed to be part of Moscow's wider efforts to address a labour shortage worsened by demographic decline and wartime mobilisation.
    


        It is reportedly being coordinated through the BRICS framework, particularly via the South African chapter of the BRICS Women's Business Alliance.



        According to report, the alliance signed an agreement in May to supply more than 5,600 workers to Alabuga and Russian construction firm Etalonstroi Ural.
    


In South Africa, the BRICS Student Commission promoted employment opportunities in Russia's construction and hospitality sectors, targeting women aged 18–22.
    


        These positions were advertised on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok as well-paid international placements.
    


        Lebogang Zulu, chair of the BRICS Women's Business Alliance in South Africa, told Bloomberg the initiative was designed to “match Russia's labour demand with South Africa's unemployment crisis.” Nearly a third of South Africans are unemployed, with youth and women disproportionately affected.
    


        However, links between these placements and Russia's military-industrial complex have raised concerns over potential exploitation.
    


Research by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) alleged that many women recruited through the Alabuga programme were unknowingly assigned to drone assembly plants rather than the construction or hospitality roles they were promised.
    


        The Alabuga facility has been targeted several times by Ukrainian forces, including one strike in August, underscoring the risks faced by those working there.
    


ISIS estimates that around 90% of the women who travelled to Russia under the programme ended up in drone production.
    


        South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has confirmed a formal investigation into the recruitment activities. “The government is actively probing reports of foreign programmes that recruit South Africans under false pretences,” DIRCO said in a statement.
    


        The latest distress calls from 17 citizens reportedly trapped in Ukraine have intensified scrutiny over these operations and raised questions about Pretoria's prior awareness.
    


        Russia's labour market is under severe pressure, with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko estimating a shortage of 4.8 million workers following large-scale mobilisation and population decline.
    


        The Kremlin has increasingly turned to friendly and neutral nations, including African countries to fill the gap.
    


        For Pretoria, the controversy poses a diplomatic challenge. South Africa has maintained a policy of non-alignment in the Russia–Ukraine conflict but now faces growing domestic and international pressure to respond to allegations of recruitment and deception involving its citizens.

Surveillance footage showed the UPS cargo plane that crashed near a Louisville airport lost its left engine just before takeoff, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said.

During a press conference on Wednesday, J. Todd Inman, an NTSB member, said that the CCTV security footage reviewed by the agency showed "the left engine detaching from the wing during the takeoff roll." Takeoff roll is the distance an aircraft travels on the runway just before it goes airborne.

"This and other videos, along with evidence we are finding, are very valuable assets to our investigators," Inman said.

The UPS plane, a 34-year-old widebody jet manufactured by McDonnell-Douglas, which merged with Boeing Company in 1997, was headed to Honolulu on Tuesday when it crashed near the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday evening.

The tail number was N259UP. It was first delivered to Thai Airways in 1991, before being acquired by UPS in 2006.

A screengrab of a social media video that was posted by Reuters showed the cargo plane banking hard left in the moment of the impact before the aircraft was engulfed in flames.

It's very rare, but engines can shear off at high vibrations. Mark Stephens, a former Delta MD-11 pilot and instructor, described it to Business Insider as a washing machine that spins out of control.

"The most dangerous time to lose an engine is right after takeoff," he said. "They would have very little time to react."

Louisville Fire Department chief Brian O'Neill said on Tuesday that the aircraft had around 38,000 gallons of fuel on board.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in an X post on Wednesday evening that the death toll had reached at least 11 people and expected it to be 12 "by the end of the day."

The crash caused UPS to halt package sorting operations at Worldport, the company's automated package sorting facility near the Louisville airport. UPS said in an updated statement on Wednesday that it canceled Second Day air shipping services from the facility.

A Boeing spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider that its technical team is supporting the NTSB's investigation in the matter.

"We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this accident," the spokesperson said.

There are about 60 MD-11 aircraft flying worldwide for cargo airlines UPS, FedEx, and Western Global, per Cirium. It has not flown passengers since 2014.

This is the second major cargo airline crash in a month. On October 20, an Emirates SkyCargo plane killed two people on the ground after it ran off the runway in Hong Kong.

The Federal Aviation Administration is cutting flights across 40 of its busiest markets to maintain safety in American airspace amid the ongoing government shutdown.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said during a press conference on Wednesday that the FAA was reducing flight capacity by 10% at 40 high-volume locations starting Friday.

Duffy said it was a "proactive" measure in response to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, who he said are under increasing pressure and will soon go a month without pay.

"This is about where is the pressure and how do we alleviate the pressure," he said.

Since the government shutdown on October 1, there has been an increase in staffing shortages and a rise in delays and cancellations at airports across the United States.

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said the agency would be working with airlines to determine how the flight reduction would be implemented. He said if there are additional staffing issues, additional measures would be taken.

"The data is telling us we need to do more, and we are going to do more," he said at the press conference. "I want to reassure the American travelers that it is absolutely safe to fly in the American skies."

Bedford also said that, in his 35 years in the industry, he was not aware of a similar measure ever being taken, adding, "We're in new territory" in terms of the government shutdown.

The shutdown, which has lasted for 36 days, is the longest in American history.

"The decision to reduce scheduled flight capacity, while necessary to keep our skies safe, will inevitably affect the travel experience, leading to fewer flights, longer delays, and more disruptions for travelers," Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the US Travel Association, said in a statement provided to Business Insider. "All government shutdowns are irresponsible, and this decision underscores the urgent need to reopen the government."

Duffy reiterated that flying is still safe.

Still, aviation safety consultant Anthony Brickhouse told Business Insider on Wednesday that controllers are highly skilled individuals, but humans can be stretched too thin.

"We design systems to minimize the impact of human mistakes, but when we add financial stress and fatigue to an already high-stress job, we could be looking at something a lot more serious than a two or three-hour delay," he said.

When emailed for comment, the FAA sent an auto-reply with the following statement on air traffic controller staffing: "As Secretary Duffy has said, there have been increased staffing shortages across the system. When that happens, the FAA slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations."

Sean Cudahy, an aviation reporter at The Points Guy, said because this will likely impact 40 of the busiest airports, which include major airline hubs, "you're going to feel this impact across the entire country because these are going to be hubs that have flights going to every city imaginable."

According to data compiled by Cirium, the aviation analytics company, a 10% reduction in flights at the 40 busiest airports could result in as many as 1,800 flights and 268,000 seats cut.

At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, for instance, if 10% of flights on Friday are cut, that would impact 121 flights and 14,524 seats, according to Cirium.

"If I have a flight this weekend or next week, I would definitely be concerned about whether that's going to take off and especially take off on time," Cudahy said.

Cudahy said he expects more specific information to be released in the coming days, but recommended that travelers keep up to date with their airlines and check their apps regularly for updates.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with He Jiabin, 35, the CEO of Ropeta, a Beijing-based robotics startup. His words have been translated and edited for length and clarity.

When it comes to decisions, I follow my instincts.

I grew up in Zhuzhou, Hunan, in central China. At 17, I left home to study product design at Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, where I started researching wearable hardware. In my third year, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia, where I helped scientists turn lab prototypes into products that people could actually use.One project explored whether a watch screen could be touch-sensitive — before the Apple Watch even existed. That inspired my graduation project: a line of smart backpacks. One tracked location for parents, another recorded video for cyclists, and a third powered a phone for seven days. The project earned national TV coverage.

One of my professors encouraged me to pursue academia, saying China needed more people developing a homegrown design discipline, rather than continuing to follow practices imported from foreign institutions.

But I was curious about how large companies scale and how their management methods drive tens of thousands of people to innovate. I wanted to approach things from a market perspective.

After graduation, I joined Baidu's learning lab as an interface designer, working on smart bicycles, self-driving cars, and smart glasses before moving to its research institute. While autonomous driving succeeded, other promising projects weren't pursued. I wanted to create products people could actually use.

So I joined the founding team of Ling Technology, which built Luka — an owl-shaped robot that reads to kids. We sold 4 to 5 million units. I was promoted to partner, overseeing product, design, production, and marketing. I stayed for five years, until intense competition drove down prices, and China's "Double Reduction" policy — which curbed after-school tutoring — cut investor interest in education tech.

We couldn't raise more funds, so I left.

In 2021, I joined Bytedance, as the leader of its industrial design department. I believed that among all the major tech companies, Bytedance was the most profitable, most aggressively innovative, and the one with the greatest potential for growth.

I worked on the leading brand of VR headsets in China. At our peak, the team had more than 2,000 people. But with such a big team, I didn't always feel involved or impactful.

At the same time, investors were looking for potential entrepreneurs.

Having spent a decade in human-computer interaction, I saw how "weak AI" products often disappointed users — and how the new AI wave could change that.

At a big company, the business is often quite vertical, leaving little freedom to explore.

I'm now the cofounder and CEO of Ropet, where I lead business management and product direction. I felt that making companion robots was a great direction. They require emotional subtleties in product development, not just a tech-oriented approach.

The company was founded in 2022 by Zhou Yushu, and I joined a year and a half later.

We secured $3 million in our first funding round, 10 million yuan in the second, and most recently, in August, we raised 30 million yuan, or about $4.2 million.

I've realized I'm not suited for big companies. I prefer working in a small team that innovates quickly. In a startup, I get direct market feedback. My goal is to sell 20,000 units by the end of the year.

We want to become the leading brand for cute pet robots globally.

Microsoft taught me how foreign companies operate. At Baidu, programmers led innovation, more than designers. Bytedance paid well but set tough goals, so people were very competitive.

At a big company, I could clock out at the end of the day. Now, there's no room to hide. No one else is there to solve problems. I think about the product and company issues 24/7. When I'm creating value, I don't see it as "work."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Eric Sim, 55, a former UBS banker who became a published author, professional speaker, and career coach. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his education and employment history.

When I was a young banker, I often heard my more successful colleagues bragging about their new watches or latest sports cars.

It wasn't long before I gave in to peer pressure. I bought myself a $3,000 watch. That made me happy for a few weeks, but the novelty of owning the watch faded quickly.

I stopped wearing that watch and switched back to my Timex, which I continue to wear.

Needless to say, I didn't follow my colleagues' footsteps when they bought their exotic cars or private wine cellars. I began to realize that instead of spending my money frivolously to impress others, I was better off using it to buy my freedom.

When you are working a regular job, you have to work with people that you may or may not like. You don't get a choice. But if you have freedom, then you can choose what you want to work on and who you want to work with. That's far more invaluable.

That mindset allowed me to retire eight years ago, when I was still in my forties.

Holding back on big-ticket expenditures during my banking days has given me the freedom to pursue my passions and interests in retirement.

In 2005, I contemplated going back to school to get an architecture degree. I eventually dropped the idea once I factored in the costs of switching careers. Besides having to study for five years, I would also miss out on the income and bonuses I could have gotten if I had just stayed in banking. It just didn't make sense to do it.

Now, in retirement, I could finally scratch that itch without any financial worries. I recently attended a six-week summer course on landscape architecture at UC Berkeley.

Of course, attending summer school at UC Berkeley isn't cheap. The fees, flights, and accommodation add up to around $20,000. That's on top of the six-week duration, which would be hard to make time for if I were still working a full-time job.

Going to UC Berkeley was only possible because I wasn't tied to a job. Most of my peers in banking still have to work because they stretched themselves financially with their expensive purchases.

By not splurging on sports cars or wine cellars, I had the flexibility to pursue the experience of being a student again. That's priceless.

We often spend a lot of time and energy worrying if people will look down on us based on the type of house we live in or the car we own.

Since leaving banking, I have been driving the smallest car I have ever owned. At first, I wondered how people would perceive that. Would they think I was no longer successful after quitting banking?

Surprisingly, no one cared. I have given people lifts in my car, and no one has ever treated me differently because of my car. These worries are usually all in our heads. Most people are more worried about their own image and reputation than about other people's.

There are three stages in your life.

In stage one, when you are about to join the workforce, you have time and health, but no money. Then, in stage two, when you are in your prime, you have money and health, but no time because you have to work and take care of your family.

Finally, when you are in stage three and have retired, you might find that your health has deserted you. Yes, you have time and money, but you can't really enjoy it.

I believe there's a magical stage between stages two and three, where you have time, health, and money.

My goal has always been to prolong that period, which usually lasts less than five years for most people. Some may even jump from stage two to three without enjoying the magical stage.

If you can rein in your spending in stage two, you can stretch the magical stage to 10 and 15 years. That's the real sweet spot we should all aim for.

Yesterday's 2.35% bounce produced a daily RSI reset but no bullish engulfing candle, unlike prior oversold recoveries on October 10 (5% bounce with bullish engulfing) and early August. This divergence from the established “bounce recipe” suggests the recent rally may lack the momentum needed to launch a sustained uptrend.

Technically, a bull flag is conceivable but weak: overhead resistance remains near $111,000, while immediate support lies under $96,000 (mid-channel low) and approximately $92,000 (October 17 pivot). A break of these levels would likely accelerate bearish sentiment. Although the daily TBO Fast line (~$107,000) offers a recovery target, Bitcoin's close below the $106,000 “line in the sand” and its position beneath the compressed daily TBO Cloud reinforce a “strong bearish” outlook. The recent upward shift of daily TBO Support from $75,000 to $98,000 signals key pivot activity but also narrows the margin for downside containment.



Ethereum closed below the daily TBO Cloud on Monday, confirming “strong bearish” momentum. A minor RSI reset accompanied yesterday's rally, but daily TBO Support levels—having risen in late September—continue to be sequentially undermined as ETH tracks lower. A decisive breach below the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement on this pullback reflects deteriorating technical structure.

On the upside, a move above $4,000 would face resistance around $4,100 (daily TBO Fast). Should ETH approach that level, aggressive short positions may be warranted, with a view toward a multi-year bottom. The current pattern favors further declines rather than a sustained rebound.

Combined stablecoin dominance pierced daily RSI resistance on Tuesday, increasing the likelihood of continued upside for the metric. Concurrently, the daily TBO Slow line has begun to slope upward, signaling a macro shift toward bullishness in stablecoin share—traditionally a harbinger of crypto-market caution. Despite this, there are no TBT bearish divergence or TBO Close Long signals on the daily, suggesting stablecoin allocations may keep rising and potentially weigh on crypto asset prices.

Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) closed red yesterday following an altcoin-led recovery, with daily RSI forming a lower high—indicating waning BTC strength. A drop below 57% could ensue, potentially reaching lows near 42% over the next 12 months if current trajectories persist. This anticipated BTC.D decline may spur a final “alt season” rally, as traders misinterpret falling dominance as a buy signal—overlooking the growing stablecoin dominance that truly gauges market risk appetite.

The total crypto market cap ex-stablecoins (TOTALES) closed green but remains below the daily TBO Cloud (“strong bearish”) with no bullish engulfing pattern, marking this week's dip as a potential setup for shorting overbought tokens. Similar conditions prevail on TOTALE50 and TOTALE100.

Conversely, the OTHERS index (smaller altcoins) printed a bullish engulfing candle despite staying under the cloud, reflecting sector-specific interest. On the 4h chart, TOTAL3ESBTC shows a flattened TBO Slow line, hinting at an early-stage recovery—though traders should await a daily TBO Close Short signal for confirmation. Noteworthy moves in privacy coins (XMR, ZEC, DCR) and dormant utility tokens (DASH, DGB, 1INCH) suggest a narrative-driven rally; yet risk management via profit-taking on interim bounces and DCA remains crucial.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) printed a TBO breakout above historical resistance, which may resemble a topping pattern rather than continuation given its late timing, echoing the early-2021 setup. S&P 500 futures shed their TBT bearish divergence after a modest rebound, though weekly RSI and OBV divergence hint at underlying weakness despite strong cloud support.

The VIX eased, alleviating immediate volatility concerns, while the Nikkei retraced to its daily TBO Fast line and remains above the cloud, suggesting a potential shift to bearish consolidation. The Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng recovered modestly. Gold continues in bearish consolidation within the daily TBO Cloud but is gradually building strength, reflecting broader risk-off dynamics.

Just a day after its last Ethereum deposit that raised eyebrows across the crypto community, leading investment firm BlackRock has executed another massive offload in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On Thursday, October 6th, renowned on-chain crypto tracking platform Lookonchain announced another major deposit of 4,653 BTC and 57,455 ETH into Coinbase Prime.

What is BlackRock up to?

According to data shared by the source, BlackRock transferred about $478.5 million in BTC and $194.9 million in ETH, worth a total of over $673 million, to Coinbase Prime within the last few hours.

It is important to note that the move came just 24 hours after BlackRock deposited 34,777 ETH worth approximately $114.97 million into the same Coinbase Prime address.

Notably, the repeated transfers — executed in multiple batches of roughly 300 BTC or 10,000 ETH at a time— signal a deliberate institutional positioning, likely an attempt to sell off large portions of its holdings.

While BlackRock is known to manage the world's largest Bitcoin ETF and recently launched its Ethereum ETF, it has continued to dominate the ETF ecosystem with consistent daily inflows.

However, the frequent sell attempts the firm has executed recently have raised questions about whether it is still holding on to its bullish stance.

While major Bitcoin funds like BlackRock often move assets to adjust holdings and match inflows or market demand, some commentators believe the firm could simply be providing liquidity for ETF operations rather than exiting its positions.

Nonetheless, the timing of the transaction has triggered greater concern, as it coincides with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins sliding aggressively over the past week.

With speculations suggesting that the market may have already concluded its bullish phase, panic selling has spread across the market as investors gradually lose confidence.

Thus, BlackRock's suspected sell activity has heightened fear among traders as the market continues to remain in deep red territory.

Call it some air slipping out what might be an AI bubble, or the Fed engineering a tightening in liquidity into a growing economic slowdown, or some combination of the two, but markets are pulling back again on Thursday.

Just before the noon hour on the east coast, the Nasdaq is lower by 2% and the S&P 500 down 1.2%.

Crypto prices — in the unfortunate position these past weeks of being uncorrelated with stocks when they were rising every single day, but perfectly correlated when stocks sell off — are again taking it on the chin. Bitcoin is lower by 3% over the past 24 hours and threatening to tumble back below $100,000. Ether ETH$3,372.41, XRP$2.3321, solana SOL$158.93 and doge (DOGE) are lower by 2%-6%.

Crypto-related stocks are having an even harder time of it. Robinhood (HOOD) is down 8.5% one day after reporting a sizable earnings beat, in part due to surging crypto trading. Among other exchanges, Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 5.6% and Gemini (GEMI) by 3%. Bullish (BLSH) is down 8% and Galaxy Digital (GLXY) by 5.1%.

Capital continues to flee to digital asset treasury sector, led by a 5.9% decline in pioneer Strategy (MSTR). At $238, MSTR is now lower by 6.8% year-over-year and down by 56% since soaring to $543 in the days following President Trump's 2024 election victory.

Bitcoin mining stocks — many of which have soared this year thanks to a pivot to becoming AI infrastructure providers — aren't being spared. Hut 8 (HUT), IREN (IREN), and Cipher Mining (CIFR) are among those down more than 8%.

Markets continue to reel from the Fed's surprise hawkish pivot last week at which Chairman Jerome Powell threw a big bucket of cold water on the settled-idea that the central bank would cut rates at its December meeting.

Powell's sentiments have since been echoed by numerous other Fed members. Worried about flying blind as the government shutdown means no official economic statistics, the central bank might be missing or choosing to ignore what's now become a string of other data pointing to underlying weakness.

The latest came Thursday with one of the worst Challenger job layoff reports in more than two decades, along with a troubling outlook from used-car sales bellwether CarMax (KMX). That company's CEO also unexpectedly stepped down — shares are lower by 20%. One day ago, McDonald's warned on the economic pressure being felt by its customers, sentiments echoed previously by chains like Chipotle and Cava.

The continued federal government shutdown also looks to be extending far further than most previously expected, according to the latest Polymarket odds. Folks can carp about deficits and bloated government all they want, but the shutdown means many billions of dollars that would otherwise by flowing through the economy (and markets) are not doing so.

Bitcoin's shaky October extended into the first week of November, as the broader outlook for crypto appears to be souring. On Tuesday, Bitcoin's price dipped about 21% since its all-time high last month to roughly $99,000, while other cryptocurrencies fell even more sharply. And while Bitcoin has since clawed back over the key psychological $100,000 mark, some think the crypto sector's remarkable run may be over for the time being.

The declines for Bitcoin and for other cryptocurrencies have been especially sharp over the past week. As of Thursday, Bitcoin slightly recovered to just under $103,000 but is still down roughly 5% in the last week. Ethereum is down roughly 12% to just under $3,372, and Solana is down about 19% to just under $158 during that time. 





Ethereum and Solana—the most prominent non-Bitcoin currencies known as alt-coins—hit record prices earlier in the year but have come down significantly. The former has plummeted roughly 30% since August, while the latter is down about 41% since January.





Bitcoin boosters like to tout the asset as an independent gold-like store of value but, as it has in the past, the price has softened along with the rest of the economy. In the last week, the crypto market's stumble has coincided with uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's direction, and a decline in the S&P 500. 





Meanwhile, the crypto market is still recovering from a flash crash on October 10 where traders experienced the worst crypto liquidation event in history, according to the analytics company CoinGlass. That day, exchanges liquidated more than $19 billion in leveraged positions. The flash crash followed Trump's Truth Social post in which he said the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China, “over and above” any tariff they were already paying.




“The current weakness reflects a mix of [an ongoing effort by markets to digest] 10/10, slightly more hawkish Fed tone, and a broader risk-off across assets,” said Jasper De Maere, an OTC Trader at Wintermute. 





Comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also affected crypto markets. At the end of last month, he hinted that the October rate cut could be the last one of the year. He said his colleagues had “strongly differing views” about future rate cuts and that, “there's a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle.” In the 24 hours following those comments, Bitcoin and Ethereum dipped about 1.6% and 2%, respectively. 





On Tuesday, when Bitcoin slipped under $100k, many on social media were quick to voice their concern.

Some analysts also believe that crypto might be struggling for a while, “[Many long-term holders] who adhere to the four-year cycle theory…are selling positions, convinced that we are at or near the cycle top,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. 





Then there's those in the crypto world who view Bitcoin dropping as just a reason to buy more of it.

Reports have disclosed that crypto entrepreneur and Tron founder Justin Sun moved a sizable amount of Ethereum into a liquid-staking service this week.

According to on-chain data, about 45,000 ETH — worth roughly $154.5 million at the time — was shifted from the lending protocol Aave into the Lido Finance staking pool.

The transfer was public and traceable on the blockchain. It drew quick attention because of its scale and timing.

Sun's Public Wallets Grow

The funds had been sitting on Aave before the move. They were then deposited into Lido, which issues staked-ETH tokens that let holders keep a form of liquidity while their ETH is staked.

Based on reports, Sun's public wallets now show around $534 million in ETH holdings. That figure has reportedly surpassed his holdings in TRON's native token, TRX, which are estimated near $519 million.

Market watchers say the swap signals a shift in how some big holders are allocating capital.

Justin Sun just withdrew $154.5M of ETH (45,000 ETH) from AAVE and deposited it to Lido Staking. He currently holds $534M of ETH in his public wallets, even more than he holds in TRX ($519M).

Bigger Stakes, Bigger Questions

Analysts reacted fast. Some see the action as a vote of confidence in ETH's yield options and protocol security. Others raised the point that large sums routed into single liquid-staking providers can add to centralization risks on the network.

Price remains unpredictable. Also, staking carries its own risks — smart contract bugs, validator downtime, and slashing events are possibilities that investors must weigh.

 Market Context And Price Action 

Based on reports, ETH was trading near $3,389 when this movement was noted. The token had slipped about 12% in the previous week, which makes big staking flows more visible because large buys or internal transfers stand out against falling prices.

In the broader crypto landscape, institutional and whale moves into staking have been increasing over the past months.

Lido remains one of the largest liquid-staking providers, and its market share is watched closely by both traders and protocol researchers. Signals Versus Motive 

Actions by the Tron boss Sun could be long-term, aimed at yield, or at a broader portfolio shuffle.

There is something notable in the transfer, but it is only a piece to a bigger picture— including holdings, trading, and trends beyond the broader indirect markets.

In 2025, stablecoins have largely stolen the limelight from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). 

However, around the world, central banks are quietly progressing with their various CBDC initiatives.

For instance, the Central Bank of West African States is preparing to launch its CBDC pilot in the new year.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England's regular forums on the matter reveal steady progress on the digital pound.

Not so long ago, CBDCs were at the heart of the conversation around digital money.

Starting around 2019, what had previously been a niche interest among payment nerds captured the public imagination.

In 2020, China's e-CNY pilot garnered significant media attention.

When Nigeria's central bank launched the eNaira a year later, the world watched closely to see how the first nationwide implementation of the concept would unfold.

By 2024, digital pounds, euros, and dollars seemed inevitable, with more than 90 central banks in the exploratory stage and 44 live pilots underway.

However, the U.S. election that year changed everything.

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump slammed CBDCs as a form of government surveillance and vowed to shut down the Fed's digital dollar explorations.

True to his word, once he entered the White House, one of the first executive orders Trump signed explicitly prohibited the creation of a CBDC within the United States.

Subsequent efforts to enshrine a ban in the more enduring form of an Act of Congress are also underway, with the House passing the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act  in July.

Washington's stablecoin push serves as an important corollary to the anti-CBDC movement.

While both technologies address calls for currency digitization, stablecoins present a much more immediate reality.

Significant changes to a nation's monetary base can take years to plan and implement.

By the time more central banks make their move, stablecoins worth trillions of dollars may already be in circulation.

With stablecoins dominating the global conversation, CBDC plans appeared to stall.

Although some central banks have moved them onto the back burner, they continue to make quiet progress.

In a sign that the movement is still alive, the Central Bank of West African States will start piloting a digital version of the West African CFA franc in the new year, Governor Jean-Claude Kassi Brou confirmed  recently.

The announcement follows the launch of Uganda's  digital shilling pilot in October.

Meanwhile, minutes  from the Bank of England's CBDC task force reveal ongoing discussions on the finer details of implementation.

Central bankers' enthusiasm isn't always matched by political appetite. The same concerns that motivate Trump's anti-CBDC agenda continue to fuel resistance elsewhere.

For instance, while the European Central Bank is pressing ahead with plans to launch a digital euro as early as 2029, lawmakers are less convinced.

Ongoing pilots and explorations don't mean CBDCs are guaranteed.

While central banks around the world have been instructed to prepare the ground, ultimately, it will be politicians, not central bankers, who have the final say.

					Sending You to Google News in 3


If you're a cryptocurrency believer but don't want to bother with cold wallets and crypto exchanges, there's an indirect way to invest in  Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). You can get immediate exposure to Ethereum's price movements with shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN:BMNR) stock.

Although it's a relatively new company, Bitmine Immersion Technologies is definitely making waves in the crypto-sphere. The chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies is none other than Thomas “Tom” Lee, a co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and a loud-and-proud Ethereum cheerleader.

Lee and Bitmine Immersion Technologies are highly ambitious, and getting BMNR stock back to $100 isn't out of the question. At the same time, investors don't need to over-allocate into Bitmine Immersion Technologies shares as the path to fabulous wealth isn't assured and probably won't be easy.

It's not difficult to summarize the business model of Bitmine Immersion Technologies. The company is an Ethereum treasury company, which is a fancy way of saying that it stockpiles large quantities of Ethereum.

It seems that Lee and Bitmine Immersion Technologies don't just want to stockpile Ethereum; they may also seek to influence the Ethereum market to a certain extent. Already, Bitmine Immersion Technologies controls around 2.8% of the circulating supply of Ethereum.

Lee's objective for Bitmine Immersion Technologies' is to control 5% of Ethereum's circulating supply. “We are now more than halfway towards our pursuit of 5% of ETH,” Lee proudly declared.

At the company's current rate of Ethereum acquisition, Bitmine Immersion Technologies could easily reach that 5% goal. Just recently, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased 82,353 ETH, thereby bringing the company's total position to 3.4 million ETH.

The math on this is mind-blowing. If the Ethereum price is around $3,350, then Bitmine Immersion Technologies' 3.4 million ETH would have a dollar value of around $11.39 billion.

The company also recently had unencumbered cash holdings totaling $389 million, but that's a drop in the bucket when compared to Bitmine Immersion Technologies' cryptocurrency position. So clearly, the fate of Bitmine Immersion Technologies and of BMNR stock will largely depend on the price performance of Ethereum.

If you prefer to invest in stocks rather than cryptocurrency, BMNR stock is a pretty good proxy for directly owning Ethereum. Owning an ETH proxy is a double-sided coin, though, as Ethereum can crash as fast as it can rally.

Holding Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock surely felt good a month ago as the ETH price headed toward $4,750 and looked ready to break above $5,000. At that time, BMNR stock traded near $63.

Yet, just as the crypto market can be generous, it can also be harsh. In what has been described as a crypto flash crash, the Ethereum price recently pulled back below $3,350.

Meanwhile, Bitmine Immersion Technologies stock crashed to the $40 area. This harrowing price action prompted the question of whether the crypto flash crash signals the start of a long, painful crypto winter.

Lee doesn't seem to be overly concerned. He believes that the cryptocurrency liquidation event “reset the market” and created new accumulation opportunities, and calmly assured that the crypto “market is consolidating.”

Only time will tell whether the price “reset” is the start of a cold, bitter winter. Lee's calm confidence may feel reassuring, but sensible investors should view Ethereum, and hence BMNR stock, as a speculative asset that's prone to bouts of volatility.

For what it's worth, Lee called for Ethereum to potentially rally to $7,000 before the end of the year. A price run-up of this magnitude would certainly help Bitmine Immersion Technologies, as the company reportedly paid $4,037 per ETH token on average.

Furthermore, according to 10x Research via Bloomberg, Bitmine Immersion Technologies is “sitting on over $1.3 billion in unrealized losses with no dry powder left.” I already mentioned Bitmine Immersion Technologies' $389 million in cash holdings, which may be considered “dry powder” but that's debatable.

When all is said and done, there are too many moving parts to easily predict the future price path of Ethereum. Since Bitmine Immersion Technologies' success or failure depends on how Ethereum performs, only stalwart cryptocurrency optimists should consider owning BMNR stock.

Additionally, given Ethereum's price volatility, it's wise to stay small in your position if you choose to buy Bitmine Immersion Technologies shares. It's fine to hope that BMNR stock will reach $100, but bullish Ethereum predictions can only carry so much weight in an often unpredictable cryptocurrency market.

                            Algorand's Jorrin Bruns explains how the blockchain makes development faster and more accessible, empowering everyday developers to innovate. | Credit: CCN.com                        

In an industry defined by complexity, Algorand has long positioned itself as the blockchain that just works: fast, efficient, and accessible to developers from all backgrounds. But how does a network designed by cryptography pioneer Silvio Micali stay true to that promise while scaling to global use cases?

To find out, during the Blockchain Futurist Conference 2025 in Miami, CCN's Dr. Guneet Kaur sat down with Jorrin Bruns, Developer Relations Engineer at the Algorand Foundation, who spends his days bridging the gap between the technology and the builders shaping its future.

From hackathons to zero-knowledge tools, Bruns shared how Algorand is making blockchain development more straightforward, faster, and more inclusive, and why, in his view, real innovation comes from giving everyday developers the confidence to experiment.

When Bruns joined the foundation, even he was surprised by how accessible the platform had become. “You can write smart contracts in Python or TypeScript,” he said, smiling.

“That immediately makes Algorand approachable to the largest group of developers in the world.”

Bruns recalls demonstrating AlgoKit at recent hackathons, where developers unfamiliar with Algorand were able to spin up working prototypes within hours.

“People would come up to me afterward saying, ‘Wow, I can't believe it was so easy,'” he said. “That's not just a marketing line; it's genuine feedback.”

He credits this ease to Algorand's developer-first tools and precise documentation. “AlgoKit lets you spin up your own local Algorand blockchain on your laptop,” he explained. “You can deploy contracts, test them, and iterate quickly; it shortens the entire development loop.”

In a world where most blockchains still require navigating through unfamiliar languages like Solidity, Algorand's focus on Python and TypeScript gives it a mainstream edge.

“It's an easy on-ramp for anyone who's already a software developer,” said Bruns. “You don't have to be a crypto native to build on Algorand.”

One of the examples Bruns highlighted was HesabPay, a payments project operating in Afghanistan. The app utilizes Algorand's blockchain to facilitate mobile transactions for individuals who lack access to traditional banking systems.

“With just a smartphone and a QR code, users can buy what they need in local markets,” he said. “It's a simple, elegant solution that removes barriers for those excluded from traditional finance.”

Beyond frontier economies, Algorand is investing in nurturing new startups globally. The Foundation's Ecosystem Success Team runs an ongoing Startup Challenge, helping early-stage projects refine their ideas, build community, and pitch to investors.

“It's like an accelerator,” Bruns said. “At the end, they get to present their projects in a kind of ‘battle of the startups,' and some of them really do take off.”

As the blockchain world buzzes with terms like interoperability, zero-knowledge proofs, and real-world asset tokenization, Algorand isn't standing still.

“Real-world assets like gold being tokenized by Meld and real estate by Lofty are already being built on Algorand,” said Bruns. “That's not theoretical; it's live.”

He's particularly excited about a new toolkit called AlgoPlonk, which simplifies the creation of zero-knowledge circuits and their integration into smart contracts.

“It's still early, but the potential for privacy-preserving transactions is huge,” he said. “I'm building prototypes myself and hope to teach others how to do it.”

For Bruns, Algorand's Pure proof-of-stake consensus model remains its strongest technical asset. Developed by cryptographer Silvio Micali, it enables three-second block times, 10,000 transactions per second, and zero downtime since its inception, a trifecta few blockchains can claim.

“We balance scalability, decentralization, and security,” Bruns noted. “That was once called the blockchain trilemma; Algorand actually solves it.”

When asked how Algorand compares with established giants like Ethereum or Solana, Bruns pointed to developer accessibility.

“TypeScript was a huge factor for me,” he admitted. “If you're a web developer, you can bring your existing skills straight into blockchain. You don't need to learn an entirely new language or architecture.”

That accessibility, he believes, will drive the next wave of adoption. “There are so many developers who don't realize they already have the skills to build decentralized applications,” he said.

“They just need a reason and a platform that doesn't make it painful.”

When the conversation turned philosophical, Bruns reflected on what he hopes to see change in the developer culture itself. “I'd love to see more risk-taking,” he said.

“There are so many developers who have great ideas but hold back because they think blockchain is too hard or too speculative.”

At traditional software events, Bruns often meets programmers who are curious but hesitant about crypto. “They ask me, ‘What can I actually build with blockchain?'” he recalled. “And I tell them, start with the problems you see in the world. Whether it's data transparency, digital identity, or supply-chain trust, blockchain can enhance it.”

He paused before adding with conviction, “We're just scratching the surface. The real innovation will come when people start applying blockchain's core values, decentralization, transparency, verifiable data, to everyday problems. That's where Algorand wants to be.”

Bruns' message to developers is clear: don't wait. With approachable tools, a thriving global community, and a protocol built for speed and reliability, Algorand aims to lower the barrier between great ideas and working blockchain applications.

“Even if your first project doesn't change the world,” he said with a smile, “you'll learn something that leads to the next thing, and that's how innovation happens.”

                            Ryne Saxe on Stablecoins                        

In an exclusive interview with CCN, Ryne Saxe, CEO of Eco, discussed how stablecoins are reshaping the flow of money on a global scale. 

Saxe explained why the rise of blockchain-based dollars has reached a turning point, how traditional finance helped drive their legitimacy, and why interoperability across blockchains remains one of the industry's biggest challenges.

He also reflected on the deeper meaning of this technological shift, describing stablecoins as the foundation of a new digital economy powered by transparency, liquidity, and borderless movement of value. 

For Saxe, the future of digital finance is not just technical, it's philosophical. And his boldest statement is:

 “Money is a choice.”

See the full interview here:

Saxe says the turning point for stablecoins came “pretty clearly over the last 12 to 18 months,” when traditional finance began to endorse blockchain-based dollars as legitimate digital instruments.

“Initially, it was like an organized lobby by payment companies, financial institutions, increasingly important crypto companies,” he explains. 

“They started to advocate not only for regulatory tolerance, but regulatory endorsement of this technology as literally just a better dollar.”

He adds that adoption accelerated when major firms such as Stripe and Visa began building around stablecoin infrastructure. 

“It's just a dollar that moves more freely, devoid of banks and borders,” he says. “And there's huge demand for that.”

Despite strong growth, liquidity fragmentation across blockchains continues to slow stablecoin scalability. “We have really good interoperability tech that's come along quite a bit over the last couple of years,” Saxe says. 

“But new chains, new stablecoins, new protocols are spreading faster than the interoperability tech connected to it.”

He explains that the issue is not conceptual but structural: 

“As this market explodes, the extensibility of current interoperability tech to pass data and move liquidity across all of those in-demand routes is lagging. That's okay. We just need to grow up and scale into this use case.”

Saxe believes the missing piece is a shared incentive layer among major blockchain networks and stablecoin issuers. 

Drawing an analogy to Visa's early history, he says,  Visa got a hundred banks, who were otherwise competitors, to subscribe to the same payment network. 

He envisions a similar mechanism for blockchains and decentralized finance protocols: 

“What's missing is effectively an incentivized liquidity layer that they all subscribe to in trust that if they're easing money movement kind of across that network, they're growing the pie for everybody involved by improving user experience and user trust.”

Asked how Eco stands out, Saxe highlights two factors: positioning and performance.

“We are full-stack, opinionated for the stablecoin use case,” he explains. 

“Most people that we are maybe competitive against, it's usually kind of like an adjacency right now, are generalized protocols or generalized platforms, whereas we only care about moving stablecoins, which today is just moving digital dollars.”

He adds that Eco's system is optimized “from the user tap all the way down to the liquidity orders on the protocol,” allowing transfers “at size across blockchains in one tap in two seconds.”

Saxe describes the stablecoin economy as the foundation of today's tokenized financial system. “A stablecoin is the numeraire or the common denominator between the various tokenized use cases,” he says. 

“It's the only asset that's going to get you anywhere on chain.”

He predicts that on-chain dollar movement will one day “dwarf the U.S. economy” because it is “unbounded by banks or borders.” 

Stablecoins, he adds, form “the critical infrastructure of the plumbing to the tokenized use cases that are going to develop down the road.”

When asked how to prevent a few issuers or liquidity hubs from concentrating power, Saxe compares the future landscape to the long-running dynamic between centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEX).

“You can imagine a closed-loop provider, a SaaS business building API, or a more decentralized alternative, a protocol aggregating liquidity in a permissionless and transparent way,” he says. 

“I would give the advantage to the open protocol because it can distribute and grow much more quickly.”

For stablecoins to scale globally, he insists, “it calls for a protocol, not a company.”

The race to aggregate liquidity, Saxe admits, it feels a little bit zero-sum right now. He sees an emerging “standards war” among issuers and protocols but believes collaboration will eventually win.

Reflecting on the hardest trade-offs in building a universal liquidity layer, Saxe calls them “philosophical.”

He explains that you could choose to build an API layer as a SaaS business, or you could build an open protocol that incentivizes idle liquidity to supply capacity and ensure performance. The difference, he says, lies in values. 

“It's about where value should flow”, toward a singular company or a network of participants.

That decision, he adds, is “a values-driven philosophical trade-off” tied directly to how freely money should move on-chain.

Looking at the next five years, Saxe sees both promise and tension in the spread of digital dollars. 

“Right now, 99 % of stablecoin demand is demand for digital U.S. dollars,” he notes. “If it scales too quickly, smaller economies might find 50 % of their currency flow in dollars, not local currency.”

He predicts that this could lead to new “capital controls versus stablecoins,” forcing governments to decide how much on-chain money they can tolerate.

Still, Saxe remains optimistic. “Crypto is going to demonstrate to billions of people that money is a choice,” he says. 

“If enough people make the same choices about what money should be, then a new meme for money is created, and money evolves in that way. That's either incredibly equalizing and like optimistic for the world, or it's very destabilizing past a certain point.”

Bitcoin BTC$101,277.82 is holding around $103,000 having rebounded from Wednesday's sub-$100,000﻿ level. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is up 1.8% in 24 hours.

Still, the largest cryptocurrency remains in a technical downtrend from the Oct. 6 record high of $126,000, having formed a lower high at $116,000 as well as consecutive lower lows.

The altcoin market has fared even worse, demonstrated by bitcoin dominance ticking back up to 60% after dropping to 57% in September.

Several tokens remain well below critical levels of support including ENA$0.3145 and APT$2.7207, both of which posted declines of more than 20% over the past week.

The recent sell-off was spurred by strength in the U.S. dollar following murmurs of indecision from the Federal Reserve in terms of the rate cutting cycle.

Partner Content UK GDPR Article 32 mandates "appropriate security measures". The ICO has defined what that means: multi-million-pound fines for password failures. The violations that trigger them? Small, familiar, and happening in your organization right now.

Your sysadmin shares SSH keys via WhatsApp in "defnotsshkeys.txt". Your HR manager stores employee ID scans in Gmail. Your intern has admin access because it was easier than configuring permissions. And your former contractor from 2017 still receives reports with client data because his email was never removed from the distribution list.

These scenarios range from the simplest to more complex, like misconfigured cloud storage with cascading access rights across departments. But they share a common outcome: this is exactly how cybersecurity breaches happen.

And when they do, ICO responds with fines that can cripple businesses. Capita plc just learned this expensive lesson — unsecured AWS buckets and extractable passwords cost them £14 million.

The pattern continues across industries: Advanced Computer Software received a £3.07 million fine for incomplete MFA coverage. 23andMe paid £2.31 million after credential stuffing attacks exploited password reuse. Even small firms like DPP Law Ltd faced a £60,000 penalty when a brute-force attack breached an admin account that lacked MFA protection.

The statutory maximum? Four percent of worldwide annual revenue. For a mid-sized UK business with £10 million turnover, that's a potential £400,000 fine. For larger operations, the exposure scales into millions.

Recent ICO enforcement actions under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 show a pattern: password failures cost UK businesses millions. Poor credential management, missing MFA, delayed breach notifications — the same fundamental errors appear across companies of vastly different scales, and the ICO is holding all of them accountable.

From FTSE 100 outsourcing giants to small law firms, the penalties tell the same story:


Capita plc (£14 million)


The outsourcing behemoth's breach in March 2023 exposed the cascading failure mode of poor password security at scale. Attackers exploited an unsecured AWS S3 bucket to gain initial access, then used privilege escalation to move laterally across systems.

They extracted unencrypted passwords directly from server memory. The ICO's message was clear: if you're handling data at this scale, there's no excuse for basic authentication failures.


Advanced computer software (£3.07 million)


Advanced had implemented multi-factor authentication across much of its infrastructure. But much isn't all. Attackers found a single customer account without MFA protection and used it as an entry point for a LockBit ransomware attack that disrupted NHS services.

£3 million fine. The ICO's John Edwards was blunt: "I urge all organisations to ensure that every external connection is secured with MFA today… there is no excuse for leaving any part of your system vulnerable."


23andme (£2.31 million)


Threat actors launched a credential stuffing attack, using passwords leaked from other breaches to access 23andMe accounts. They compromised 6.9 million user profiles. The ICO's verdict? "23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond."


Interserve group (£4.4 million)


Interserve, a major support services and construction firm, suffered a phishing attack that compromised employee credentials. Once inside, attackers accessed systems containing personal data for thousands of employees and service users.

The breach revealed a critical vulnerability: without centralized credential management, a single compromised password can provide attackers with unrestricted access to the entire infrastructure.

Don't assume the ICO only goes after big targets. This small law firm learned that lesson when a brute-force attack compromised an administrator account that had no MFA protection. The attackers accessed sensitive legal client data.

The fine was proportionate to their size, but the reputational damage and legal implications were devastating. The message? UK GDPR applies equally to a five-person law firm and a major corporate player.

Credentials are scattered across business infrastructure in ways that would horrify any IT-security officer:

Only 23% of UK businesses have a formal incident response plan. Most organizations have no systematic approach to credential management: no visibility into who has access to what, no process for generating strong passwords, no method for secure sharing, and no way to revoke access when employees leave.

Reminders don't change password behavior. Human memory has limits. Human behavior follows patterns. You need a system that works with human nature, not against it.

The UK Government's Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 shows the scale of the problem: 43% of businesses suffered a breach in the last year, rising to 74% for large organizations. Phishing attacks were identified by 85% of breached businesses.

Despite 73% of businesses having password policies, adoption of advanced controls remains dismal: just 31% use VPNs for remote access, 30% have user monitoring, and only 29% conduct cyber security risk assessments. A mere 19% provide staff training on cyber security.

Most organizations lack systematic credential management – no visibility into access, no secure sharing process, and inadequate offboarding procedures. Password policies exist on paper, but enforcement and monitoring remain the exception.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) official guidance on password security has abandoned complexity theater for something that actually works: three random words. "CoffeeTrainFish" is both memorable and secure — far better than "P@ssw0rd123!" which appears in every breach database.

But strong passwords alone aren't enough. The regulatory message is unambiguous: without MFA on every external connection, you're violating Article 32 of UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, which mandate "appropriate technical and organisational measures."

With the ICO wielding fines up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover, "appropriate" has suddenly become very well-defined.

Enforcing strong, unique passwords across 50, 500, or 5,000 people without a centralized system? You can't. Or rather, you can try, but you'll fail in predictable ways. Users will write passwords in notebooks or simply reuse them, because remembering 47 different "three random words" combinations is cognitively impossible.

Your security policy will be perfect on paper and worthless in practice. This is where enterprise password management becomes non-negotiable under UK GDPR requirements. But here's the problem the vendors don't advertise: most enterprise password managers are awful to actually use.

They're technically robust. They tick all the compliance boxes. But they require three-day training sessions, have interfaces designed by people who've never watched a normal human try to log into something under time pressure, and come with support teams that respond in 48-72 hours with links to documentation.

So IT departments deploy them, users hate them, and within six months everyone's back to saving passwords in Chrome and sharing credentials via WhatsApp.

The problem isn't that organizations lack password management tools — it's that nobody uses them. Complex deployment. Unintuitive interfaces. So people revert to old unsecure ways.

Effective credential management requires quick implementation and intuitive design for end users, supported by advanced capabilities for technical teams. IT, DevOps, and sysadmins need secret storage, API integration, and automation. Regular employees need something that works without a manual.

Passwork was designed around this balance. Its features address the specific failures from those ICO cases: role-based access controls prevent the lateral movement that burned Capita, policy enforcement ensures passwords meet NCSC standards, and comprehensive audit logs provide evidence of compliance when the ICO comes asking questions.

But the real differentiator is this: Passwork has a high adoption rate because users don't hate it. That matters more than any technical specification, because security that people actively avoid using isn't security at all.

Implementation speed matters. Interface simplicity matters. Features depth matters. Support quality matters. (Read The Register's review to see how these factors play out in practice).

The ICO has made its position crystal clear: basic password security failures are no longer forgivable. The fines are real, they're large, and they're accelerating.

You can't fix this with a strongly worded email about password hygiene. You can't fix it by telling people to be more careful. The statistics show that individual users, left to their own devices, will reuse passwords and choose weak passwords.

What you can do is implement systems like Passwork that make secure behavior the default. Centralized password management, role-based access controls, and audit trails aren't nice-to-haves anymore. They're the minimum standard the regulator expects.

After Capita, Advanced, and 23andMe, you need to ask whether your business can absorb the financial and reputational damage of a preventable breach.

What to Know:

Gemini just switched on XRP perpetual contracts for EU customers, letting traders go long or short with up to 100x leverage and no monthly expiry.

Perps settle in $USDC and live inside Gemini's regulated EU derivatives stack, and this combo offers access to XRP volatility while keeping operations under an institutional-style framework. The launch adds a fresh venue for XRP price discovery and funding-rate strategies, which tends to attract market makers and bring tighter spreads. 

Why is this important? Because it adds more derivatives liquidity to one of the largest crypto payment assets and pulls capital into alt rotations.

As a result, $XRP has now recovered to above $2.3 in the last day (+3.49%), alongside many of the best altcoins on the market, including Ethereum (2.8%), Solana (+3.1%), and BNB (+1.04%).

When a Tier-1 venue lights up a new perp, traders often start hunting catalysts across the rest of the board. And it's often wallet infrastructure that sees the upside because that's where users bridge, swap, and stake while moving between trades.

That's the setup that can funnel attention toward top altcoin with direct utility.

Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Best Wallet, a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with an integrated DEX aggregator, a curated ‘Upcoming Tokens' presale hub, and a planned debit card.

$BEST owners get fee reductions, governance, staking boosts, and access to some of the best crypto presales on the market. If XRP perps kick off risk-on rotations, a wallet token that monetizes swaps and presale activity is a clean way to play the flow without guessing single-coin winners.

More perp venues usually equal more trading cycles, more bridging, and more on-chain execution. Wallets that compress those steps into one interface capture value at the ‘picks and shovels' layer, and Best Wallet (alongside $BEST) is designed to sit exactly there.To learn more about Best Wallet Token, read our guide.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Multi-Chain Wallet With Built-In Presale Access

Best Wallet is a non-custodial app built for daily use, not cold storage. It supports six major chains (Solana and Ethereum among them), routes same-chain and cross-chain swaps through an integrated DEX aggregator, and offers vetted ‘Upcoming Tokens' so you can join early presales from inside the wallet.

It also offers multi-wallet asset management, buying and selling within the wallet, on-ramp services, and a continuously-evolving DeFi ecosystem.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ties it all together with trading fee reductions, governance rights, and boosted staking rewards (a staking aggregator is in the works as we speak).

The roadmap shows a browser extension, NFT gallery, richer portfolio views, and a debit card to spend crypto are coming in the future.

That mix turns $BEST into a utility token linked to swaps, discovery, and payments.

So, when derivatives activity sends users rotating between majors and alts, $BEST's unified flow helps capture those transactions at the point of execution as the mechanism that returns value to holders.

$BEST's presale has raised over $16.8M, with a current token price of $0.025905. The token has substantial potential come next year – our $BEST price prediction shows a possible price point of $0.05106175 by the end of 2026 (a 97% increase from today's price).

That's not the only way to gain from this presale, though. You can stake your $BEST tokens immediately after purchase for a dynamic 78% APY (it will drop as more holders join the staking pool).

 Here's how to buy $BEST right now.

All in all, Gemini's move signals bullish times for altcoin rotations, and traders are already making moves. And Best Wallet Token can be one of the smartest investments in this period, especially if price predictions come true.

Join the $BEST presale before it ends in 22 days.

Vancouver, BC November 5th 2025

In a bold move to reinvigorate the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Strategic Crypto Reserve (SCR) has officially launched its platform at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca, aiming to restore meaning and value to digital whimsical artwork. Founded by a prominent large family from British Columbia, the initiative seeks to address what its creators see as a stagnation in the NFT space, introducing fresh perspectives and community-focused innovation to an asset class poised for resurgence.

The origins of the Strategic Crypto Reserve trace back to a multi-generational family based in Vancouver with deep roots in technology, art, and entrepreneurship. Led by the family patriarch, a former warehouseman turned venture capitalist, and supported by extended relatives—including artists, developers, and financial experts—the group identified a gap in the NFT ecosystem during the market downturn of 2022-2023. “We saw the NFT boom of 2021 as a revolutionary moment where digital art gained real-world value, but it quickly became oversaturated with speculative projects lacking substance,” the patriarch said in an exclusive interview. “Our family believed it was time for new players to step in, ones that prioritize creativity, whimsy, and long-term cultural significance over hype.

“The family, which numbers over 20 active members across three generations, drew inspiration from their own experiences in collecting traditional art and memorabilia. Growing up in British Columbia's vibrant creative scene, influenced by the province's natural beauty and indigenous artistic traditions, they envisioned NFTs not just as investments but as digital heirlooms. “Whimsical artwork—think playful illustrations, surreal animations, and imaginative designs—has always brought joy to our family gatherings,” explained the patriarch's daughter, the platform's chief creative officer. “But in the NFT world, that whimsy got lost amid rug pulls and celebrity endorsements. We wanted to bring it back, making digital art meaningful again by tying it to real stories and communities.” Among the key family members driving the vision is Dark Underlord, a tech-savvy relative known for innovative blockchain ideas, who contributed to the platform's core architecture.

Launched after two years of development, the Strategic Crypto Reserve platform offers a curated marketplace for NFTs that emphasize originality and narrative depth. Users can mint, trade, and collect pieces from emerging artists, with a focus on themes like fantasy worlds, environmental whimsy, and cultural folklore. Unlike many platforms, SCR incorporates blockchain technology to ensure provenance and scarcity, while integrating features like virtual galleries and augmented reality previews. The site, accessible at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca, also includes educational resources for newcomers, demystifying NFTs and highlighting their potential as stable digital assets.

At the heart of SCR's mission is the conviction that NFTs represent the next great asset class for investors. As traditional markets face volatility from inflation, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty, digital assets like NFTs offer diversification with unique advantages. “NFTs aren't just JPEGs; they're verifiable ownership of intellectual property in a borderless economy,” noted a financial analyst from the University of British Columbia, who consulted on the project after working the sociological ramifications of returning emails. “With blockchain ensuring transparency and immutability, holding NFTs can provide a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, much like gold or real estate in previous eras.

“Experts point to several factors positioning NFTs for growth. First, the maturation of Web3 infrastructure has reduced barriers to entry, with lower gas fees on networks like Ethereum and Polygon making transactions more affordable. Second, institutional adoption is rising: Major corporations, from sportswear giants to coffee chains, have integrated NFTs into loyalty programs, signaling mainstream acceptance. Third, the scarcity model inherent in NFTs—limited editions backed by smart contracts—creates intrinsic value, especially for collectibles with cultural resonance.

Investing in NFTs through platforms like SCR could yield substantial returns, proponents argue hesitant in buying SCR tokens. Historical data shows that blue-chip NFT collections have appreciated significantly over time, outperforming some stock indices during bull markets. For instance, a 2024 report by a leading consulting firm estimated the global NFT market could reach $35 billion by 2027, driven by metaverse integration and digital ownership rights. “The key is selectivity,” advised the patriarch. “By focusing on whimsical, story-driven art, we're creating assets that hold emotional and financial value. Imagine passing down a digital family portrait that's also an appreciating investment.

“SCR's family-centric approach sets it apart. The relatives have committed personal funds to seed the platform, ensuring artist royalties of up to 3% on secondary sales—a higher rate than industry averages. They've also support BC-based charities, pledging a portion of proceeds to political causes, aligning with the province's sustainability ethos. Early adopters praise the platform's user-friendly interface and emphasis on community events, such as virtual art auctions and creator meetups.

Challenges remain in the NFT space, including regulatory scrutiny and environmental concerns over blockchain energy use. However, SCR addresses these by utilizing proof-of-stake protocols and advocating for clearer guidelines from bodies like Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. “We're not just building a marketplace; we're fostering a movement,” the patriarch emphasized. “For families like ours, this is about legacy—digital art that endures.

“As the crypto winter thaws, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 in recent months, the timing for SCR's launch appears fortuitous. Investors eyeing the next wave of digital innovation may find NFTs, particularly those with whimsical appeal, as compelling holdings. “In an increasingly virtual world, owning a piece of digital culture is akin to holding shares in the future of creativity,” the analyst added.

The Strategic Crypto Reserve invites artists, collectors, and investors to explore its offerings at www.strategiccryptoreserve.ca. With its family-founded roots and forward-looking vision, SCR positions itself as a beacon for meaningful NFT revival.

Africa's largest currency union will pilot a retail central bank digital currency in early 2026, pressing on with a centralised strategy even as momentum shifts increasingly in favour of stablecoins as an alternative. 

“We are at the proof of concept [stage] now, and after that we will move to the pilot stage,” Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, governor of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), told The Banker, with the pilot due to begin in the new year.

Oops, something went wrong

Digital currencies have long carried both promise and controversy, hailed as a breakthrough for financial independence yet criticized for their heavy toll on the planet. Now, a project is looking to change how cryptocurrency operates in a world increasingly defined by climate awareness.

As detailed by the International Business Times, entrepreneur John Ortmann and his team introduced bitcoin.ℏ in 2024 as a sustainable alternative designed for the next generation of eco-conscious investors. Built on the Hedera Hashgraph network instead of a traditional blockchain, bitcoin.ℏ processes transactions quickly without the massive energy demands that have defined early cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Traditional crypto mining, which relies on a proof of work consensus mechanism, consumes enormous amounts of energy. One of the most resource-intensive cryptocurrencies used 154.9 billion kilowatt-hours in 2013 alone, more than the annual energy use of 167 countries combined. This environmental strain has driven innovators to explore cleaner approaches to digital finance.

Ortmann's team designed bitcoin.ℏ with this goal in mind. "We want to give people an opportunity for growth that does not destroy the planet in the process," Ortmann told the Times.

Hedera's governance system is decentralized like that of other cryptocurrencies, but it is not anonymous. Instead, it is overseen by institutions around the world, which provides added credibility and transparency. Its hashgraph consensus algorithm allows thousands of transactions per second while maintaining security through a "gossip about gossip" protocol and virtual voting. "We have a 39-member governing council. It is one of the most unique features of the Hedera," Ortmann said.

Another defining feature: predictable, low-cost transactions. While many cryptocurrencies fluctuate in price depending on network activity, bitcoin.ℏ maintains a fixed translation fee of just $0.001.

Though its name echoes the original bitcoin, Ortmann stressed that bitcoin.ℏ is not "associated with any cryptos that still rely on the energy-consuming PoW method." He described it as "common sense cryptocurrency," per the Times.

As the crypto industry addresses its environmental issues, bitcoin.ℏ shows that digital currencies can combine efficiency, transparency, and predictable costs while reducing their impact on the planet.

Senior Contributor.

Bitcoin's price movements have generated significant visibility lately, and the $100,000 level is acting like a “massive” “magnet” that is drawing in the market, said analyst Tim Enneking. 

“Everything else is dwarfed by the support of $100k," Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, claimed via email, emphasizing this level's crucial nature. 

He made this statement during a time when the world's most prominent digital currency has repeatedly fallen below $100,000, but has managed to quickly recover, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. Today, the cryptocurrency traded north of this level, flirting with $104,000. 

The digital asset has been trading close to this level after suffering significant losses over the last several weeks. Bitcoin prices reached a fresh, all-time high of more than $126,000 early last month, but have declined close to 20% since then. 

As the digital currency trades near $100,000, market observers have identified several key levels of support, areas where a concentration of buy orders could either slow or stop the digital asset's descent. 

Going forward, “It would be most constructive if BTC held the zone between 101k and 103k,” said William Noble, an independent crypto analyst, through emailed comments. 

“If there is a major stock market disturbance, there could be a drop to 95k-98k,” he stated. “If that is created by problems in the banking system or repo market, then I would expect a massive reversal higher whether stocks continue lower or not,” added Noble. 

Interestingly enough, several other market observers mentioned the $98,000 when identifying levels of key support. 

“Bitcoin is consolidating after a sharp pullback from the $110,000 area, and traders are watching to see whether it can hold key support near $98,000–$100,000,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, stated via email. 

David Brickell, head of international distribution for FRNT, also weighed in, indicating that “Key support lies near $98,000, with a break below that level potentially opening a move toward the $88,000 area — the breakout zone following the sharp sell-off in April." 

Several other analysts who offered input for this article also highlighted key price levels to watch should current support fail. 

“The first lower support level stands at mid $98k, if breached, the following support level stands at high $96k, followed by low $94k,” said independent cryptocurrency analyst Armando Aguilar. 

Enneking also shed some light on what could happen if support near $100,000 fails to hold up. 

“Looking lower, there is some support at $94k, but if that breaks, BTC will probably fall to the mid-80s. Below that, there is truly solid support at $74k,” he stated. 

“For the record, I don't see us testing any of those levels,” Enneking emphasized. 

Analysts also pinpointed important areas of resistance, which are price levels where a concentration of sell orders either slow down or prevent upward price movement. 

“A sustained move above $105,000 would suggest renewed momentum, with resistance around $110,000–$112,000 as the next major hurdle,” said DiPasquale. 

Aguilar offered a similar take, stating that “The upper resistance level stands at low $105k, followed by high $106k, then mid $108k.” 

Enneking also weighed in, specifying that “Moving up, BTC will face strong resistance at $107k, $112k, $116k and $123k.” 

“Of course, pushing to a new ATH (in this case, above $126k) is always a challenging proposition,” he noted. 

Brickell highlighted some similar levels, stating that “On the upside, a recovery above $107,000 would remove immediate downside pressure, while a sustained break above the $115,000–$117,000 region would put new all-time highs back into view.”

Seven leading blockchain infrastructure providers–Fireblocks, Polygon Labs, Mysten Labs, the Monad Foundation, the Solana Foundation, the Stellar Development Foundation and the TON Foundation– announced the formation of the Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC), an initiative to enable frictionless, compliant transactions across networks and borders.

Global onchain payment volume exceeded $15 trillion in 2024 and stablecoins now settle more value than Visa and Mastercard combined. Despite this, blockchain payments remain fragmented, with each network operating under different technical and compliance standards. The Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC) brings together leading infrastructure providers to enable frictionless, compliant transactions across networks and borders, laying the foundation for a unified global payments system, for businesses and consumers alike.

Stellar has facilitated billions in payments, proving blockchain's ability to move value efficiently at scale. But true global adoption requires more than just speed and low costs—it demands trust, interoperability, and clear standards. The Blockchain Payments Consortium represents a critical step forward in maturing our industry. We've always believed that financial infrastructure should be open and accessible to all, and BPC's mission to establish common frameworks across networks aligns perfectly with that vision." 

Raja Chakravorti, Chief Business Officer, Stellar Development Foundation

Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC) is a new industry consortium uniting leading blockchain networks. Our mission is to define safe, common standards that can shape better payment experiences for everyone.

Blockchain rails are reshaping the global payments landscape. But for blockchain payments to reach full potential, we must address the inconsistent and fragmented experiences individuals and institutions face when moving between traditional payments and blockchain.

BPC will define a common framework that enhances blockchain transactions with data requirements of traditional payments. This will enable financial institutions, enterprises, and other organizations to build systems that work seamlessly across networks and borders.

We will act as a bridge between blockchain ecosystems, regulators, and traditional financial institutions — offering a consistent, interoperable framework to enhance compliance across jurisdictions.

Together, we can lay the foundation for blockchain payments to operate on a global scale: fast, trusted, and truly interoperable.

The cosmological constant, which describes how our universe expands, may not be constant after all.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists have recently used an updated understanding of the math of our universe to theorize that the universe will end in a crunch rather than entropy into oblivion. The field of cosmology may be very vocabulary-dense, but the bottom line is that one of our key numbers—the cosmological constant—may have switched teams from positive to negative. (If you switched from gaining one pound a week to losing one pound a week, you, too, might end in a “Big Crunch.”) And using this math, a team of researchers has estimated that our universe has a lifespan of about 33 billion years. That means we have about 19 billion to go before we become crispity crunchity.

Cosmology is, in broad terms, the study of our universe—how it began, how it exists now, and how it will eventually end. Those who publish research on cosmology must work in a different way than many other sciences, because key moments like the Big Bang and an eventual Big Crunch are almost completely outside current human understanding. We can wind time backward by studying stars, black holes, exotic structures, and even the shadows we believe may lead to dark matter or dark energy. But we're missing huge connecting pieces, like how a tiny amount of matter can explode into a universe.

The cosmological constant is one effort to help answer these huge existential questions. We know that much of the mass and energy in our universe is invisible, or “dark,”  but we don't know the nature of this missing stuff, nor the source of it (though physics indicates that we're likely swimming amid dark matter at all times). Dark energy, including the cosmological constant, is suggested as a way to balance our observation of how the universe is expanding. The gravity we know is everywhere around us would actually shrink our universe, so if we're expanding all the time (as we are), that means something is repelling the universe's parts from each other.

To cosmologists, this meant a positive constant. The universe was “gaining weight,” so to speak, so it would continue to expand at a faster and faster rate because the “weight” grew at a constant rate. But this changed after recent results from both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) earlier this year. Scientists studied the data and found that the cosmological constant may not be constant at all, but rather changing over time and indicating that its influence may be weakening. That would change the most widely believed equation about the beginning of our universe. (Imagine if your math homework changed from “Solve x + 5 = 8” to “Solve x + y = 8”—that's a whole different skillset!)

Cosmology has been rippling from these DES and DESI revelations for months now, leading to research like this new paper—written by scientists based in the U.S., China, and Spain—which appears now in the peer reviewed journal Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics. These scientists have built a new, adjusted model for the expected lifespan of the universe by taking a possible negative cosmological constant into account. If the universe will stop expanding at some point and begin to contract, that's a huge change from the understanding we had of the state of things at this same time a few years ago.

Their conclusions bring with them some newly opened doors. “It is crucial that the DES/DESI observation is confirmed and the aDE model is rigorously tested,” the researchers explain, as science is built on repeated and replicable data that helps researchers refine their conclusions and test new hypotheses. The team also curbs an anticipated question about a so-called Big Bounce, which is a theory in which the universe “crunches” and then re-expands in a predictable cycle:

“Although very unlikely, one cannot rule out that, in the presence of quantum effects, there is a way for the universe to transition to the next cycle. However, this reincarnation will lead to a very different universe from our present one, not to a cyclic universe.”

So, for those hoping to leave a letter for the new universe 18.9 billion years from now, the next paradigm may not have humans, paper, or even stars. Plan accordingly!

Seeking Profits, Private Companies Look to Light up the Night Sky

Reflect Orbital's plan to deliver “sunlight on demand” using thousands of giant orbital mirrors is just the latest in a growing list of disruptive commercial activities in space

By Ramin Skibba edited by Lee Billings

For astronomers, the sky isn't exactly falling—yet the sky-high ambitions of tech companies seeking profits in Earth orbit and beyond are becoming too disruptive to ignore. SpaceX's Starlink Internet service, built with thousands of telescope-photobombing satellites, is the poster child for this problematic trend, but it's not alone. The latest start-up with brash out-of-this-world plans is Reflect Orbital, which has built a business case for beaming sunlight from orbit to power solar farms after dark. The company, based in Hawthorne, Calif., next to SpaceX's former headquarters, recently sought a license from the Federal Communications Commission to launch its first satellite in 2026 and plans to put thousands more in orbit.

Maybe that could work. But experts have technological, environmental and safety concerns. Marketed as “sunlight on demand,” Reflect Orbital's high-frontier initiative is just one among many; other companies in the proliferating space industry want to launch space advertisements, human remains and made-to-order artificial meteor showers. Such wide-ranging—and, to some, objectionable—projects are part of an ongoing shift from government-sponsored science or defense-focused missions to a new, commerce-dominated space era.

The satellite that Reflect Orbital aims to loft in 2026 is a test spacecraft dubbed EARENDIL-1—a Lord of the Rings–inspired name that, like many other tech companies and products that reference the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, would probably make the anti-industrial author roll in his grave.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Once the satellite reaches its approximately 600-kilometer-high orbit, it will deploy a giant 18-by-18-meter mirror to redirect sunlight down to targets on Earth. (The mirror's area is twice the size of a volleyball court.) In addition to describing the solar-power-boosting benefit of the technology, the company's website advertises other applications, too, such as “unforgettable” sunlit evenings at “entertainment venues, corporate events, and urban public spaces.” Reflect Orbital is financed by investors, including Sequoia Capital and the billionaire Baiju Bhatt, and is supported by a $1.25-million Small Business Innovation Research contract from the U.S. Air Force as well.

Reflect Orbital's project comes with many engineering challenges, however. “It's simple but not easy,” says Darren McKnight, a systems engineer and senior technical fellow at LeoLabs, a spacecraft- and debris-tracking company based in Menlo Park, Calif. “People look at each individual technology and say, ‘See, it's possible,' but don't put it all together.”

Overheating and station-keeping could be big problems for the sprawling, sunbathed satellite, as could the precise control required to pinpoint a reflected beam onto targets far below. The beam would also shed some of its energy in the atmosphere, with the potential for clouds and inclement weather to dramatically degrade its intensity. Overcoming these overlapping challenges would be a tall order, and the transmission losses alone could be astronomical across such vast distances, McKnight says. Reflect Orbital isn't the first organization to attempt giant mirrors in space for the purpose of beaming sunlight onto Earth: Russian space agency scientists pursued and even launched a prototype spacecraft in the 1990s before ultimately abandoning the effort.

Reacting to the company's announcements, a group of astronomers produced a fact sheet on October 6. It stated, “There are already solutions right here on Earth to many of the problems ‘sunlight as a service' purports to solve. This approach is simply a reckless and inefficient use of Earth orbit, a precious and finite resource.” In a statement to Scientific American, Reflect Orbital's chief strategy officer Ally Stone said the company “is committed to protecting dark skies,” and that its first missions would involve “tightly controlled light spots steered well away from observatories and sensitive areas.”

If the company's plans come to fruition, following its tests next year it will begin launching more mirror-toting satellites, ultimately building a mega constellation of 4,000 by 2030. Each would be capable of casting a 5 km-wide beam about four times brighter than the full moon down to Earth. But atmospheric scattering would ensure that some light escapes each beam, says John Barentine, a Tucson, Ariz.–based astronomer and executive officer of Dark Sky Consulting, which advises companies and city officials on outdoor lighting use. “We've calculated that, even relatively far from the beam, the [satellites] would still have an apparent brightness that would make them among the brightest objects in the night sky,” he says.

Large numbers of satellites in low-Earth orbit are crucial to Reflect Orbital's plans because a daisy-chain approach is required to consistently illuminate a target on the ground. A single satellite there could only beam sunlight to a surface target for some four minutes before flying out of range, whereupon another satellite would take over with its own beam. This process could continue for an hour or two during twilight and dawn. In addition to the potential effects on ground-based astronomical observatories, which already struggle to study the universe through existing levels of light pollution, Barentine fears the beaming could also have dire consequences for nocturnal wildlife—as well as the celestial views of everyday stargazers.

Besides Reflect Orbital's planned fleet of satellites, he cites other companies' bright spacecraft—not only SpaceX's Starlink mega constellation, which now includes more than 8,000 among its ranks, but also Amazon's growing Project Kuiper satellite fleet. Other problematic projects are AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird satellites and its BlueWalker 3 prototype, which Barentine and his colleagues have shown to be exceptionally bright.

Reflect Orbital's plan isn't an isolated phenomenon, says Jordan Bimm, a space historian and an assistant professor of science communication at the University of Chicago. “Humans have been sending weird stuff to space for a while,” he says. Numerous times, NASA astronauts have brought up various trinkets or smuggled items to space, including an unauthorized corned beef sandwich taken on the Gemini III mission in 1965 and a gorilla suit brought to the International Space Station in 2016. Furthermore, robotic missions have often included “festooning,” stowing or bolting small, nontechnical elements that don't directly involve the mission on landers and rovers, often for public engagement or other purposes.

“But there's zany, and then there's deeply concerning,” Bimm says. The past few years have brought multiple contentious space projects and concepts: For the first test flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket in 2018, SpaceX launched an entire Tesla Roadster into space, where the gradual, chaotic effects of orbital mechanics could eventually push it on a collision course with Earth or Mars. The following year live tardigrades were crash-landed on the surface of the moon via the Beresheet spacecraft, operated by the Israel-based nonprofit SpaceIL, which may have constituted a technical breach of planetary protection protocols. And not one but two companies had “lunar memorial services” (that is, cremated human remains) as payloads onboard last year's Astrobotic lunar lander, which failed in Earth orbit. In addition, a Russian company, Avant Space, seeks to launch space ads into orbit, where they would also contaminate the night sky. And the Japanese company ALE wants to deploy spacecraft that would generate high-visibility artificial meteor showers on demand.

The trend extends into proposals for commercial space infrastructure as well. Tech companies such as Nvidia and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have begun exploring the feasibility of launching solar-powered space-based data centers, and space-tech titans Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have each recently voiced vigorous support for the idea. And of course, billionaires themselves have traveled to space, including founders of companies that are leading efforts to design the first commercial space stations, which may gain prominence when government facilities such as the International Space Station cease operations.

For most of the 20th century, space activities remained largely the purview of powerful nations, with an initial emphasis on cold-war-era military applications, followed by more science-centric “soft power” feats such as moon landings, interplanetary missions and orbital telescopes, Bimm points out. But in the 21st century, lower launch costs and better spacecraft designs have allowed myriad commercial schemes and a host of new opportunities and controversies.

There's currently limited national and international oversight of many of these commercial space projects, but it doesn't have to be that way, argues Aaron Boley, a planetary scientist at the University of British Columbia and co-founder of the Outer Space Institute, a network of space experts. “In general, nation states remain responsible for authorizing and supervising their respective commercial space activities,” but some regulations need updating, he says. For U.S.-based companies, that means oversight is critical from regulatory agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, and other countries should make similar efforts, he says. In addition, the bedrock of space law, the Outer Space Treaty, states the overarching principle that countries must have “due regard” for others, which ultimately means that it's everyone's shared responsibility to protect Earth orbit and the moon as a common heritage for humanity.

Boley and other experts don't oppose companies pursuing far-out proposals per se. Investing “strategic R&D” in an ambitious idea that might not pan out anytime soon sometimes yields unexpected science and technology breakthroughs, McKnight says.

But potential innovations can't be the only consideration, Bimm says. “I'm not against being bold in space,” he says. “I think being bold is important, but you must also be thoughtful.”

The grave held the warrior's remains and a curved blade that likely meant the deceased was among the elite class.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Robbers may have stolen some exciting artifacts from a seventh-century Avarian warrior's grave, but they didn't take everything. Fortunately, among what they had left behind was a stunningly rare, curved iron saber—a 1,300-year-old find that, after its recent discovery, has gone on display in a Hungarian museum. 

The Szent Istvan Kiraly (King Saint Stephen) museum announced the August discovery of the grave, the impressive sword, and additional grave goods when they recently went on display. The find came thanks to the Hungarian National Museum's Cemeteries from Space program, which uses satellite imagery to pinpoint potential archaeological sites worth exploring. This site, roughly 30 miles southwest of Budapest, was first seen in the project's satellite images before excavation of the location unveiled the grave with its ancient warrior tucked inside.

Within the grave, which had already been at least partially looted, the team found the skeleton of what they are calling an Avar-era warrior—likely coming from the Avar kingdom in Central Europe, centered in modern-day Hungary. The bottom half of the skeleton was left untouched, while the abdomen and everything above it were scattered, likely by looters. In addition to the sword, those looters also left behind arrowheads, a silver belt, earrings with glass pearl studs, decorative metal hair braids, and a knife. The grave dates to between 670 and 690 C.E.

“These cemeteries prove that Fejer County was an important center 1,400 years ago,” said historian Gyorgy Szabados in a translated statement from the museum, according to Heritage Daily. “The saber discovery adds weight to that claim, offering both a tangible artifact and a symbol of the region's place in early medieval history.”

Retrieving the rare saber was tricky. Though still fully intact, with a decorative blade and hilt, the piece was rusted and brittle. A volunteer crafted a type of wooden cradle to help lift the saber, along with some of the surrounding soil, from the grave, allowing for enough restoration to be completed on the saber that it could be showcased by the museum. 

The curved nature of the blade, according to Live Science, was a common style used for warriors on horseback. Just who this particular warrior was, though, remains a mystery. The type of saber suggests that the individual was of a high social rank, and other expensive grave goods back that theory up. 

According to Live Science, historians aren't certain on the true beginning of the Pannonian Avar people, nor whether they were connected to the Turkic or Mongolian elite. With no known written language, the culture's history has been tricky to trace. 

Roughly 80 potential graves remain unexplored at the site, and from them, experts hope to gain more insight into Avar history. Maybe they'll find another saber along the way.

Radical chain initiation strategies are fundamental to the synthesis of small molecule drugs and macromolecular materials. Modern methods for initiation through one-electron reduction are largely dominated by photo- and electrochemistry but the large-scale industrial application of these methods is often hampered by scalability challenges. Here we report a general, thermally driven and scalable method for the reductive initiation of radical chains that involves reacting an inexpensive azo initiator with a formate salt to form a carbon dioxide radical anion. Substoichiometric quantities of this initiator system were used to form C(sp2)–C(sp3), C(sp2)–S, C(sp2)–H, C(sp2)–B and C(sp2)–P bonds from complex (hetero)aryl halides, with high chemoselectivity and under transition-metal-free conditions. The developed initiator system was also used to probe the mechanism of other radical reactions.

The controlled initiation of radical chains is a subject of fundamental importance to polymer science1, organic synthesis2,3, atmospheric chemistry4 and biochemistry5. In the context of synthetic organic chemistry, a substantial proportion of radical reactions are driven by chains6,7, but this aspect is often obscured—especially if the length of the chain is short. If the chain length is short, the reaction must be continuously reinitiated for its duration8. This is a major reason why photo- and electrochemistry have emerged as leading methods of initiation: they provide flexible and programmable frameworks to promote electron transfer and generate radicals at a controllable rate9,10,11,12,13. One drawback of photo-/electrochemical initiation strategies is their non-trivial scalability in a process development and manufacturing setting (beyond the milligram to gram scales used in earlier stages of medicinal chemistry)14,15. Indeed, both strategies require specialist reactor technologies, which may increase process development times and costs, limiting applications on the industrial scale when compared to standard manufacturing techniques (Fig. 1a). However, for chains driven by one-electron reduction (electron-catalysed and electron-transfer chain processes)16,17 photo- and electrochemical methods still far surpass the general utility of chemical/thermal initiation strategies using ground state electron donors18,19. Considering this current state-of-the-art, we sought to develop a general reductive initiation system with the following characteristics: (1) strongly reducing (\({{E}_{1/2}^{\circ}} < -2\,{\rm{V}}\) versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)); (2) usable in substoichiometric quantities; (3) thermally controlled; (4) does not form chain-terminating persistent radicals (a traceless one-electron reductant); (5) compatible with a broad range of substrates; (6) applicable to a wide range of reactions; and (7) inexpensive and scalable using standard manufacturing vessels.

a, One-electron reduction initiation strategies. b, Proposed thermal strategy using azo initiators to generate carbon dioxide radical anion. PC, photocatalyst; D, donor; \({E}_{1/2}^{\circ}\), half-wave potential.

In this study, we describe the realization of this goal by heating inexpensive azo initiators commonly used in the polymer industry20 in the presence of formate salts to generate a strong one-electron reductant, carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2·−, \({{E}_{1/2}^{\circ }}=-{2.22}\,{\rm{V}}\) versus SCE)20,21. Inspired by advances in the photochemical generation of CO2•− (refs. 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30), we hypothesized that electrophilic α-cyano alkyl radicals (derived from the thermal decomposition of an azo initiator) would readily abstract hydrogen atoms from formate salts to from CO2·− in a polarity-matched process (Fig. 1b). The proposed combination of an azo initiator and formate salt would provide an operationally simple ‘dump and stir' thermal method of initiation, which would satisfy the aforementioned criteria and be widely applicable across synthetic chemistry.

To evaluate the feasibility of our mechanistic proposal, we monitored the reaction of an azo initiator and sodium formate by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in the presence of the spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). 4,4-Azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ACVA) was selected as the azo initiator, as unlike azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), ACVA is not classified as an explosive. When reacting ACVA, HCO2Na and DMPO, a species matching previously reported data for a DMPO–CO2·− adduct was detected (Fig. 2a)31. To verify if this species was indeed a CO2·− adduct, these experiments were repeated using H13CO2Na and the expected additional 13C hyperfine coupling was clearly observed (aiso13C = 33 MHz). These results strongly suggest that CO2·− is formed from the reaction of ACVA and sodium formate. The feasibility of polarity-matched hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT)32 between the ACVA-derived α-cyano alkyl radical I and formate II was assessed by density functional theory (DFT), which indicated that HAT is both kinetically and thermodynamically viable (ΔG‡ = 14.5 kcal mol−1, ΔG = −3.6 kcal mol−1; Fig. 2b). It is possible that the distonic nature of I and interactions between the α-cyano radical and carboxylate anion may play a role in the efficiency of this electron upconversion process (the conversion of a weak/mild reductant into a stronger reductant product)17, but any such interactions are probably weakened by the highly polar dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solvent environment33,34,35,36.

Having validated our key mechanistic hypothesis, model synthetic applications were explored to determine the generality of this initiation strategy. We first targeted C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond-forming carbonyl α-arylation reactions due to the synthetic utility and prevalence of the α-aryl carbonyl motif in biologically active compounds37,38. Moreover, we posited that a general transition-metal-free radical strategy for carbonyl α-arylation would: (1) complement the scope of existing methods37,38 by providing improved compatibility with heteroaromatic systems, which are common poisons for metal catalysts; and (2) avoid issues related to the cost and toxicity of transition metals, as well as the geopolitical, ethical and environmental concerns regarding their supply chains39,40. Here, we hypothesized that CO2·− could initiate the electron-catalysed unimolecular radical-nucleophilic substitution (SRN1)41,42 of aryl halides with enolate nucleophiles43,44. Indeed, CO2·− is known to readily reduce aryl halides to form aryl radicals22,23,45. Thus, aryl halide 1 was reacted with ethyl acetoacetate 2 (4.0 equiv.), Cs2CO3 (4.5 equiv.), ACVA (0.25 equiv.) and potassium formate (0.5 equiv.) in DMSO at 80 °C for 4 h (Fig. 2c). Pleasingly, following the addition of ammonium chloride (to promote complete deacetylation of the intermediate 1,3-dicarbonyl 3), this one-pot procedure produced deacetylated α-aryl ester 4 in 79% yield and hydrodehalogenated side product 5 in 10% yield (Fig. 2c, entry 1). Hydrodehalogenated product 5 is proposed to form from a slower competing HAT chain in which the aryl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the formate salt (reforming CO2·−). Other commercially available azo initiators were trialled, but none proved superior to ACVA (entries 2–5). No product formation was observed in the absence of ACVA and HCO2K (entry 6). However, some product formation was observed with HCO2K alone (entry 7); we attribute this background reactivity to inefficient spontaneous initiation events—in which the anionic nucleophile itself serves as a weak one-electron reductant45—being amplified by CO2·− formation. Repeating the optimal reaction with ACVA and HCO2K in the presence of air reduced the yield of product 4 to 54% (entry 8). Moreover, all reactivity was completely supressed in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) (entry 9). Finally, repeating the reaction in the absence of the nucleophile 2 afforded only the hydrodehalogenated product 5 in 70% yield (entry 10). These findings are all consistent with an SRN1 electron-transfer chain process. Other compatible, but less effective formate salts and reaction conditions are described in Supplementary Tables 1–3.

With optimized conditions in hand, the scope and application of this thermally initiated transformation were explored (Fig. 3a). First, the importance of the nucleofuge was examined with para-halobenzonitrile derivatives. Pleasingly, the iodo, bromo and chloro derivatives were all converted into α-aryl ester 4 in 54%, 67% and 53% yield, respectively. Conversely, only 7% of 4 was formed from the corresponding fluoride, which indicates that the contribution of a polar SNAr mechanism to these reactions is probably minimal. Moreover, efficient reactivity was observed regardless of the arene substitution pattern because the meta- and ortho-substituted products 6 and 7 were both formed in good yields. Other electron-deficient nitrobenzene and aryl sulfone derivatives were similarly compatible and converted into products 8–13 in 30–85% yield. Interestingly, the reaction of 4-iodonitrobenzene formed product 11 in 66% yield in the absence of ACVA and HCO2K. We attribute this reactivity to spontaneous initiation, which is commonly observed when reacting anionic nucleophiles with easily reduced substrates (strongly electron-deficient aryl iodides)46,47. Carbonyl and ester derivatives were also tolerated and converted into α-aryl esters 14–20 in good to excellent yields. Notably, ester 20 could be formed in 77% yield from a dihalogenated substrate, illustrating the selectivity of this method for heavier halogens. Reactivity was still observed in the absence of strong electron-withdrawing resonance effects: bistrifluoromethyl derivative 21 was prepared in 66% yield. However, less electron-deficient systems displayed lower levels of reactivity as demonstrated by the formation of 22 in 15% yield. Moreover, no α-aryl ester product was formed from electrophiles bearing strong electron-donating groups such as 4-iodoanisole, but hydrodehalogenated product 23 was formed in 42% yield. This important result indicates that while the ACVA–formate initiator system is capable of reducing challenging electron-rich systems, the model SRN1 electron-transfer chain was not viable (potentially due to inefficient radical-anion coupling). Attention then turned towards our original target of heteroaryl halides. Pleasingly, pyridine, pyrazine and pyrimidine azaarenes, including the drug etoricoxib, with varying substitution patterns were all tolerated, furnishing α-aryl esters 24–35 in 26–63% yield. Finally, a variety of fused bicyclic heteroaryl halides, including quinolines, isoquinolines, quinoxalines, quinazolines, benzothiazoles, pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyridazines, were also compatible and substituted to form products 36–43 in 13–88% yield.

Next, in collaboration with the process chemistry group at AstraZeneca, we sought to determine if the developed method and initiator system were sufficiently scalable to allow widespread use in the pharmaceutical and related industries. Therefore, the safety of the model reaction system was examined, in particular the use of ACVA, DMSO and base at elevated temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry and fall-hammer testing of ACVA, and high-rate Carius tube testing of the reaction mixture, all confirmed that the reaction can be safely performed at 80 °C. The developed reaction was further optimized via high-throughput experimentation48 and time-course analysis, before being performed on a 50-g scale, which provided product 4 in 61% isolated yield and >95% purity following a simple precipitation and filtration process (Fig. 3b). This result was particularly pleasing considering the heterogeneous nature of the reaction mixture (common to many reactions using inorganic bases in organic solvents) because a lack of reaction homogeneity can complicate scale-up49. In addition, the clean reaction profile and lack of side products was notable as azo initiators are known to also react as electrophiles with strong nucleophiles50. Thus, the low-cost ACVA–formate initiator system appears highly amenable to large-scale applications (current prices: ACVA, £1.57 g−1; HCO2K, £0.11 g−1 (Sigma Aldrich)).

Inspired by these promising findings, we sought to test the limits of the developed method and initiator system by exploring their compatibility with complex (hetero)aryl drug-like intermediates through microscale parallel screening at AstraZeneca (Fig. 4) (see Supplementary Information for more details). We had confidence in the ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (uHPLC)/mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis because four substrates previously tested showed close agreement between isolated yields and uHPLC/MS area/area%. Pleasingly, 13 of the remaining 20 complex substrates, dense with Lewis basic-nitrogen functionality, afforded the desired products in synthetically useful yields under unoptimized conditions. To further validate these results, two of these ‘hits' (49 and 59) were performed on a preparative scale and isolated in comparable yield. These results demonstrate the broad synthetic utility of the developed initiator system and α-arylation methodology, which both appear ready for immediate application in industrial drug discovery programmes.

The deacetylation step with ammonium chloride was not performed to facilitate a workflow without additional solid handling. Yields shown are combined uHPLC/MS area/area% of acetylated and deacetylated products (if applicable) at 220 nm (identified by MS analysis). Screening yields are visually summarized in a heatmap-style graphic (higher yields are brighter in colour). Isolated yields at 0.3-mmol scale for validation are reported in parentheses. aAccurate reporting of the reaction outcome was hampered by poor resolution of the reaction components across multiple analytical methods. Ts, p-toluenesulfonyl; Bn, benzyl; PMB, p-methoxybenzyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl.

Having sufficiently explored the scope with respect to the electrophile, the nucleophile scope was investigated using 1 as a model substrate (Fig. 5a). First, closely related methyl and tert-butyl acetoacetates 67 and 68 were reacted to afford the corresponding α-arylated esters 69 and 70 in 77% and 42% yield, respectively. The ester functionality was not essential for reactivity because acetylacetone 71 was also converted into 72 (following a modified deacetylation protocol). Amide 73 was also tolerated and selectively converted into dicarbonyl 74 in 50% yield. More sterically congested nucleophiles such as 75 could be used to form α-methyl ester 76 in 55% yield. This result was particularly pleasing considering the prevalence of the α-methyl carboxylic acid moiety in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as exemplified by the conversion of aryl bromide 77 into suprofen ethyl ester 78 in 42% yield. Cyclic ketone 79 was also successfully arylated to form 80 with a quaternary carbon centre in 27% yield. The ketone functionality was not essential for reactivity because ethyl cyanoacetate 81 was arylated to form 82 in 66% yield. In a similar fashion, malonates 83–85 were converted into 86–88 in 24–68% yield. Pleasingly, benzophenone glycine derivative 89 could also be used to form the corresponding N-protected unnatural α-aryl amino acid 90 in 43% yield. Finally, we examined non-anionic nucleophiles such as enamines using modified conditions based on the work of Gianetti and co-workers who arylated enamines under photoredox-catalysed conditions51. Here, the pyrrolidine-derived enamine of cyclohexanone 91 was formed in situ and arylated to afford 92 in 36% yield. This result supports the mechanistic hypothesis of Gianetti and co-workers who proposed that a chain mechanism was potentially operative alongside a photoredox catalytic cycle. In addition to applications in methodology development, the ACVA–formate initiator system may therefore be used as a general mechanistic tool to probe cases in which a radical chain mechanism is suspected.

To conclude our studies, we chose to demonstrate the utility of the developed ACVA–formate initiator system beyond C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond formation. First, simply by exchanging the nucleophile for a thiol, 4-iodobiphenyl 93 was converted into diaryl thioether 94 in 62% yield (Fig. 5b). This reaction presumably proceeds via an SRN1 mechanism as thiolates are known to be excellent SRN1 nucleophiles42,52. Next, by omitting any nucleophile and increasing the equivalents of ACVA and HCO2K, aryl bromide 95 was converted into hydrodehalogenated product 96 in 61% yield. The addition of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2) enabled aryl boronic ester 97 to be formed in 51% yield. In a similar fashion, phosphonate ester 98 was formed in 50% yield when using triethyl phosphite as a radical trap. These results illustrate that the developed initiator system can be broadly applied for reaction development.

We have developed a general, scalable and inexpensive method to initiate radical chains through one-electron reduction by reacting an azo initiator with a formate salt. The power of this initiation approach was demonstrated through the development of a general carbonyl α-(hetero)arylation protocol, which enabled challenging and valuable structural motifs to be formed under remarkably simple reaction conditions. The scalability of this initiation approach and carbonyl α-(hetero)arylation protocol was demonstrated on a 50-g scale in an industrial setting. Moreover, compatibility with a range of complex substrates was illustrated through microscale parallel screening. Finally, in addition to C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond formation, the wider synthetic potential of the developed initiation system was illustrated through the development of C(sp2)–S, C(sp2)–H, C(sp2)–B and C(sp2)–P coupling reactions. Considering the multidisciplinary importance of radical chain chemistry, we anticipate that this inexpensive initiation strategy will find widespread application in both industry and academia. We also speculate that alongside large-scale manufacturing opportunities, the disclosed initiator system may serve as a valuable mechanistic tool to probe the chain character of other radical reactions.

An 8-ml screw-cap vial was charged with ACVA (25.6 mg, 75 μmol, 0.25 equiv.), HCO2K (12.6 mg, 150 μmol, 0.50 equiv.), Cs2CO3 (440 mg, 1.35 mmol, 4.5 equiv.), and if solid, the aryl halide coupling partner (1.0 equiv.). To the solids was sequentially added a magnetic stirrer bar, anhydrous DMSO (1.5 ml), ethyl acetoacetate (156 mg, 1.20 mmol, 4.0 equiv.), and if liquid, the aryl halide coupling partner through the screw-cap septa. The reaction mixture was sparged with N2 for 15 min before being sealed with parafilm. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 80 °C in a metal heating block for 4 h. To promote complete deacetylation of intermediate 1,3-dicarbonyls, NH4Cl (80.3 mg, 1.50 mmol, 5.0 equiv.) was added. The reaction was then stirred at 50 °C in a metal heating block for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature before being diluted with CH2Cl2 (10 ml) and water (10 ml). The organic phase was collected, and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 ml). The organics were combined, washed with brine (25 ml), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was then purified by column chromatography to afford the α-arylated product.

Insertions of large DNA sequences into the genome are broadly enabling for research and therapeutic applications. Large serine recombinases (LSRs) can mediate direct, site-specific genomic integration of multi-kilobase DNA sequences without a pre-installed landing pad, albeit with low insertion rates and high off-target activity. Here we present an engineering roadmap for jointly optimizing their DNA recombination efficiency and specificity. We combine directed evolution, structural analysis and computational models to rapidly identify additive mutational combinations. We further enhance performance through donor DNA optimization and dCas9 fusions, enabling simultaneous target and donor recruitment. Our top engineered LSR variants, superDn29−dCas9, goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9, achieve up to 53% integration efficiency and 97% genome-wide specificity at an endogenous human locus and effectively integrate large DNA cargoes up to 12 kb for stable expression in non-dividing cells, stem cells and primary human T cells. Rational engineering of DNA recombinases enables precise and efficient single-step genome insertion for diverse applications across gene and cell therapies.

The ability to insert multi-kilobase DNA sequences efficiently and precisely into specified sites in the human genome in a single-step mechanism would advance both synthetic biology and gene therapy, enabling integration of gene circuits, large-scale pooled libraries and entire gene replacement rather than individual correction of diverse patient mutations1. However, previous approaches have been hampered by semi-random integration2, limited efficiency3,4,5,6, ceilings on donor template size7 or complex multi-component delivery8,9,10,11.

DNA recombinases are an emerging class of genome editing systems with important mechanistic advantages for achieving precise DNA insertions into the genome. The LSR enzyme family offers high recombination efficiency and site-specificity, operates independently from host DNA repair machinery and requires only two components: the recombinase and the donor DNA12. Natively, these enzymes facilitate mobile genetic element integration into bacterial genomes by recombining two double-stranded DNA attachment sites (attP and attB). During recombination, serine recombinases simultaneously cleave all four DNA strands, creating a covalent protein−DNA intermediate, followed by controlled strand exchange via subunit rotation and rejoining of the DNA ends13. They are readily adaptable to human cell engineering, integrating at either pre-installed landing pads or endogenous pseudosites (termed attH for the human genome) that closely resemble their native integration sequence12,14,15.

The broad application of LSRs is currently constrained by the prerequisite of DNA recognition sequences within the target genome. Pre-installing landing pads can be particularly challenging in primary cells or in vivo settings. Even when suitable pseudosites exist, ensuring high recombinase specificity remains difficult. Our previous screening of more than 60 diverse LSR orthologs in human cells revealed that many integrated into genomic pseudosites but often with low specificity, targeting hundreds of sites with varying efficiencies12. Attempts to engineer LSRs and other serine recombinase systems to target endogenous sequences through mutagenesis or DNA-binding-domain fusions have historically yielded inefficient or non-specific systems3,16,17,18,19,20. Engineering tyrosine recombinases to target endogenous sequences showed greater success, yet their inherent bidirectionality limits genome integration applications21,22,23. In the present study, we developed LSRs with high efficiency and high specificity for direct human genome integration without pre-engineered landing pads.

We reasoned that three key mechanistic limitations impeding efficient and specific endogenous integrations are genome recognition and binding, donor DNA binding and recombination efficiency (Fig. 1a). To address these challenges, we developed a framework to guide recombinase engineering, using the genome-targeting LSR Dn29 as a proof of concept. We combined four strategies—directed evolution, machine-learning-guided mutation stacking, dCas9 fusions and donor attachment site sequence optimization—to create recombinases that specifically integrate DNA cargo at a single endogenous locus in the human genome. Furthermore, we demonstrate integration in stem cells and primary T cells and show that the integration site maintains similar transgene expression to validated safe harbors, such as AAVS1, while reducing transcriptome perturbation.

a, Overview of engineering strategies to improve integrations into endogenous genomic sites. By improving genome recognition and binding, recombination efficiency and donor DNA binding, we aim to enhance recombination between a plasmid containing the recombinase attachment site attP and a genomic pseudosite, attH1, by maximizing on-target integrations and minimizing off-targets. b, Genome-wide specificity profile of WT Dn29. The green dot is the on-target site, attH1 (chr10:21,130,405). The yellow dots are off-target sites, ranked by their insertion efficiency. Data shown are the same as Fig. 2i. c, Schematic of Dn29 directed evolution scheme in E. coli. An evolution backbone, pEVO, expresses a library of Dn29 variants containing NNK codons across the coding sequence (CDS) and contains attP and attH1 sites. Active variants remove the NdeI site, allowing selective PCR recovery after digestion. The active recombinase library can be shuffled to generate higher-order combinations of beneficial mutations and re-cloned into pEVO for subsequent rounds of evolution. d, Schematic of mammalian cell validation of evolved LSR variants. Colonies from the active recombinase library are randomly selected and validated in HEK293FT cells. ddPCR at the on-target (attH1), a single-off target (attH3) and a genomic reference measures the efficiency (attH1/reference) and specificity (attH1/attH3). e, Efficiency and specificity of 247 LSR library members in HEK293FT cells, shown as fold change (FC) to WT.

Variant 127 is shown in blue (n = 12 biological replicates, same data as f); orange dots indicate the addition of efficiency mutations; and teal dots indicate the addition of specificity mutations, with each dot representing 2−7 biological replicates. Dots and error bars represent the mean ± s.d. of samples with n ≥ 3 biological replicates.

Data presented are the same as shown in h. j, Efficiency of integration into a single off-target (attH3) of WT (n = 10 biological replicates), superDn29 (n = 2 biological replicates), goldDn29 (n = 5 biological replicates) and hifiDn29 (n = 3 biological replicates). k, Genome-wide specificity of on-target integration compared to all genomic insertions of WT (n = 3 biological replicates), superDn29 (n = 4 biological replicates), goldDn29 (n = 2 biological replicates) and hifiDn29 (n = 2 biological replicates).

We previously reported that LSRs catalyze DNA integration directly into endogenous genomic pseudosites12, with the number and identity varying across LSR orthologs based on the sequence similarity between their native attachment site (attB) and the targeted genome (Fig. 1a). In the present study, we sought to establish engineering principles for optimizing any LSR for site-specific genome integration, choosing the genome-targeting LSR Dn29 as a proof of concept owing to its favorable specificity and efficiency profile12. Dn29 integrates into the endogenous genome at 5% overall efficiency and directs 12% of insertions into a top site (termed attH1, located within an intron of NEBL), with three prominent off-targets (attH2, attH3 and attH4) each comprising 5−10% of total insertions and approximately 80 other low-frequency off-target sites (Fig. 1b).

Our framework involves three key steps: increasing on-target integration efficiency at attH1, reducing insertion frequency at prominent off-targets and minimizing the long tail of low-frequency off-target insertions. To measure our progress toward these goals, we developed three key metrics: ‘efficiency' as the percentage of attH1 sites that receive an insertion; ‘specificity' as the ratio of insertions into attH1 versus the prominent off-target attH3; and ‘genome-wide specificity' as the ratio of attH1 insertions relative to all on-target or off-target integration events (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a and Methods).

Because the protein−DNA recognition code of LSR enzymes for their DNA target site is unknown but unlikely to be modular like zinc finger or TALE proteins24, we reasoned that Dn29 would need modification via directed evolution to improve on-target integration into attH1. To increase Dn29 insertion efficiency at attH1 and disfavor integration into off-targets, we performed deep scanning mutagenesis of Dn29 at single-site saturation and tested the variant library in an intra-plasmid recombination reporter containing the attH1 and attP sites (Fig. 1c). Successful recombinants are positively selected by removing an intervening restriction enzyme site, whereas unproductive variants are eliminated via plasmid digestion23,25. To increase library complexity beyond single mutants, which may not be sufficient for modifying LSR target site preference, we performed DNA fragmentation and reassembly to shuffle successful mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1b)26.

After 12 evolution rounds and two DNA shuffles, we sequenced the output library with short-read and long-read sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1c−f). The resulting library contained a median of three amino acid changes per variant, with 72% of the pool carrying 2−6 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Additionally, the evolution process exhibited robust selection against non-functional variants, with mutation dropout rates increasing from 0.0035% in the input library to 44.9% in the output library (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). As expected, we saw strong retention of the catalytic serine and conserved zinc-coordinating cysteines27 and depletion of stop codons (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), and we observed that phylogenetic conservation negatively correlated with mutational tolerance (Pearsonʼs r = −0.3577, two-tailed P < 0.0001) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Compared to the input library, the output library was enriched for mutations in several hotspots, particularly in the C-terminal region (Supplementary Figs. 1e and 2). We observed higher mutational sensitivity in the N-terminal domain (NTD), consistent with its important functional roles in inter-subunit interactions, subunit rotation, catalysis and ligation28.

Next, we functionally evaluated variant library members in human cells from three directed evolution timepoints: after five cycles, after seven cycles plus one shuffle and after 12 cycles plus two shuffles (the final output library). We assessed the efficiency (insertion into attH1) and specificity (attH1/attH3 ratio) of each variant (Fig. 1d), observing a shift toward higher on-target efficiency between the first and second timepoints and more variants with improved specificity after the third (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Although our selection was based solely on integration efficiency, the emergence of specificity-enhanced variants suggests that some mutations improved target discrimination without compromising recombination activity.

Because most variants exhibited either enhanced efficiency or specificity, but not both, we hypothesized that combining mutations across these two classes would achieve both desired properties (Fig. 1e). First, we combined the four mutations from variant 62 (2.5-fold wild-type (WT) efficiency) and variant 93 (8.6-fold WT specificity) into variant 127, which demonstrated 13.4-fold specificity and 1.8-fold efficiency (Fig. 1f).

The ability to simultaneously improve LSR efficiency and specificity motivated systematic exploration of all mutations in our efficiency-enhanced and specificity-enhanced variants. We sought to identify the causal point mutations and remove passenger mutations, thereby enabling higher-order mutation stacking. Individual validation of each mutation in variant 62 identified E70G and A224P as the driving efficiency mutations (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The sole amino acid mutation in variant 93, N341K, was further investigated by substituting N341 with every amino acid (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Many substitutions increased activity, with N341Q improving efficiency 2.3-fold and positively charged residues robustly improving specificity (N341K: 6.7-fold, N341R: 5.3-fold).

We next assessed all point mutations from variants with at least 1.5-fold WT efficiency (n = 47 mutations) and two-fold WT specificity (n = 28 mutations) (Fig. 1g). We also included lysine mutations at putative DNA-interfacing residues, chosen based on alignment with the crystal structure of Listeria integrase C-terminal domain bound to attP (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4KIS)29, hypothesizing that positively charged mutations could modify DNA binding (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These mutations were individually installed into variant 127, identifying 12 additional efficiency and seven additional specificity driver mutations, each contributing 1.2-fold to 2.5-fold efficiency and 1.1-fold to 6.8-fold specificity improvements over variant 127 (Fig. 1g). A final round of mutation validation (Extended Data Fig. 2f) yielded a final list of 21 efficiency and 12 specificity driver mutations for further rational engineering (Supplementary Table 1).

We optimized Dn29 variants through sequential mutation layering, introducing single mutations into the best variant(s) from the previous round. We began with two lineages: an efficiency lineage containing 341Q and a specificity lineage containing 341K (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Double mutations showed mostly additive and subadditive effects, with rare antagonistic or synergistic epistasis (Extended Data Fig. 2h). This process yielded three key variants: superDn29 (10-fold efficiency and 70-fold specificity), goldDn29 (four-fold efficiency and 44-fold specificity) and hifiDn29 that combined goldDn29 with four additional specificity driver mutations to achieve WT efficiency with high specificity that approached the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) limit of detection (Fig. 1h−j and Supplementary Table 2). These variants demonstrated a substrate preference shift toward attH1 while maintaining or reducing activity at the native attB attachment site, indicating partial substrate reprogramming rather than expansion (Extended Data Fig. 2i). Finally, we conducted whole-genome insertion profiling using an unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based integration site assay that quantifies the relative frequency of on-target versus off-target integrations (Methods). This analysis confirmed the substantial improvement in genome-wide specificity, which increased from 12% on-target integration with WT Dn29 to 40−60% with the engineered variants (Fig. 1k). Overall, we identified specific mutations driving efficiency or specificity improvements, enabling rational engineering of optimized recombinases.

We demonstrated that LSR-directed evolution with efficiency and specificity classification enables iterative mutation combinations to generate LSRs with desired functional profiles. To expedite experimental testing higher mutational loads, we developed a computational model for predicting combinatorial variant activity from single mutant data. The variants were divided into distinct rounds, with the individual mutation validation in round 1 (Fig. 1g) and the iterative mutation stacking experiments comprising rounds 2−5. We trained two linear models (linear regression and ridge regression) and two gradient boosting models (XGBoost and CatBoost)30,31 on one-hot encoded variant sequences from round 1 and then tested these models on rounds 2−5 (Fig. 2a).

CC, coiled-coil motif; RD, recombinase domain; ZD, zinc-ribbon domain.

We evaluated model performance using root mean squared error (RMSE), Spearman's rank correlation and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). NDCG was prioritized as the key evaluation metric because it emphasizes higher-activity mutants, matching our experimental validation priorities. Although all models performed well, ridge regression excelled for both efficiency and specificity, showing high accuracy (NDCG = 0.970 for efficiency, 0.971 for specificity) in predicting higher-order mutant activities (Fig. 2b−d). The performance of linear models in extrapolating single mutant activity to higher-order mutants supports our previous observations that LSR mutations are largely additive (Extended Data Fig. 2h) and aligns with previous research showing that regularized linear models perform well across mutagenesis datasets of 14 different enzymes32.

To identify key mutations, we examined regression coefficients, revealing strong concordance between computationally and experimentally identified impactful mutations (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). The model coefficients strongly correlated with experimental fold changes (efficiency: ρ = 0.623, two-tailed P = 0.0025; specificity: ρ = 0.930, two-tailed P < 0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), demonstrating that the interpretability of linear models enables the automated identification of impactful mutations.

We outline an approach for applying regression models to predict efficiency and specificity of higher-order mutants (Fig. 2f). From individual mutations measured for specificity and efficiency by ddPCR, we generated ridge regression models, examined their coefficients to quantify the impact of key mutations and predicted activity of higher-order mutants, enabling prioritization of mutants for experimental testing. To demonstrate this approach, we predicted the activities of all double mutants added to superDn29, skipping round 6 to directly test round 7 of iteration. We tested the top 10 efficiency and top three specificity variants, finding that eight of 10 efficiency variants and three of three specificity variants performed better than superDn29 (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 3e−g). Although the three key variants (superDn29, goldDn29 and hifiDn29) that we experimentally identified served as the primary variants for subsequent characterization studies, these model-guided variants demonstrate the potential for further optimization and represent valuable targets for future investigation. Overall, we demonstrate that model-guided recombinase design across multiple activity axes can further push efficiency and specificity beyond spaces easily reachable by traditional directed evolution.

To gain mechanistic insights from our mutational landscape, we generated an AlphaFold3 structural model of Dn29 bound to the attB-R DNA half-site (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 4a)33, which showed high alignment (zinc-ribbon domain RMSD = 1.341, recombinase domain RMSD = 1.707) to the Listeria integrase C-terminal domain bound to attP (PDB: 4KIS)29 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We identified an efficiency mutation hotspot (residues 373−393 and 449) in the coiled-coil motif hinge region, with four of the eight activating mutations converting to proline residues (L388P, Q390P, L393P and L449P), suggesting that destabilization of the helical secondary structure in this region enhances activity, potentially by modifying tetramer stabilization or autoinhibitory control (Extended Data Fig. 4c)34. Despite previous work on a different ortholog that identified mutations in this region as enabling the excision reaction35, our key variants maintained unidirectionality (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Another key efficiency mutation (D503N) reduces negative charge in a tri-aspartic acid stretch (503−505), likely enhancing DNA phosphate backbone interactions (Extended Data Fig. 4e).

Many specificity driver mutations localize near the DNA-binding interface, often replacing neutral amino acids with positively charged ones, potentially strengthening DNA interactions (Extended Data Fig. 4f). This combined computational and structural analysis provides a multifaceted understanding of how specific mutations impact LSR function, informing rational engineering to enhance LSR performance.

We reasoned that the LSR protein and target DNA interaction could be further enhanced by developing LSR−dCas9 fusions that facilitate LSR recruitment to the genomic target site, as demonstrated in other recombinase systems3,4,6,19,22. We first optimized the fusion design, observing that an N-terminal dCas9 fusion abolished Dn29 activity, likely due to steric hindrance of tetramerization as the N terminus is located at the tetrameric complex core29,36. By contrast, C-terminal fusions supported robust recombination and were used for further experiments (Fig. 3a).

We next evaluated the impact of dCas9-mediated genomic recruitment using single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting regions near attH1 or attH3 (Fig. 3b,c). This single-guide approach increased integration efficiency 2.7-fold at attH1 and six-fold at attH3 compared to non-targeting guides (NTGs) (Fig. 3d,e). We further improved efficiency by optimizing the ratio of donor, effector and guide components (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and confirmed the importance of direct tethering of Dn29 to the genomic target site, as linker replacement with a P2A peptide to induce ribosomal skipping abolished the effect37,38 (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Interestingly, we could manipulate the natural integration preference of Dn29 using dCas9 recruitment. Although WT Dn29 naturally integrates into attH1 with two-fold frequency over attH3, dCas9-based recruitment to attH1 amplified this preference to 14-fold. Conversely, attH3-targeting sgRNAs reversed this bias, resulting in 11-fold higher integration at attH3 compared to attH1 (Fig. 3f). Combining dCas9 fusions with our optimized Dn29 variants further improved on-target efficiency. SuperDn29−dCas9 achieved 50.8% integration at attH1, whereas goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9 reached 44.5% and 39.1%, respectively, representing up to an 11.8-fold efficiency increase (Fig. 3g).

Next, we tested if dCas9 fusions enhanced specificity by biasing insertion toward the desired pseudosite. Whole-genome insertion profiling showed that on-target integrations improved from 12% with WT Dn29 to more than 60% with Dn29−dCas9 targeted to attH1, although rare off-target sites persisted. SuperDn29−dCas9 maintained a similar insertion profile but moderately increased rare off-targets due to higher overall activity. Notably, goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9 achieved 91% and 97% genome-wide specificity to attH1, with significantly fewer off-target loci (average 35 and 12 sites, respectively) (Fig. 3h,i and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). For Dn29−dCas9, 20−35% of off-target sites were shared between replicates, decreasing to 6−12% for superDn29−dCas9 and to 0% for goldDn29−dCas9 and hifiDn29−dCas9 (Supplementary Fig. 5a−d and Supplementary Table 3). Off-target site concordance across variants was low, with only 15 sites appearing in more than one sample (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Furthermore, these off-target sites did not overlap with predicted guide RNA off-target sites, indicating that they are not dCas9 mediated (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Taken together, these results suggest that specificity engineering has effectively eliminated reproducible off-target activity, with the low reproducibility potentially reflecting both rare genuine events and technical artifacts previously reported for this off-target detection method39.

We assessed the generalizability of our fusion approach across three additional LSR orthologs (the genome-targeting LSRs Pf80 and Nm60 and the landing pad LSR Si74), demonstrating up to 10-fold improved efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 5c−i). To elucidate optimal sgRNA design parameters, we analyzed integration efficiencies across all fusion variants and orthologs and determined optimal sgRNA placement to be approximately 40 bp from the attachment site core, agnostic of guide orientation (Extended Data Fig. 5j).

We next explored three orthogonal strategies to further improve efficiency—using dCas9 variants with alternative PAM recognition40, multiplexing sgRNAs and incorporating sgRNA binding sites on donor plasmids. dCas9 variants with increased PAM flexibility can expand pseudosite-proximal guide options. Using dCas9−HF1−SpG (NGN PAM), we achieved 22% insertion efficiency at the best NGH guide compared to 15% with the best NGG guide (Extended Data Fig. 5k−m). Multiplexed sgRNAs targeting upstream and downstream of the attachment site could further improve genome search and binding (Fig. 3j). At the attH3 site, the H3-g3 and H3-g7 combination achieved 13% integration versus 6.6% and 5.6% efficiencies individually (Fig. 3k). Finally, we tested the ability of an sgRNA-binding sequence on the donor plasmid to facilitate donor recruitment, across four orientations flanking the minimal attP site (top and bottom strand, upstream and downstream) (Fig. 3l). All four configurations improved integration efficiency for Dn29−dCas9, reaching up to 40% integration compared to 23% with the WT donor (Fig. 3m). Similarly, incorporating the Nm60-g1 sequence on the donor plasmid improved Nm60 attH2 integration from 61% to 73% (Extended Data Fig. 5n).

Our results show that LSR−dCas9 fusions can substantially enhance both efficiency and specificity of cargo DNA insertion by improving LSR recruitment to target and donor DNA. The positive correlation between efficiency and specificity (Extended Data Fig. 5o) suggests that optimizing and multiplexing guide RNAs are crucial for maximizing both parameters simultaneously. This approach, combined with engineered LSR variants and dual-targeting guides, achieves up to 97% specificity or over 73% efficiency at a single genomic locus.

Beyond dCas9 fusions, we explored enhancing donor DNA recruitment by optimizing the attP sequence. We created two Dn29 attP donor plasmid libraries, each with one constant half-site and the other mutated using custom mixed base oligos for an average of approximately 5.5 mutations per 26-bp half-site (Methods). Transfecting these libraries into cells expressing WT Dn29−dCas9 and H1-g3 guide, we sequenced attH1 integrants and calculated nucleotide enrichment scores (Fig. 4a−c). Although the WT nucleotide was generally preferred, we identified six positions where non-WT nucleotides showed moderately higher enrichment. Combining all six substitutions into an optimized e-attP sequence improved integration efficiency by 1.3-fold (Fig. 4d). Applying this strategy to Nm60 with Nm60−dCas9 and Nm60-g2, we identified an e-attP with seven mutations that improved efficiency by 1.1-fold (Fig. 4e,f).

Our library enrichment approach provides a high-resolution view of DNA specificity and recombination efficiency determinants. For both Dn29 and Nm60, native attachment sites appear highly evolutionarily optimized, with only a few positions showing incremental efficiency improvements through mutation.

We identified core-distal regions of outsized importance for functional recombination: positions 16−23 and 16'−23' for Dn29 (Fig. 4C) and 13−23 and 13'−23' for Nm60 (Fig. 4e). These findings are consistent with previous reports on other LSR orthologs that show stronger zinc-ribbon domain binding requirements and more relaxed sequence specificity in the recombinase domain41,42. Dn29's position 17/17' showed particularly high enrichment, strongly preferring A and T, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of depleted nucleotides reveals selection against attB-like sequences, particularly A/T at position 12/12' for Dn29 and A/T at position 14/14' for Nm60, which correspond to critical attB nucleotides (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b)12. This depletion suggests evolutionary pressure to maintain discrimination between attB and attP sites via previously described ‘discriminator bases'41. By analyzing dinucleotide normalized to single-nucleotide abundance, we identified preferential RY dinucleotides at positions 17/18 and YR dinucleotides at positions 22/23, suggesting that DNA flexibility as well as sequence contributes to protein recognition of the attachment site43,44,45,46 (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

Given the numerous DNA-binding domain mutations in our variants, we applied this approach to identify optimal attP substrates for each recombinase. The engineered variants preferred attP sequences with 7−9 mutations relative to WT Dn29 e-attP, predominantly favoring guanine/cytosine bases (Supplementary Fig. 7a−c). This G/C bias likely reflects enhanced lysine−guanine interactions resulting from the numerous specificity-enhancing lysine residues incorporated into the DNA-binding regions during protein engineering47. Although variant-specific e-attPs demonstrated modest improvement over the WT e-attP sequence (Supplementary Fig. 7d), we used the WT e-attP for all subsequent studies to maintain a standardized donor template across all variants.

Although LSR attachment sites are canonically imperfect inverted repeats, the importance of this asymmetry remains unclear42. Our data reveal that the most strongly enriched nucleotides are symmetrical across the core, aligning with previous Bxb1 studies48,49. However, for Dn29 and Nm60, we observed five and eight nucleotides with subtle preferences for asymmetric nucleotides at corresponding half-site positions. This suggests that slight attachment site asymmetry may be a deliberate feature of the recombination mechanism rather than a consequence of mutations or phage genome sequence constraints. Overall, this attachment site exploration deepens our understanding of LSR target site recognition and advances our ability to design optimal DNA donors.

Next, we aimed to create optimal LSR tools for large DNA cargo integration by combining our orthogonal engineering efforts. Armed with directed evolution variants, dCas9 fusions with sgRNA design rules and optimized donor DNA substrates, we assessed combining these features into a single system (Fig. 5a,b). Overall, our combined engineering strategies substantially improved recombination efficiency: the variants fused to dCas9 with the optimized donor achieved 41−53% efficiency, a 9.6-fold to 12.3-fold improvement over the WT enzyme (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 4).

Dots and error bars represent the mean ± s.d. of samples with n ≥ 3 biological replicates. d, Specificity analysis of edited HEK293FT single-cell clones engineered with Dn29 and hifiDn29, with and without dCas9 fusions. Number (n) of clones analyzed per sample is indicated on the x axis.

Using hifiDn29−dCas9, our most specific configuration, we measured 97% genome-wide specificity by bulk integration site sequencing (Fig. 5c). To better understand the single-cell variation of insertional mutagenesis, including on-target/off-target co-occurrence and integration copy number, we mapped integrations in approximately 50 clonal HEK293FT populations edited with hifiDn29 or WT Dn29, with and without dCas9 fusions (Fig. 5d). dCas9 fusion dramatically improved performance for both Dn29 and hifiDn29, resulting in over 95% of clones containing on-target edits. However, the most striking difference was observed in off-target insertions: 91% of Dn29 clones contained off-target insertions compared to 46% of hifiDn29 clones. Ultimately, with dCas9 fused to hifiDn29, off-target insertions were reduced to only 9% of clones compared to 52% for Dn29–dCas9. These single-cell specificity measurements closely mirrored the bulk genome-wide specificity results (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Beyond targeting accuracy, measuring the number of integrations per cell is crucial for fully understanding editing outcomes. Because dCas9 increases efficiency, it also increases the rate of multiple on-target insertions. HifiDn29 showed the highest rate of single on-target insertion events, with half of the clones exhibiting this genotype. By contrast, dCas9 fusions decreased single on-target insertion events to 38% and increased the rate of multiple on-target insertions from 4% to 53% of clones (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Due to the pseudo-triploid genome and copy number variation/instability of HEK293FT cells50, on-target insertions ranged from zero to five per cell, with a median of two for both hifiDn29−dCas9 and Dn29−dCas9 clones (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Overall, these single-cell results demonstrate the enhanced precision and efficiency of hifiDn29−dCas9, nominate hifiDn29 for generating clonal cell lines containing single on-target integrations and highlight the value of single-cell analysis in evaluating gene editing outcome heterogeneity.

Genome editing can pose safety risks through unintended outcomes, including insertion and deletion (indel) formation, cytotoxicity and genomic rearrangements. Because the recombinase mechanism involves coordinated cleavage of all four DNA strands, abortive recombination could potentially lead to double-stranded break (DSB) formation, causing indels at the attachment sites51,52,53. We identified rare but significant indels at attH1 (0.01−1.4%), with indel frequency correlating with recombination efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 6d). This trend parallels observations in small serine recombinase systems, where activating mutations that increase synapse formation also demonstrate higher rates of DSB generation54. As a proxy for genome-wide DSB formation or DNA damage response (DDR) activation, we employed phosphorylated-H2AX (γ-H2AX) staining and flow cytometry. Dn29 and superDn29 showed low but significant γ-H2AX, whereas specificity-enhanced variants (goldDn29 and hifiDn29) reduced damage to background levels (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Notably, these variants also generated less γ-H2AX than Bxb1, previously reported as the highest-fidelity recombinase51 and commonly used in attachment site prime editing approaches such as PASTE and PASSIGE8,10,39. Interestingly, delivering catalytically dead LSR also produced γ-H2AX, suggesting that non-catalytic mechanisms such as DNA binding may damage DNA (Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 5).

Cytotoxicity can arise from multiple mechanisms, including off-target effects, DDR activation, immune activation, protein burden and genomic instability. Cell viability assays revealed no significant toxicity in HEK293FT cells when transfecting LSR variants and donor plasmid (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Measuring genome-wide junctions with attH1 by NGS, we detected genomic rearrangements ranging between 0% and 2% within chromosome 10 and 0−0.3% inter-chromosomal translocations (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). Most junctions occurred within 50 kb of attH1, potentially reflecting a preference for recombining with nearby sequences or resulting from DSB-induced large deletions (Extended Data Fig. 6i). Overall, our comprehensive safety assessment demonstrates that Dn29-mediated editing, particularly with our specificity-enhanced variants, offers a favorable safety profile with minimal cytotoxicity, rare genomic rearrangements and reduced DNA damage compared to existing recombinases, positioning this system as a promising option for precise genomic integration.

Next, we sought to benchmark our engineered LSRs in a diverse set of genome insertion tasks across various cell types. LSRs offer an advantage in genome engineering applications, including robust insertion efficiency in non-dividing cells10. We treated HEK293FT cells with aphidicolin to induce cell cycle arrest and observed that Dn29 and key variants showed largely equivalent integration rates to untreated cells. dCas9 fusions had decreased integration efficiency by 35−50%, but still achieved up to 30% integration (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

We then tested DNA cargo installation in H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and observed that on-target integration efficiency with engineered recombinases increased up to six-fold relative to WT Dn29, from 4.1% to 24.5% (Fig. 6a). These improvements are 25−50% of HEK293FT integration efficiencies, likely due to the 50−80% reduction in plasmid transfection efficiency in stem cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Insertion specificity also significantly improved, as off-target integration at attH3 for the engineered variants approached the ddPCR detection limit (Extended Data Fig. 7c).

Bars and error bars represent the mean ± s.d. of samples with n ≥ 3 biological replicates (each an average of two technical replicates), with each originating from a different blood donor.

To evaluate larger cargo installation and enable functional genomics applications, we designed a 12-kb CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) construct encoding the ZIM3−dCas9 fusion and multiple regulatory elements and marker genes, including blue fluorescent protein (BFP), neomycin resistance marker, Woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE). We achieved robust insertion efficiencies up to 13% and verified transgene expression after selection in both bulk and clonal lines (Fig. 6b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7d). Genotyping of goldDn29−dCas9-edited clones revealed that 95% of clones possessed precise heterozygous attH1 insertions, with only one homozygous clone and one clone showing both on-target and off-target integrations (Fig. 6d). These results underscore the high clonal consistency achieved, demonstrating a predominance of accurate, single-copy integrations and strong maintenance of cargo gene expression in H1 stem cells.

To assess CRISPRi functionality and safety across different genomic loci and editing tools, we compared knockdown efficiency and transcriptome perturbations in H1 hESCs and WTC-11 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We tested cells edited at attH1 using either hifiDn29−dCas9 or Cas9 with homology-directed repair (HDR) and at established safe harbors AAVS1 and CLYBL using Cas9 HDR55,56,57,58. CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of target genes demonstrated similar and robust efficiency across all loci (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that hifiDn29−dCas9 produced the fewest differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to Cas9 editing at all loci in both cell types (Fig. 6f and Extended Data Fig. 8a). The DEGs in hifiDn29−dCas9 samples demonstrated the strongest safety profile, with no disruption of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes or essential genes (Extended Data Fig. 8b−d). Critically, NEBL expression showed no significant change across all edited cell lines, confirming that attH1 integration does not disrupt the endogenous locus (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Transgene silencing is a persistent challenge in stem cell engineering, likely due to extensive chromatin restructuring that occurs during differentiation59. To assess whether attH1 supports stable cargo expression during differentiation, we differentiated the CRISPRi-edited hESCs into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) under neomycin selection. After differentiation, edited HPCs maintained robust cargo expression (approximately 70% BFP+) with approximately 80% of cells expressing canonical HPC markers, such as CD34 and CD43 (Extended Data Fig. 7f−h). Next, we transduced sgRNAs targeting CD63, CD81 and CD147 into the edited HPCs and observed 82−96% knockdown of these cell surface markers compared to a non-targeting control, with knockdown rates similar to AAVS1 and CLYBL sites (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Taken together, we demonstrate that engineered recombinases efficiently produce bulk hESC lines with near-clonal genotypes, minimal transcriptomic perturbation and stable large cargo expression throughout hESC-to-HPC differentiation, making them suitable for generating stable cell lines for CRISPR screens or potentially introducing therapeutic genetic cargoes.

Site-specific transgene insertions show great promise in immune cell engineering, enabling integration of functional cargos such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and additional immune regulators for therapeutic applications. Although primary T cells can be sensitive to high doses of nucleic acid delivery (Extended Data Fig. 9a), we developed multiple effective strategies for LSR-mediated integration. We first explored viral delivery strategies, electroporating T cells with effector mRNA and synthesized sgRNAs and delivering donor templates via single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) or self-complementary AAV (scAAV) (Fig. 6g and Extended Data Fig. 9b−d). LSR−dCas9 fusions achieved up to 17% AAV integration efficiency, which maintained high cell viability even at the highest doses. The scAAV donor yielded 2.3-fold to 3.3-fold higher integration rates compared to the ssAAV donor, likely due to double-stranded DNA requirements for LSR-mediated integration. Sequencing confirmed that more than 98% of integrations were genuine LSR-mediated events rather than non-specific AAV capture (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Because LSR-mediated integration of linear AAV genomes creates DSBs requiring cellular repair mechanisms to rejoin the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) ends, future applications could benefit from circular AAV donor templates to eliminate this repair requirement60.

To expand cargo capacity beyond AAV genomes and circumvent DSB repair requirements, we optimized the electroporation protocol for efficient plasmid integration (up to 14.8%) while balancing reductions in cell viability across variants (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g and Methods). These findings suggest that in more sensitive cell types, the most active recombinases (superDn29) may exhibit increased toxicity, whereas the dCas9-fused recombinases showed minimal toxicity. We integrated a 5.8-kb plasmid expressing a CD19-targeted CAR into primary T cells at up to 11% efficiency, which demonstrated robust cytotoxicity against Nalm6 cells in an in vitro cancer target cell-killing assay (Fig. 6h,i and Extended Data Fig. 9h,i). This delivery format versatility provides flexibility for different applications and manufacturing contexts, strongly supporting further development of this approach for engineering primary T cells for therapeutic applications.

Finally, we investigated the cross-reactivity of our engineered LSRs across model organisms, including mice and various non-human primates. An attH1-like sequence is present in the NEBL intron in marmosets, rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys, with 1−2 point mutations compared to attH1, and is located intergenically in the mouse X chromosome with six point mutations. Dn29 and goldDn29 could robustly recombine attP with the model organism pseudosites in a plasmid recombination assay in HEK293FT cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j−l), enabling future advancement in preclinical animal studies that bridge the gap between laboratory research and human clinical trials.

In this study, we combine directed evolution, protein engineering and machine learning models to engineer DNA recombinases to efficiently and specifically insert large genetic cargos directly into the human genome, overcoming the need to pre-install attachment site landing pads. As a proof of concept, we integrated into a single genomic locus using optimized Dn29 LSRs, achieving 13-fold to 17-fold improvements in insertion efficiency. Combining mutants with dCas9 fusions and optimized donor sequences (e-attP and sgRNA target sites) yielded recombinases with 40−53% efficiency and 90−97% genome-wide specificity for an endogenous locus.

Our engineering efforts provide numerous mechanistic insights into LSR function during genome integration. Notably, our dCas9 fusion experiments demonstrate that improved genome search and DNA binding are crucial areas for increased integration efficiency. To further interrogate DNA binding, we employed structural modeling and attachment site screening to identify specific protein and DNA regions critical for target recognition. Directed evolution revealed a general tradeoff between efficiency-improving and specificity-improving mutations for Dn29, which we overcame by strategically pairing mutations across distinct LSR domains and increasing the protein−DNA interface through fusions with DNA-binding proteins.

Our current system incorporates CRISPR components, which include both protein (dCas9) and RNA (sgRNA) elements. Although this design improves efficiency by seven-fold and specificity by five-fold, it also increases the overall size of the system and introduces an additional RNA component, which increases the manufacturing and formulation complexity. In future iterations, these CRISPR components could be replaced with smaller, protein-only DNA-binding domains, such as zinc fingers22. Such modifications would preserve the delivery advantages of these compact recombinases and maintain a streamlined system of a single protein and single DNA donor.

Further studies of LSR safety should be conducted to advance the translational potential of these tools. Many off-target sites exhibit minimal sequence similarity to the target site, complicating off-target locus prediction. Our most highly active variant (superDn29) also exhibited higher rates of indels or chromosomal rearrangements, and lower T cell viability, than the more balanced goldDn29. LSR−dCas9 fusions also exhibited reduced efficiency in cell-cycle-arrested cells, suggesting the need for further studies to understand potential cell cycle dependence or improve the nuclear delivery of larger fusion constructs. Finally, improved methods for off-target prediction, detection and validation will be needed to assess and overcome these challenges.

During the preparation of this paper, independent efforts to engineer the Bxb1 LSR were reported39,61,62,63. These studies focused on improving Bxb1 targeting of its natural attB site to enhance integration rates into landing pads or retarget Bxb1 to endogenous sites. However, these approaches require pre-installation of the landing pad or concurrent delivery of multiple Bxb1 variants, increasing delivery complexity and increasing the space of potential off-target sites. By contrast, our study presents multiple orthogonal engineering strategies to enhance the ability of an LSR to recognize and integrate at endogenous genomic sequences. We further demonstrate the generalizability of these approaches beyond Dn29 to Nm60, improving on-target genomic insertion efficiency to 73%.

These advancements have use across diverse research and therapeutic applications of LSRs. Current research uses lentiviral engineering of cell lines and single-copy installation of pooled libraries, which can lead to unpredictable effects on gene expression, potential insertional mutagenesis and silencing of transgenes64. Our engineered recombinases overcome these limitations by targeting a defined integration locus at high efficiencies, which are essential for large-scale and uniform functional genomics studies. In hESCs, we demonstrate that 95% of cells have single-copy, on-target insertions, enabling the generation of homogenous bulk cell populations without single-clone selection. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated the use of LSRs for virus-free library screening in landing pad cell lines12. We extend this capability, showing the feasibility of integrating RNA or protein libraries directly into an endogenous human genomic locus. In hESCs, these integrations occur at copy numbers similar to low multiplicity of infection (MOI) lentivirus (MOI = 0.1), well within the standard guidelines for approximating one integrant per cell65.

In the therapeutic space, this approach offers advantages over prevailing CRISPR-based gene therapies, which require a guide RNA to target a distinct disease-causing mutation. By contrast, multi-kilobase insertions enable replacement of entire corrective open reading frames, providing a ‘one-size-fits-all' approach for correcting genetic diseases with mutational heterogeneity across patient populations. Additionally, these corrective transgenes can include critical non-coding regulatory elements for enhanced control of gene expression. Furthermore, Dn29 can cross-reactively integrate into attH1-like sequences in diverse model organisms, an important consideration for future Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies.

The strategies outlined in this work can be adapted to target diverse genomic loci beyond Dn29 attH1. To target a different locus, such as validated genomic safe harbors such as AAVS1 or therapeutic targets such as TRAC, LSRs can be mined from the thousands of naturally occurring orthologs to find a recombinase with a closer match to the desired target sequence. These candidate LSRs can then be subjected to our joint optimization approach, combining directed evolution, machine learning predictions and DNA-binding protein fusions to enhance both efficiency and specificity.

Our research complies with relevant ethical regulations. Experiments using hESC lines were performed under an allowance granted by the Arc Institute Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee.

Experiments were conducted in HEK293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R70007, female), H1 hESCs (WiCell Research Institute, male), WTC-11 iPSCs (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, GM25256, male) and primary human T cells (STEMCELL Technologies, 200-0092) from deidentified healthy donors. HEK293FT cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1× penicillin−streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dissociated using TrypLE Express (Gibco). H1 hESCs and WTC-11 iPSCs were maintained in mTeSR Plus (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cultured on Cultrex (Bio-Techne) or Matrigel (Corning) coated plates. For routine passaging, hESCs and iPSCs were dissociated with ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies). For 96-well plating prior to transfections, single-cell dissociation was performed using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies). hESCs and iPSCs were supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor for 24 hours after dissociation. Primary human T cells were cultured in complete X-VIVO 15 (cXVIVO 15) (Lonza Bioscience, 04-418Q), which consists of 5% FCS (R&D Systems, M19187), 5 ng μl−1 IL-7 and 5 ng μl−1 IL-15. For the cell cycle arrest experiment, HEK293FT cells were treated with 5 μM aphidicolin at the time of transfection. HEK293FT, WTC-11 and H1 cells tested negative for mycoplasma, tested monthly.

An NNK deep mutational scanning library of the entire Dn29 coding sequence (CDS) was generated using NNK oligos and overlap extension PCRs. First, forward and reverse oligos with NNK mixed bases at each codon were designed with a melting temperature of 65 °C. Each NNK forward primer was paired with Dn29 DMS_universal_reverse that binds downstream of the CDS and each NNK reverse primer with DMS_universal_forward primer, generating amplicons flanking the mutated codon. PCR reactions contained 2.5 µl of Q5 Master Mix (New England Biolabs (NEB)), 0.01 µl of Dn29 plasmid template (100 ng µl−1), 0.025 µl of universal primer (100 µM), 1.465 µl of water and 1 µl of unique NNK primer (2.5 µM). Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 30 seconds and 72 °C for 1 minute; final extension of 72 °C for 2 minutes.

Upstream and downstream amplicons (2.5 µl each) were pooled and cleaned with 2 µl of ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.5 µl of DpnI (NEB), incubating at 37 °C for 30 minutes and then at 80 °C for 15 minutes. For the overlap extension PCR, 1 µl of cleaned PCR pool was mixed with 2.5 µl of Q5 2× Master Mix, 0.025 µl of each universal primer (100 µM) and 1.45 µl of water, using the same cycling conditions.

The full mutant pool was created by combining 2.5 µl of each overlap extension PCR. The full-length Dn29 fragment was gel extracted (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit; NEB). The library and pEVO backbone were digested with XbaI and HindIII-HF (NEB). Ligation used 100 ng of total DNA (3:1 molar ratio of library to backbone), 2 µl of T4 ligase (NEB), 4 µl of 10× T4 ligase buffer (NEB) and water to 40 µl. The reaction was split into two 20-µl reactions, ligated for 30 minutes at room temperature, inactivated at 65 °C for 10 minutes and purified (Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit; Zymo Research).

The ligation product was electroporated into XL-1 Blue cells (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions, recovered for 1 hour at 37 °C in 1 ml of SOC medium and plated onto four 245-mm × 245-mm BioAssay dishes. Approximately 1 million colonies were obtained. Plasmids were purified using a NucleoBond Xtra Midi EF Kit (Macherey Nagel) and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 2000 600-cycle P1 Kit (Supplementary Fig. 1c) using the NextSeq 1000/2000 Control Software Suite version 1.7.1.

For library transformation, induction and growth: 4 µl of pEVO plasmid library was electroporated into 50 µl of XL-1 Blue competent cells (Agilent Technologies), recovered in 1 ml of SOC medium (37 °C, 1 hour) and then seeded into 100 ml of LB medium with carbenicillin and L-arabinose (10 µg ml−1 or 0 µg ml−1). Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C. Library coverage (>1 million colonies) was confirmed by plating serial dilutions. Plasmids were extracted using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (0.3 g of wet bacteria pellet per column).

Selection of active variants: 500 ng of plasmid was digested with NdeI (NEB) to eliminate inactive variants. Active variants were amplified using 25 µl of 2× Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 19 µl of water, 2 µl each of SLiDE_recovery_forward and SLiDE_recovery_reverse primers (10 µM) and 2 µl of NdeI-digested material. PCR conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 52 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 55 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The correct size band was gel extracted (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit).

Cloning for next evolution cycle: Amplified active variants and pEVO backbone were digested with XbaI and HindIII-HF (NEB) at 37 °C for 30 minutes and then heat inactivated at 80 °C for 20 minutes. Digested variants were purified using DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research) and backbone with DNA Clean and Concentrator-25 (Zymo Research). Five ligation reactions (20 µl each) were set up using 100 ng of DNA (3:1 ratio of library to backbone) and T4 ligase (NEB). Ligation occurred at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 10 minutes. Pooled reactions were purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit), eluted in 6 µl of water and electroporated into XL-1 Blue cells to start the next evolution cycle.

Shuffling the active variants between rounds of cycling involved a uridine exchange PCR to partially exchange thymidines for uridine, USER Enzyme fragmentation at uridine sites, primerless PCR fragment reassembly and PCR for full-length gene recovery.

Uridine exchange PCR: Fragment size and yield was optimized by modifying dUTP/dTTP ratio, with the optimal ratio being 3/7. PCR mixture: 5 µl of 10× Thermopol Buffer, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 µl each of SLiDE_recovery_forward and SLiDE_recovery_reverse primers (10 µM), 1 µl of plasmid library, 1 µl of Taq Polymerase and 40 µl of water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 seconds; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 20 seconds, 60 °C for 30 seconds, 68 °C for 1 minute per kilobase; final extension at 68 °C for 5 minutes. Full-length gene band was gel extracted (Monarch Gel Extraction Kit).

USER Enzyme digestion: 500-ng aliquots were digested with 2 µl of USER Enzyme (NEB) at 37 °C for 3 hours. Gel electrophoresis confirmed fragment distribution (100−1,000 bp).

Fragment reassembly: Fragments were purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5) and reassembled in a primerless PCR reaction using the following conditions: 25 µl of purified fragments and 25 µl of 2× Q5 High-Fidelity Master Mix (NEB). Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 30−50 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 30 °C for 30 seconds (+1 °C per cycle), 72 °C for 1 minute (+4 seconds per cycle); final extension at 72 °C for 10 minutes. A final PCR was performed to recover only the full-length Dn29 CDS for further rounds of directed evolution. The following conditions were used for full-length gene recovery: PCR mixture: 25 µl of Platinum SuperFi II 2× Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 µl of reassembled fragments, 2 µl each of DMS_universal_forward and DMS_universal_reverse primers (10 µM) and 11 µl of water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 30 seconds; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 55 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes.

The gel-extracted, shuffled and reassembled genes were cloned into the plasmid backbone using XbaI and HindIII digest and T4 ligation as previously described.

Six primer sets (DMS_NGS primers; Supplementary Table 8) were designed to amplify approximately 260-bp segments of the Dn29 CDS with Illumina adapter overhangs. Two rounds of PCR were performed to add P5/P7 adapters and i5/i7 indexes (FLAP2 primers). Amplicons were cleaned with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) between PCR rounds and after the final PCR. Amplicons were pooled in equimolar ratios, quantified using Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 (600-cycle kit). Full overlap between read 1 and read 2 was ensured for higher confidence in mutation calling.

Paired-end reads were merged using BBMerge (version 39.06) and analyzed with a custom Python script. The script converted Phred quality scores to error probabilities using the formula \(P=1{0}^{(Q/-10)}\), where P is the probability of error and Q is the Phred quality score. Reads with a summed error probability greater than 0.5 or containing frameshifts were filtered out. Nucleotide and amino acid mutations at each position were then counted and plotted. Enrichment for each amino acid (AA) between the input and output libraries was calculated using the following formula: ((%AAoutput) / (1 − %AAoutput)) / ((%AAinput) / (1 − %AAinput)). To distinguish library construction-based dropouts from selection-based dropouts in the enrichment heatmaps, any amino acids with zero reads in the output library were assigned a single read.

Variants were cloned into a vector containing a 100-nucleotide (nt) random unique molecular identifier (UMI) barcode with a BHVD repeat pattern. The plasmid library was linearized by Eco105I digestion. Nanopore libraries were prepared using a barcoded nanopore sequencing kit (SQK-NBD114.24) with 1 µg of linearized plasmid library and sequenced on a MinION flow cell (R10.4.1) for 72 hours using MinKnow UI control software version 6.5.15.

Sequencing reads were filtered using nanoq (version 0.9.0) with settings –min_len 4500–max_len 5500–min-qual 10 (that is, minimum q score of 10, a minimum read length equivalent to 90% of the expected read length and a maximum read length equivalent to 110% of the expected read length). The UMI sequence was extracted using Cutadapt (version 1.18) with settings –g ‘GGCGGTCACCATCACCACCACCACGCTACACG;max_error_rate = 0.2…ACTGTAC;max_error_rate = 0.2'–trimmed-only–revcomp–minimum_length 95. All UMI sequences were trimmed to 95 nt using seqkit (version 1.3-r106) with the command seqkit subseq -r 1:95.

Reads were clustered by UMI with mmseqs easy-linclust (version 14.7e284) with setting –min-seq-id 0.5. For each UMI cluster bin with at least 15 reads, a representative cluster sequence was generated by using usearch (version 11) with settings -cluster_fast -id 0.75 -strand both -sizeout -centroids and taking the first representative sequence of the output66. A final consensus sequence was generated by one round of polishing with Medaka (version 1.9.1) with settings -m r1041_e82_260bps_hac_g632. Counts for each unique variant were determined by tallying the total consensus sequences.

Primers (DE_mammalian_forward and DE_mammalian_reverse) were designed to amplify the Dn29 CDS from the active variant PCR library, adding overhangs for Esp3I-compatible Golden Gate cloning. PCR conditions were as follows: 25 µl of 2× Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 19 µl of water, 2 µl of purified active variant library and 2 µl each of primer. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 60 seconds; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 60 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 55 seconds; final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The product was purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5) and quantified by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher).

A mammalian expression vector was designed with the EF1α promoter upstream of an Esp3I Golden Gate landing pad, used as the destination for the protein variant library. The landing pad was followed by a T2A self-cleaving peptide sequence and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) CDS.

Golden Gate reaction mixture: 75 ng of mammalian expression vector, amplified variant library (3:1 molar ratio to vector), 1 µl of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (NEB), 0.5 µl of T4 DNA Ligase (NEB), 0.5 µl of Esp3I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and up to 10 µl of nuclease-free water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 37 °C for 1 minute, 16 °C for 1 minute; 37 °C for 30 minutes; 80 °C for 20 minutes. Five Golden Gate reactions were performed, pooled and purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5). The library was transformed into Mach1 Escherichia coli and plated for overnight growth. Random colonies were picked, grown in 4 ml of TB-Carbenicillin and miniprepped (NucleoSpin Plasmid Transfection Grade Mini Kit; Machery-Nagel).

One day before transfection, 12,000−18,000 HEK293FT cells were plated per well of a 96-well plate, aiming for 60–80% confluency at the time of transfection.

Standard LSR + donor transfection: for transfections containing an LSR effector plasmid and a donor plasmid, each well was transfected with 725 ng of DNA, containing a 5:1 molar ratio of donor plasmid to effector plasmid, using 0.5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per well.

Standard LSR-dCas9 + donor + guide transfection: LSR−dCas9 effector plasmid, donor plasmid and guide plasmid were transfected with 725 ng of total DNA, containing a 5:1:1 molar ratio of donor:effector:guide plasmid with 0.5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well, unless specified otherwise in the figure legends.

Modified transfection conditions: Experiments shown in Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5b were transfected with 375 ng of effector plasmid, 100 ng of sgRNA plasmid and 250 ng of donor plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. Experiments shown in Figs. 3g, 5 and 6 used a consolidated plasmid expressing both the effector and guide RNA. In HEK293FT experiments, this consolidated plasmid was transfected at a 5:1 ratio of donor:effector/guide plasmid with 0.585 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well. For transfections containing two gRNA plasmids (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 5h), each well was transfected with 375 ng of effector plasmid, 75 ng each of gRNA plasmid and 250 ng of donor plasmid.

The cells were incubated and monitored for 3 days for mCherry (donor plasmid) and GFP (effector plasmid) expression. Cells were then harvested for flow cytometry (Attune NxT Flow Cytometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or genomic DNA extraction for downstream analyses.

Three days after transfection, cells were trypsinized with 50 µl of TrypLE (Gibco) for 10 minutes and then quenched with 50 µl of Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences). The 100-µl cell suspension was split into two 50-µl aliquots in U-bottom 96-well plates and centrifuged (300g, 5 minutes), and the supernatant was aspirated. One plate was resuspended in 200 µl of Stain Buffer and analyzed with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer with autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The other plate was resuspended in 50 µl of QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies), vortexed for 15 seconds and thermocycled: 65 °C for 15 minutes, 68 °C for 15 minutes, 98 °C for 10 minutes. DNA was cleaned with 0.9× AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) beads.

To assess integration efficiency and specificity, qPCR/ddPCR primers and probes were designed to span the left integration junction of attH1 and attH3, using a constant primer that binds to the donor plasmid sequence (ddPCR_donor_reverse_1), a genome binding primer near the pseudosite (ddPCR_attH1_forward_1, ddPCR_attH3_forward) and a FAM probe within the amplicon (ddPCR_attH1_probe_1, ddPCR_attH3_probe). For attH1, a second set of primers/probes was designed to target the right junction to verify measurement accuracy (ddPCR_attH1_2 primers/probe). Genomic reference primers and probes located nearby each attachment site were designed to measure pseudosite copy number for efficiency percentage calculations.

ddPCR reaction mix (22 µl total): 11 µl of ddPCR Supermix for Probes (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad), 1.98 µl of each primer (10 µM), 0.55 µl of each probe (10 µM), 1.65 µl of cleaned gDNA, 0.22 µl of SacI-HF (NEB) and water to volume. Each reaction contained primers and probes for the target site (FAM probe) and a nearby reference locus (HEX probe). Reactions were run on a QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) using Bio-Rad QX Manager Software version 2.1.0, and data were analyzed and visualized using Microsoft Excel (version 16.89.1) and GraphPad Prism (version 10.3.0). For off-target detection or low-concentration samples, primers were increased to 20 µM and volume halved, and gDNA volume was increased to 4.95 µl.

qPCR reaction mix (40 µl total): 1 µl of each primer, 0.8 µl of each probe, 20 µl of TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.4 µl of genomic DNA and 12 µl of water. The master mix was split into three 10-µl technical replicates in a 384-well plate and run on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) using LightCycler 480 software version 1.5.1.62. Primer pairs for ddPCR and qPCR are provided in Supplementary Table 8.

A fluorescent reporter assay was used to assess episomal plasmid recombination in HEK293FT cells. One day before transfection, 12,000−18,000 HEK293FT cells were plated per well of a 96-well plate, aiming for 60−80% confluency at the time of transfection. Three plasmids at a 1:1:1 molar ratio were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000: (1) 200 ng of the effector plasmid expressing the Dn29 variants and GFP; (2) 50.5 ng of the donor plasmid containing the attP attachment sequence and mCherry; and (3) 70.6 ng of the acceptor plasmid containing an EF1α promoter and the cognate attB attachment sequence. Upon recombination of the two attachment sequences, the EF1α promoter will drive expression of the mCherry CDS, which is read out by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 4d). To assess the excision reaction, the attP in the donor plasmid is replaced with the left post-recombination attachment site (attB-L:attP-R), called attL, and the attB is replaced with the right post-recombination attachment site (attP-L:attB-R), called attR. To assess attP recombination with model organism pseudosites, the attB sequence is replaced with the pseudosite sequences. Mismatching LSR (Bxb1) controls with each donor and acceptor plasmid is used to correct for the leaky mCherry background expression, defining the flow cytometry gating boundaries. Three days after transfection, the cells were trypsinized with 50 µl of TrypLE (Gibco) for 10 minutes, quenched with 50 µl of Stain Buffer, transferred to U-bottom 96-well plates and centrifuged (300g, 5 minutes), and then the supernatant was aspirated. Plates were resuspended in 200 µl of Stain Buffer and analyzed with an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer with autosampler.

Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) primers were designed using the script from Bi et al.67, selecting primers with melting temperature closest to 65 °C. For each mutation, a forward and reverse primer were generated, each containing the desired mutation at the center. PCR reactions were set up combining forward SDM primer with DMS_universal_reverse primer or reverse SDM primer with DMS_universal_reverse primer. The PCR mixture (12.5 µl total) contained 6.25 µl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 0.5 µl each of primer (10 µM), 1 µl of plasmid template DNA (1 ng µl−1) and water to volume. PCR was run using the standard Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix protocol with annealing temperature at 65 °C. Products were cleaned with 0.5× AMPure XP beads. For Gibson assembly, 1 µl each of cleaned PCR product, 5 µl of Gibson master mix and 3 µl of water were incubated at 50 °C for 15 minutes and then transformed into Mach1 E. coli and plated. For simultaneous cloning of two or more mutations, universal primers were replaced with other mutationsʼ forward and reverse primers. Two mutations required a two-piece Gibson assembly, three mutations required a three-piece assembly and so forth.

A Tn5 tagmentation and PCR amplification-based assay was used to unbiasedly measure the relative efficiency of all integration sites, as described in Durrant et al.12. In brief, extracted genomic DNA is tagmented with Tn5 transposase to randomly add adaptors throughout the genome. Then, two nested PCRs are performed, with primers that bind the donor plasmid and the Tn5 adaptor to amplify the donor−genome junction and add Illumina sequencing adaptors. UMIs on the donor plasmid enable counting of the relative frequencies of integration events at each genomic locus.

HEK293FT cells were transfected as previously described, with a non-matching LSR (Bxb1) plasmid replacing the effector plasmid as a control for donor plasmid dilution. Cells were cultured for 2−3 weeks, passaging and analyzing by flow cytometry every 2−3 days at 80% confluency, until the non-matching LSR control was less than 1% mCherry+, indicating that the plasmid had nearly completely diluted out. Genomic DNA was extracted using a Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research), quantified by Qubit HS dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 µg of gDNA per sample was DpnI digested (NEB) to remove residual donor plasmid.

Tn5 transposase was purified following the Picelli et al.68 protocol. Tn5 adaptors were prepared by annealing top and bottom oligos (100 μM each) at 95 °C for 2 minutes, followed by slow cooling to 25 °C over 1 hour. The transpososome was assembled by combining 85.7 μl of purified Tn5 with 14.3 μl of pre-annealed oligos and incubating at room temperature for 1 hour. Tagmentation reactions contained 150 ng of gDNA, 4 μl of 5× TAPS-DMF, 1.5 μl of transpososome and water to 20 μl total volume. Samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated at 55 °C for 20 minutes. Reactions were placed on ice and purified with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrate Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, eluting in 11 μl of nuclease-free water. Sample quality was confirmed by Bioanalyzer to verify fragmentation of approximately 1.5−2.5 kb.

For round 1 PCR, each reaction contained 12.5 μl of 2× SuperFi II Master Mix, 1.5 μl of TMAC (0.5 M), 0.5 μl of outer nest donor-specific primer (PR_N165, 10 μM), 0.25 μl of outer nest i5 primer (PR_N163, 10 μM), 1.25 μl of DMSO and 9 μl of tagmented DNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 2 minutes; 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 68 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 90 seconds; followed by 72 °C for 5 minutes. Products were purified using 0.9× Agencourt AMPure XP SPRI beads and eluted in 11 μl of water.

For round 2 PCR, each reaction contained 25 μl of 2× SuperFi Master Mix, 3 μl of TMAC (0.5 M), 2.5 μl of DMSO, 2.5 μl of i5 primer (PR_N149, 10 μM), 5 μl of i7 donor-specific primer (PR_N184-PR_N204, 10 μM), 2 μl of water and 10 μl of purified round 1 PCR product. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 2 minutes; 18−20 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 68 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 90 seconds; followed by 72 °C for 5 minutes.

For size selection, approximately 40 μl of round 2 PCR product was loaded on a 2% agarose gel, and the smear between 300 bp and 800 bp was excised. DNA was extracted using the Monarch Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pooled at equimolar ratios. Final library quality and molarity were assessed using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche). Pooled libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 or Illumina MiSeq with 2 × 300-bp paired-end reads, using Nextseq 1000/2000 Control Software Suite version 1.7.1 or MiSeq Control Software version 4.1.0 and Illumina BaseSpace Software version 7.38.0. Raw sequencing data were processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline as described in Durrant et al.12.

To reduce occurrence of index hopping, unique dual i7 and i5 barcodes were used for the attH1 targeted samples in Fig. 3. To directly compare specificity of samples with different numbers of measured integration events, samples were downsampled to the same total UMI count.

Fusion proteins consisting of a catalytically dead Cas9 fused to an LSR and a P2A−GFP were constructed by Gibson assembly into a pUC19-derived plasmid containing the EF1α promoter and a SV40 poly(A) tail. Variable flexible linkers, including (GGS)8, (GGGGS)6 XTEN16, XTEN32-(GGSS)2 and XTEN48-(GGSS)2, were used to link the dCas9 and LSR. Spacers targeting loci proximal to the LSR integration site and non-targeting controls were cloned into an sgRNA-expressing plasmid via oligo ligation and Golden Gate cloning. Spacer selection was based on PAM sequence and pseudosite proximity.

Two plasmid libraries (attP-L and attP-R) were constructed to determine nucleotide preference within the attP, with each 26-bp half-site mutagenized separately. Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)-synthesized oligo pools contained 79% WT base and 7% each of the other bases at each position. Single-stranded oligo pools were subjected to second-strand synthesis. First, an oligo anneal reaction containing 2 µl of Library Oligo (100 µM), 4 µl of Klenow primer (100 µM), 3.4 µl of 10× STE Buffer and 24.6 µl of water was heated at 95 °C for 5 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. Next, a Klenow extension reaction containing 34 µl of annealed libraries, 8 µl of water, 5 µl of 10× NEBuffer2, 2 µl of 10 mM dNTPs (NEB) and 1 µl of DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB, 5,000 U ml−1) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes, purified (DNA Clean and Concentrator-5) and eluted in 20 µl of nuclease-free water.

The purified product was cloned by Esp3I Golden Gate cloning into the donor plasmid backbone: 75 ng of pre-digested backbone, 3:1 molar ratio of attP library to backbone, 0.5 µl each of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) and Esp3I (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 µl of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (NEB) and water to 10 µl were incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour, purified and eluted in 6 µl of nuclease-free water. Then, 1 µl of purified library was electroporated into Endura Electrocompetent Cells (Biosearch Technologies) at 10 μF, 600 Ω, 1,800 V, recovered in 2 ml of Lucigen Recovery Medium (37 °C, 1 hour), plated on 245-mm × 245-mm BioAssay dishes and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Final libraries were scraped, purified (Nucleobond Xtra Maxi EF Kit) and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 2000.

Next, 2.2 × 106 HEK293FT cells were plated on 10-cm dishes 1 day before transfection to achieve 70% confluence at transfection. Then, 24 μg of total plasmid DNA was prepared at a 5:1:1 molar ratio (attP library:LSR effector:sgRNA). DNA and 72 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were separately mixed with 1.5 ml of OMEM, incubated for 5 minutes and then combined and incubated for 10 minutes before adding dropwise to cells. After 3 days, cells were harvested with TrypLE (Gibco), and genomic DNA was extracted using a Quick-DNA Midiprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research).

Integration events were amplified by single-step PCR with i5/i7 index-adding primers using all available genomic DNA. Biological replicates had 1-bp staggered amplicons to increase nucleotide diversity. PCR conditions were as follows: 25 μl of NEBNext High Fidelity PCR Master Mix, 2.5 μg of genomic DNA, 1.25 μl each of the attL or attR i5 or i7 primers (Supplementary Table 8) and water to 50 μl. Cycling conditions were as follows: 25 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 63 °C for 10 seconds, 72 °C for 25 seconds. PCR products were pooled and run on 2% agarose gel, and correct size bands were extracted (Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit). Libraries were quantified (Qubit 1× dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay; Thermo Fisher Scientific), pooled equimolar with 35% PhiX spike-in and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 (150-bp paired-end reads).

Libraries were demultiplexed using Illumina BaseSpace automatic demultiplexing workflow. Paired-end reads were merged using BBMerge (version 39.06) and analyzed with a custom Python script. Reads were filtered for exact amplicon length and QScore ≥ 30. Next, percent abundance of each nucleotide at each attP position was calculated for input and output libraries. Enrichment scores were computed using the following equation: \(r=\frac{{A}/1-A}{B/1-B}\), where A and B represent the read counts for selected nucleotides in output and input libraries, respectively, normalized to the total number of reads. Enrichment scores were converted to sequence logos, generated using Logomaker69 and matplotlib packages.

Unique library members recovered as integration events were assessed by generating the set of unique reads. The number of unique integration events from NGS analysis was compared to ddPCR analysis of bulk genomic DNA for validation.

Dinucleotide enrichment analysis was performed by first counting individual nucleotide frequencies at each position across all reads, followed by counting all possible dinucleotide combinations using a 2-bp sliding window at consecutive position pairs. Raw counts were normalized to total reads to calculate probabilities for both single nucleotides and dinucleotides at each position. To assess deviation from independence, observed dinucleotide probabilities were divided by the product of their constituent single-nucleotide probabilities: P(dinucleotide) / (P(nucleotide1) × P(nucleotide2)).

Enrichment scores were calculated by comparing output to input library frequencies using \(r=\frac{{A}/1-A}{B/1-B}\), where A represents output library frequency and B represents input library frequency for each dinucleotide. Final values were log2 transformed and averaged across dinucleotide categories based on purine (R: A,G) and pyrimidine (Y: C,T) classification: RR (purine−purine), YY (pyrimidine−pyrimidine), RY (purine−pyrimidine) and YR (pyrimidine−purine).

H1 hESCs and WTC-11 iPSCs were cultured in mTeSR Plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies) on Cultrex-coated (Bio-Techne) or Matrigel-coated (Corning) six-well plates. Cells were routinely subcultured at a 1:12 ratio using ReLeSR Passaging Reagent (STEMCELL Technologies) every 4 days or at 70−80% confluency. Three days after splitting (60% confluency), the cells were dissociated for 10 minutes with Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies) and plated in Cultrex-coated 96-well plates at 25,000−30,000 cells per well with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor. The next day (at 70% confluency), media were changed to include 50 µM ROCK inhibitor 2 hours before transfection. Then, 3 µg of plasmid DNA containing a 1:1 molar ratio of combined effector/guide plasmid to donor plasmid in 10-µl volume was diluted in 81 µl of mTeSR Plus and thoroughly pipette mixed. Next, 9 µl of FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) was added to the DNA/mTeSR mix, thoroughly mixed and incubated for 12 minutes. After another thorough pipette mix, 7 µl of the DNA was added dropwise to each well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, splitting 1:2 if 90% confluency was reached. After 3 days, the cells were dissociated with Accutase and split into two V-bottom plates, one for flow cytometry and one for gDNA harvest with QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies).

hESCs were differentiated into HPCs using the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). On day 10 of differentiation, 250 µl of non-adherent cells were collected from the supernatant using wide-bore P1000 tips and transferred to a V-bottom 96-well plate. Next, the cells were pelleted at 400g for 5 minutes, supernatant discarded and resuspended in 95 ml of Stain Buffer containing 1 µl of each antibody with a wide-bore pipette. The following antibodies were used: APC CD81 (BD Biosciences, 551112), APC CD147 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A15706), Alexa Fluor 647 CD63 (BD Biosciences, 561983), APC/Cyanine7 CD34 (BioLegend, 343514) and PE CD43 (BioLegend, 343204). The cells were incubated in the dark for 20 minutes to 1 hour, washed once with Stain Buffer and flowed on the Attune Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Attune Cytometric Software version 5.3.0 for collection.

hESCs were diluted to one cell per 100 µl in mTeSR Plus medium supplemented with 1× CloneR (STEMCELL Technologies) and plated into two 96-well plates per sample. Cells were maintained until colonies were visible, and then wells with multiple colonies were removed. Single colonies were expanded to 24-well dishes when they covered half the surface area of the 96-well plate. At the next split, one quarter of each well was pelleted for gDNA extraction using QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies). The extracted gDNA was cleaned with 0.9× AMPure XP beads and genotyped by ddPCR. Primers and probes were designed to target the attH1 junction (ddPCR_attH1_1 set), the donor sequence (Amp_forward, Amp_reverse, Amp_probe) and a nearby genomic reference sequence. On-target zygosity was determined by the attH1/reference ratio, and total zygosity was measured by the donor/reference ratio.

Stem cells were transfected as previously described. Two days after transfection, cells were selected using Geneticin (Gibco) at 100 μg ml−1 and penicillin−streptomycin (Gibco) at 100 U ml−1. Cells were maintained in culture for 3 weeks until selection was complete and sufficient cell expansion was achieved for downstream applications, including cryopreservation and RNA extraction. Throughout the culture period, cell quality was monitored daily via microscopy to assess morphology and identify spontaneous differentiation events. Culture medium consisting of mTeSR Plus supplemented with penicillin−streptomycin and Geneticin was replaced daily. Upon reaching 70−80% confluency, cells were clump passaged using ReLeSR according to the manufacturer's instructions.

If spontaneous differentiation was observed, cells were subjected to a straining protocol to remove differentiated cells and maintain pluripotent populations. In brief, media were aspirated, and four drops of ReLeSR were added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were gently dislodged by pipetting or tapping the side of the culture dish to release cell clumps. The cell suspension was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer placed on a 50-ml Falcon tube and rinsed with 6 ml of PBS. The strainer was then inverted onto a fresh Falcon tube, and clumps were collected with 3 ml of culture medium before replating into six-well plates.

For RNA-seq, cells from one well of a six-well plate were harvested by adding 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. The lysate was mixed by pipetting until a homogeneous viscosity was achieved and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction.

For RNA extraction, 200 μl of chloroform was added, followed by vigorous shaking for 15 seconds and incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 minutes at 4 °C, resulting in phase separation. The upper aqueous phase containing RNA was carefully transferred to a fresh tube, and 0.5 ml of isopropanol was added and mixed. After a 5−10-minute incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to precipitate RNA. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, mixed and centrifuged at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was air dried for 5−10 minutes before resuspension. The extracted RNA was analyzed on a High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies) to measure the RNA integrity number (RIN) score, which was higher than 9 for all samples.

mRNA enrichment was performed using the Roche/KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After mRNA enrichment, sequencing libraries were prepared using the HyperPrep Library Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Final libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X at a depth of at least 20 million reads per sample.

Raw paired-end FASTQ files for each stem cell sample were first subjected to adapter and quality trimming using Trim Galore (version 0.6.7)70 with default settings, retaining reads ≥20 nt. Quality of raw and trimmed reads was assessed with FastQC (version 0.11.9)71 and aggregated using MultiQC (version 1.15)72. Trimmed reads were aligned to the GRCh38.p13 reference genome (GENCODE version 46 primary assembly, FASTA and GTF obtained from GENCODE) using STAR (version 2.7.10a)73 in two-pass mode. Alignment metrics and insert size distributions were evaluated with Picard (version 2.27.4)74, RSeQC (version 4.0.0)75, Qualimap (version 2.2.2)76, dupRadar (version 3.21)77 and Qualimap RNA-seq modules, with reports again aggregated by MultiQC. Concurrently, Salmon (version 1.10.0)78 was used to quantify transcript abundances (–validateMappings), and transcript-to-gene summarization was performed to produce gene-level count and transcripts per million (TPM) matrices. All steps were orchestrated via the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (version 3.12.0)79 under Nextflow (version 24.10.0)80 with the Docker (version 28) profile, specifying –strandedness reverse81.

Gene-level count matrices (salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv) were imported into R (version 4.3.1)82, and DESeq2 (version 1.38.1)83 was used for normalization and differential expression. A sample metadata table containing sample_id, condition and group_id was preprocessed so that identifiers matched the column names of the count matrix. For each stem cell line (group_id), the wild-type (‘WT') condition was identified, and pairwise comparisons were performed between each edited condition and the corresponding wild-type condition. Differential expression was modeled in DESeq2 with the formula ‘~ condition' (R formula syntax), meaning that gene counts were fit as a function of the experimental condition (edited or wild-type). Wald tests were used to estimate log2 fold changes, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing by the Benjamini–Hochberg (false discovery rate (FDR)) method. DEGs were defined as those with adjusted P < 0.05 and |log2 fold change | > 1.

HEK293FT cells were transfected as previously described. Eight days after transfection, cells were placed under puromycin selection (0.5 μg ml−1) for 10 days. On day 18, cells were trypsinized and strained through a 35-µm filter, and single mCherry+ cells were sorted into four 96-well plates per sample using a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences). Single-cell colonies were expanded for 2 weeks until more than 50% confluent, with visual inspection to ensure single colony growth. Wells with zero or multiple colonies were excluded from analysis.

Confluent colonies were harvested with QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies) and amplified in two separate PCRs: PCR 1 using primers UMI_reverse and ddPCR_attH1_forward_1, flanking the UMI and attH1 donor/genome junction, and PCR 2 using primers UMI_reverse and UMI_forward, flanking the UMI on the donor plasmid. Amplicons were sequenced via Sanger and/or NGS to determine on-target UMI count (PCR 1) and total UMI count (PCR 2), allowing calculation of on-target and off-target insertion counts per colony.

HEK293FT cells were transfected with LSR and donor plasmids at a 1:5 ratio, as described above. After 3 days, cells were passaged into a 24-well dish for expansion. On day 5 after transfection, genomic DNA was harvested using the Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers with 0−5 stagger base pairs were designed to amplify the attH1 site. Each PCR reaction contained 1 μg of gDNA, 40 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 3.2 μl of forward primer (PR_N284−PR_N289, 10 μM), 3.2 μl of reverse primer (PR_N290−PR_N295, 10 μM) and water to 80 μl total volume. After 25 cycles under standard conditions, products were purified with 0.8× AMPure XP beads. A second PCR amplification added Illumina indexes using 1 μl of purified product, 12.5 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 1 μl each of uniquely indexed FLAP2 primers and 9.5 μl of water. After seven cycles, libraries were purified with 0.7× AMPure XP beads, quantified via Qubit, pooled and sequenced using Illumina chemistry.

Indel rates were calculated using Crispresso2 with the following command: CRISPResso -a CATTGGTGAATGTCTCATGTGGGTTTGAAAAGAGTGTGTATTCTGCTGTTGTTGGGTAAAGTAGTCTATACATGTCAATGATATGCTGTTGATTGATGCTGGTGTTGAATTCAACTATGTCCTTGCTGATTTTCTGCCTGCTGGATCTGTCTGAC -g GTCTATACATGTCAATGATA -r1 Read_1.fastq.gz -r2 Read_2.fastq.gz–keep_intermediate -w 20 -q 30–min_bp_quality_or_N 30–exclude_bp_from_left 10–exclude_bp_from_right 10–plot_window_size 20–ignore_substitutions. The Modified% output value represented the percentage of unintegrated cells containing indels. Background indel rates from untransfected cells were subtracted from each sample. The final percentage of cells with indels was calculated by multiplying the Modified% by the percentage of uninserted cells (1 minus the average insertion percentage determined by ddPCR).

HEK293FT cells were plated in black-walled, clear-bottom optical plates, excluding edge wells and transfected with LSR and donor plasmids at a 1:5 ratio with four replicates per sample. Two days after transfection, cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Assay (Promega). Cells were first refreshed with 100 μl of fresh D-10 medium and then treated with 100 μl of combined room temperature CellTiter-Glo Buffer and Substrate. Plates were orbitally shaken at 510 r.p.m. for 2 minutes on a Tecan Spark Microplate Reader and incubated for an additional 8 minutes, and then luminescence was measured with 1,000-ms integration time. Background luminescence from empty wells was subtracted from all measurements. Final viability values were normalized to control cells transfected with donor plasmid and pUC19 stuffer plasmid in place of the LSR effector plasmid.

HEK293FT cells were plated into 96-well plates and transfected as described above. Two days after transfection, cells were dissociated with TrypLE and transferred to a V-bottom plate. Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and washed with 200 μl of DPBS. Next, cells were centrifuged again and resuspended in 50 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in DPBS) for fixation. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times and stored in PBS overnight. To permeabilize cells, samples were resuspended in 0.25% Triton-X (diluted in DPBS) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Next, cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated in blocking buffer composed of the following: 10% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, G6767), 0.5% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, I3021) and 5% w/v saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, 84510) diluted in DPBS. Samples were incubated in blocking buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, samples were centrifuged and resuspended in a 1:1,000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-phospho histone H2A.X (Ser139) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. 05-636-AF647, clone JBW301, lot 4214083) diluted in blocking buffer. Samples were incubated for 2 hours, washed twice with DPBS and analyzed on the Attune flow cytometer.

HEK293FT cells were transfected with LSR and donor plasmids at a 1:5 ratio. After 3 days, cells were passaged into a 24-well dish for expansion. On day 5 after transfection, genomic DNA was harvested using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit. Tn5 tagmentation was performed as described above, with two reactions performed per sample.

For enrichment of translocation junctions, tagmented DNA underwent a two-step nested PCR. The first PCR combined 10.5 μl of tagmented DNA with 12.5 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 1 μl of outer nest primer (PR_N296 for upstream or PR_N297 for downstream of attH1) and 1 μl of PR_N163 (Tn5 adaptor binding). Reactions were amplified for 12 cycles (standard three-step protocol, 60 °C annealing, 1-minute extension), purified with 0.9× AMPure XP beads and eluted in 11 μl of water. The second nested PCR added indexes and Illumina adaptors using 10 μl of the first PCR product, 25 μl of Platinum SuperFi II Master Mix, 2.5 μl of inner primer (PR_N298−PR_N327 for upstream samples or PR_N328−PR_N356 for downstream samples), 2.5 μl of PR_N149 and 10 μl of water. After 20 cycles, products were purified with 0.9× AMpure XP beads, quantified by Qubit and pooled equimolarly. Amplicons between 300 bp and 900 bp were selected by gel extraction, quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit and sequenced with Illumina chemistry for 600 cycles.

Genomic rearrangements and translocations were identified using a custom pipeline. After merging paired-end reads, the sequence between the inner primer and the attH1 dinucleotide core (‘upstream sequence') was searched for, allowing up to three mismatches to account for sequencing errors. Reads containing the upstream sequence were processed to extract downstream portions (minimum 20-bp length), which were then aligned to both WT and donor insertion references using BWA-MEM (-a -M -k 8 -T 20)79. Reads were classified based on alignment quality (≥80% alignment and mapping quality (MAPQ) ≥ 20) into WT aligned, donor insertion aligned or potential translocations.

Potential translocation reads underwent further analysis by BWA alignment to the human reference genome (hg38). The resulting alignments were converted to sorted BAM files using SAMtools (version 1.22) for visualization and BED files using BEDTools (version 2.31.0) for genome browser compatibility.

Translocation events were classified into four categories: (1) close to target (within 2 kb of on-target site, reclassified as WT aligned); (2) EF1α promoter aligned (mapping to chr6 region 73,519,610−73,522,070, reclassified as donor insertion aligned); (3) non-chr10 translocations; and (4) chr10 rearrangements.

To quantify the presence of ITRs at the attH1/donor junction of AAV integrations, the same protocol was used, using the upstream bait primers. All reads containing the upstream sequence were aligned to WT and donor insertion references using BWA (version 0.7.19). All reads that did not align to these references were then aligned to the human genome. Finally, all reads that did not align to the human genome were aligned to AAV ITR sequences using Geneious Prime (version 11.0.20.1+1).

sgRNA spacers targeting cell surface markers CD81, CD147 and CD63 were cloned into the LentiGuide-Puro construct (Addgene, 52963). Lentivirus was generated using the LV-MAX Lentiviral Production Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and concentrated 100× with Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara). HPCs were diluted to 50,000 cells per well in 100 µl of Medium B (STEMCELL Technologies, STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit) in a 96-well plate. Each well received 1 µl of LentiBOOST (SIRION Biotech) and 1 µl of lentivirus. Media were changed the next day. Four days after transduction, a subset of cells was stained for cell surface markers. Remaining cells were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin for 4 days to select for transduced cells, followed by cell surface marker staining. Antibodies used for cell surface staining were as follows: APC CD81 (BD Biosciences, cat. 551112, lot 2061009, clone JS-81, 1:100 dilution); APC CD147 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. A15706, lot 540242, clone 8D12, 1:100 dilution); Alexa Fluor 647 CD63 (BD Biosciences, cat. 561983, lot 2112938, clone H5C6, 1:100 dilution); APC CD63 (BioLegend, cat. 353008, lot B373947, clone H5C6, 1:100 dilution); APC/Cyanine7 CD34 (BioLegend, cat. 343514, lot B413134, clone 581, 1:100 dilution); and PE CD43 (BioLegend, cat. 343204, lot B359578, clone CD43-10G7, 1:100 dilution). All antibodies chosen are validated for flow cytometric analysis of human cells according to the manufacturer's website.

The full-length WT Dn29 protein sequence and minimal attB-L or attB-R sequence (attB-L: GTAGACAAGGAAGGTAATGA; attB-R: GAAATAAGTTTGATAGATAT) were input into the AlphaFold3 web server with the seed set to ‘auto'. Five models were generated for each query of Dn29 bound to an attB half-site. Outputs were manually inspected in pymol (version 3.0.2) to ensure correct orientation of Dn29 bound to the half-site, with the dinucleotide core of the DNA proximal to the NTD. One model (Dn29 × attB-R) out of the 10 generated models met this criterion and was selected for further analysis. The chosen model was compared to the Listeria integrase crystal structure of the LSR CTD and attP complex (PDB: 4KIS). Despite 4KIS being bound to attP instead of attB, domain-wise comparisons showed strong alignment: RMSDs were 1.341 and 1.707 for the zinc-ribbon domain and the recombinase domain, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Protein/DNA interface residues were identified with the InterfaceResidues pymol script using default settings.

The efficiency and specificity data of all Dn29 variants were split into a training and test set based on what round of experimentation they were generated in. The training set, called round 1, contained all variants from the two single-mutation validation experiments, where mutations were tested individually on top of variant 127 (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2c−e) or variant 381 (Extended Data Fig. 2f). The testing set contained all higher-order combinations from the iterative rounds of driver mutation stacking (rounds 2−5). The efficiency (percent of integrations at attH1) was normalized to WT, and specificity (ratio of attH1/attH3 activity) was log transformed. The full amino acid sequences of the protein variants were one-hot encoded, a technique that transforms each amino acid in the sequence into a binary vector of length 21 (corresponding to the 20 standard amino acids plus a stop codon), where the position corresponding to that amino acid is set to 1 and all others are 0—this encoding is then flattened into a single vector representing the entire sequence. Activity in the training set was modeled using linear regression, ridge regression, XGBoost and CatBoost with the scikit-learn (version 1.0.2), xgboost (version 1.6.2) and catboost (version 1.2.5) Python libraries. Additional Python packages used include pandas (version 1.3.5), numpy (version 1.19.5), matplotlib (version 3.5.2), seaborn (version 1.73) and scipy (version 1.7.3).

For the ridge regression, optimal α was identified through minimization of the testing set R2 (α = 0.8 for efficiency model, α = 1.3 for specificity model). Hyperparameter optimizations were conducted for XGBoost and CatBoost by performing a randomized search, evaluating on negative mean squared error, using the following parameters: XGBoost: ‘n_estimators': [100, 500, 1,000], ‘learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1], ‘max_depth': [3, 5, 7], ‘subsample': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0], ‘colsample_bytree': [0.7, 0.8, 1.0]; CatBoost: ‘iterations': [100, 200, 500, 1,000], ‘learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2], ‘depth': [4, 6, 8, 10], ‘l2_leaf_reg': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], ‘bagging_temperature': [0, 1, 2, 3], ‘random_strength': [1, 1.5, 2, 3], ‘border_count': [32, 64, 128], ‘grow_policy': [‘SymmetricTree', ‘Depthwise', ‘Lossguide'].

The following parameters were chosen for each model: XGBoost, specificity: ‘subsample' = 0.5, ‘n_estimators' = 1,000, ‘max_depth' = 7, ‘learning_rate' = 0.1, ‘colsample_bytree' = 0.8; XGBoost, efficiency: ‘subsample' = 0.7, ‘n_estimators' = 100, ‘max_depth' = 7, ‘learning_rate' = 0.05, ‘colsample_bytree' = 0.7; CatBoost, specificity: ‘random_strength' = 1.5, ‘learning_rate' = 0.1, ‘l2_leaf_reg' = 1, ‘iterations' = 1,000, ‘grow_policy' = ‘Depthwise', ‘depth' = 4, ‘border_count' = 128, ‘bagging_temperature' = 1; CatBoost; efficiency: ‘random_strength' = 1.5, ‘learning_rate' = 0.1, ‘l2_leaf_reg' = 7, ‘iterations' = 500, ‘grow_policy' = ‘Lossguide', ‘depth' = 4, ‘border_count' = 32, ‘bagging_temperature = 2.

Effector constructs were cloned into an in vitro transcription (IVT) plasmid as previously described84. This plasmid contained a mutated T7 promoter, 5' untranslated region (UTR), P2A EGFP and 3' UTR followed by a 145-bp poly(A) sequence. IVT templates were generated by PCR using primers oGX006 and oLGR009, which incorporate a poly(A) tail and correct the T7 promoter mutation. PCR reactions were performed using KAPA HiFi HotStart 2× (Roche) Master Mix with 6.25 ng of plasmid template per 25-µl reaction. The PCR protocol involved annealing at 63 °C, extending for 45 seconds per kilobase and running for 18 cycles. The reactions were purified using 0.8× volume of SPRI beads and eluted into water. The purified PCRs were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop to ensure correct size and determine concentration.

The IVT reactions were set up using the HiScribe T7 High-Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, E2040S), modified with full pseudo-UTP substitution using N1-Methyl-Pseudo-U (TriLink Biotechnologies, N-1081) and co-transcriptionally capped with CleanCap AG (TriLink Biotechnologies, N-7113). Each IVT reaction contained 5 mM ATP, CTP, GTP and pseudo-UTP, 4 mM CleanCAP AG, 1× Transcription Buffer, 3.75 ng µl−1 DNA template, 1 U µl−1 Murine RNAse Inhibitor (NEB, M0314L), 0.002 U µl−1 yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (NEB, M2403L) and 5 U µl−1 T7 RNA polymerase. Reactions were incubated for 2.5 hours at 37 °C.

Next, the mRNA was purified using lithium chloride. To each reaction, 1.5× water and 1.25 × 7.5 M LiCl were added. The solution was chilled at −20 °C for 30 minutes and then spun at maximum speed (16,000g) for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rinsed with 70% ice-cold ethanol to remove residual salts. After another maximum speed spin for 10 minutes at 4 °C, the mRNA was resuspended in water and stored at −80 °C. The mRNA was analyzed on an Agilent TapeStation and by Qubit RNA High Sensitivity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to ensure correct size and determine concentration.

Two days before electroporation, T cells were seeded at 1 × 106 fresh cells per milliliter and activated with a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 40203D). On the day of electroporation, the beads were magnetically removed, and the T cells were electroporated with 2 µg of LSR−dCas9−P2A−EGFP mRNA and 2 µg of sgRNA (Synthego) for LSR−dCas9 samples or 1 µg of LSR−P2A−EGFP mRNA for LSR samples using the Lonza P3 Primary Cell Kit. Each electroporation contained between 0.5 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells in 20 µl total volume and was electroporated using the 4D Nucleofector system and the DS-137 pulse code. Immediately after electroporation, 80 µl of pre-warmed culture media was added to the Nucleocuvette strip, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 15−30 minutes. Next, 2 × 105 cells per condition were split into 96-well U-bottom plates in 100 µl of serum-free medium (TheraPEAK X-VIVO-15 Serum-free Hematopoietic Cell Medium, BEBP04-744Q) supplemented with 5 ng μl−1 IL-7 and 5 ng μl−1 IL-15. Cells were then transduced at an MOI of 1 × 105 genome copies per cell with ssAAV or scAAV vectors of serotype 6 (AAV6) containing the e-attP sequence, attH1 sgRNA target sequence and an mCherry expression cassette, which were ordered from VectorBuilder. The next morning, cells were spun down at 300g for 5 minutes; the serum-free medium was removed; and cells were resuspended in 200 µl of fresh cX-VIVO. Cells were maintained and passaged as needed by the addition of cX-VIVO every 2−3 days.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human blood donors were collected under an approved institutional review board protocol by the Stanford Blood Center and used to isolate human T cells. In brief, leukoreduction chambers from processing of platelet donations were used to isolate PBMCs using density centrifugation with Ficoll (Lymphoprep; STEMCELL Technologies) within SepMate tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. Next, primary human CD3+ T cells were isolated by negative selection using a Human CD3 T Cell Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. Isolated primary human CD3 T cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and activated using anti-human CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Cell Therapy Systems; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 1:1 ratio in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 5% FBS (MilliporeSigma) and 50 IU ml−1 human IL-2 (PeproTech). T cells were activated at a 1:1 ratio of cells to Dynabeads and initially cultured in standard tissue culture incubators at approximately 1 × 106 cells per milliliter of medium. After gene editing/electroporations, T cells were counted and reseeded at approximately 1 × 106 cells per milliliter, with additional IL-2 and X-VIVO 15 complete media added every 2–3 days to maintain a culture density of approximately 1 × 106 cells per milliliter.

Forty-eight hours after activation, Dynabeads were magnetically removed from activated T cell cultures by incubating for 2 minutes at room temperature on a magnet (EasySep Magnet; STEMCELL Technologies), and cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For electroporations, 1−2 million T cells per editing condition were gently pelleted by centrifugation at 90g for 10 minutes, followed by careful aspiration of the supernatant. T cell pellets were resuspended in 20 μl per editing condition in P3 buffer (Lonza) and then mixed with prepared LSR mRNA and DNA templates. Then, 1.5 µg of LSR mRNA, 2 µg of donor plasmid, 1.5 µg of sgRNA plasmid and 20 µl of T cell suspension were mixed and aliquoted into a 96-well Nucleocuvette plate (Lonza). All plasmids were purified using the ZymoPure II Plasmid Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research). The 5.8-kb CD19 CAR-expressing plasmid contains the EF1α promoter, tNGFR EC domain (cell surface reporter), T2A, 1928z CAR and bGH poly(A). Total nucleic acid volume was limited to 5 µl. Electroporation occurred on a Gen2 Lonza 4D instrument with a 96-well plate attachment using pulse code EO-151. Immediately after electroporation, 80 μl of pre-warmed X-VIVO 15 media was added to each cuvette, and cells were rested within the cuvettes for 15 minutes in a standard 37 °C tissue culture incubator. The cells were then gently resuspended and transferred to standard 96-well round-bottom plates with 300 µl of total X-VIVO 15 complete medium with 50 IU ml−1 human IL-2. T cells were maintained at 0.5 × 106 to 1 × 106 cells per milliliter, and X-VIVO 15 complete medium with 50 IU ml−1 human IL-2 was refreshed every 2−3 days.

Three days after electroporation, 50 µl of T cells was collected for staining and flow cytometry. In brief, cells were centrifuged, washed once with 200 μl of cell staining buffer and stained with Ghost Dye Red 780 at a 1:1,000 dilution (Tonbo, 13-0865-T500) for 20 minutes in the dark at 4 °C. The cells were measured using an Attune NxT Cytometer with a 96-well autosampler (Invitrogen) and analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.10.0) for viability, mCherry fluorescence (expressed on the AAV) and GFP fluorescence (effector expression). The remaining 150 µl of T cells in culture was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes, and the gDNA was harvested using QuickExtract DNA Solution (Biosearch Technologies) and analyzed by ddPCR as described above.

At 13 days after non-viral gene editing, T cell editing was assessed by flow cytometry, and cells edited with goldDn29, goldDn29−dCas9 and Dn29−dCas9 were selected for the killing assay. T cells were mixed at indicated effector:target (E:T) ratios with target Nalm6 leukemia cells in 96-well plates, with four different Nalm6 conditions (16,000, 8,000, 4,000 or 2,000 cells per well) and 4,000 T cells per well. Cell killing was assessed by flow cytometry at 48 hours, and the percentage of Nalm6 tumor cell killing was calculated by taking 1 − (no. of Nalm6 cells alive in experimental condition / no. of Nalm6 cells alive in no-T-cell conditions). Effector cells were stained with human NGFR-APC (clone ME20.4, BioLegend, 345108), and target cells were stained with human CD19-PE (clone HIB19, BioLegend, 982402), for flow cytometric analysis.

Artificial intelligence language models (ChatGPT and Claude) were used for generating custom Python scripts for data analysis and visualization, assistance with copyediting and infilling preliminary drafts of some sections based on an author-provided outline. All content generated by artificial intelligence was thoroughly reviewed, edited and verified by the authors.

In a major step toward improving cancer treatment, researchers at Northwestern University have redesigned the molecular structure of a widely used chemotherapy drug, making it far more soluble, potent, and less toxic to the body.

The scientists built a new form of the drug using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), a type of nanostructure that embeds the drug directly into DNA strands coating tiny spheres. This re-engineering turned a weak, poorly dissolving chemotherapy drug into a highly targeted cancer-fighting agent that spares healthy tissue.

A Dramatic Boost Against Leukemia

The new therapy was tested in animals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a fast-growing and hard-to-treat blood cancer. Compared with the standard chemotherapy version, the SNA-based drug entered leukemia cells 12.5 times more efficiently, destroyed them up to 20,000 times more effectively, and slowed cancer progression 59-fold -- all without detectable side effects.

This success highlights the growing promise of structural nanomedicine, a field that precisely controls the composition and architecture of nanomedicines to improve how they interact with the human body. With seven SNA-based treatments already in clinical testing, researchers believe this approach could pave the way for new vaccines and therapies for cancers, infections, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.

The findings were published on Oct. 29 in ACS Nano.

"Stopping Tumors in Their Tracks"

"In animal models, we demonstrated that we can stop tumors in their tracks," said Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin, who led the research. "If this translates to human patients, it's a really exciting advance. It would mean more effective chemotherapy, better response rates, and fewer side effects. That's always the goal with any sort of cancer treatment."

Mirkin is a leading figure in chemistry and nanomedicine, serving as the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Medicine at Northwestern. He also directs the International Institute for Nanotechnology and is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Rethinking a Classic Chemotherapy Drug

For this study, Mirkin's team revisited 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), a long-standing chemotherapy drug known for its limited efficiency and harsh side effects. Because it affects healthy cells as well as cancerous ones, 5-Fu can cause nausea, fatigue, and in rare cases, heart complications.

Mirkin explained that the issue lies not in the drug itself but in its poor solubility. Less than 1% dissolves in many biological fluids, meaning most of it never reaches its intended targets. When a drug cannot dissolve well, it clumps together or remains solid, preventing the body from absorbing it effectively.

"We all know that chemotherapy is often horribly toxic," Mirkin said. "But a lot of people don't realize it's also often poorly soluble, so we have to find ways to transform it into water soluble forms and deliver it effectively."

How Spherical Nucleic Acids Transform Drug Delivery

To overcome this limitation, the researchers turned to SNAs -- globular nanoparticles surrounded by dense shells of DNA or RNA. Cells readily recognize these structures and pull them inside. In this case, Mirkin's team chemically incorporated the chemotherapy molecules into the DNA strands themselves, creating a drug that cancer cells naturally absorb.

"Most cells have scavenger receptors on their surfaces," Mirkin explained. "But myeloid cells overexpress these receptors, so there are even more of them. If they recognize a molecule, then they will pull it into the cell. Instead of having to force their way into cells, SNAs are naturally taken up by these receptors."

Once inside, enzymes break down the DNA shell, releasing the chemotherapy payload directly into the cancer cell. This structural redesign completely changed how 5-Fu interacted with leukemia cells, dramatically increasing its effectiveness.

Precision Targeting With Minimal Harm

In mouse models, the new therapy nearly eliminated leukemia cells in the blood and spleen while significantly extending survival time. Because the SNAs selectively targeted AML cells, healthy tissues remained unharmed.

"Today's chemotherapeutics kill everything they encounter," Mirkin said. "So, they kill the cancer cells but also a lot of healthy cells. Our structural nanomedicine preferentially seeks out the myeloid cells. Instead of overwhelming the whole body with chemotherapy, it delivers a higher, more focused dose exactly where it's needed."

Next Steps Toward Clinical Trials

The research team now plans to test the approach in a larger group of small animal models before advancing to larger animals and, ultimately, human clinical trials, once additional funding becomes available.

The study, titled "Chemotherapeutic spherical nucleic acids," was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, with further support from the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.

Memory problems may not be an unavoidable part of getting older. New findings from Virginia Tech reveal that age-related memory loss stems from specific molecular changes in the brain, and that fine-tuning these processes can help restore memory function.

In two complementary studies, Timothy Jarome, an associate professor in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences' School of Animal Sciences, and his graduate students used advanced gene-editing tools to target these molecular changes and improve memory performance in older rats. Rats are commonly used as models for understanding how memory declines with age.

"Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it's a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease," said Jarome, who also serves in the School of Neuroscience. "This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied. If we can understand what's driving it at the molecular level, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment."

Adjusting Memory Pathways in the Hippocampus and Amygdala

In the first study, published in Neuroscience and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the researchers investigated a molecular process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts like a tagging system that directs proteins inside brain cells on how to behave. When it functions properly, it helps neurons communicate effectively and form memories.

The researchers discovered that aging alters this process in two important brain regions. In the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming and retrieving memories, K63 polyubiquitination levels rise with age. Using a gene-editing system called CRISPR-dCas13, the team lowered those levels and observed improved memory in older rats.

In contrast, in the amygdala -- a region crucial for emotional memory -- K63 polyubiquitination decreases with age. When the researchers further reduced this activity, memory performance also improved.

"Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain's aging process," Jarome explained. "In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory."

Reactivating a Dormant Gene to Improve Memory

The second study, published in the Brain Research Bulletin and led by Jarome and doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene known to support memory formation. As the brain gets older, IGF2 activity declines as the gene becomes chemically silenced within the hippocampus.

"IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that's imprinted, which means it's expressed from only one parental copy," Jarome said. "When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit."

The team found that this silencing occurs through DNA methylation, a natural process that adds chemical tags to DNA, turning the gene off. Using the CRISPR-dCas9 gene-editing system, they removed these tags and successfully reactivated IGF2. Older rats showed significant memory improvement once the gene was turned back on.

"We essentially turned the gene back on," Jarome said. "When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn't yet have memory problems weren't affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong."

Multiple Molecular Systems Influence Brain Aging

Together, these studies reveal that memory loss during aging doesn't result from a single cause. Instead, it involves several molecular systems that change over time.

"We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once," Jarome said. "If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer's disease, we have to look at the broader picture."

Collaborative Research Led by Graduate Scientists

Both projects were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome's lab and carried out with collaborators at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State. Yeeun Bae led the K63 polyubiquitination study, while Shannon Kincaid led the IGF2 project.

"These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, collaborative research that defines our work," Jarome said. "Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue."

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the American Federation for Aging Research.

"Everyone has some memory decline as they get older," Jarome added. "But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer's disease rises. What we're learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected -- and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments."

Microsoft has formed a new Superintelligence team within its AI division, aiming to develop what it calls “humanist superintelligence” — advanced AI that remains under human control.

The team, announced Thursday morning in a post by Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, reflects the company's ambitions to shape the next era of artificial intelligence while addressing concerns about safety and control in the development of advanced AI systems.

“We are doing this to solve real concrete problems and do it in such a way that it remains grounded and controllable,” Suleyman wrote. “We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity.”

The approach contrasts with the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the goal of creating AI systems that can match or surpass human capabilities across virtually any task — which is core to the mission of Microsoft's longtime partner, OpenAI, and its CEO Sam Altman.

In his message, Suleyman cited early directions in areas such as healthcare, where Microsoft researchers are developing expert-level diagnostic models, and clean energy, where AI could accelerate breakthroughs in materials, batteries, and fusion research. 

The goal, he wrote, is to advance technology “within limits” — keeping humanity in control while harnessing AI's potential to improve lives on a global scale

Suleyman will lead the new MAI Superintelligence Team, joined by Microsoft AI Chief Scientist Karén Simonyan and other core Microsoft AI leaders and researchers. Key leaders who've been involved in Microsoft's model development work are also expected to be part of the effort.

The company hasn't disclosed how large the group is expected to become.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

A brand new Intel graphics card, a free AAA game, plus an $80 saving, and it isn't even Black Friday yet? This graphics card deal isn't one to miss if you're thinking about upgrading your gaming rig. Thanks to the folks at B&H Photo, this Acer Intel Arc B580 Nitro OC GPU is down to just $234.99, saving you a whopping 25% on the card itself. You're also gaining Intel's Holiday Bundle as part of the deal, with one of four big game releases up for grabs, including the new Battlefield 6.

We were impressed with the performance offered by the Intel Arc B580 when we tested it late last year, especially considering its $249 MSRP. While stiff competition from Nvidia and AMD ultimately stole its thunder, not to mention price hikes amid stock shortages on launch, it's still a formidable choice for gamers at this new price. With Intel also adding multi-frame gen support to its XeSS upscaling tech, a feature previously only available to the latest Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards, these GPUs have also gained a real advantage that its AMD rivals can't offer – at least, not yet.

This Acer manufactured Intel Arc B580 Nitro OC graphics card is ready for 1440p gaming, featuring 20 Xe2 cores and 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM.

Specs-wise, this Battlemage GPU features 20 Xe2 cores and ships with 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM attached to a 192-bit memory bus. That 12GB of VRAM helps to explain why Intel focused attention on the B580's 1440p gameplay performance on launch, coming with faster GPU cores and higher capacity VRAM than equivalent cards available at the time, including the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060.

Buyers also get to take advantage of Intel's Holiday Bundle promotion. Running until January 31, 2026, this giveaway lets you redeem a free copy of either Battlefield 6, Dying Light: The Beast, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Civilization VI with each B580 purchase. Apart from Dying Light, which is worth $60, these games have a retail value of $70.

Similarly, low-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 cards are typically closer to $300, while AMD alternatives like the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 8GB can be found for around $250, but these cards are stuck with just 8GB of VRAM. With 12GB on hand, this Acer Intel Arc B580's $234.99 sale price is hard to ignore, especially for gamers looking to play at 1440p on a budget, but it won't be around forever.

Digs, a Vancouver, Wash.-based startup that sells software for homebuilding, raised $5 million.

Founded in 2022, Digs' software helps residential homebuilders streamline various aspects of their workflows including document organization, communication, and other tasks. It focuses on the pre-construction and design phase, turning static blueprints into digital, searchable files.

Digs also converts build documents (PDF floor plans, change orders, etc.) into a 3D digital twin that supports warranty agreements. 

Digs CEO Ryan Fink describes the company as “CarFax for the home.”

“Digs offers homeowners a first-of-its-kind 3D digital twin and AI-powered home ownership experience to become a living record of value and improvements,” he said in a press release. 

Fink said revenue is growing but didn't provide specific metrics. The company said it has nearly 10,000 homes on its platform.

Fink previously founded an augmented reality glasses startup called ONtheGo Platforms, which Atheer acquired in 2015. He also founded Streem, a startup that developed AR technology for home improvement technicians, which was acquired in 2019 by home services company Frontdoor.

Fink started Digs with Ty Frackiewicz, who previously co-founded ONtheGo and was vice president of product at Streem.

Digs employs 28 people and has raised nearly $20 million to date.

The latest $5 million raise is part of a “pre-Series A funding.” The round was led by Dallas-based firm SPLY Capital. Other backers include Oregon Venture Fund; Flying Fish; Portland Seed Fund, and Cascade Seed Fund. Digs customer Lanthorne Homes also invested in the latest round. 

SPLYCAP General Partner Tyler Williams joined the board at Digs. The startup recently hired longtime sales leader Stephen Molen as chief revenue officer.

They say all roads lead to Rome—but exactly how many Roman roads were there? According to new research, potentially over 68,000 miles (over 110,000 kilometers) more than previously known.

Meet Itiner-e, a new high-resolution digital dataset and map of the Roman Empire's roads around 150 CE. A team of researchers used archaeological and historical records, topographic maps, and satellite imagery to create the behemoth, which charts 185,896 miles (299,171 km) of roads across almost 1,544,409 square miles (4,000,000 square km).

“The Roman Empire's road system was critical for structuring the movement of people, goods and ideas, and sustaining imperial control. Yet, it remains incompletely mapped and poorly integrated across sources despite centuries of research,” the researchers wrote in a study published today in the journal Nature. They describe Itiner-e as “the most detailed and comprehensive open digital dataset of roads in the entire Roman Empire.”

When the Roman Empire peaked in the second century CE, it encompassed more than 55 million people from modern-day Britain to Egypt and Syria. The new map reveals 68,734 miles (110,616 km) more of roads than previous estimates. According to the researchers, the increase comes from a higher coverage of roads in the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and North Africa, as well as the modification of previously proposed roads around the actual landscape, such as winding mountain roads rather than unrealistic straight shots.

“This resource is transformative for understanding how mobility shaped connectivity, administration, and even disease transmission in the ancient world, and for studies of the millennia-long development of terrestrial mobility in the region,” the researchers said.

In total, Itiner-e consists of 14,769 road sections, with 34.6% categorized as main roads and 65.4% categorized as secondary roads. Notably, only 2.7% of the roads' precise locations are certain. 89.8% are known with less precision, and 7.4% are theorized.

“This shows a discrepancy between our knowledge of the existence and location of Roman roads: we know all of the included roads were used at some point during the Roman period, but their precise locations are not certain,” the team explained. They also noted that Itiner-e does not represent how the road system developed over time.

At its most basic level, Itiner-e provides an impressive new visual of the ancient Roman territories that helps you appreciate how well-connected the empire was. If you compare it to a modern map, you might even find some nerdy easter eggs—like the fact that the road that connects modern-day Bologna, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, and Milan is the same as the one that connected ancient Bononia, Mutina, Parma, Placentia, and Mediolanum in 150 CE.

This sort of arrogance where suddenly everyone remembers all reasons why some technology is bad once the "poor masses" get it (while they themselves had the technology for years), is hypocritical and frustrating.The reality is that getting online makes a massive difference for someone in some remote poor area.

For example, that would cost about three times as much in the UK but median income is about an order of magnitude higher so its more affordable.I do realise it is a lot more affordable than telecoms were in the past, but its something like a day of median income.

A third solution is to pipe it across timezones using HVDC and accept some level of efficiency loss and some geopolitical risks.A fourth solution is to mix lots of wind, which performs better in winter and cancels out the lower insolation.Realistically it's going to be all of the above, with the balance determined by local factors.

Extend that to 10k km and you're looking at approximately 25%, but if it's surplus solar, who cares?Such a line costs as much as a highway broadly speaking, so it's not impossible to build.

reply

Local power costs are over 30 cents per KWh, so that could be pretty competitive.The problem is that, no profit based organization will ever build "surplus" solar to enable that kind of thing. If we want surplus power, if we want a strong grid, if we want cheap power, if we want to enable the ability to quite literally waste solar power on inefficient processes (including things like industrial processes that produce less CO2 or generating hydrogen or methane as long term energy storage), we have to get the government to make it happenBut, uh, we hired people who would rather spend $170 billion on harassing random cities and brown people so..... Everyone get ready to pay absurd rates for electricity to support outdated businesses that have been directing American energy policy since Reagan, including paying about 60k coal miners in west virginia for a resource that is economically inferior to other fossil fuels but because they voted for a democrat once they now get a stranglehold on the US economy.

The argument always seemed disingenuous. For sure, China produces a lot of pollution as they are modernizing, but they are also investing a lot in the direction of sustainability. If we take the balance of (pollution produced - pollution prevented) for the two countries, the day will come, if it isn't now, that the US is on the losing side of that comparison, and I wonder what the new argument will be for the US not doing more.

reply

China's numbers did rise quickly on that measure and is above the EU now I think but still way below the US.And if you don't like per capita, then China with 4x as many people is still behind the US when you compare cumulative CO2.

The Chinese leadership understands several things very clearly:- The country has experienced multiple catastrophic natural disasters in the past.-  Such disasters often lead to regime change (losing the mandate of heaven via natural disasters leading to social unrest)- The leadership is comprised of smart people (and a lot of engineers) and they don't play dumb political games like denying the reality of climate change.- Climate change will bring far worse problems in future, which threatens the country's economic growth and therefore their hold on power.So they have massive incentive to care about the reality of climate change and do everything they can to mitigate it and protect their environment.

Therefore reaching self sufficiency in terms of power generation will make this threat less relevant and an enemy will no be able to use it to make them back off.

But none of that matters, China would pursue massive solar power infrastructure regardless, because they want energy independence. Stupid amounts of solar power means they will no longer be importing lots of oil and fuel, and that means they would be less vulnerable to the US blockading them in some sort of conflict, which is one of their primary geopolitical concerns.They would do this even if solar power was dramatically less effective or was significantly more expensive, because solar power is the first kind of power generation that it is economical to way overbuild, and have serious redundancy and surplus and excess, because there's no consumables that scale your running costs like if you tried to build massive amounts of coal power plants.China would like to have that kind of scale for power because they can use it to subsidize things like datacenters running less efficient Chinese made computer components. The fact that power doesn't have to run a profit in China helps this.The US should be taking fucking notes, about how nationalized infrastructure can be a force multiplier economically, and how infrastructure that doesn't have to be profitable can be even more powerful.Slaving ourselves to the enrichment of well connected capital owners is harming our country, and preventing a literal energy revolution. We have the option to, for the first time in human history, actually have energy resources that are too cheap to meter.

So many people did so that at one point last year the government said, "So many people are exporting it now, and the surplus is so great on the network we may have to charge you for exporting it". Wholesale power prices become negative during peak solar times - but retail companies will still charge you for using it!.Obviously, that didn't go down too well and this is the response - free electricity during peak solar hours.That said, my understanding is that free electricity is only for people who are on the "default offer" from the electricity companies - that is effectively the highest tier of pricing. Most people are not on the default offer.

Charge the batteries in the free time and then use the stored power the rest of the day.

Best 5 years of my life. I'm back in the US now temporarily, but there's zero doubt in my mind I will end up back in Aus. I've lived in 8 cities now(1), and Sydney was the highest quality of life I've had out of any of them. Great infrastructure, great work-life balance, great culture, and fantastic weather. Only downsides are the distance and the lack of ozone layer (do not fuck around with the sun in Australia - there's a reason why they have over 10x the global average of melanoma). Happy to answer any questions about it or the process for getting citizenship.(1) Cities lived for comparison: San Diego, LA, Honolulu, San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Sydney

It's quite fun (and educational) with the kids to work out when to put the car on to charge, when to run the dryer etc, looking at the few days ahead forecasts.Last month, we paid 11p per kWh on average, which is less than half what you'd pay on a standard tariff, and it's nice to be doing something good for the environment too.  It's  particularly satisfying to charge up the car when tariffs go negative.Here's today's rates (actuals):

That's pretty rough. That should be about 14¢ per kWh which only a hair less than the median price per kWh in the US (~17¢).

Almost all households are on fixed tariffs, typically about 26p/kwh at the moment.

Prices have gone negative because of things like subsidies - which in the short term is a good thing IMHO - it subsidizes industries developing systems to make use of that free (but not negative cost) energy...

Somebody has to go and turn it off, and having this person available overwhelms all of your operational costs.Or alternatively, you need the infrastructure to do it automatically, what is currently expensive. (But there aren't intrinsic reasons for that being expensive, it's probably due to lack of scale.)If it's just slightly negative, or just rarely so, it's not worth it.

Something I firmly believe is that there's a ton of low hanging fruit for timing our energy use better. It is just hidden by the desire to present a uniform energy price.Like why not run our water heaters when power is cheap? Then if that became a thing, we might even be interested in larger water heater tanks. Batteries cost per volume, you only pay for the surface are of a metal tank!

Obviously it still works great on the weekend, or whatever days you're not working to charge the EV at home for free.Given all power is free, why wouldn't you charge the EV at work in the middle of the day? Even if you pay to have the charger installed it will pay back quickly.It's not going to happen overnight, but with literally free electricity things will change quickly, and even huge parking structures or lots will have a stack of chargers that are free or very close to it.

Which utility and plan is this? I'm not aware of any California residential rate plans that charge you for putting power back on the grid, much less $100/month.That said, wholesale electricity rates are set by high frequency supply/demand markets.Recent residential net metering rates are  closely aligned with wholesale supply/demand based rates, so most utilities will compensate your brother in law  near $0 when you are pushing power to the grid when wholesale rates are <= $0, because there are not enough buyers of the power he is generating.He is using the grid as a battery, which comes at a cost.This is of course changing as more grid connected storage comes online and creates demand for off peak electricity.  In that case, you actually get paid for selling power back to the grid during high grid stress periods.  I get paid a few hundred dollars a year in CA for doing that with my measly home backup battery.

The ambient vibe of our time, and here on HN, is often really pessimistic. I don't believe such pessimism is realistic. Commercial grade fusion power will come, and we should push very hard to make it happen. It will change the equations at the core of the economy and open up whole new paths for technology -- far beyond the pure digital.

Ten years after Glowforge was founded in Seattle, the startup's longtime leaders are rebooting the laser-engraver business.

Following months of turmoil involving multiple rounds of layoffs, a failed funding round, and the closure of a Seattle manufacturing facility, Glowforge has undergone a restructuring through an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, a state-level process that's an alternative to bankruptcy.

Co-founder and CEO Dan Shapiro told GeekWire that the company — which had raised $183 million from investors — arrived at this moment “after spending a painful nine months looking at every possible option for the business.”

But it's not the end for the maker of a line of desktop 3D laser cutters/engravers that took the home crafting world by storm back in 2015.

Shapiro said he and co-founder Mark Gosselin, the startup's CTO, negotiated with the entity that was assigned Glowforge's assets — which was otherwise ready to liquidate the company — to acquire the trademark and brand, the hardware platform, software, and rights to manufacture more machines in Seattle.

“The board of directors ran a sales process led by an independent third party,” Shapiro said. “When there weren't any bidders, Mark and I put in a bid from our own savings.”

He said the company makes enough money out of the gate to support a team of about 20 former Glowforge employees, and that he and Gosselin plan to “get back to basics,” improving hardware and software and serving customers.

Shapiro said Glowforge was “weeks away from going public” in 2022 before it was derailed by what he called “a collapse in the crafting market” that took out key strategic partners like JOANN, which filed for bankruptcy in 2024.

While he credits millions in capital and a growing staff for enabling the startup to do things “we never dreamed of,” Shapiro said it's been a three-year struggle to keep serving customers.

“The need to scale at all costs, to optimize for the next funding round, to hit growth metrics that justified ever-higher valuations … it pulled us away from what mattered,” he said.

In early 2025, Glowforge moved assembly of its highest-end machines from Mexico back to the U.S. and Seattle with the opening of a production facility in its SoDo headquarters space. The work employed 15 people, and Shapiro said at the time Glowforge employed just over 90 full-time and contract employees.

But following layoffs in August that impacted multiple teams, the production facility was shuttered in September in the wake of more layoffs.

“I'm not going to pretend this year was anything but brutal,” Shapiro said. “Layoffs are painful. Restructuring is messy. And there are people who believed in the original company who are understandably disappointed.”

Shapiro founded Glowforge in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Gosselin (founder and former CTO of Cequint) and Tony Wright (founder of RescueTime, Jobby and CubeDuel), who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter.

Glowforge's machines let people use raw materials including leather, paper, plastic, fabric, or cardboard to intricately cut and engrave products with the push of a button.

Via its cloud-based software users can design and develop creations from a web browser on a computer, tablet, or phone. You can create “almost anything” with Glowforge, Shapiro previously said, including jewelry, decorative items, smartphone engravings, wallets, toys, and more.

Glowforge backers included Brad Feld's Foundry Group and True Ventures, which led the company's $9 million Series A round in May 2015. MakerBot co-founder Bre Pettis, former MakerBot CEO Jenny Lawton, Wetpaint founder Ben Elowitz, KISSmetrics founder Hiten Shah, and former Swype CEO Mike McSherry are among other investors.

The company set a crowdfunding record in October 2015 with a 30-day campaign that generated $27.9 million in sales.

“Mark and I started this because we believed something simple: everyone should be able to make beautiful things,” Shapiro said this week. “Not just people with engineering degrees or expensive workshops, but everyone. And we created a desktop laser market that nobody had even imagined could exist.”

In August 2016, the company raised $22 million, but it was dealing with shipping delays that stretched into 2017 and caused mounting customer frustration and order cancellations. In 2018, the company raised another $10 million, and $43 million more in 2022.

Glowforge initially focused on direct-to-consumer and later partnered with large craft retailers such as JOANN and Michaels. The company also expanded to serve schools and universities in 2021. 

The startup eventually sold two higher-end machines including the Glowforge Plus ($4,995) and Glowforge Pro ($6,995). In 2023 it released the $1,200 Aura and in 2024 the $699 Spark in an attempt to attract a wider audience of consumers.

Eternally optimistic throughout Glowforge's years of ups and downs, Shapiro exhibits that same characteristic in the face of starting over.

He called it a “rebirth” and a return to the vision that he and Gosselin had in 2015, with a team “that's here for the mission, not the vanity metrics” and to serve customers “rather than optimizing for investor presentations.”

“The cost of being a growth-first company is massive, and not always obvious,” Shapiro said. “When we stripped the business to its essentials, we could see what we actually needed to serve our customers.”

The same hardware and software products will be offered, and Shapiro said improvements are coming. New features are also being launched now and next week, including: Box Builder, which uses generative AI to let users describe a custom box in plain English before Glowforge creates the design; and Snapmarks, in which users can print anything on a regular inkjet printer (stickers, iron ons) and load it into a Glowforge laser for cutting.

Shapiro also said they plan to continue the manufacturing formula they previously developed to build machines in Seattle. 

He called the new Glowforge a great business from day one — “awesome product, amazing customers, and profitable,” adding that the startup is now “simpler, more focused, and more committed to the long haul. And Mark and I are all in.”

Paul Erlanger and Se Yong Park, co-founders of consumer crypto trading app Fomo, took an unusual route to raising capital that is paying off for them. 

Their app launched in May and they just announced a $17 million Series A round led by Benchmark — an atypical crypto bet for the top-tier VC firm — bringing total funding to $19 million.

Instead of a classic seed round, the founders drew up a list of 200 people they dreamed of having as angel investors. 

“We knew that every single person would be valuable to us in the business,” Erlanger told TechCrunch. 

Then they worked their networks for warm intros — both had previously worked at the popular crypto trading platform dYdX. Failing that, they made cold calls. And 140 of their dream angels wrote checks after hearing their pitch.

They landed such big names in the crypto world as Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron, co-founder of Solana Raj Gokal, and former Coinbase CTO and super-angel Balaji Srinivasan, the founders said.

“There's a lot of people we never got to, like Elon Musk,” Park said with a grin, but of the ones who did take their call, less than a handful said no, he said. 

The angels liked their idea of a super app that gives consumers access to every crypto asset ever (millions of them), available on any blockchain, with, they promise, no technical friction. The app also has a social component baked into it, where users can follow friends and leaders they respect to see their trades. 

While Fomo doesn't yet have every asset from every blockchain available, the founders said they are on track to be close to that goal in six months. And among the millions of assets they do offer today, users can trade everything from major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana to meme coins and altcoins, they say.  

The ultimate vision is to one day allow consumers to trade all kinds of other assets on the app, from prediction markets to standard securities like bonds. 

A month after Fomo's May launch, the founders added a feature that dramatically changed their company's trajectory: support for Apple Pay. This essentially let users download the app and quickly start trading. 

“We saw a massive influx of users and revenue,” Erlanger said.  Fomo instantly soared to about $150,000 in revenue per week and $3 million in volume a day, the founders said. 

The app collects transaction fees on each trade of 0.50% (with a minimum fee of $0.95 for transactions on Solana, and no minimum fee on other, less-expensive blockchains like Base and BNB Chain). But it doesn't make users pay so-called “gas fees,” or the fees blockchains charge to process transactions. That's a real selling point for users interested in holding the major coins, Park said. 

Their many-angels strategy paid off because not one but three people reached out to Benchmark early-stage investor Chetan Puttagunta to offer an introduction, Puttagunta told TechCrunch. 

Puttagunta was a long-shot choice for a lead investor of the Series A round that Erlanger and Park were actively pursuing. Benchmark is selective with its picks and doesn't invest much in crypto startups. It backed Chainalysis in 2018, along with Toncoin and a few others.

But Puttagunta (who's backed such companies as Elastic, Cursor, Manus, and LangChain) saw Fomo's fast growth and was convinced to take a chance, and a board seat.  

“Paul and Se and the entire team have a clear vision to make crypto assets both easy to discover and trade,” Puttagunta said. “Their vision is clearly resonating with truly exceptional growth since they launched a few months ago.”  

Benchmark was the only institutional check the founders took, with the rest of the round going to existing angels and new ones.

So far, it looks like Benchmark's bet could pay off. Since the round closed in September, Fomo has added more assets from more blockchains to its app and has seen growth go even crazier. The founders say they have onboarded over 120,000 users. “We're now doing about $20-$40 million in volume a day, and about $150,000 in revenue a day,” Erlanger said.

With so much money flooding into AI startups, it's a good time to be an AI researcher with an idea to test out. And if the idea is novel enough, it might be easier to get the resources you need as an independent company instead of inside one of the big labs.

That's the story of Inception, a startup developing diffusion-based AI models that just raised $50 million in seed funding led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Mayfield, Innovation Endeavors, Microsoft's M12 fund, Snowflake Ventures, Databricks Investment, and Nvidia's venture arm NVentures. Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy provided additional angel funding.

The leader of the project is Stanford professor Stefano Ermon, whose research focuses on diffusion models — which generate outputs through iterative refinement rather than word-by-word. These models power image-based AI systems like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and Sora. Having worked on those systems since before the AI boom made them exciting, Ermon is using Inception to apply the same models to a broader range of tasks.

Together with the funding, the company released a new version of its Mercury model, designed for software development. Mercury has already been integrated into a number of development tools, including ProxyAI, Buildglare, and Kilo Code. Most importantly, Ermon says the diffusion approach will help Inception's models conserve on two of the most important metrics: latency (response time) and compute cost.

“These diffusion-based LLMs are much faster and much more efficient than what everybody else is building today,” Ermon says. “It's just a completely different approach where there is a lot of innovation that can still be brought to the table.”

Understanding the technical difference requires a bit of background. Diffusion models are structurally different from auto-regression models, which dominate text-based AI services. Auto-regression models like GPT-5 and Gemini work sequentially, predicting each next word or word fragment based on the previously processed material. Diffusion models, trained for image generation, take a more holistic approach, modifying the overall structure of a response incrementally until it matches the desired result.

The conventional wisdom is to use auto-regression models for text applications, and that approach has been hugely successful for recent generations of AI models. But a growing body of research suggests diffusion models may perform better when a model is processing large quantities of text or managing data constraints. As Ermon tells it, those qualities become a real advantage when performing operations over large codebases.

Diffusion models also have more flexibility in how they utilize hardware, a particularly important advantage as the infrastructure demands of AI become clear. Where auto-regression models have to execute operations one after another, diffusion models can process many operations simultaneously, allowing for significantly lower latency in complex tasks.

“We've been benchmarked at over 1,000 tokens per second, which is way higher than anything that's possible using the existing autoregressive technologies,” Ermon says, “because our thing is built to be parallel. It's built to be really, really fast.”

An enthusiast has shared their first designs, melding the disparate worlds of PC DIY with model railroading. Beautiful-Turnip-353 shared a video of a prototype PC build with a small T-gauge train circling atop their chunky GPU. It adds a truly dynamic aspect to the case window view, and we can imagine a tiny stationmaster shouting, “All aboard the PCI Express, we're going gaming.”

T-gauge model trains are the smallest commonly available to hobbyists. With a track gauge of just 3mm (0.118 inches) and a model scale of somewhere between 1:450 to 1:500, these are the minnows of the model railroading hobby world. Nevertheless, once properly set up, T-gauge builders can enjoy realistic speed controls and the convenience of magnetized track building systems. They also fit well in the smallest of spaces – or allow for the most intricately detailed large-scale dioramas.

Even the biggest and best graphics cards don't really have enough room for anything more substantial, so T-gauge is the best choice in a PC like this. T-gauge track has a minimum corner radius of approximately 60mm; moving up to Z-gauge would double that. However, perhaps the GeForce 60 series will inadvertently open up Z-gauge options to the model train/PC building enthusiast community.

Beautiful-Turnip-353 reveals that they have more ambitious plans for the build. Currently, it is explained that the electric loco is powered via “an Arduino on a USB port that is sending a PWM 5V signal to the rails.”

Power delivery for the train set is one aspect of the design that is earmarked for further refinement, though. The Redditor said the current setup doesn't allow a great range of speed controls. A helpful fellow enthusiast in the comments suggested controlling the train throttle via an internal 5V PWM fan header and adjusting it using software such as FanControl. Another pointed out that it would also be possible, for example, to auto-adjust the train's speed in line with the PC's temperature sensors.

Beautiful-Turnip-353 hints that they are seeking to intensify their railroad/PC crossover designs. “I want to make a much more train-themed build in the future, but something is better than nothing, haha.” There is a lot Beautiful-Turnip-353 could do with more scenery in the case, and the outer PC case design, and they know it.

More interesting track layouts, interactive signaling and control systems, and lighting would add atmosphere and charm to the build. It would be a spectacular cherry on top if a chuffing steam train could run around in the case, too.

You'd better have your encryption key on hand, so you won't lose your data.

Microsoft just released a service alert informing users that the October 2025 Windows security update might trigger BitLocker recovery for some Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2, as well as Windows 10 22H2 systems. According to BleepingComputer, this isn't the first time that Windows has experienced this issue, with similar incidents in May of this year, as well as in 2024 and 2022.

“After installing Windows Updates released on or after October 14, 2025, some devices might encounter issues during restart or startup,” Microsoft said in its announcement. “Affected devices might boot into the BitLocker recovery screen, requiring users to enter the recovery key once. After the key is entered and the device restarts, it will boot normally without any further BitLocker prompts.”

This won't be an issue if your device does not have BitLocker activated — however, Windows 11 24H2 and onwards (even the Home version) have the feature turned on by default if it's a clean install on supported hardware and you logged in with a Microsoft account. This means you likely have BitLocker activated if you have a new laptop, especially as Microsoft is taking steps to make it impossible to log into your Windows 11 PC using a local account.

If you're using a corporate device, your IT administrator can prevent the bug from affecting your device via a Known Issue Rollback group policy. But if you're a consumer user, you'd better know your BitLocker password, or else you risk losing access to your files for good if it locks you out and you don't know the correct credentials. Thankfully, you can easily check if BitLocker encryption is enabled or disabled on your device, and you can also retrieve your BitLocker key from your Microsoft account if it has already locked you out.

BitLocker is a nifty tool for protecting your data, as it won't let anyone access your hard drive if your computer is stolen, even if they move it to another device. However, it can also be a pain for the average user, especially if they did not know that it's automatically activated on their Windows 11 PC, and how to recover the key should it activate. This is especially true if the bug activates after a software update — after all, most users do not expect that their system would flag an update from Microsoft as a security threat.

Jensen Huang made this controversial comment on the sidelines of the Future of AI Summit.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Washington has lost its edge in artificial intelligence and warns that China will win the AI race. He cited the West's cynicism, export controls, and favorable energy circumstances in China as the reason, claiming it is much easier for companies to access energy in the country.

The chief of the most valuable company in the world by market cap has long been saying that the U.S. ban on chip exports is a failure, and that the spread of its advanced semiconductors is vital for it to retain its competitive advantage globally. However, the ongoing trade war between the two powers has resulted in export bans of Blackwell chips from the White House on the one hand, and the CCP banning foreign AI chips from state-funded data centers on the other. Because of this, Nvidia's market share in China has since dropped to basically zero, which probably led to Huang's statement to the Financial Times.

“China is going to win the AI race,” Jensen commented. He also added that “we need more optimism,” saying that the West's cynicism is holding it back. Huang released a statement on Nvidia's X account a few hours after FT published his words. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.” The Nvidia CEO previously mentioned this in late September on a podcast, leaning on his stance that he's been preaching for over a year that export restrictions on his company's AI chips are detrimental to the U.S.'s long-term interests.

Huang argues that if China loses access to Nvidia's latest AI GPUs, its tech companies will be forced to purchase homegrown alternatives, which will pour money into its chip makers and further drive research, development, and innovations in the local semiconductor industry. Aside from that, it will also reduce these companies' dependence on Nvidia's software ecosystem, making it easier for them to migrate to a Chinese AI processor. On the other hand, other industry leaders contend that the U.S. is heavily dependent on China and that it's only using Nvidia's products as a stopgap until it builds a credible competitor to the AI chip powerhouse. The comments come just days after the administration hinted that China could have access to Nvidia Blackwell chips, but only once they are out of date.

Aside from export controls, Nvidia's top executive also highlighted China's approach to energy subsidies that make it easier for companies to put up power-hungry data centers, versus the hodgepodge of rules the different States in the U.S. are pushing on AI, potentially resulting in “50 new regulations.” Experts have been saying that electricity generation is the next bottleneck that the AI industry must solve, and it seems that Beijing is miles ahead, as it has already addressed the energy problem for its AI infrastructure. On the other hand, American tech companies are still investing in alternative power sources like small modular reactors and space-based data centers, which will take years to materialize, if at all. Recently, Microsoft revealed it has GPUs it simply can't plug in because it doesn't have the energy required.

The status of the AI race between the two global rivals isn't clear, especially as politics and protectionism are muddying the waters. Aside from that, both sides' arguments for and against China getting access to Nvidia's AI GPUs have merit, meaning we will probably only truly see who is right years down the line. But one thing is clear in all of this — Nvidia will get a massive advantage if it supplies the chips that both sides use in the AI race.

A Seattle biotech startup born from a Nobel laureate's lab has landed $12.7 million and partnerships with pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Kite Pharma by using AI to design proteins that mount a multi-pronged attack on diseases.

Accipiter Biosciences emerged from stealth today with a leadership team that includes researchers who worked at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design under David Baker, a 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner for his breakthroughs in building proteins from scratch.

The company is using artificial intelligence tools developed at the institute to engineer de novo proteins that have the unusual ability to bind multiple cellular targets at once, potentially amplifying their illness-fighting impact.

“We want to establish this new modality,” said Matthew Bick, Accipiter Bio's co-founder and CEO. The strategy, he added, could unlock new ways to more effectively treat complicated diseases.

There's evidence that combinations of drugs sometimes perform better than single therapies, but the challenge has been coordinating their actions so they work together at the same location. 

In some forms of cancer, for example, multiple cell functions need to be turned on simultaneously to produce helpful molecules that work synergistically to create an effect “that is not just additive, it's multiplicative,” Bick said. 

The approach could also speed U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and cut costs. Typically, when two drugs are combined to treat a condition, each must undergo its own expensive Phase 1 safety trial, followed by an additional trial testing them together. A single multi-functional drug would need just one Phase 1 trial.

Accipiter Bio has entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to research and engineer new molecules. The deal provides an upfront payment for the startup and the potential to earn more than $330 million if Accipiter Bio hits certain milestones and through royalties.

“With Accipiter's platform technology and collaboration, Pfizer aims to solve complex therapeutic problems with biologics that may have previously been unattainable,” said Jeffrey Settleman, Pfizer Oncology R&D's chief scientific officer. 

Accipiter Bio also has an agreement with the oncology drug company Kite, which is owned by Gilead Sciences, to design proteins for use in cell therapies. The arrangement similarly includes initial funding with the possibility of milestone payments and royalties. Kite has the option of acquiring molecules created through the arrangement and develop them into therapeutics for global sales. 

On top of those efforts, Accipiter Bio has four of its own drug-development programs. Two programs are preparing for formal FDA discussions about human testing — a stage called pre-IND .

Bick would not provide details on the efforts, but said the company is researching agents for treating cancers and irritable bowel syndrome, among other ailments.

Flying Fish Partners and Takeda co-led the seed round. Additional investors are Columbus Venture Partners, Cercano Capital, Washington Research Foundation, Alexandria Investments, Pack Ventures and Argonautic Ventures.

“We've reached the point where computation isn't just speeding up biology,” said Heather Gorham, principal at Flying Fish Partners and Accipiter board member. “It's expanding what's biologically possible.”

The startup launched in March 2023 and previously raised about $800,000 to get off the ground. Bick was a senior fellow in Baker's lab for more than seven years and later a senior director for Seattle's Neoleukin Therapeutics.

Accipiter Bio has 17 employees. The leadership team has three members in addition to Bick. 

While the strategy of using AI to build a new class of proteins could open the door to groundbreaking therapies, drug development is a risky business.

Neoleukin was a biotech company co-founded by Baker that spun out of the UW in 2019. The startup's lead drug candidate, an engineered protein used in cancer treatment, under-performed in a Phase 1 trial. Neoleukin laid off many of its employees before merging with another company.

The three co-founders met at the startup and gained valuable technical and strategic lessons from the experience, Bick said. That included the need to have multiple drug programs running at once and insights into preventing immunogencity, which is an unwanted immune response to foreign bodies. 

“We were part of the team,” he said, “that took the first fully de novo protein into patients.”

What are the drivers of this? Does it imply that the income of these households is mostly from stock market returns or that they would tighten belts because of perceived future financial insecurity? Or is it is because they're largely business owners and a stock market contraction would correlate with reduced profits?

Why focusing on the energy system and large companies is more important than policing individual behavior.

Picture it: I'm minding my business at a party, parked by the snack table (of course). A friend of a friend wanders up, and we strike up a conversation. It quickly turns to work, and upon learning that I'm a climate technology reporter, my new acquaintance says something like: “Should I be using AI? I've heard it's awful for the environment.” 

This actually happens pretty often now. Generally, I tell people not to worry—let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want. 

That response might surprise some people, but I promise I'm not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. Data centers could consume up to 945 terawatt-hours annually by 2030. (That's roughly as much as Japan.) 

But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals, partly because AI concerns remind me so much of another question: “What should I do to reduce my carbon footprint?” 

That one gets under my skin because of the context: BP helped popularize the concept of a carbon footprint in a marketing campaign in the early 2000s. That framing effectively shifts the burden of worrying about the environment from fossil-fuel companies to individuals. 

The reality is, no one person can address climate change alone: Our entire society is built around burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need political action and public support for researching and scaling up climate technology. We need companies to innovate and take decisive action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Focusing too much on individuals is a distraction from the real solutions on the table. 

I see something similar today with AI. People are asking climate reporters at barbecues whether they should feel guilty about using chatbots too frequently when we need to focus on the bigger picture. 

Big tech companies are playing into this narrative by providing energy-use estimates for their products at the user level. A couple of recent reports put the electricity used to query a chatbot at about 0.3 watt-hours, the same as powering a microwave for about a second. That's so small as to be virtually insignificant.

But stopping with the energy use of a single query obscures the full truth, which is that this industry is growing quickly, building energy-hungry infrastructure at a nearly incomprehensible scale to satisfy the AI appetites of society as a whole. Meta is currently building a data center in Louisiana with five gigawatts of computational power—about the same demand as the entire state of Maine at the summer peak.  (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.)

Increasingly, there's no getting away from AI, and it's not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Your email provider's suggested replies? Probably AI. Same for chatting with customer service while you're shopping online. 

Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices. 

Massive tech companies using AI in their products should be disclosing their total energy and water use and going into detail about how they complete their calculations. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that's changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Lawmakers should be mandating these disclosures, and we should be asking for them, too. 

That's not to say there's absolutely no individual action that you can take. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact. 

Ultimately, as long as you aren't relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn't be too worried about your individual AI footprint. But we should all be keeping our eye on what this industry will mean for our grid, our society, and our planet.

Atari is a very different games company in 2025 to the industry-dominating titan of the 1980s. Back then, it was practically synonymous with gaming, but following years of sell-offs and restructurings, it's now a stalwart of the retro scene, leveraging its classic franchises to position itself as a natural home for nostalgic play.

After the Atari Watch comes the brand's latest outing: the Gamestation Go. Or rather, it's retro hardware specialist My Arcade's latest—a roughly Switch-sized handheld that packs in hundreds of games from across Atari's long and storied history.

It should be an easy sell for a wide variety of players, from those wanting to relive their youthful memories to any self-styled gaming historians wanting to experience crucial moments of the medium. It almost succeeds—but unfortunately, a few too many compromises in performance and build quality hold it back from greatness. Let's get into the detail.

The Gamestation Go makes its biggest splash with a central offering of more than 200 built-in games—a phenomenal roster to have at hand. All the familiar faces are included, from Asteroids, Breakout, and Centipede to Missile Command, Tempest, and Yar's Revenge (the full list can be found on Atari's official page), with the bulk of the library, 70-plus games, coming from the iconic Atari 2600. Eight more come from the Atari 5200, 11 from the Atari 7800 (albeit with a hefty caveat on that front), plus three dozen of Atari's various arcade originals and a handful from lesser-known sources such as Mattel's M-Network carts.

Oddly, given the branding of the device, this isn't entirely Atari's party. There's also a trio of Pac-Man games (arcade classic, Atari 2600, and “Speed Up” flavors) and Balls of Steel, a mid-'90s pinball game broken out into its own section, with seven tables based on Atari games.

Drifting further, there are 40 titles included from defunct Japanese publisher Jaleco, including games released on 8-bit and 16-bit consoles and in arcades, and 20 from Piko, a US label that specializes in its own digital archaeology, licensing lost and abandoned titles from yesteryear. Still, it doesn't hurt to have some added variety, and there are plenty of genuinely hidden gems in this selection—Piko's Brave Battle Saga, a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive RPG released in the Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets in 1996 is a particularly nice find.

The Gamestation Go also tips its hat to modernity with five Atari Recharged titles, a series of remakes that take the core mechanics of classic games and revamp them with updated graphics, extra features, and even achievements. The five here—Asteroids, Berzerk, Breakout, Centipede, and Missile Command—are available on other platforms where they usually sell for $10 apiece, which makes for a nice value add here.

Hundreds of games means inevitable overlap, though, with some titles cropping up repeatedly. Centipede alone appears five times, with 2600, 5200, 7800, Arcade, and Recharged iterations. Others, including Missile Command, Asteroids, and Berzerk, also make multiple appearances. On one hand, it's an absolute gift for games preservation—being able to see how these games changed and evolved as they hopped platforms is pretty cool. On the other, given the core gameplay remains largely the same across versions, only the most devoted of Atari fans are likely to appreciate the nuances when it comes to actually playing them.

That “hefty caveat” when it comes to the Atari 7800 games, though? They don't work. Select any of the games from that platform, and you're met with a slight audio pause and a flicker of the menu screen, but nothing else. Even trying a factory reset of the console achieves nothing—this cohort of games simply will not launch.

A press spokesperson for My Arcade says that a “firmware update development is in progress, and an official announcement will be made once it's ready to deploy,” but it's far from ideal for the Gamestaion Go to be launching with several of its games unplayable and no date in sight for a fix. No explanation for the failure of the 7800 games was provided, but given everything on the device runs through emulation, my guess is the one for 7800 titles simply isn't working.

Relying on emulation results in unwanted quirks elsewhere, often in terms of presentation. While most games have an option to swap the screen ratio between original dimensions and the handheld's 16:9, some don't look right in either format. Anything with vector graphics seems to be particularly prone to this, but not uniformly—Missile Command seemed mostly fine, but Tempest could throw up problems like broken text or a stretched appearance. It makes selecting a game a bit of a crapshoot, as you can't tell which are going to have issues. On a more positive note, the use of emulators does mean you can expand the already massive library via a MicroSD slot, if you have any (legally obtained, obviously) ROMs to load up.

Away from the games, the overall system UI is … well, it's fine. Games are grouped under chunky category headers, each one leading to a perfunctory list. You can't search for titles, just scroll through the list, but you can at least mark favorites to return to later. Players are treated to a nice bio of each game and classic case art or, in a neat touch for the arcade titles, shots of their original cabinets—another lovely nod to the history of the roster. There are also helpful touches like being able to check the controls or read a tips section for each game, while the emulated approach means you can create save states for many titles.

The most annoying system aspect is that the device doesn't remember Wi-Fi settings, meaning you'll need to enter your network credentials every time. Given you only need to connect to check for system updates, it's not a deal breaker, but it's an irritating chore every time.

The Gamestation Go's secret weapon isn't in the sheer volume of games included, though, but in how many ways it gives you to play them. Along with all the expected inputs—four face buttons, four shoulder buttons, and a surprisingly great D-pad—it also incorporates unique controls inspired by traditional Atari hardware, allowing you to play some of these early, experimental games as originally intended.

Above the D-pad sits a dial—officially the “Paddle”—which is perfect for games like Breakout. Below it, a “Trak-Ball” allows for more accurate rotational controls, working great in Tempest. Below the ABXY face buttons is a full 12-key number pad. That's probably the least-used, but the Atari 5200's Meebzork supports it, at least.

While all these curious controls give the handheld a distinct look—there's no way you'll mistake it for any other gaming handheld—they might seem overwhelming. Thankfully, the Gamestation Go proves itself a bright spark, with its fantastic "SmartGlow" feature. This genius bit of design has the necessary controls for each game light up with a warm orange LED, making it immediately clear which to use. Given the vast roster included, that's no small feat. The gentle glow also beautifully fits into the aesthetics of the handheld, matching the autumnal swashes of color that hark back to the Atari 2600's wood paneling, and break up its otherwise monochrome look.

The in-built screen offers a 720p resolution and decent, if not mind-blowing, brightness or color depth—but realistically, no one in 2025 is playing the games here for their graphical prowess. The display is perfect for the intended purposes, as are the internal speakers—a bit tinny perhaps, but for '80s chiptune, absolutely fine.

If you do want a bit more visual clarity though, you can connect the Gamestation Go to your main TV and enjoy full 1080p thanks to an HDMI-Out port, although some input lag may be noticeable depending on the game. Two USB-C ports on the rear allow wired controllers to be connected for multiplayer, easily accessed thanks to a sturdy kickstand that also keeps the console upright. You can also use the Gamestation Go as a controller in TV mode, allowing you to use the Paddle, Trak-Ball, or Num Pad on the big screen. A solid battery life of four to six hours helps for portable or TV play without needing to plug in.

Unfortunately, the device's build quality doesn't quite match up to its engineering. The plastic casing feels low quality, and my review unit arrived showing what appear to be stress marks or warping near the 3.5-mm audio jack and volume rocker at the top edge of the handheld. The face buttons and the Start/Select/Credit/Settings buttons that sit above the screen have a cheap, acrylic feel to them. Annoyingly, the Paddle also tends to feel too stiff, and the Trak-Ball, too twitchy, and while it's possible to adjust sensitivity for some games, they rarely feel right.

The Gamestation Go also leaves something to be desired on the ergonomics front. While its 267 mm x 138 mm front-on dimensions puts the Gamestation Go in roughly the same size category as the Switch 2, it's much thicker (26-mm depth, measured at the hand grips) and slightly heavier, too—566 grams versus 534. Those hand grips are more of an indented ridge either side, just about creating space to rest fingers, and making reaching the shoulder buttons a literal stretch. It's not the most uncomfortable handheld, but its chunky form means it sits in the hands like a boxy slab and isn't great for longer play sessions.

The Gamestation Go feels like it has two identities. One is a retro gamer's fantasy, a portable console packed with classic games, authentic ways to play them, and a few modern tricks up its sleeve. That version feels like a real love letter to Atari fans. The other is a slapdash bit of tech crammed with more games than anyone will realistically play, some of which may not work at all, and lacking polish. If system updates fix some of the inherent software and emulation issues, there's great potential here, but even then, probably only for those with a real passion for the days when Atari was king.

The Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto, California, has some of the best real estate in the country, with a charming hodgepodge of homes ranging in style from Tudor revival to modern farmhouse and contemporary Mediterranean. It also has a gigantic compound that is home to Mark Zuckerberg, his wife Priscilla Chan, and their daughters Maxima, August, and Aurelia. Their land has expanded to include 11 previously separate properties, five of which are connected by at least one property line.

The Zuckerberg compound's expansion first became a concern for Crescent Park neighbours as early as 2016, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market. Then, about five years later, neighbors noticed that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. This would be illegal under the area's residential zoning code without a permit. They began a crusade to shut it down that did not end until summer 2025.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

WIRED obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the neighborhood dispute—including 311 records, legal filings, construction plans, and emails—through a public record request filed to the Palo Alto Department of Planning and Development Services. (Mentions of “Zuckerberg” or “the Zuckerbergs” appear to have been redacted. However, neighbors and separate public records confirm that the property in question belongs to the family. The names of the neighbors who were in touch with the city were also redacted.)

The documents reveal that the school may have been operating as early as 2021 without a permit to operate in the city of Palo Alto. As many as 30 students might have enrolled, according to observations from neighbors. These documents also reveal a wider problem: For almost a decade, the Zuckerbergs' neighbors have been complaining to the city about noisy construction work, the intrusive presence of private security, and the hordes of staffers and business associates causing traffic and taking up street parking.

Over time, neighbors became fed up with what they argued was the city's lack of action, particularly with respect to the school. Some believed that the delay was because of preferential treatment to the Zuckerbergs. “We find it quite remarkable that you are working so hard to meet the needs of a single billionaire family while keeping the rest of the neighborhood in the dark,” reads one email sent to the city's Planning and Development Services Department in February. “Just as you have not earned our trust, this property owner has broken many promises over the years, and any solution which depends on good faith behavioral changes from them is a failure from the beginning.”

Palo Alto spokesperson Meghan Horrigan-Taylor told WIRED that the city “enforces zoning, building, and life safety rules consistently, without regard to who owns a property.” She also refuted the claim that neighbors were kept in the dark, claiming that the city's approval of construction projects at the Zuckerberg properties “were processed the same way they are for any property owner.” She added that, though some neighbors told the city they believe the Zuckerbergs received “special treatment,” that is not accurate.

“Staff met with residents, conducted site visits, and provided updates by phone and email while engaging the owner's representative to address concerns,” Horrigan-Taylor said. “These actions were measured and appropriate to abate the unpermitted use and responsive to neighborhood issues within the limits of local and state law.”

According to The New York Times, which first reported on the school's existence, it was called “Bicken Ben School” and shared a name with one of the Zuckerbergs' chickens. The listing for Bicken Ben School, or BBS for short, in a California Department of Education directory claims the school opened on October 5, 2022. This, however, is the year after neighbors claim to have first seen it operating. It's also two and a half years after Sara Berge—the school's point of contact, per documents WIRED obtained from the state via public record request—claims to have started her role as “head of school” for a “Montessori pod” at a “private family office” according to her LinkedIn profile, which WIRED viewed in September and October. Berge did not respond to a request to comment.

Between 2022 and 2025, according to the documents Bicken Ben filed to the state, the school grew from nine to 14 students ranging from 5 to 10 years old. Neighbors, however, estimated that they observed 15 to 30 students. Berge similarly claimed on her LinkedIn profile to have overseen “25 children” in her job. In a June 2025 job listing for “BBS,” the school had a “current enrollment of 35–40 students and plans for continued growth,” which the listing says includes a middle school.

In order for the Zuckerbergs to run a private school on their land, which is in a residential zone, they need a “conditional use” permit from the city. However, based on the documents WIRED obtained, and Palo Alto's public database of planning applications, the Zuckerbergs do not appear to have ever applied for or received this permit.

Per emails obtained by WIRED, Palo Alto authorities told a lawyer working with the Zuckerbergs in March 2025 that the family had to shut down the school on its compound by June 30. A state directory lists BBS, the abbreviation for Bicken Ben School, as having operated until August 18, and three of Zuckerberg's neighbors—who all requested anonymity due to the high-profile nature of the family—confirmed to WIRED in late September that they had not seen or heard students being dropped off and picked up on weekdays in recent weeks.

However, Zuckerberg family spokesperson Brian Baker tells WIRED that the school didn't close, per se. It simply moved. It's not clear where it is now located, or whether the school is operating under a different name.

In response to a detailed request for comment, Baker provided WIRED with an emailed statement on behalf of the Zuckerbergs. “Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade,” he said. “They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”

By the fall of 2024, Zuckerberg's neighbors were at their breaking point. At some point in mid-2024, according to an email from then mayor Greer Stone, a group of neighbors had met with Stone to air their grievances about the Zuckerberg compound and the illegal school they claimed it was operating. They didn't arrive at an immediate resolution.

In the years prior, the city had received several rounds of complaints about the Zuckerberg compound. Complaints for the address of the school were filed to 311, the nationwide number for reporting local non-emergency issues, in February 2019, September 2021, January 2022, and April 2023. They all alleged that the property was operating illegally under city code. Both were closed by the planning department, which found no rule violations. An unknown number of additional complaints, mentioned in emails among city workers, were also made between 2020 and 2024—presumably delivered via phone calls, in person, or to city departments not included in WIRED's public record request.

In December 2020, building inspection manager Korwyn Peck wrote to code enforcement officer Brian Reynolds about an inspection he attempted to conduct around the Zuckerberg compound, in response to several noise and traffic complaints from neighbors. He described that several men in SUVs had gathered to watch him, and a tense conversation with one of them had ensued. “This appears to be a site that we will need to pay attention to,” Peck wrote to Reynolds.

“We have all been accused of ‘not caring,' which of course is not true,” Peck added. “It does appear, however, with the activity I observed tonight, that we are dealing with more than four simple dwellings. This appears to be more than a homeowner with a security fetish.”

In a September 11, 2024, email to Jonathan Lait, Palo Alto's director of planning and development services and Palo Alto city attorney Molly Stump, one of Zuckerberg's neighbors alleged that since 2021, “despite numerous neighborhood complaints” to the city of Palo Alto, including “multiple code violation reports,” the school had continued to grow. They claimed that a garage at the property had been converted into another classroom, and that an increasing number of children were arriving each day. Lait and Stump did not respond to a request to comment.

“The addition of daily traffic from the teachers and parents at the school has only exacerbated an already difficult situation,” they said in the email, noting that the neighborhood has been dealing with an “untenable traffic” situation for more than eight years.

They asked the city to conduct a formal investigation into the school on Zuckerberg's property, adding that their neighbors are also “extremely concerned” about the school, and “are willing to provide eyewitness accounts in support of this complaint.”

Over the next week, another neighbor forwarded this note to all six Palo Alto city council members, as well as then mayor Stone. One of these emails described the situation as “serious” and “untenable.”

“We believe the investigation should be swift and should yield a cease and desist order,” the neighbor wrote.

Lait responded to the neighbor who sent the original complaint on October 15, claiming that he'd had an “initial call” with a “representative” of the property owners and that he was directing the city's code enforcement staff to reexamine the property.

On December 11, 2024, the neighbor claimed that since one of their fellow neighbors had spoken to a Zuckerberg representative, and the representative had allegedly admitted that there was a school on the property, “it seems like an open and shut case.”

“Our hope is that there is an equal process in place for all residents of Palo Alto regardless of wealth or stature,” the neighbor wrote. “It is hard to imagine that this kind of behavior would be ignored in any other circumstance.”

That same day, Lait told Christine Wade, a partner at SSL Law Firm—who, in an August 2024 email thread, said she was “still working with” the Zuckerberg family—that the Zuckerbergs lacked the required permit to run a school in a residential zone.

“Based on our review of local and state law, we believe this use constitutes a private school use in a residential zone requiring a conditional use permit,” Lait wrote in an email to Wade. “We also have not found any state preemptions that would exclude a use like this from local zoning requirements.” Lait added that a “next step,” if a permit was not obtained, would be sending a cease and desist to the property owner.

According to several emails, Wade, Lait, and Mark Legaspi, CEO of the Zuckerberg family office called West 10, went on to arrange an in-person meeting at City Hall on January 9. (This is the first time that the current name of the Zuckerberg family office, West 10, has been publicly disclosed. The office was previously called West Street.) Although WIRED did not obtain notes from the meeting, Lait informed the neighbor on January 10 that he had told the Zuckerbergs' “representative” that the school would need to shut down if it didn't get a conditional use permit or apply for that specific permit.

Lait added that the representative would clarify what the family planned to do in about a week; however, he noted that if the school were to close, the city may give the school a “transition period” to wind things down. Wade did not respond to a request for comment.

There was another increasingly heated conversation happening behind the scenes. On February 3 of this year, at least one neighbor met with Jordan Fox, an employee of West 10.

It's unclear exactly what happened at this meeting, or if the neighbor who sent the September 11 complaint was in attendance. But a day after the meeting with Fox, two additional neighbours added their names to the September 11 complaint, per an email to Lait.

On February 12, a neighbor began an email chain with Fox. This email was forwarded to Planning Department officials two months later. The neighbor, who seemingly attended the meeting, said they had “connected” with fellow neighbors “to review and revise” an earlier list of 14 requests that had been reportedly submitted to the Zuckerbergs at some previous point. The note does not specify the contents of this original list of requests, but of the 19 neighbors who originally contributed to it, they claimed that 15 had contributed to the revised list.

The email notes that the Zuckerbergs had been “a part of our neighborhood for many years,” and that they “hope that this message will start an open and respectful dialogue,” built upon the “premise of how we all wish to be treated as neighbors.”

“Our top requests are to minimize future disruption to the neighborhood and proactively manage the impact of the many people who are affiliated with you,” the email says. This includes restricting parking by “security guards, contractors, staff, teachers, landscapers, visitors, etc.” In the event of major demolitions, concrete pours, or large parties, the email asks for advance notice, and for dedicated efforts to “monitor and mitigate noise.”

The email also asks the Zuckerbergs to, “ideally stop—but at a minimum give us extended breaks from—the acquisition, demolition and construction cycle to let the neighborhood recover from the last eight years of disruption.”

At this point, the email requests that the family “abide by both the letter and the spirit of Palo Alto” by complying with city code about residential buildings.

Specifically, it asks the Zuckerbergs to get a use permit for the compound's school and to hold “a public hearing for transparency.” It also asks the family to not expand its compound any further. “We hope this will help us get back the quiet, attractive residential neighborhood that we all loved so much when we chose to move here.”

In a follow-up on March 4, Fox acknowledged the “unusual” effects that come with being neighbors with Mark Zuckerberg and his family.

“I recognize and understand that the nature of our residence is unique given the profile and visibility of the family,” she wrote. “I hope that as we continue to grow our relationship with you over time, you will increasingly enjoy the benefits of our proximity—e.g., enhanced safety and security, shared improvements, and increased property values.”

Fox said that the Zuckerbergs instituted “a revised parking policy late last year” that should address their concerns, and promised to double down on efforts to give advanced notice about construction, parties, and other potential disruptions.

However, Fox did not directly address the unpermitted school and other nonresidential activities happening at the compound. She acknowledged that the compound has “residential support staff” including “childcare, culinary, personal assistants, property management, and security,” but said that they have “policies in place to minimize their impact on the neighborhood.”

It's unclear if the neighbor responded to Fox.

While these conversations were happening between Fox and Zuckerberg's neighbors, Lait and others at the city Planning Department were scrambling to find a solution for the neighbor who complained on September 11, and a few other neighbors who endorsed the complaint in September and February.

Starting in February, one of these neighbors took the lead on following up with Lait. They asked him for an update on February 11, and heard back a few days later. He didn't have any major updates, “but after conversations with the family's representatives, he said he was exploring whether a “subset of children” could continue to come to the school sometimes for "ancillary" uses.

“I also believe a more nuanced solution is warranted in this case,” Lait added. Ideally, such a solution would respond to the neighbors' complaints, but allow the Zuckerbergs to “reasonably be authorized by the zoning code.”

The neighbor wasn't thrilled. The next day, they replied and called the city's plan “unsatisfactory.”

“The city's ‘nuanced solution' in dealing with this serial violator has led to the current predicament,” they said (referring to the nuanced solution Lait mentioned in his last email.)

Horrigan-Taylor, the Palo Alto spokesperson, told WIRED that Lait's mention of a “nuanced” solution referred to “resolving, to the extent permissible by law, neighborhood impacts and otherwise permitted use established by state law and local zoning.”

“Would I, or any other homeowner, be given the courtesy of a ‘nuanced solution' if we were in violation of city code for over four years?” they added.

“Please know that you have not earned our trust and that we will take every opportunity to hold the city accountable if your solution satisfies a single [redacted] property owner over the interests of an entire neighborhood,” they continued.

“If you somehow craft a ‘nuanced solution' based on promises,” the neighbor said, “the city will no doubt once again simply disappear and the damage to the neighborhood will continue.”

Lait did not respond right away. The neighbor followed up on March 13, asking if he had “reconsidered” his plan to offer a “‘nuanced solution' for resolution of these ongoing issues by a serial code violator.” They asked when the neighborhood could “expect relief from the almost decade long disruptions.”

Behind the scenes, Zuckerberg's lawyers were fighting to make sure the school could continue to operate. In a document dated March 14, Wade argues that she believed the activities at “the Property” “represent an appropriate residential use based on established state law as well as constitutional principles.”

Wade said that “the Family” was in the process of obtaining a “Large Family Daycare” license for the property, which is legal for a cohort of 14 or fewer children all under the age of 10.

"We consistently remind our vendors, guests, etc. to minimize noise, not loiter anywhere other than within the Family properties, and to keep areas clean,” Wade added in the letter. Wade also attached an adjusted lease corresponding with the address of the illicit school, which promises that the property will be used for only one purpose. The exact purpose is redacted.

On March 25, Lait told the neighbor that the city's June 30 deadline for the Zuckerbergs to shut down the school had not changed. However, the family's representative said that they were pursuing a daycare license. These licenses are granted by the state, not the city of Palo Alto.

The subtext of this email was that if the state gave them a daycare licence, there wasn't much the city could do. Horrigan-Taylor confirmed with WIRED that “state licensed large family day care homes” do not require city approval, adding that the city also “does not regulate homeschooling.”

“Thanks for this rather surprising information,” the neighbor replied about a week later. “We have repeatedly presented ideas to the family over the past 8 years with very little to show for it, so from our perspective, we need to understand the city's willingness to act or not to act.”

Baker told WIRED that the Zuckerbergs never ended up applying for a daycare license, a claim that corresponds with California's public registry of daycare centers. (There are only two registered daycare centers in Palo Alto, and neither belongs to the Zuckerbergs. The Zuckerbergs' oldest child, Maxima, will also turn 10 in December and consequently age out of any daycare legally operating in California.)

Horrigan-Taylor said that a representative for the Zuckerbergs told the city that the family wanted to move the school to “another location where private schools are permitted by right.”

In a school administrator job listing posted to the Association Montessori International website in July 2022 for “BBS,” Bicken Ben head of school Berge claims that the school had four distinct locations, and that applicants must be prepared to travel six to eight weeks per year. The June 2025 job listing also says that the “year-round” school spans “across multiple campuses,” but the main location of the job is listed as Palo Alto. It's unclear where the other sites are located.

Most of the Zuckerbergs' neighbors did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. However, the ones that did clearly indicated that they would not be forgetting the Bicken Ben saga, or the past decade of disruption, anytime soon.

“Frankly I'm not sure what's going on,” one neighbor said, when reached by WIRED via landline. “Except for noise and construction debris.”

Siri, which somehow still stinks, is finally getting a new core AI model, and it's going to be a 1.2 trillion parameter Google Gemini-based LLM, according to Bloomberg Apple reporter Mark Gurman. Until Apple gets its act together on a proprietary AI system, Gurman writes, it will reportedly give Google about $1 billion per year for a temporary fix.

Internally, Apple apparently calls the Google-powered Siri upgrade by the code-name “Linwood,” according to the report, and rather than announcing an exciting AI partnership, Apple regards Google's role in this deal as that of a “behind-the-scenes technology supplier,” Gurman writes.

Apple's AI assistant, released in 2010, has long been a perceived weakness in Apple's mobile software lineup. Even though it has been tweaked since the release of the Apple Intelligence suite, the voice-activated robot voice never became the centerpiece of some futuristic new AI-driven version of the iPhone as Apple once signaled it would. Instead it has come to symbolize Apple's sluggishness in the AI race—mostly perceived as a 15-year-old piece of software that tells you the weather, and says it doesn't understand you or can't help you aside from that.

According to Gurman's past reporting, the upgrade will be in place this coming spring as part of the update to iOS 26.4. This round of changes to Siri will be focused on “personalization,” allowing the assistant “to tap into consumers' personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries.”

According to MacRumors, the upgrade will still involve Apple's proprietary models when queries can be answered with a lower-powered model that runs on the device itself, and there will be privacy measures in place for when Google's software gets involved. “User privacy will be preserved by running the Google models on Apple's server infrastructure without any external data sharing, and on-device personal data will likely be processed using Apple's own Foundation Models,” writes Benjamin Mayo of MacRumors.

Gurman says the switch to Google Gemini will occur when Siri needs to perform complex tasks or summarize information.

Gurman's report, as usual, comes from anonymous leaks, while Apple's formal statement in response to this report notes that the spring release of new Siri features is not something the company has formally announced.

As Gizomodo's James Pero wrote in July of this year, Apple was reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Anthropic about the possibility of powering this Siri upgrade with a GPT or Claude model. Given that the AI announcements in July didn't match what had been previously advertised, it looked like things were “not going as planned.”

Now we have one more data point hinting at what's been going on behind the scenes at Apple's AI workshop. Apple supposedly still intends to develop its own AI system to power some future version of Siri, even as AI staff defections mount—for example, Ke Yang, who was spearheading Apple's in-house chatbot effort, and who left for Meta last month. But in the meantime, it seems a $1 billion-per-year Google Gemini model will do.

A slew of new companies have emerged in recent years offering fresh takes on RVs, like Lightship, Pebble, and Grounded. Now another startup called Evotrex is coming out of stealth with its own twist: a hybrid RV travel trailer with an integrated gas engine.

The new RV will have an onboard battery pack that will power the living quarters, onboard electronics, and an electric motor, but the gas engine will recharge that battery pack and extend its range for far longer than a full charge — potentially making Evotrex's trailer attractive for longer camping trips.

The Evotrex RV will debut at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, but the company detailed some of its plans ahead of that reveal in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.

Using a gas engine to get more out of a big battery pack has become a trendy idea in the automotive world, as carmakers and customers hesitate to transition to fully electric vehicles. In fact, the CEO of startup automaker Scout Motors recently revealed that 80% of the customers who preordered its upcoming vehicles have chosen the hybrid “extended range” powertrain option over the all-electric ones.

Evotrex co-founder Alex Xiao, a former product manager for consumer electronics company Anker, believes the idea will appeal to RV customers and dealers alike.

Xiao told TechCrunch that he and co-founder Stella Qin (another Anker alum) spent seven months researching the RV market before they started building anything. What they found was a customer base that was getting much younger and had the desire to take these kinds of vehicles farther out in the world, far beyond the typical plug-and-stay campsites and RV parks.

These customers “want to bring their gadgets and other equipment on skiing, hunting, fishing, and other activities, and stay in the wild for like four or five days, which is different,” Xiao said. “They're off-grid — off-grid living was not supported before within the RV life.”

To do all that, you need power. 

RV owners are no strangers to gas generators, but Xiao and Qin believe the way they've integrated their engine into the Evotrex trailer offers a number of benefits. They claim it's quieter and more efficient, and they say they're even using the excess heat created to help keep the cabin warm.

Xiao said Evotrex plans to ship the first of its RV trailers by the end of 2026, and it's raised $16 million in seed funding so far from his former employer Anker, as well as Chinese early-stage venture firms Unity Ventures, Kylinhall Partners, and Vision Plus Capital.

Evotrex has about 40 employees so far, Xiao said, with some in China and some in the U.S. Evotrex's CTO formerly led automotive R&D at Chinese automaker Geely Group, and the startup's COO (and a third co-founder) has held supply chain leadership positions at IBM, Lenovo, and Anker.

Xiao said the plan is to do most of the production in China with final assembly in California. Combined with the fact that much of the supply chain for RVs remains in China, he said he's aware that there will be challenges due to the Trump administration's trade policies.

Solving those problems won't be easy, Xiao said. But neither is making a successful RV company from scratch, he added.

“The purpose of this company is to bring those kinds of new experiences to the customer,” Xiao said.

Premium headphones from the likes of Bose, Apple, Sony, and Sonos are always going to be pricey and offer up a combination of audio quality and active noise cancellation that cheaper pairs just can't match. But now, Bose is hurrying to clear out stock of its QuietComfort headphones which means it's knocked down the price from $349 to an incredible $199 (43% off). That puts these flagship cans at less than the price of basic models from competitors, basically rendering every other option obsolete at this price point.

See at Amazon

The QuietComfort line came into prominence due to its industry-leading ANC and this pair is no exception. Bose combines its proprietary ANC technology with passive noise isolation via the over-ear design to create a listening environment that genuinely blocks out chaos. Plush ear cushions create a soft seal that keeps ambient sound at bay while remaining comfortable enough for marathon listening sessions. You can flip between Quiet Mode for full noise cancellation and Aware Mode when you need to stay tuned into your surroundings, like during airport announcements or when someone needs your attention.

With the padded headband distributing weight evenly across your head, these can be worn for hours without the clamping pressure that makes cheaper headphones uncomfortable after 30 minutes. This matters on long flights, during extended work sessions and those days when you just want to disappear into your music for hours on end. The over-ear cushions completely seal your ears, rather than pressing against them and create that studio quality isolation professional musicians rely on.

With a solid 24-hour battery life from a single charge, even those super-long international flights are covered with power to spare. When it's time to recharge, USB-C charging gets you back into the action quickly, where just 15 minutes of charging delivers 2.5 hours of playback. This fast-charging capability can save you should you forget to plug them in overnight and have to head out the door.

Sound quality exceeds what most people would expect from a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Bose provides high-fidelity audio, with deep bass response that doesn't muddy the mids or treble. An adjustable EQ inside the Bose app puts you in complete control of your sound signature, letting you boost the bass for hip-hop, emphasize the mids for vocals, or crank the treble for classical music.

The fact that these QuietComfort headphones are $199, versus $399 for Sony's WH-1000XM5 or $549 for Apple's AirPods Max, nets out to a significantly better value when you consider they provide very similar noise cancellation and sound quality. Bose clearly wants to clear this inventory fast.

Most 10,000mAh power banks feel like a brick in your pocket: They tout portability but deliver bulk that makes you wonder whether it's really worth the hassle. That's where the INIU mini portable charger flips the script completely: This thing is 45% smaller than your average 10,000mAh power bank, which means you actually get true pocket-friendly charging without sacrificing capacity. Right now, Amazon has cut the price from $38 to just $26 which makes this compact powerhouse an absolute steal for anyone tired of carrying around clunky charging bricks.

See at Amazon

But the secret behind this little marvel is Iniu's TinyCell Pro battery technology which packs the same 10,000mAh in a frame almost half as small as the competition. You're getting enough juice in here to charge an iPhone 17 twice over or a Samsung S25 about 1.5 times or even an iPad Mini 1.5 times. For daily commutes, weekend trips, or those long flights when your phone battery seems to drain faster than you can say “low power mode,” this capacity hits the sweet spot between usability and convenience.

But here's the kicker: this tiny charger is capable of a maximum 45W output,which seriously gets you into fast-charging territory. It supports Power Delivery, Quick Charge, and even Samsung Super Fast Charging protocols, so your devices charge at their absolute maximum speeds. That iPhone 16 or Samsung S24 you're carrying will power up just as quickly as it would plugged into the wall. The real party trick, though, is that this mini power bank can actually charge a MacBook Air, delivering 42% battery in just 25 minutes.

The USB-C port handles both input and output at that blazing 45W speed, which means recharging the power bank itself doesn't take forever either. Iniu includes a detachable lanyard cable that's USB-C to USB-C, so you've got a charging cable built right in for maximum convenience. The lanyard design is clever because the cable detaches when you need it for other devices or power banks, making it genuinely useful rather than just a gimmick.

At this price point, you're looking at one of those very rare deals where the discount actually reflects the value you're getting.

A team of scientists at the University of Seville has identified an essential process that protects DNA integrity in reproductive cells, providing new clues about how organisms avoid genetic defects during egg formation.

A recently published study, the result of Nuria Fernández-Fernández's doctoral work, describes how phosphorylation, a chemical modification of the BRC-1/BRD-1 protein complex in the Caenorhabditis elegans worm, acts as a "switch" against DNA damage. This activation allows the genome to repair itself properly during meiosis, the process that gives rise to reproductive cells.When this mechanism fails, the DNA suffers serious breaks, leading to accumulated damage, chromosome fragmentation and loss of embryo viability. The researchers also identified two enzymes, Bloom and Mus81, that contribute to these problems by incorrectly resolving the bonds between damaged DNA molecules.

Our findings reveal a critical step in the cellular response to genetic damage in the germline. Understanding these processes is essential to understanding how aneuploidy and developmental defects are prevented."

Among individuals at high risk for stroke, those who participated in a 10-week primary care program that promoted involvement in everyday activities and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle had a 61% lower likelihood of remaining at high risk at 12 months.

“[The study] results indicate the potential of the [Make My Day] intervention for primary healthcare settings and the potential of a comprehensive lifestyle analysis and formulating realistic individual goals,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Cecilia Johnsson, Division of Occupational Therapy, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on November 02, 2025, in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health.

The intervention group may have been motivated to succeed for both personal benefit and to comply with the study. The sample was largely homogenous, with high education and income levels. Both groups received lifestyle analysis and goals; thus, the control group acted as an active control group.

This study received funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare and the Research School in Health Science at Karolinska Institutet. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Children with atopic dermatitis (AD), commonly known as eczema, may experience fewer infections and allergic complications if they receive the COVID-19 vaccine, according to new research being presented at the 2025 American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting in Orlando.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition driven by the immune system and often precedes the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Children with AD are also at higher risk for infections, including those affecting the skin and respiratory system."

Tristan Nguyen, BS, medical student, lead author of the study

Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study, analyzing 5,758 vaccinated and 5,758 unvaccinated pediatric AD patients, younger than 17 years of age. The subjects were matched for demographics and health history. Children with prior COVID-19 infection or major comorbidities were excluded.

"Our study suggests that COVID-19 vaccination not only protects against coronavirus but may also have broader health benefits for children with atopic dermatitis," said Zhibo Yang, MD, PhD, the principal investigator (PI) of the study. "We found lower rates of both allergic conditions and infections among vaccinated children compared to their unvaccinated peers."

Key findings included:

The findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting vaccination as a valuable tool in protecting children with chronic allergic conditions.

New research presented at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) offers encouraging news for parents of young children with peanut allergies. A long-term study found that a peanut patch treatment – epicutaneous immunotherapy – continued to help toddlers safely build tolerance to peanuts over three years.

The treatment, known as the Viaskin Peanut Patch, delivers small amounts of peanut protein through the skin. The goal is to train the immune system to tolerate peanut exposure and reduce the risk of severe allergic reactions from accidental ingestion.

This new analysis looked at toddlers who originally received placebo in an earlier one-year study and then used the peanut patch for up to three years. After three years of treatment, more than 70% of these children could tolerate the equivalent of at least three to four peanut kernels – a significant improvement from their first year of treatment. Nearly half could tolerate even higher amounts.

Importantly, the treatment continued to show a strong safety record. No cases of treatment-related anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) were reported in the third year. Skin irritation at the patch site – the most common side effect – became less frequent over time. Researchers also found that children's reactions during food challenges became milder, with fewer severe symptoms after three years than after one year.

These results show that ongoing treatment with the peanut patch continues to improve tolerance and remains safe over time. For parents of toddlers with peanut allergies, this kind of approach may one day offer peace of mind by reducing the risk of having an allergic reaction, including severe reactions, from accidental exposure."

Matthew Greenhawt, MD, MBA, allergist, lead author and ACAAI member

Peanut allergy affects about 2% of children in the U.S. and is a leading cause of severe allergic reactions. The study results add to growing evidence that early intervention in young children could help change the course of peanut allergy. Researchers stress that parents should not attempt any form of peanut desensitization at home and should discuss emerging treatment options with a board-certified allergist.

The research was funded by DBV Technologies.

U.S. Veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) face an increased risk of developing several chronic respiratory conditions, according to new research presented at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Orlando.

The large-scale study examined more than 48,000 deployed Veterans compared with a matched group of non-deployed Veterans. Researchers found that deployment was significantly associated with new diagnoses of asthma, chronic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and nasal polyposis (NP) in the decade following service.

Veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were often exposed to airborne hazards such as burn pits and dust storms. We found that these exposures may have long-term health impacts, particularly for respiratory diseases that can affect quality of life for years after service."

Key findings included:

The analysis used data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse and included only Veterans with no prior history of the studied conditions. Each deployed veteran was matched with a non-deployed veteran of similar age, sex, race, and ethnicity.

The median age at deployment was 26.7 years, and the majority of veterans in the study were male (84%) and White (75%).

"These results highlight the importance of long-term health surveillance and specialized care for Veterans who served in OIF and OEF," said Dr. Gleeson. "Recognizing the link between deployment and respiratory disease can help guide medical support, policy, and preventive strategies for those affected."

A new study finds that thunderstorms can trigger sharp increases in asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, underscoring the importance of storm preparedness for people with asthma. The research is being presented at the 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in Orlando.

"Thunderstorm asthma" is a well-documented environmental phenomenon internationally, but studies in United States in areas with heavy pollen have been limited. According to the World Allergy Organization, thunderstorms are considered a risk factor for asthma attacks in patients suffering from pollen allergy.

Researchers analyzed 4,439 asthma-related ER visits across three Wichita, KS hospitals from January 2020 to December 2024. Using meteorologic records, they identified 38 thunderstorm days during this period.

Key findings included:

These results confirm that thunderstorms can pose a serious health risk for people with asthma, even in the United States. Because storms are unpredictable, patients and healthcare providers should include storm-specific precautions in asthma action plans."

Diala Merheb, MD, lead author of the study

The researchers note that storm-related surges in asthma cases place a significant burden on emergency departments. By recognizing the connection between thunderstorms and asthma exacerbations, communities and healthcare systems can develop preparedness strategies to protect vulnerable populations and reduce strain on hospitals.

Says allergist Selina Gierer, DO, ACAAI member and one of the study authors, "If you or your child has asthma, it's smart to think about thunderstorms the same way you prepare for high-pollen days or cold weather. "Understanding triggers and having a clear plan can help avoid emergency room visits."

A nationwide study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has found that adolescents who experience migraines are three times more likely to have high blood pressure. The research, which analyzed data from over two million Israeli teens, revealed that the link was strongest among those with severe or frequent migraines. The findings suggest that early blood pressure screening for teens with migraines could help detect cardiovascular risks before they develop into chronic disease.

A massive Israeli study tracking over 2 million adolescents has uncovered a striking connection between migraine headaches and high blood pressure—conditions rarely studied together in young people. The research, conducted by scientists at The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center , reveals that teens diagnosed with migraines were three times more likely to have hypertension than their peers, suggesting that what may seem like "just headaches" could signal deeper vascular issues.

The study analyzed medical records from Israel's national pre-military health screenings between 1990 and 2019, covering adolescents aged 16 to 20. Among more than 61,000 teens diagnosed with migraines, nearly 1 in 150 also had hypertension, compared to 1 in 500 among those without migraines. The link held strong even after accounting for factors like age, gender, body mass index, and socioeconomic background.

What stood out most was the severity connection: adolescents with severe migraines were over four times more likely to have high blood pressure than those with mild or no headaches. Similarly, cases of severe hypertension were more common among those with frequent or disabling migraines.

Migraine is often dismissed as a temporary neurological complaint. But our findings suggest it may also serve as a marker for early vascular dysfunction—meaning these young people could be at higher cardiovascular risk long before adulthood."

Prof. Ronit Calderon-Margalit from the Hebrew University's Faculty of Medicine, one of the study's senior authors

The study, published in Hypertension, is the largest of its kind to examine this relationship in adolescents using verified medical diagnoses rather than self-reported symptoms. Previous research mostly focused on adults, leaving a gap in understanding how these conditions interact during youth—when prevention can make the biggest difference.

While the findings don't prove that migraines cause high blood pressure, the researchers emphasize the importance of screening adolescents with migraines for early signs of hypertension. Identifying elevated blood pressure early could help prevent long-term complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage later in life.

The results also raise intriguing biological questions: both migraines and hypertension involve the body's vascular system, and recent genetic studies have pointed to shared pathways influencing blood vessel function and inflammation.

For parents and teens, the takeaway is clear—don't ignore frequent or severe headaches. They may be more than a passing pain.

Despite higher awareness of caffeine's dangers, new research shows that university students, including future doctors, keep reaching for energy drinks to power through their studies.

Study: Energy Drink Knowledge, Consumption, and Regulation Support Among Polish Medical and Non-Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study. Image credit: New Africa/Shutterstock.com

Young adults commonly consume energy drinks (ED), despite the association with high-risk behaviors. A recent study published in Nutrients explores the effect of health education on knowledge about EDs, their consumption, and their attitudes towards them, as well as towards ED sales regulation for minors.

EDs comprise an expanding segment of the global beverage market, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Not only are they widely available, but they are also heavily marketed, making them extremely attractive to this age group. In addition, EDs are most frequently consumed by males and physically active people.

If ingestion starts in youth, ED use may persist and has been associated with poor dietary patterns and the use of other substances, including smoking and alcohol. ED consumption is also associated with palpitations. These effects are often overlooked by marketers, who focus instead on improvements in cognitive and physical performance.

Unmarried people and non-medical students are also at a higher risk for ED consumption. Heavy academic workloads also play a role, with students preferring to use EDs to fight fatigue and maintain alertness. Most university students have mixed feelings about energy drinks and a limited understanding of their potential risks. 

Polish studies indicate high public awareness of these dangers, and public demand for ED sales to be prohibited for minors. Poland has therefore enacted the 2023 amendment to the Public Health Act, which regulates the sale and distribution of ED at the national level. It became operational on January 1, 2024.

This amendment makes it illegal to sell EDs to minors and to distribute EDs in schools or through vending machines. It officially defines EDs and requires that they be clearly labeled. This aims to promote consumer awareness and promote effective enforcement of the amendment.

The current study aimed to evaluate the consumption of EDs and attitudes towards them among Mazovian students in Poland.

The study included 871 students, approximately 42% of whom were medical students. They were asked to fill out an online survey on ED consumption, their knowledge of ED, and their attitudes towards regulation. The students were primarily female, with an average age of 22 years.

About 75% of students consumed EDs once in a while, while the rest were never-users. Approximately 14% each had EDs two or three times a week, once a month, or less than once every three months, respectively. About 9% consumed EDs almost every day. There was no statistically significant difference in consumption frequency between medical and non-medical students.

Only a third of students knew the recommended daily limit of caffeine consumption, with 35% stating they had no idea. Medical students were more likely to answer this correctly.

Knowledge of what goes into EDs was greater among medical students. This group was aware that EDs contained simple sugars, B vitamins, L-carnitine, and electrolytes. Even so, they were no more likely than nonmedical students to identify the presence of caffeine, ginseng, artificial colorants, and taurine in EDs.

Medical students were better informed about the ill effects of ED, including nausea, dizziness, and irritability.

Both medical and non-medical students had the same frequency of ED consumption, despite the former group having superior knowledge. Medical students were more likely to use coffee as well as EDs.

Males were more likely to consume EDs than females, reflecting a broader societal pattern. Almost all ED consumers self-reported disrupted sleep, and 95% said they experienced self-reported elevated blood pressure, while over 90% reported anxiety and irritability. Between 40% and 60% self-reported feeling dizzy or nauseous, vomiting, or decreased coordination.

Both groups had similar patterns of use for alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or psychoactive drugs, as well as taking dietary supplements. Adverse effects were also similarly reported in both groups.

The most common age of first trying EDs was between 15 and 18 years, but 30% said they had their first ED before the age of 15 years. Among medical students, 41% and 42% had their first ED at 15-18 years, and before 15 years, respectively.  Conversely, 59% and 58% of non-medical students showed this pattern, respectively.

Factors prompting ED use included the need for more energy, which was relevant for 63% of students. The need for more concentration accounted for 37%; a similar proportion drank it for the taste; and 32% used EDs as a substitute for coffee. The use of EDs for energy and concentration was more pronounced among medical students. A smaller proportion drank them as part of a social group.

This marks medical and associated professionals as high-risk groups for ED consumption and could underline the need for stronger regulation of the advertising of EDs and other caffeinated beverages. This step may reduce their exposure to these advertisements. Coupled with their heightened awareness of the negative aspects of these drinks, this could lead to a decrease in their consumption among young people.

Both groups supported the legal prohibition protecting minors from EDs. Female students were more often in favor of not selling ED to minors, and supported restrictions on ED advertising, but most students did not believe a ban could be enforced in the real world.

Medical students knew more about the composition and adverse effects of EDs, but did not reduce their use of EDs compared to non-medical students. Health education on the importance of avoiding unsafe caffeine consumption is crucial in preventing excessive caffeine use by medical students, who often seek to overcome fatigue associated with shift work.

Medical students are likely to become responsible for counseling patients with lifestyle disorders and advising them to cease behaviors such as consuming caffeinated drinks. These results highlight the significance of this issue in the field of education.

Combining targeted education with stronger enforcement could enhance the impact of regulatory policies and reduce risky consumption among young adults.

Children with a family history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased risk of developing the disease. However, children born to mothers with T1D are less likely to develop the disease than those whose fathers or siblings have T1D. A new study published in Nature Metabolism has identified distinct blood methylome changes in children exposed to maternal T1D. Some of these changes were related to reduced islet autoimmunity development, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may underlie the protection against islet autoimmunity. The work is a collaboration between Helmholtz Munich, the Global Platform for the Prevention of Autoimmune Diabetes (GPPAD), and the TU Dresden University of Technology.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the body's own insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas, leaving patients with a lifelong dependency on external insulin. Children whose parents or siblings have type 1 diabetes have an 8- to 15-fold increased risk of developing the autoimmune disease themselves. However, this risk is not evenly distributed: the child of a mother with type 1 diabetes has a lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes than a child with a father or sibling with type 1 diabetes. Of interest, genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes has been shown to be comparable between the offspring of mothers and the offspring of fathers with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, researchers suspected that early-life epigenetic programming may be a key mechanism through which maternal type 1 diabetes confers a protective effect.

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation determine which genes are ultimately read and expressed. By changing DNA methylation patterns, environmental influences in the womb such as smoking by the mother, medical conditions, stress, or diet can have far-reaching effects on a child's health by switching genes on or off in the early life period and later in life. Hence, specific environmental conditions in the womb of a mother with type 1 diabetes, the so-called intrauterine environment, may influence the child's risk for islet autoimmunity through epigenetic modifications.

We observed DNA methylation changes at multiple type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes in children born to mothers with type 1 diabetes." 

Prof. Sandra Hummel, researcher at the Helmholtz Munich Institute for Diabetes Research and last author of the study

Her team investigated how maternal type 1 diabetes influences the child's epigenome. In a new epigenome-wide association study, they identified that maternal type 1 diabetes is associated with specific epigenetic marks in the form of DNA methylation in the child. These changes appear to affect the expression of several genes involved in immune function.

The researchers examined blood samples from 1,752 children at around two years of age from the BABYDIAB, BABYDIET, and POInT cohorts. All children included had an increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. They compared DNA methylation patterns of 790 children with and 962 children without a mother affected by type 1 diabetes to identify differences linked to maternal diabetes.

"Our study identified numerous differentially methylated genetic locations, predominantly in the HOXA gene cluster and the MHC region in offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes. The MHC region is known to confer the major genetic susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. We observed that the epigenomic changes in these children were associated with the expression of 15 type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes," explains Dr. Raffael Ott, lead scientist at the Institute of Diabetes Research and first author of the study.

Using 34 differentially methylated positions at type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci that best reflected exposure to maternal type 1 diabetes, the researchers created a methylation propensity score. Testing this score in children without a mother with type 1 diabetes, they found that those who developed islet autoimmunity had significantly lower scores, indicating less protective epigenetic modification. These findings suggest that environmental factors may modulate the risk of islet autoimmunity through epigenetic changes to key susceptibility genes.

In a following project led by Sandra Hummel, the researchers will take a closer look at the relative protection of children born to mothers with type 1 diabetes. Together with Prof. Ezio Bonifacio and colleagues from the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden at the TU Dresden University of Technology, the team aims to identify which type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes are epigenetically modulated by maternal type 1 diabetes and whether similar epigenetic effects occur in children born to mothers with gestational diabetes.

In collaboration with further Helmholtz Munich researchers, the project will also explore potential protein and metabolomic biomarkers linked to DNA methylation patterns and how these molecular changes contribute to protection against islet autoimmunity. To this end, they will analyze bio-samples collected within GPPAD trials, the BABYDIAB and the BABYDIET cohorts, and the Fr1da study. The project is supported by a grant of over 550,000 USD from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust.

The rise in virtual research since the COVID-19 pandemic has created opportunities for researchers to expand and diversify clinical trials, but it has also opened up avenues for fraudulent participation in these studies. A new study led by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researchers directed by Michael Stein, chair and professor of the Department of Health Law, Policy & Management (HLPM) at BUSPH, provides a comprehensive checklist of indicators that researchers can utilize to quickly identify suspicious behavior and prevent fraudulent actors from enrolling in online studies and compromising valuable data.

The most effective way to prevent this fraudulent activity is to implement a combination of automated and manual actions during the prescreening, screening, and enrollment process, according to the report published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. 

In addition to automated fraud detection methods, the study suggests that researchers should utilize a checklist of precautions to spot, along with videoconferencing and photo identification requests from participants during the screening process. These actions can reveal fraudulent actors-who are largely driven by financial gain from research compensation-before the actual enrollment process begins.

Modest financial remuneration is a cornerstone of most studies, important for recognizing participants' time and effort, while also helping to boost engagement and retention. However, as compensated research opportunities expand in the online setting, so too do opportunities for fraudulent participation, from participants misrepresenting their eligibility or enrolling multiple times, to automated bots attempting to complete online surveys. As online research becomes more prevalent, it is essential for investigators to be vigilant and design their digital studies with fraud prevention in mind."

Kara Magane, study corresponding author, senior director of research operations in HLPM at BUSPH

Digital recruitment is especially valuable because it allows researchers to collect data among populations that are underrepresented or difficult to reach through traditional in-person methods.

"Online research has lowered barriers to participating in research, particularly for people with stigmatized diagnoses, such as HIV," says study lead author Robert Siebers, an HLPM research coordinator at BUSPH at the time of the study. "Allowing participants to remain in their own home ensures higher levels of privacy and comfort that in-person research cannot. Without proper guardrails, fraudulent participation can arise due to the ability to more easily misrepresent one's identity online."

In the study, the researchers and colleagues from BU's College of Arts and Sciences, Tufts Medical Center, and the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University describe the team's own experience with fraudulent participants when screening and enrolling people with HIV into two linked online trials: "Integrated Telehealth Intervention to Reduce Chronic Pain" and "Unhealthy Drinking Among People Living With HIV." The randomized trials were conducted through the Boston ARCH Comorbidity Center in 2023 and 2024. After a research assistant noticed during a videoconference screening that a participant appeared to be wearing a wig and resembled another person who had been interviewed days prior, the team discovered that 10 fraudulent participants had enrolled in the trials, and they quickly disenrolled them at an early stage. The team created a checklist of precautions to refer to during each stage of the selection process moving forward, and was able to detect 37 additional fraudulent participants during the screening process. They evaluated their enrollment protection methods six months later and found no new fraudulent actors participating in their trials.

Some of the suspicious behavior that researchers should look for during the prescreening process include similar patterns in email addresses (such as those that use multiple numbers), zip codes that do not correspond to the participant's home state, or other details that seem unusually similar, such as the same level of physical activity among multiple participants. During the screening portion, the team says researchers should also investigate participants who enroll multiple times, provide predictable responses or swift answers to questions that typically require thought, or have similar accents or patterns of speech to participants previously identified as fraudulent. In their trials, the team modified the study protocol to allow phone screenings to take place on camera so that they could monitor participants' appearance and other suspicious behavior, such as muting their microphone frequently after each question. 

During baseline interviews on video, the team recommends that researchers ask-but not mandate-that participants show photo identification on the screen.

"Ensuring participant comfort and privacy is of utmost importance for all researchers, but particularly in research that involves stigmatized populations or diagnoses," Siebers says. "Requesting, but not requiring, a photo ID in our study was a key flexibility that allowed us to be respectful of participant privacy concerns while ensuring we had the opportunity to verify someone's true identity when needed." They also did not request electronic copies of IDs, he adds. 

Automated methods, such as IP address identification systems and bot detection tools, can also be effective at identifying fraudulent activity in the earliest stages of the selection process, but these methods often require financial or technological resources that may not be available to all researchers.

The team also recommends that researchers coordinate with their institution's Institutional Review Board (IRB), committees that ensure that human research is ethical and compliant with regulations.

"IRBs and funding agencies can play an important role by recognizing fraud prevention as an integral part of research workflows, particularly for online studies," Magane says. "They can encourage researchers to include fraud detection and prevention plans in their study protocols, and allocate appropriate resources for these efforts within study budgets. They can also provide clear guidance and support around recognizing and responding to research participation fraud."

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and all precautions should be tailored to each study design, the researchers say.

"As a community of researchers, I'm not sure we have a grip on how much virtual research involves fraudulent participants and therefore how much published data might be tainted," says Stein, senior author author of the study. "What we unexpectedly and unfortunately learned as researchers was that from the moment of planning an online study through the participant recruitment phase, researchers need to be alert to the possibility that bad actors-and I mean that literally-can ruin the reliability of their findings. Fraud protection may need to be described in all published fully virtual studies going forward."

Medical and scientific evidence is proving invaluable in holding public authorities accountable for the impact of unlawful air pollution on people's health, say experts in The BMJ's climate issue today.

Gaia Lisi and Rupert Stuart-Smith at the University of Oxford say that relatively few studies attributing health impacts to climate change have been published so far, but as this research field matures, methods are becoming more widely recognised, opening up new routes for climate accountability.

They describe recent cases where medical and scientific evidence has been used to defend human rights to health.

For example, in the UK, the inquest into the death of 9-year-old Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah concluded that exposure to high levels of air pollution contributed materially to her death, while in a case against Italy, the European Court of Human Rights used peer reviewed research to establish a "real and imminent risk" to life.

Similarly, in a series of civil liability cases in France, medical evidence was used to prove causal links between short term peaks in air pollution and aggravation of respiratory symptoms in children.

And they say scientific evidence demonstrating the human health consequences of climate change is likely to assume greater importance in lawsuits in national, regional, and international forums following recent advisory opinions on climate change by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and International Court of Justice saying that states have specific duties to protect the health of individuals from life threatening effects of climate change.

In lawsuits concerning environmental pollution, they also point out that medical experts have had a key role in helping courts understand the protections needed to uphold health related laws, be it through conducting research underpinning legal arguments and judicial decisions, acting as expert witnesses, or providing third party evidence.

"Improved understanding of the health consequences of climate change could have a similar effect, clarifying the extent to which states are meeting their legal obligations to protect health, and opening up routes for climate justice where they fall short," they conclude.

In a linked article, Laura Clarke at ClientEarth and Hugh Montgomery at University College London, say these landmark court decisions mean that big emitters, both states and companies, can no longer feign ignorance about the impacts of their activities.

"As attribution science strengthens further, we expect to see more class actions and damages claims brought by climate affected communities which, when they scale, will change the calculations and business models of big emitters," they add.

They suggest that health professionals can help in characterising and appropriately attributing cause of deaths and disease resulting from the direct and indirect impacts of climate change, such as the direct health consequences of heatwaves on kidney and heart disease, or reproductive health.

However, attribution to socioeconomic impacts will require the development of new models, they note.

Medical professionals can also drive action by helping to support legal interventions where those responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions are wilfully indifferent or unresponsive, they add.

"If we are to make progress on emissions, action will require holding big polluters to account through the courts. Medical professionals, everywhere, should play their part in this process," they conclude.

The world's largest collection of curated eye imaging and linked clinical data is expanding across the country, in an initiative led out of Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL (University College London).

The INSIGHT Health Data Research Hub for Eye Health and Oculomics is benefiting from investment funding of £3.7 million awarded by UKRI Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).

INSIGHT will expand from Moorfields Eye Hospital and create a blueprint for linking NHS sites across the country, supporting research, improving patient care, and fostering innovation in eye health.

As part of a four-year programme of work delivered through Moorfields Eye Hospital's strategic partnership with the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, INSIGHT will on-board NHS sites including Sunderland Eye Infirmary, one of the UK's largest regional centres for ophthalmology, working in collaboration with South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and North East North Cumbria Secure Data Environment.

INSIGHT will also broaden national data linkages and integrate genetic data from the NIHR BioResource and UK Biobank to accelerate oculomics research, which uses biomarkers in the eye to detect systemic conditions such as dementia and cardiovascular disease.

Patient and public representatives will play a central role, working with project leads to embed standards for data access and governance, address risks of bias in artificial intelligence, and ensure equitable benefits for underserved communities.

The enhanced INSIGHT research data platform will grow from over 30 million images - currently more ophthalmic data than the top three centres in the US combined - to some 50 million images, consolidating the UK as the global leader in ophthalmology and oculomics research and innovation.

INSIGHT Director Professor Pearse Keane (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital) said: "This funding allows us to expand INSIGHT from Moorfields Eye Hospital into a truly national resource, with significant benefits for clinical research and public health. Ophthalmology is the busiest NHS speciality, increasingly under pressure as patient need grows. By providing a comprehensive, interoperable research resource for ophthalmic data, we can help to accelerate research discoveries, bring new treatments to patients faster, and ultimately reduce the burden of sight-threatening disease in the UK and globally."

The potential of NHS data to improve patient outcomes and tackle health inequalities is immense. We are proud that the INSIGHT Hub has led the way in harnessing routinely collected NHS eye imaging data for medical research, demonstrating how patient data can be optimised for research in a safe and secure way, involving patients and members of the public in decision-making. With this grant funding, we anticipate entering an exciting new phase in the Hub's development, supporting the UK's ambitions as a global leader in healthcare technology."

Peter Ridley, CEO, Moorfields Eye Hospital

The award is one of five announced by UKRI MRC and the NIHR to enhance biomedical and health-related data and digital platform resources in the UK, following a UKRI call published last year.

A Weill Cornell Medicine investigator and other members of a technical advisory group to the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund have outlined measures that nations can take to ensure that children's health is accounted for within climate change goals. The authors discuss concrete and achievable indicators in a commentary published Oct. 1 in The Lancet Planetary Health.

Children have specific needs that often get overlooked. We're making sure that doesn't happen."

Dr. Ilan Cerna-Turoff, lead author, assistant professor of epidemiology in emergency medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine

The topic is particularly relevant as world leaders gather for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) in Belém, Brazil to discuss how to measure their countries' progress toward adapting to climate change.

"When they met at COP28 in November of 2023, world leaders made very broad commitments, but they didn't have concrete indicators for measuring progress," Dr. Cerna-Turoff said, "and how are you going to keep to your commitments without metrics?"

To rectify the situation, the United Nations, government representatives, regional governance bodies and civil society groups proposed a list of candidate indicators to assess progress, totaling 5,339 distinct indicators related to the impacts of climate change. "It was an enormous list," Dr. Cerna-Turoff said, "that covered multiple domains of health and wellbeing but did not have an explicit focus on child health."

Dr. Cerna-Turoff and the co-authors identified six indicators from the original list pertinent to child health, which could be measured in at least 50% of countries globally. To those six, they suggested 11 additional standardized indicators, making a total of 17. The final list spans childhood mortality rates to metrics related to nutrition and vaccination coverage. Dr. Cerna-Turoff and the co-authors are advocating for signatories to the Paris Agreement to adopt these 17 indicators at COP30.

Whether signatories to the Paris Agreement adopt all 17 indicators or chart a separate course, Dr. Cerna-Turoff thinks that increasing standardized measurement makes global child health data more readily available, which supports other targets, like the Sustainable Development Goals, and opens valuable opportunities to analyze how the climate change agenda is influencing child health. Combining communicable disease data with information about flooding or heat, for instance, "could pinpoint the specific effects of these weather systems on health outcomes," he said. He further hopes the specificity of the data will increase, disaggregating children by age and economic status, for instance, so global leaders can make sure they are protecting the most vulnerable.

Ultimately, Dr. Cerna-Turoff hopes to see signatories to the Paris Agreement include children in assessing progress and impact of climate adaptation on health. "Children ultimately will inherit the world that we create today, and we can't afford to leave the youngest members of our society behind," he said.

A new study conducted by University Hospitals Connor Whole Health highlights the impact of pediatric integrative medicine services. This unique self-governed program, operating within UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, integrates complementary therapies – such as lifestyle interventions, supplements, herbal medicine, cognitive strategies, and bodywork therapies – alongside conventional medical practices. The study describes how this combined approach can help address gaps in care for pediatric patients with complex conditions.

The U.S. pediatric population is experiencing a rise in chronic illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and mental health issues – including those associated with social media. Pediatric integrative medicine is emerging as a promising solution. However, the published landscape describing how these services are implemented, and which pediatric patients are served by integrative medicine, remains limited in scope. The UH Connor Whole Health Pediatrics Program (UH CWHP) was initiated in 2020 as a physician-led service with broad service integration, addressing demands for comprehensive care. This study examined patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment strategies utilized within UH CWHP.

This retrospective study reviewed 2,677 outpatient UH CWHP visits among 657 patients from March 2020 to September 2023. Among those patients, common conditions included anxiety (59.2%), fatigue (44.4%), headache (43.1%), abdominal pain (33.6%), constipation (33.0%), and long-COVID (24.7%). Frequently recommended interventions included dietary changes (61.8%), self-care (33.8%), massage (21.0%), and acupuncture (19.2%). Supplements often suggested were probiotics (49.9%), vitamin D (42.6%), multivitamins (41.9%), and fish oil (39.4%).

The study revealed that many patients with anxiety preferred non-drug treatments and were receptive to learning new coping skills such as cognitive reframing, breathing techniques, dietary modifications, and management of inner dialogs. Patients valued insights from Traditional Chinese Medicine, and about 30 percent utilized Chinese herbal treatment. Those with anxiety related to long-COVID often required additional treatments (e.g., antihistamines). For fatigue related to long-COVID and for many patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, pacing and low dose naltrexone were key interventions.

Dietary interventions and nutritional management focused on realistic, family-friendly shifts toward nutrient rich, minimally processed foods. Probiotics were prescribed in subgroups of patients showing dysbiosis commonly linked to diet and antibiotics. Approximately 30 percent of patients presented with vitamin D deficiency. Also, patients exhibiting seasonal mood imbalances were prescribed light therapy as a helpful non-drug treatment.

Moreover, this study found that myofascial pain was often overlooked before UH CWHP visits. Treatment focused on teaching patients myofascial self-care techniques to manage pain and reduce reliance on medication. Gua Sha, a Traditional Chinese Medicine technique, was frequently used and taught for home pain management. In addition, sleep disruptions and insomnia were common with contributing factors including screen use before bed and inconsistent routines. Support included sleep education, referral to sleep medicine, melatonin, Chinese herbal treatments, and management of iron deficiency.

"Pediatric Integrative Medicine can fill key service gaps in existing health systems, particularly in regards to offering nonpharmacologic pain control methods and emotional regulation strategies. It can also serve complex populations such as patients with long-COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome who do not otherwise have a home within the medical system," said David W. Miller, MD, FAAP, L.Ac., Dipl. OM, Principal Investigator of the study, Medical Director of Pediatric Integrative Medicine, and the Françoise Adan, MD, Endowed Director in Connor Whole Health Leadership. "Patients value care that includes diet and lifestyle modification as well, and appreciate the integration of herbal medicine alongside conventional care approaches. Working with a trained physician helps patients understand what is safe and likely effective, and helps in navigating the vast information available on the internet."

The whole health model of care provides a framework to understand what matters most to our patients. This study demonstrates the variety of integrative and lifestyle strategies that can be implemented to improve the health of our pediatric patients."

Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a pioneering method to mend damaged hearts without open-heart surgery, an advance that could one day transform the treatment of heart failure. 

The new approach uses lab-grown heart tissue made from reprogrammed adult stem cells, delivered through a tiny incision rather than a surgically opened chest cavity. In preclinical testing, the stem cell patch restored heart function and improved healing.

For patients with severe heart failure, there are very few options beyond mechanical pumps or transplants. We hope this approach will offer a new way to repair their own hearts."

Wuqiang Zhu, Ph.D., senior author of the study published in Acta Biomaterialia and cardiovascular researcher, Mayo Clinic, Arizona

Heart attacks remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, oxygen-starved cells die and are replaced by scar tissue that cannot contract or conduct electrical signals - weakening the heart's ability to pump blood.

"The adult human heart doesn't regenerate once those cells are lost," Dr. Zhu explains. "That's why heart failure, especially chronic heart failure due to the loss of functional cardiac muscle, is often difficult to treat; the muscle simply can't repair itself."

For years, scientists have been working on ways to replace damaged tissue with healthy heart cells derived from stem cells. Early efforts showed promise, but most required open-heart surgery - a procedure too risky for many patients already struggling with severe heart failure.

Scientists have long hoped that stem cells could provide a way to rebuild what the body cannot. By reprogramming ordinary adult cells such as skin or blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers can coax them into becoming replacement heart cells.

But safely and effectively delivering engineered heart tissues made from these cells has remained a major challenge.

In collaboration with engineers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Mayo researchers developed a flexible, paper-thin patch made of nano- and microfibers coated with gelatin. This hybrid scaffold supports a blend of human heart muscle cells, blood vessel cells and fibroblasts-cells that form the tissue's structural framework-to create a living, beating piece of heart tissue. Before transplantation, the tissue is infused with bioactive factors such as fibroblast growth factor 1 and CHIR99021 that encourage the growth of new blood vessels and help the cells survive once they are in place.

"The beauty of this design," says Dr. Zhu, "is that it can be folded like a piece of paper, loaded into a slender tube, and delivered precisely where it's needed through a small incision in the chest. Once in place, it unfolds and adheres naturally to the heart's surface."

Instead of using stitches, the team used a biocompatible surgical adhesive that holds the patch in place while minimizing additional trauma to the surrounding tissue.

Testing in preclinical models showed that the minimally invasive method improved heart function, reduced scarring, enhanced vascular growth and lessened inflammation compared with conventional approaches.

"Our results show that these engineered tissues not only survive but actually help the heart heal itself," says Dr. Zhu. "That's the ultimate goal: to replace what's lost and restore function."

The research aligns closely with Mayo Clinic's Genesis Initiative, which aims to accelerate discoveries that restore or regenerate human organs and tissues.

"Genesis is about pioneering new ways to repair and rebuild the human body," Dr. Zhu says. "What we're doing here is exactly that - using regenerative science and minimally invasive delivery to give the heart a chance to recover."

Currently, more than 4,000 heart transplants are performed in the United States each year, while thousands more patients die waiting for a donor organ. Dr. Zhu hopes this technology could eventually offer another option.

"Our vision," he says, "is that patients could one day receive engineered heart tissue made from their own reprogrammed cells, delivered through a minimally invasive procedure - no donor organ, no long recovery, just a repaired heart."

The Mayo Clinic team plans to advance this work through larger-scale preclinical testing to ensure the therapy's safety and effectiveness before moving to human clinical trials, a process that Dr. Zhu estimates could take five years or more.

"Heart failure remains a devastating condition," he says. "If we can make stem cell treatment accessible to more patients, especially those too fragile for open-heart surgery, we could save lives."

After expected triumph in the Conference League, Maresca led the Blues to glory in the United States with arguably their best performance of the season in the final.

Despite facing Champions League holders PSG, Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro inspired Chelsea to a 3-0 victory in the final game of the extended season.

Maresca's gain in the 2024/25 season was Mauricio Pochettino's loss after the Argentine had failed to deliver a trophy or Champions League qualification.

Despite not being present to see some of his foundations turn into glory, there are no sour grapes from the former Blues boss, who remains adamant Chelsea very much earned their win in the final.

He said: “Chelsea was a fair winner, that is your question? Yes, yes. I think they were better than Paris Saint-Germain in that game. That showed that in a short period of tournament, how important it is to arrive in a good form.

“And I think Chelsea was a fair winner.”

It remains to be seen if Chelsea's victory in the first edition of the new format of the Club World Cup will see them automatically qualify for the 2029 version.

With Chelsea players earning £350,000 for winning the competition, they will be hoping they have the opportunity to defend their crown in four years' time.

It was reported that Chelsea hadn't given their players suitable time off following the Club World Cup, due to how soon after the new Premier League season got underway.

With the limited time off, the Blues were always going to be prone to injury issues, and have been severely impacted in the new campaign.

Levi Colwill suffered an ACL injury on the first day of pre-season, and issues to Liam Delap, Cole Palmer and Romeo Lavia have continued to plague them for prolonged periods in the new season.

Victory at the Club World Cup was clearly a high point for the Blues, however the ramifications it has had on their new season are clear to see.

United States men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino explained what he meant when he recently discussed that he is "missing" the Premier League.

Pochettino spent the bulk of his managerial career in the Premier League before being named the USMNT's head coach in September 2024. He specifically made a name for himself with Tottenham, where he spent five years between 2014 and 2019, leading the club to a Champions League final appearance.

"The Premier League is the best league in the world," Pochettino told the BBC. "Of course I am missing it. I am so happy in America, but also thinking one day to come back to the Premier League. It's the most competitive league."

Pochettino was asked about those comments while speaking with reporters on Thursday following the release of the Americans' 25-player roster for two upcoming 2026 World Cup tune-up matches against Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa. 

"For me, the Premier League is the best league in the world," Pochettino repeated. "I was involved for 12 years in different clubs like Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea. And it's normal to miss the good times when you spent very good times in someplace. 

"Maybe if you ask me in five years, or maybe I extend the contract [with U.S. Soccer] for another four years in the USA, and then after seven years or six years I move [to another job] and they ask me, ‘Oh, how do you feel about when you were manager of the national team of USA?' [I'd say], ‘Yeah, I miss it because I spent a very good time here.' And when you spend good time [somewhere] you miss that good time."

Pochettino lamented that one of the challenging parts about being an international boss vs. a club coach is the lack of contact with players. His Tottenham team was very close, and he's still getting used to the fact that with the USMNT, the intensity is inherently different because he is not with the players' day in and day out.

"We are going to be spending 10 days in Philadelphia and Tampa and then until March, you cannot be together," Pochettino added. "Yes, you can have contact by phone, [text] message or go visit, but it's never the same as when you are working [every day] and that's what you miss the most. 

"In the way that we work and the way we like to work, how we build our relationship with the player, it is really important to have contact every day. But at the same time, we are learning to build and develop our relationships in a different way. It's never the ideal world, but we will try to evolve as a coaching staff and think of a different strategy to provide the player the possibility to be present even if [there is] distance, and they're in a different environment."

FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) — Hershey native Christian Pulisic will miss the United States' friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay, the next-to-last set of games before coach Mauricio Pochettino calls in players for his pre-World Cup training camp, while Gio Reyna is back on the roster for the first time since March.

Midfielder Weston McKennie and goalkeeper Matt Turner were among the notable omissions from the 25-man roster announced Thursday.

Forward Ricardo Pepi, midfielder Tyler Adams and defenders Joe Scally, John Tolkin and Auston Trusty are back with the 16th-ranked U.S. for the games against No. 39 Paraguay on Nov. 15 at Chester, Pennsylvania, and 15th-ranked Uruguay three days later at Tampa, Florida.

Pulisic injured a hamstring in an Oct. 14 friendly against Australia but AC Milan said he likely will be available for Saturday's Serie A match at Parma. The attacking midfielder is the top American player and drew criticism for skipping the CONCACAF Gold Cup last summer to rest his body ahead of the European season and the World Cup.

Reyna, a son of former captain Claudio Reyna, has played for the U.S. team just once since the 2024 Copa America, appearing as a 69th-minutre sub in the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match loss to Canada. Slowed by a thigh injury following his transfer to Borussia Mönchengladbach, he has been limited to one start and four substitute appearances in the Bundesliga.

Pepi and Trusty are back with the team for the first time since Pochettino's second camp in November. Scally, like Reyna, has not been with the group since the Nations League final four. Adams missed the October games because his wife was due to give birth.

In addition to Pulisic, others missing the matches because they are hurt or recovering from injuries include defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers (Achilles) and Antonee Robinson (knee), winger Tim Weah (thigh), midfielders Malik Tillman (thigh) and Johnny Cardoso (ankle), and goalkeeper Chris Brady (lower body).

If Christian Pulisic leads his country to World Cup glory on home soil in 2026, he might not be the first man to get his hands on the trophy.

Traditionally it is the captain that lifts the trophy at the end of six weeks of intense competition, but USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino might have to yield to a higher power rather than Pulisic, who wears the armband.

Poch is yet to meet with President Donald Trump but has hinted he might have to concede ground if the President decides to pull rank.

The Argentinian tactician joined Ben Jacobs on a special edition of the talkSPORT Daily Podcast to discuss the upcoming tournament, with the draw set to take place in Washington in December.

Trump famously joined the Chelsea squad on stage during the Club World Cup presentation in July.

It caused some confusion at the time, but should Pulisic and the USMNT pull off what would be a famous - and hugely unexpected - victory, there is a plan in place.

"For sure, I will give -- in case we win -- I will give him the trophy and he can lift the trophy," Pochettino said. "For sure, no problem for me."

Trump's new-found love of soccer has yet to see him cross paths with Pochettino but the former Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain manager hopes to change that soon.

"We'll see now in the draw if is the possibility to, to meet him and, and to say hello," he explained. "For sure, it's going to be in Washington. Maybe we will have the opportunity."

Asked what he would say to the Commander in Chief, Poch expressed his gratitude for the support the sport receives.

"In case I meet him, I think I'm going to say, 'Thank you for everything that he's doing for soccer in America and the continuing support.'

"I think that is great because he's showing his support to football and soccer."

Despite boasting stars like captain Pulisic, Fulham defender Antonee Robinson, and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie, the Stars and Stripes will not be among the favorites for a long run in the tournament.

Pochettino - who has been dragged into a row with Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner - was a bold appointment, bringing plenty of pedigree, and his expectations are high.

Jacobs asked what his goal was come next summer -- and suggested nothing short of President Trump holding the trophy aloft.

"It's to win," he said. "Because I come from Argentina and then from Europe and from England and we are so competitive and that is in our blood.

"Also knowing that it's going to be difficult, but I think our mentality is to win every single game and to compete with no fear and thinking that we can beat any team."

Pochettino has won 12 of 20 matches since taking over as manager in 2024, and believes he has been successful in creating a winning culture.

After spells in England with Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, Pochettino continues to be linked with a return to the Premier League, most notably back to Spurs who he memorably led to the Champions League final.

However, his focus is squarely on the ambition for his current role, where wants his players to believe anything is possible.

"With our quality to to try to be intelligent in the way that you build the team and how you are going to compete against these big teams -- talking about Spain, talking about Argentina, talking about England," said the 53-year-old. "I think we can we can be very competitive and create and build a very good team to compete.

"And then winning depends on many factors, but they see the mentality is to win. That is the culture that we are creating in the federation after one year.

"We are so happy about how we are translating this mentality."

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has fired back at Cristiano Ronaldo and urged the club to look to the future, rather than focus on the mistakes made under his regime and those made by previous managers. The United manager has also highlighted the key problem "he cannot allow" to continue holding his team back this season. 

In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo criticised Man Utd's continued struggles, stating the club "don't have a structure" and are "not on a good path". He expressed sadness over the team's decline, despite still loving the club. Ronaldo claimed that Amorim could not perform "miracles" with the current set-up and that some players don't have the right mentality for a club of United's stature. The comments came nearly three years after his explosive 2022 interview with Morgan, which led to his departure.  

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said: "You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have (done) so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary (Neville), Roy Keane, (David) Beckham, they became big players but they had youth. So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the future, present/future, because the potential of the club, it's amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century. 

He added: He's (Amorim) doing his best. What are you going to do? Miracles? Miracles is impossible. We say in Portugal, 'miracles is only in Fatima', and he's not going to do miracles." 

The Miracle of Fatima occurred in Portugal in 1917,  where observers claimed to have seen the sun dance, spin, and appear to fall towards the earth. 

Amorim said: "Of course, he knows and he (Ronaldo) has a huge impact in everything he says. What we need to focus on is the future. We know that we as a club made a lot of mistakes in the past and we are trying to change that. Let's not focus on what happened, let's focus on what we are doing now and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things and want the players to behave. We are doing that and we are improving, so let's continue and forget the past."

Amorim added: "I think you can attack really well. Sometimes when you defend better, you attack better. I think it's not that, it's the way we defend the box, but the last game we struggled inside the box because we allowed the crosses into the box without any pressure.

"These small details that you watched during the last game, we have worked on that. In our last game, they had 17 shots and we cannot allow that. It's something we need to change. We can attack the same way, score even more goals, but we need to defend better."

United face Tottenham this weekend, the first time the two teams have met since the Europa League final in May, which the Reds lost 1-0. Spurs have an excellent away record, but have been woeful at home and Amorim believes his side have improved since losing the final in Bilbao. 

Amorim said: "The characteristics of the players, we have different characteristics in our team, but we also have a lot of players who played last year. We are a better team, we play better and we understand the game better. We are more confident. At this moment, we play with a different confidence. We manage better the moments of the game, but if you remember that game, they had that shot on the goal and won the game. I expect a different game. We can play better, but also have a little bit of luck to win the game."

He added: "I think we are more confident. We believe more that we can win any game and we prove already that we can win any game. The last game was tough on us because in some moments we weren't the team we were supposed to be in every minute. And compare that against Brighton, it was a different thing.”

You'd be hard-pressed to find a more in-form, goal-scoring center back than Christian Gray.

Over the past four months, he has scored against Western Springs AFC and Eastern Suburbs in the Northern League, and he also netted a late equalizer in Auckland City's recent draw vs. Auckland FC's reserve side. However, the most important goal of his career came on July 24 — not in his native New Zealand, but in the United States.

Having lost their first two matches to Bayern Munich and Benfica by a combined 16-0, Auckland City were already eliminated from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, unlike Boca Juniors, who were seeking to book their ticket to the knockout round with a victory. When Boca opened the scoring in the 26th minute via an own goal, all signs pointed to Auckland suffering yet another heavy defeat in Nashville. Instead, they held firm and reached halftime with a manageable deficit, and in the 52nd minute, they pulled level as Christian Gray headed home from a corner kick. While Boca exited the tournament without a win, and Bayern and Benfica confirmed their spots in the Round of 16, Auckland managed to bow out of the Club World Cup with their heads held high.

“Coming off the back of the previous results, if we were told that we'd get a point from that game vs. Boca, I don't think anyone would have believed you,” said Gray in an exclusive World Soccer Talk interview. “It was a funny feeling after the game… you're not sure how to react. It's a draw at the end of the day, but when you take everything into account, it's still a good result. It took a moment to realize it's not a win, but it's not a loss.”

Born in the Gisborne region of New Zealand, Gray was raised by Sandra Edge — who won gold at the 1987 World Netball Championships in Glasgow, silver in 1991 in Sydney, and bronze in 1995 in Birmingham — and Rodger Gray, who captained New Zealand's men's national team and scored four goals in 39 caps between 1989 and 1997, in addition to representing Mt. Wellington, Waitakere City, and Waitemata FC.

Like many players such as Sergey Palkin, Diadie Samassékou, and Marco Verratti, he was hooked on soccer from a young age and sought to emulate his father. Initially a striker, Christian transitioned to midfield and later to center back, ultimately following in his father's footsteps by launching his senior career with Waitakere United in 2016.

“My father and my uncle played together for the national team and club team. Mum has a netball background, so I guess I grew up surrounded by sport. Academically, they were both involved in coaching, and Mum also has a teaching background, so sports were always a big part of my childhood.”

Gray moved from Waitakere United to Hamilton Wanderers, then to Birkenhead United and Eastern Suburbs in 2019, before eventually joining Auckland City in January 2022. Unlike New Zealand's two professional clubs, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix — who play in the Australian league — Auckland City remain an amateur side, and because of that, they compete in the New Zealand top flight. They have not only participated — they have dominated, winning 10 league titles and 13 OFC Champions League trophies, including each of the last four. As a result, Auckland have played in more FIFA Club World Cups (12) than any other club, finishing third in 2014.

An unused substitute in Auckland's defeat to Al Ahly in Morocco in 2023, Gray made his first Club World Cup start against Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, facing Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kanté, and Fabinho in a 3–0 defeat. He was on the bench nine months later as Auckland lost 6–2 to Al Ain in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in Qatar. The tournament was later rebranded and expanded into a 32-team Club World Cup, meaning Auckland would spend a full month abroad and have more chances to prove themselves.

“Traveling to all these locations has been awesome. We've ticked off quite a few places. We just got back from Egypt where we saw the pyramids — something I probably never would have done without football. That's been a big part of why we play. We've played against some huge names over the last four years, at big stadiums, and visited countries we might never have seen otherwise. I had the chance to play against Benzema a year after he won the Ballon d'Or, and other legends like Edinson Cavani and Ángel Di María.”

After competing in Cincinnati, Orlando, and Nashville, Gray returned to New Zealand before heading back to Egypt to face Pyramids in the Intercontinental Cup. Unable to overcome a strong opponent, Auckland lost 3–0. He later scored an own goal vs. Birkenhead but responded by helping his team secure wins vs. Western Suburbs and Wellington Olympic, followed by a 1–1 draw with Auckland FC's reserves.

“There are always lessons from these matches that we'll take back into the National League. Pyramids are obviously a strong side, so the big thing is taking what we learned and applying it at home.”

Gray has become a key figure in Auckland's backline thanks to his timing, awareness, passing quality, and physical bravery. Like Gonçalo Inácio, Marc Guéhi, and others, he excels aerially, scoring and defending with equal determination.

At 29, Gray has faced world-class opposition — yet has not been called up to the New Zealand national team, largely due to not being a professional player. His full-time job is teaching Physical Education and Health at Auckland Grammar School and Mt. Roskill Intermediate, while also coaching the school's boys' team. His days begin before dawn and often end late at night, alongside completing his graduate teaching diploma.

“It's been a busy year, juggling everything — especially with all the travel. I coach in the mornings, teach during the day, study on weekends, and train in the evenings. I'll finish my diploma in December and become a registered teacher.”

Whether Gray will someday turn professional or play for the All Whites remains uncertain, but one thing is certain: his goal against Boca Juniors will be remembered as one of the biggest shocks in FIFA Club World Cup history.

Gio Reyna is back with the U.S. men's national team for the first time since March.

The 22-year-old 2022 World Cup veteran has made just one 21-minute cameo for his country since former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino took over as USMNT coach last year, and he's played sparingly for new club Borussia Mönchengladbach since leaving German Bundesliga rival Borussia Dortmund in August.

Usual starting attackers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah are unavailable this month because of injury and Malik Tillman just returned to action after missing three-plus weeks of action with a hamstring strain he sustained while on U.S. duty last month.

That has given Reyna, who helped the U.S. win a trio of Concacaf Nations League titles between 2021-24, the chance to get on Pochettino's final roster of the year.

The roster was revealed Thursday ahead of 2026 World Cup tuneups against South American powers Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa.

Forward Ricardo Pepi returns for the first time since November 2024. The PSV striker scored in each of his first three appearances for Pochettino but underwent knee surgery in February after getting hurt in a UEFA Champions League win over Liverpool. 

Though he has yet to win back his starting job for the Dutch champs, he's averaging a goal every 81 minutes in the Eredivisie and Champions League. On Tuesday, he helped PSV salvage a point with a late tally off the bench against Olympiacos. It was Pepi's third result-changing goal in second-half stoppage time in the Champions League, equaling Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Agüero for the most in the competition's history. 

Fellow striker Folarin Balogun has also been in fine form in Europe's top club tournament, having scored Monaco's Champions League winner over Bodo/Glimt earlier this week.

Besides Pulisic, Tillman and Weah, several other regulars were omitted. Central defender Chris Richards, a stalwart for Premier League Crystal Palace, was left in London, presumably to rest the calf injury Eagles manager Oliver Glasner says the Alabama native has been nursing this fall.

Standout midfielder Weston McKennie will remain with Juventus, which recently hired yet another new manager, the Texan's fourth since arriving at at the Italian powerhouse five years ago.

And there was no place for goalkeeper Matt Turner, who started all four games for the Americans at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Turner ins't scheduled to play another competitive match until the New England Revolution kick off the new MLS season in February. Yunus Musah, another mainstay in Qatar, was left out for the fourth consecutive camp; Musah came off the bench for Atalanta Wednesday and helped the Italian side preserve a 1-0 win over a Weah-less Marseille in UEFA Champions League action.

Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson recently scored their first Premier League goals this season. Adams missed the October exhibitions because of the birth of his second child.

The meeting with Paraguay represents a homecoming for four Philadelphia Union alums, as Aaronson, keeper Matt Freese, and central defenders Mark McKenzie and Auston Trusty all return to Subaru Park.

Fourteen of the 25 men summoned by Pochettino play for European clubs. With Liga MX-based Alex Zendejas (knee injury) still out, the remaining 11 are MLS-based. Right back Alex Freeman was recently voted the 2025 MLS Young Player of the Year. Freeman, Sebastian Berhalter and Cristian Roldan were named to MLS's Best XI on Wednesday, as was injured Vancouver defender Tristan Blackmon.

The 25 invited players, listed below, will begin reporting to the Philadelphia area following this weekend's slate of club matches in MLS and overseas.

Goalkeepers: Roman Celentano, FC Cincinnati (MLS); Matt Freese, New York City FC (MLS); Jonathan Klinsmann, Cesena (Italy): Patrick Schulte, Columbus Crew (MLS) 

Defenders: Max Arfsten, Columbus; Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands); Alex Freeman, Orlando City (MLS); Mark McKenzie, Toulouse (France); Tim Ream, Charlotte (MLS); Miles Robinson, Cincinnati; Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach (Germany); John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel (Germany); Auston Trusty, Celtic (Scotland) 

Midfielders: Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England), Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Aidan Morris, Middlesbrough (England); Gio Reyna, Borussia Mönchengladbach; Cristian Roldan, Seattle Sounders (MLS); Tanner Tessmann, Lyon (MLS); Sean Zawadzki, Columbus

Forwards: Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United (England); Folarin Balogun, AS Monaco (France); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS), Ricardo Pepi, PSV; Haji Wright, Coventry City (England)

Upcoming Friendlies vs. World Cup Qualifiers on Nov. 15/18 in suburban Philadelphia and Tampa;

Luna Faces RSL Teammate Braian Ojeda in Paraguay Match

ATLANTA / HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday, November 5, 2025) – Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna has been named by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino amongst the 25 players selected for upcoming U.S. friendlies on Sun., Nov. 15 and Wed., Nov. 18 against World Cup-bound opponents Paraguay – which will feature Luna's RSL teammate Braian Ojeda – and Uruguay, the two South American nations ranked 15th and 16th globally.

Luna – RSL's 2025 Golden Boot winner with 10 goals and seven assists across all competitions in this most recent season – surpassed his goal output from last year in fewer MLS matches. The 22-year-old playmaker has appeared in 15 of the U.S.A.'s 16 games this season, leading the list of a half-dozen players on the roster with double-digit appearances in 2025. All but one of Luna's career national team appearances have come this year.

Named to the CONCACAF Gold Cup Best XI this summer, Luna tallied three goals and two assists and earned Man of the Match honors after scoring twice in the semifinal win against Guatemala.

Earlier this year, Luna earned the game-winning assist during his first 45 minutes played under Pochettino, suffering a shattered nose in the process, during a January friendly against Costa Rica. During the CONCACAF Nations League consolation match, Luna was bright and assertive against Canada, as the two-time 2024/25 MLS All-Star selection and former MLS Young Player of the Year continues to press for 2026 FIFA World Cup inclusion.

The USA will first host Paraguay, presented by Allstate, on Sun., Nov. 15 at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa. Kickoff from the home of the Philadelphia Union is set for 3:00 p.m. MT and will be broadcast on TNT, HBO Max, Telemundo, Universo, and Peacock.

Three days later, USA-Uruguay, presented by New York Life, will mark the USMNT's return to Tampa for the first time since 2018. Raymond James Stadium hosts on Wed., Nov. 18 against the 16th-ranked Uruguayan side, kicking off at 5:00 p.m. MT and shown live on TNT, truTV, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. Fans can follow the USMNT on X (@USMNT), Instagram (@USMNT), U.S. Soccer Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

For the USMNT, the matches against two more World Cup qualified teams offer more experience against the opponents and styles it could face next summer. Paraguay, 2010 World Cup quarterfinalists who are making their ninth appearance in the tournament, are led by Atlanta United striker Miguel Almirón. Uruguay, currently 15th in the Coca-Cola FIFA Men's World Rankings, finished third in the 2024 Copa America.

France national team head coach Didier Deschamps refrained from sparking further controversy while addressing the recent injury suffered by Paris Saint-Germain forward and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele. Deschamps claimed that he is "especially sad" to see Dembele's fitness struggles drag on, but added that he won't "add fuel to the fire" amid Les Blues' ongoing feud with PSG.

Dembele was forced off after just 25 minutes during their Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich earlier this week, just moments after he thought he had levelled the score at the Parc des Princes. It continues to be a frustrating season for the 28-year-old, who was crowned with the Ballon d'Or award in less than two months ago. His struggles with injuries seem to have returned, as he has played a grand total of 425 minutes this season, having suffered a hamstring injury with France in September and escaping a scare against Nice just days prior to the Bayern game. "It hurts, it hurts so bad," Dembele was captured telling his team-mate Achraf Hakimi.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference on Thursday, where the France squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers was announced, Deschamps expressed his sorrow over the fact that Dembele, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner, has been "hit with a string of injuries" after remaining largely injury-free during the 2024-25 season. 

"I'm especially sad for Ous. Last season, he was spared from injury, and now he's been hit with a string of injuries," he told reporters. "Not having him with us isn't good. But don't count on me to add fuel to the fire [with PSG]. I'm not interested in controversy. We have one thing in common: his absence isn't good for PSG or for us. I hope he recovers quickly."

He further elaborated on the feud between PSG and the French national team: "I'm not giving lessons. What happens at PSG is their business; I don't have all the information. I wouldn't presume to say anything about any club; they decide, they have the information to decide. Just like us. There have always been exchanges, as is the case here with Ousmane's injury. When tests are done, they are communicated both ways. Of course, the interests of clubs and the interests of national teams aren't the same. But there have always been exchanges regarding the tests and diagnoses. I'm not here to change the medical protocol. The fact that clubs can be given more decision-making power than national teams isn't up to me to decide. I'm not in Luis Enrique's position, just as he's not in mine. From the moment his players are on the pitch, there's a risk. [Achraf] Hakimi and [Nuno] Mendes weren't not at risk, but they got injured."

Dembele's fitness issues have sparked tension between PSG and the French Football Federation (FFF). Dembele and  team-mate Desire Doue both suffered injuries on duty with Les Bleus in a World Cup qualifying game against Ukraine. The Ligue 1 champions were left angry by the governing body's handling of their players, saying the injuries were "serious and avoidable" and that they would not have happened had the FFF's medical staff consulted the club properly.

Les Bleus currently lead the Group D standings in the World Cup qualifiers with 10 points from their four games. The upcoming fixtures against Ukraine on November 13 and Azerbaijan on November 16 are their final set of qualifiers. While Deschamps' men only require one more point to seal qualification to the World Cup, they will be determined to bag all three points against Ukraine to not only confirm their place at next year's World Cup, but also finish the group as the table-toppers. Such a scenario could see Deschamps hand much-needed rest to his most important players against Azerbaijan while also providing opportunities to players who haven't had as many chances to prove their mettle.

Toni Kroos has hit out at the decision to send off Luis Diaz during Bayern Munich's win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, insisting that "it wasn't a red card”. The German and Real Madrid legend believes referee Maurizio Mariani was influenced by Achraf Hakimi's injury rather than the tackle itself. Diaz, however later apologised publicly, while Bayern backed their forward.

Bayern's statement 2-1 win away at PSG in the Champions League was overshadowed by a highly debated refereeing decision. Colombian international Diaz, who had scored both goals for Bayern in the first half, was shown a straight red card following a VAR intervention for a tackle on PSG full-back Hakimi. Initially given only a yellow, referee Maurizio Mariani changed his decision after reviewing the incident on the monitor, citing excessive force and danger to the opponent.

Hakimi, who left the field in clear pain and in tears, was later diagnosed with a syndesmosis tear and deltoid ligament damage expected to keep him sidelined for around eight weeks. 

The moment dramatically shifted the tone of the match, even as Bayern held on for a crucial away victory to extend their winning run under Vincent Kompany to 16 straight matches across competitions. The incident has since become the primary talking point across European football, with varying opinions from pundits, former officials and players, and one of the most vocal critics has been the German legend Kroos.

Speaking on his Einfach mal Luppen podcast, Kroos was emphatic in his belief that the referee made the wrong call. “For me, it's clear: it wasn't a red card,” Kroos said, insisting that the referee “let Hakimi's injury have too much of an influence on his assessment of the play.”

The German argued that the challenge itself, while forceful, did not indicate malicious intent from Diaz. “If Hakimi had gotten up after the challenge, nobody would have reviewed the play.”

Kroos also turned his attention toward the role of the VAR team, suggesting that replay slow-motion angles can distort reality, “In situations like these, the referee should judge the action itself, not the consequences.”

His position echoed the sentiment of several Bayern players, including Joshua Kimmich and Josip Stanisic, who suggested that the injury may have influenced the decision. However, Kimmich admitted upon reflection that “seeing the replay and how he catches him, you can understand the referee showing a red card.”

Diaz addressed the incident after the match, posting a message on Instagram that said: “Football always reminds us that in 90 minutes, the best and the worst can happen… I wish Hakimi a quick return to the pitch.”

Bayern boss Kompany expressed sympathy for PSG and Hakimi, citing Bayern's own past injury experiences with Jamal Musiala, while also defending the Colombian winger. 

“I hope Hakimi recovers soon, it's terrible. We went through the same thing last year with Musiala. I don't think Diaz meant any harm; it was just an unfortunate incident in a high-intensity match,” said the Belgian coach.

Despite the controversy, Diaz's performance before the red card reinforced his growing importance under Kompany, decisive, direct, and ruthless in transition. Kroos then moved to tactical commentary, praising Bayern's bravery in pressing PSG high and suggesting their superiority would likely have produced the same result, regardless of Hakimi or Diaz's presence. 

"Bayern were clearly superior and could have gone into halftime 3-0 or 4-0 up. I don't think PSG would have created any danger with eleven against eleven," he said.

Bayern sit top of the Champions League table and will turn their attention to domestic action, where they face Union Berlin next, a fixture Kompany warned could become a “trap game” after the emotional and physical intensity of Paris.

For PSG, the focus is now on recovery and rotation, and Hakimi's absence adds further pressure on coach Luis Enrique, who is already dealing with Ousmane Dembele's injury, who also left the pitch earlier in the game due to a calf injury. The French champions need solutions on the flanks, especially with decisive Champions League fixtures still ahead.

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (Nov. 6, 2025) - Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw has signed a contract extension through the 2029 season, the club announced Thursday in partnership with Dove.

Shaw, 20, joined Gotham FC in September in an NWSL intraleague-record $1.25 million transfer from the North Carolina Courage. In her Gotham debut on Sept. 12, Shaw scored her first goal for the club against the San Diego Wave, where she began her professional career at age 17. The goal marked the second time she has scored in an NWSL club debut, making her the fifth player in league history to achieve the feat.

“I'm so excited to continue to give my all for this incredible club and our amazing fans,” said Shaw. “I'm grateful to call this place home for the years ahead.”

“Jaedyn has already demonstrated her incredible quality in the short time she's been with us,” said Yael Averbuch West, the general manager and head of soccer operations for Gotham FC. “We're thrilled to keep her at Gotham and look forward to watching her continue to thrive and make an impact with our club.”

The 2022 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year began this season with the Courage, appearing in 19 matches, including 10 starts, and recording three goals and one assist. She became the youngest player in NWSL history to reach 15 career goals, surpassing Alyssa Thompson.

A regular with the U.S. Women's National Team, Shaw was a member of the gold medal–winning American squad at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She also earned the Golden Ball – awarded to the tournament's top player – at the Concacaf W Gold Cup that same year, helping lead the United States to the title in the inaugural event. Shaw received her first senior national team call-up since joining Gotham FC in October and assisted a goal in a U.S. win over Portugal.

Shaw has made nine appearances for Gotham FC this season in all competitions, including seven starts, with one goal and one assist.

2026 World

Cup Countdown

FIFA president Gianni Infantino (right) presents US President Donald Trump a FIFA World Cup ticket for the final Andrew Caballero-Reynolds

In recent months, 2026 men's World Cup host cities in the United States have watched on as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that he is prepared to relocate matches from cities he deems to be unsafe.

While FIFA's contracts are with the host cities directly, rather than the U.S. government, the World Cup organizer suggested it would fall into line with President Trump when a spokesperson said in October: “Safety and security are obviously the government's responsibility and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

President Trump has name-checked Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston as areas of concern during his presidency, all of which are due to be World Cup cities, even if the games themselves are in the broader surrounding areas.

He said in late September: “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni (Infantino), the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.' And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

One challenge this has posed for host cities relates to their attempts to drive local sponsorship for the tournament. While FIFA has exclusivity for its own sponsors at stadium venues, the host cities are able to seek revenue around fan festivals in non-competing categories. However, several host city executives, speaking anonymously to The Athletic when discussing commercially sensitive matters, have expressed their concern that uncertainty could deter commitments from sponsors.



Bob Lynch, a former partnerships executive at the Brooklyn Nets and Miami Dolphins, is now founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a global sports sponsorship intelligence platform. He warned that the political environment has the potential to place obstacles in front of deals for host cities.

Lynch said: “It's definitely something I'm sure brands are bringing to the table in their discussions with local governing bodies around their sponsorship deals. Having sat in that seat, there are always things that are potential threats.

“When you have things like that, which include the threat of leaving or pulling out, there are a couple of things that generally take place. One is that it usually slows down the decision-making process of brands at the table. They may say: ‘We need to watch and see.' It is no different than if the economy is really struggling and people have major deals on the table or the uncertainty during Covid. So that's a real thing. That does slow down probably conversion on sponsorship deals.

“In some cases, there are conversations taking place around, ‘If we're in an agreement or we're going to be in agreement, what are our rights to get out of this?' Those are generally no different than what actually takes place within sports to guard against an earthquake taking place. It is to ensure brands are legally protected.

“I'm sure, like anybody, they would want the noise to stop. Anybody in sponsorship on the sales side is going to want the least amount of disruption. They would want that to dissipate, because that doesn't help them sell anything.”

In 2026, 11 cities in the United States will host World Cup games. Yet Chicago, the city with the third-largest population in the United States, will not be part of the tournament — and they appear to be quite happy about it.

The Midwest is short of representation at the World Cup, with only Kansas City, Missouri, among the host cities in that region. Chicago, which boasts an iconic venue in the 61,500 capacity Soldier Field, withdrew from the U.S.'s joint bid with Canada and Mexico in 2018, with the office of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying in a statement at the time that it would not be in Chicago's “best interests.”

Seven years on, Chicago's decision-makers do not have regrets.  In an interview with The Athletic, Chicago Sports Commission's long-serving executive Kara Bachman said: “There are people who think ‘Oh my God. How are you not hosting? What's wrong with you?' I'm like, ‘You didn't see what we saw.' There was not a way to get a handle on the financials in a way I could confidently stand behind.”

She said that the deal transferred a financial burden to the city to the extent it risked “leaving us in debt.”

She also described FIFA's terms as “demands” rather than requests and said the World Cup organizers would not accept “any changes or edits” to the contract.

“Quite honestly, I never spoke to anyone from FIFA face to face during that process, which to me was also a red flag,” Bachman added.

A FIFA source, who remained anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said that FIFA was negotiating with the United (United States, Canada and Mexico) bid rather than with cities directly. They also insisted that the process has been collaborative between host cities and FIFA.

Bachman warned that some of her counterparts in different host cities in America are envious of Chicago's position in 2026. She said the requirements had “taken over” for some host cities and constituted an opportunity cost for other possible ventures.

In New Jersey, for example, MetLife Stadium, the host venue for the final, has already spent $37m (£28.4m) on upgrades to enable it to host games for FIFA. Congressman Josh Gottheimer told The Athletic in March that New Jersey will take on $65m in costs for things such as transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports. Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with hosting World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium.

Chicago has hosted other soccer events in recent years, such as the 2025 Premier League Summer Series, which Bachman says she would like to bring back to the city. Chicago is also currently part of a group of cities considering bidding to be a host city for the 2031 Women's World Cup, which is expected to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica.

Yet Bachman also warned that Chicago “will not sell our soul to do it.” She said: “If they show up with the same terms, then I don't know. If it's the same terms, the answers don't change.

“I don't know that any of (the cities) have confidence that FIFA is going to look into themselves that much. I'd love to be proven wrong. Nobody seems to have the confidence that FIFA is going to be that self-reflective.”

Before FIFA's revamped Club World Cup had reached its conclusion in the summer, Gianni Infantino gave a speech at Trump Tower, New York, and declared it a roaring success.

The FIFA president said more than two million fans had “visited the matches,” with an average attendance of just under 40,000 for the 63 fixtures played across the U.S., culminating in more than 81,000 spectators at MetLife Stadium to watch Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

One area that proved to be a struggle when it came to ticket sales, however, was the hospitality packages.

Ahead of the tournament, FIFA announced it had partnered with Beyond Hospitality, with Beyond's initial press release outlining the “multiple tiers of social, premium and luxury” options available across the 12 venues.

These included a “Flagship Lounge”, which Beyond described as “the most luxurious shared commercial hospitality space available,” and “Exclusive Private Suites” offering a “five-course dining menu.”

Despite the plentiful offerings, more than 50 per cent of the hospitality tickets at the Club World Cup went unsold, according to people with knowledge of the sales.

FIFA sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, highlighted that this was an inaugural tournament being held in the U.S. for the first time and there were always bound to be inconsistencies in attendance. The challenge for both Beyond and FIFA was also increased by the late planning of the tournament, with a broadcaster only announced seven months before the competition.

Beyond did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite FIFA's many challenges in launching the expanded Club World Cup in the United States, the world governing body is confident it has plenty of options when it comes to hosting the next tournament in 2029.

FIFA intend it to be a summer competition again, which almost certainly rules out Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where the summer heat would render the games likely unplayable and require a move in the calendar to winter, as we saw with the men's World Cup in 2022. This would bring a collision between FIFA and domestic European leagues, not to mention European football's governing body UEFA, whose own competitions would be disturbed by the Club World Cup. For 2029 at least, this is not a fight FIFA wants.

During and following the competition in the summer, FIFA received expressions of interest from the Brazilian Football Federation, while the 2029 edition could also be used as a dummy run for Spain and Morocco, who are two of the host nations in the six-nation, three-continent bonanza that is the men's World Cup in 2030.

Australia have also been credited with an interest in potentially hosting the Club World Cup, but The Athletic can reveal another registration has come from Germany, who most recently hosted Euro 2024.

There are also advocates within FIFA to take the tournament to England, owing to the quality of the training bases and stadia. It may also be a way to improve relations with the Premier League, which was aggrieved by a perceived lack of consultation ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. FIFA would also be able to rope in an additional Premier League team beyond the current country limit of two by giving England a host-country place, which was the mechanism by which Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were invited this summer.

One of the criticisms of the 2025 edition was the absence of so many leading European names and a qualification formula that resulted in Liverpool, Napoli and Barcelona (the current champions of England, Italy and Spain) not being in a competition marketed as “the best v the best.”

There had been widespread expectation that the tournament would expand from 32 teams to help accommodate the most famous and successful teams in the world. But, for now at least, there are high-profile advocates within FIFA who believe the competition should remain a 32-team affair, but with play-in rounds to help improve the quality of competitors without removing access for confederations across the world, while the two teams per country cap may also be altered.

2026 World

Cup Countdown

FIFA president Gianni Infantino (right) presents US President Donald Trump a FIFA World Cup ticket for the final Andrew Caballero-Reynolds

In recent months, 2026 men's World Cup host cities in the United States have watched on as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that he is prepared to relocate matches from cities he deems to be unsafe.

While FIFA's contracts are with the host cities directly, rather than the U.S. government, the World Cup organizer suggested it would fall into line with President Trump when a spokesperson said in October: “Safety and security are obviously the government's responsibility and they decide what is in the best interest for public safety.”

President Trump has name-checked Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston as areas of concern during his presidency, all of which are due to be World Cup cities, even if the games themselves are in the broader surrounding areas.

He said in late September: “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni (Infantino), the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.' And he would do that. He wouldn't love to do it, but he'd do it very easily.”

One challenge this has posed for host cities relates to their attempts to drive local sponsorship for the tournament. While FIFA has exclusivity for its own sponsors at stadium venues, the host cities are able to seek revenue around fan festivals in non-competing categories. However, several host city executives, speaking anonymously to The Athletic when discussing commercially sensitive matters, have expressed their concern that uncertainty could deter commitments from sponsors.



Bob Lynch, a former partnerships executive at the Brooklyn Nets and Miami Dolphins, is now founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a global sports sponsorship intelligence platform. He warned that the political environment has the potential to place obstacles in front of deals for host cities.

Lynch said: “It's definitely something I'm sure brands are bringing to the table in their discussions with local governing bodies around their sponsorship deals. Having sat in that seat, there are always things that are potential threats.

“When you have things like that, which include the threat of leaving or pulling out, there are a couple of things that generally take place. One is that it usually slows down the decision-making process of brands at the table. They may say: ‘We need to watch and see.' It is no different than if the economy is really struggling and people have major deals on the table or the uncertainty during Covid. So that's a real thing. That does slow down probably conversion on sponsorship deals.

“In some cases, there are conversations taking place around, ‘If we're in an agreement or we're going to be in agreement, what are our rights to get out of this?' Those are generally no different than what actually takes place within sports to guard against an earthquake taking place. It is to ensure brands are legally protected.

“I'm sure, like anybody, they would want the noise to stop. Anybody in sponsorship on the sales side is going to want the least amount of disruption. They would want that to dissipate, because that doesn't help them sell anything.”

In 2026, 11 cities in the United States will host World Cup games. Yet Chicago, the city with the third-largest population in the United States, will not be part of the tournament — and they appear to be quite happy about it.

The Midwest is short of representation at the World Cup, with only Kansas City, Missouri, among the host cities in that region. Chicago, which boasts an iconic venue in the 61,500 capacity Soldier Field, withdrew from the U.S.'s joint bid with Canada and Mexico in 2018, with the office of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying in a statement at the time that it would not be in Chicago's “best interests.”

Seven years on, Chicago's decision-makers do not have regrets.  In an interview with The Athletic, Chicago Sports Commission's long-serving executive Kara Bachman said: “There are people who think ‘Oh my God. How are you not hosting? What's wrong with you?' I'm like, ‘You didn't see what we saw.' There was not a way to get a handle on the financials in a way I could confidently stand behind.”

She said that the deal transferred a financial burden to the city to the extent it risked “leaving us in debt.”

She also described FIFA's terms as “demands” rather than requests and said the World Cup organizers would not accept “any changes or edits” to the contract.

“Quite honestly, I never spoke to anyone from FIFA face to face during that process, which to me was also a red flag,” Bachman added.

A FIFA source, who remained anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said that FIFA was negotiating with the United (United States, Canada and Mexico) bid rather than with cities directly. They also insisted that the process has been collaborative between host cities and FIFA.

Bachman warned that some of her counterparts in different host cities in America are envious of Chicago's position in 2026. She said the requirements had “taken over” for some host cities and constituted an opportunity cost for other possible ventures.

In New Jersey, for example, MetLife Stadium, the host venue for the final, has already spent $37m (£28.4m) on upgrades to enable it to host games for FIFA. Congressman Josh Gottheimer told The Athletic in March that New Jersey will take on $65m in costs for things such as transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports. Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with hosting World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium.

Chicago has hosted other soccer events in recent years, such as the 2025 Premier League Summer Series, which Bachman says she would like to bring back to the city. Chicago is also currently part of a group of cities considering bidding to be a host city for the 2031 Women's World Cup, which is expected to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica.

Yet Bachman also warned that Chicago “will not sell our soul to do it.” She said: “If they show up with the same terms, then I don't know. If it's the same terms, the answers don't change.

“I don't know that any of (the cities) have confidence that FIFA is going to look into themselves that much. I'd love to be proven wrong. Nobody seems to have the confidence that FIFA is going to be that self-reflective.”

Before FIFA's revamped Club World Cup had reached its conclusion in the summer, Gianni Infantino gave a speech at Trump Tower, New York, and declared it a roaring success.

The FIFA president said more than two million fans had “visited the matches,” with an average attendance of just under 40,000 for the 63 fixtures played across the U.S., culminating in more than 81,000 spectators at MetLife Stadium to watch Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

One area that proved to be a struggle when it came to ticket sales, however, was the hospitality packages.

Ahead of the tournament, FIFA announced it had partnered with Beyond Hospitality, with Beyond's initial press release outlining the “multiple tiers of social, premium and luxury” options available across the 12 venues.

These included a “Flagship Lounge”, which Beyond described as “the most luxurious shared commercial hospitality space available,” and “Exclusive Private Suites” offering a “five-course dining menu.”

Despite the plentiful offerings, more than 50 per cent of the hospitality tickets at the Club World Cup went unsold, according to people with knowledge of the sales.

FIFA sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, highlighted that this was an inaugural tournament being held in the U.S. for the first time and there were always bound to be inconsistencies in attendance. The challenge for both Beyond and FIFA was also increased by the late planning of the tournament, with a broadcaster only announced seven months before the competition.

Beyond did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite FIFA's many challenges in launching the expanded Club World Cup in the United States, the world governing body is confident it has plenty of options when it comes to hosting the next tournament in 2029.

FIFA intend it to be a summer competition again, which almost certainly rules out Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where the summer heat would render the games likely unplayable and require a move in the calendar to winter, as we saw with the men's World Cup in 2022. This would bring a collision between FIFA and domestic European leagues, not to mention European football's governing body UEFA, whose own competitions would be disturbed by the Club World Cup. For 2029 at least, this is not a fight FIFA wants.

During and following the competition in the summer, FIFA received expressions of interest from the Brazilian Football Federation, while the 2029 edition could also be used as a dummy run for Spain and Morocco, who are two of the host nations in the six-nation, three-continent bonanza that is the men's World Cup in 2030.

Australia have also been credited with an interest in potentially hosting the Club World Cup, but The Athletic can reveal another registration has come from Germany, who most recently hosted Euro 2024.

There are also advocates within FIFA to take the tournament to England, owing to the quality of the training bases and stadia. It may also be a way to improve relations with the Premier League, which was aggrieved by a perceived lack of consultation ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. FIFA would also be able to rope in an additional Premier League team beyond the current country limit of two by giving England a host-country place, which was the mechanism by which Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were invited this summer.

One of the criticisms of the 2025 edition was the absence of so many leading European names and a qualification formula that resulted in Liverpool, Napoli and Barcelona (the current champions of England, Italy and Spain) not being in a competition marketed as “the best v the best.”

There had been widespread expectation that the tournament would expand from 32 teams to help accommodate the most famous and successful teams in the world. But, for now at least, there are high-profile advocates within FIFA who believe the competition should remain a 32-team affair, but with play-in rounds to help improve the quality of competitors without removing access for confederations across the world, while the two teams per country cap may also be altered.

Thomas Tuchel has reportedly decided to draft Jude Bellingham back into his England squad for the November internationals. The Real Madrid superstar was surprisingly left out of the Three Lions' ranks in October after recovering from shoulder surgery and returning to action at club level. The expectation is that he will figure in 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania.

Eyebrows were raised when Tuchel chose to overlook Bellingham for fixtures that saw England book their tickets to next summer's global gathering in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The German tactician stuck with those that performed admirably in September.

Tuchel claimed that Bellingham was left out as he was lacking “rhythm” after several weeks on the sidelines. The 22-year-old midfielder has not represented his country since June, with his international coach going on to reveal that his mother finds some of Bellingham's on-field behaviour “repulsive”.

Questions were asked of Bellingham's character on the back of those comments, with Tuchel eager to establish squad harmony ahead of a bid for World Cup glory. He has said: “We are not collecting the most talented players, we are trying to build a team. Teams win trophies, no-one else.

“That's how it is in international football. But the thing you are playing [back to me] is not what I am saying. You are playing the game that says: ‘He [Tuchel] is saying the others who aren't in the team, you cannot build a team with them'. It's not like this. We built a team with the players who were available and they did so well so we go again with them. Nobody said we can't do the same with them. Or even better, or maybe the same level, with the others.

“For this moment we stick with our choice and the radical statement is that we don't collect the most talented players. We collect the guys who have the glue and cohesion to be the best team. Because we need to arrive as the best team. We will arrive as underdogs at the World Cup because we haven't won it for decades and we will play against teams who have repeatedly won it during that time. So we have to arrive as a team or we will have no chance.”

The Athletic reports that Bellingham will be given a chance to prove his worth when Tuchel names his latest England squad on Friday. He has been catching the eye for Real Madrid of late, netting three goals through his last four appearances, and will get the chance to add to his collection of 43 senior international caps.

Danny Murphy will be among those pleased to see Bellingham welcomed back into the fold, with the ex-England midfielder having told GOAL in the wake of October's snub: “I find the narrative around his character and any problems a little bit strange because when I have watched England - I have watched them a lot at tournaments and watched him closely, he is, by far, the best character on the football pitch when England play, in terms of producing big moments, grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, leaving everything out there.

“If you could have 11 Jude Bellinghams, you would win most tournaments. The element of not talking to the press or not doing interviews or the odd swear word or rant or a little bit of what some people would call arrogance, that is what creates the player on the pitch. They are just rumours because a lot of the feedback from the players - Jordan Henderson recently said how much he likes him and how great a character he is - I think some of it has been exaggerated.

“From a footballing perspective, we have a much better chance of winning the World Cup if he is in the team. I don't mean just in the squad, I mean in the team. He is a phenomenal talent. We should be - as pundits, fans, press - building him up, applauding him and being thankful that we have got him, not trying to pull him down because he is the best one we have got. He is the game-changer in our side. He is the one that can make things happen. He's just a phenomenal player.

“I don't blame Tuchel for not bringing him back on this particular occasion because he has only played a few minutes for Real Madrid. I understand that and don't see that as a drama. I don't see that as a big statement. We are playing two games we should win comfortably - let him get on with his fitness, let him get on with building himself back up. I would be absolutely gobsmacked and amazed if he is, if fit, not in Tuchel's first XI come the World Cup.”

England, who have already topped their World Cup qualification group after taking maximum points from six fixtures that have all delivered clean sheets, will be back in action on November 13 when playing host to Serbia. They will then travel to Albania three days later as their 2025 schedule is wrapped up.

Chelsea came crashing back down to earth on Wednesday night after staggering to a 2-2 draw against Qarabag in Europe, highlighting the inconsistencies that have frustrated Enzo Maresca since taking over.

The west Londoners face a tough battle to secure an all-important spot in the top eight of the Champions League group standings, with tricky ties against Barcelona and Italian champions Napoli to come. 

Maresca has been desperate to utilise his expensively-assembled squad this season, but has been forced to contend with injuries to key players including Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Liam Delap - a knock-on effect from their exertions at last summer's Club World Cup. 

To add more misery to the Blues boss, young midfielder Romeo Lavia was forced off with an injury during Wednesday night's draw in Azerbaijan. It has been a miserable time in London for the Belgian, who has picked up no fewer than 10 injuries during his stint at Stamford Bridge. 

In real terms, that's led to 495 days out injured, 77 matches missed, and just 29 minutes for Chelsea. The brutal reality is that he has spent more time injured than healthy. 

Maresca has attributed his side's terrible injury record to their exploits in the United States this summer, where they triumphed in the inaugural Club World Cup, meaning they struggled to adequately prepare for the new season.

Enzo Maresca has bemoaned the Club World Cup's effect on his fatigued Chelsea squad 

The Blues boss has changed half his team every game, leading to inconsistent results

‘The Club World Cup affects a lot,' he said after Wednesday's draw. 'We try to rotate. When you win, no one mentions all that. When we don't win, everyone is focused on that, and now I think it's important to recover energy for Saturday and go again.' 

It's been a mixed start to the season for the Blues. Statement victories over Liverpool and Spurs have been interspersed with dismal defeats by Man United, Brighton and newly promoted Sunderland, seeing Maresca's side languishing in seventh position. 

The Italian's constant tinkering - he's made no fewer than 85 total starting lineup changes this season - has proved to be a double-edged sword for the boss. While he's managed to keep injury-prone stars like Reece James and Pedro Neto fit by shuffling his pack, rotation may be a key factor behind the team's struggle to find sustained runs of consistency. 

The foundation of any successful team can be found in a settled back line. While Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made 67 changes to his starting lineups and boasts impressive strength in depth at centre back, he rarely rotates his go-to duo of William Saliba and Gabriel.

Even Pep Guardiola, who has been the source of frustration for many Fantasy Premier League managers with his regular first XI changes, has settled for Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol at centre back. 

Other contenders have shuffled their squad - not to the extent of Chelsea - but can still produce positive results and performances

It can be no coincidence, then, that the young defenders Maresca has turned to when rotating his squad have been prone to errors. In Azerbaijan, £37million new boy Jarrel Hato made two key errors leading to the underdogs' goals, while Trevoh Chalobah was at fault for Sunderland's winning goal at Stamford Bridge.

At the other end of the XI changes table, Sunderland have rarely made tweaks to their starting lineups this season. Blessed with a kinder calendar where they rarely have to play three times a week, the Black Cats have made just 32 changes to their team week on week.

For the frontrunners - Arsenal, Man City and reigning champions Liverpool - they have a remarkably similar number of changes to their XI: 67, 64 and 69 respectively. 

As Maresca aims to reach the levels of the three leaders, there are lessons to be learnt for the Blues boss if he is to make his squad last the season - while picking up results.

Hello! The World Cup circus is in full swing — brace yourselves for another Gianni Infantino wheeze — but the city of Chicago will take no part in it. We're here to explain.

On the way:

No bid to host the World Cup is worth its salt without promising to lavish riches on a country domestically. Every tournament, without fail, will be ‘worth X to the local economy' (insert a satisfying number of millions or billions), heading off financial sceptics at the pass.

The book Soccernomics devoted a chapter to this subject and, through a fair amount of research, deduced that projections of how much a nation earns from a World Cup — i.e. the amount of cash which benefits ordinary people like you and me — are often optimistic at best. Some are pulled from fantasy land. If you're in the United States, Mexico or Canada, I'd recommend reading it.

And when you see it said, as it does in two FIFA-backed reports, that the 2026 edition and the 2025 Club World Cup could generate a combined $47bn (£36bn) for the U.S. alone, I'd suggest applying your hogwash filter. It's possible that the impact will be felt to that extent. Just don't take the figures at face value.

Chicago certainly didn't, hence why the third-biggest city by population in the States won't be hosting any of the matches at the 2026 finals. It's odd when you think about it. Soldier Field, above, the home of the Chicago Bears and Chicago Fire, is every bit as large and modern as the average venue set aside for next summer. I'd have had it on my bingo list as readily as Boston, San Francisco or Philadelphia.

But as Adam Crafton illustrates in his World Cup column today, the authorities in Chicago were far from convinced that pitching to be a host was in the best interests of the city's public purse. On the contrary, they feared it might merely incur debt. So Chicago was out. And others who got in on the act are apparently wondering if the Windy City called it right.

Adam spoke to Kara Bachman, the executive director for the Chicago Sport Commission (a body which supports major events there). Her concerns were numerous, starting with the question of whether Chicago would post a significant profit from hosting World Cup games.

Beyond that, she described the terms put forward by world governing body FIFA as “demands”, not requests, and claimed Chicago had no power to alter the contract it would be told to sign. She says she was unable to speak to anybody at FIFA in person, calling this “a red flag”. FIFA sources contacted by Adam insist they were cooperative but according to Bachman, officials in certain host cities — having encountered the reality — quietly wish they had taken Chicago's stance.

The costs incurred through hosting are not minor. Take, for instance, the $37m spent upgrading MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the stage for the World Cup final, or the $65m that state will spend on travel security. It falls to individual locations to manage “safety, security and protection”, none of which is simple or cheap for a competition so big. Adam also reports U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats to relocate fixtures are running the risk of spooking prospective sponsors.

The counter-argument is that the World Cup can turn host cities into jamborees. People in and around group-stage and knockout-phase matches are having the door opened to experiences they might remember forever (assuming they can afford to attend). But on the matter of who stands to earn what from the 2026 finals, all we can say is that FIFA will make hay. The various host cities would be well advised not to spend their mooted royalties in advance.

I'm not saying UEFA's Champions League is going as expected this season, but the top eight halfway through the first stage resembles a European Super League, with English sides doing particularly well. Barcelona, in 11th, are the only real outliers, and that won't last.

Don't mistake those observations for complaints, though. I'm a natural-born sceptic, but I can't deny the Champions League is the most entertaining competition out there as it stands. The goals alone are worth the subscription fees, and after Micky van de Ven's Roadrunner impression for Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, we were treated to another batch of dynamite last night.

Apologies to Lazar Samardzic, whose stonking late winner for Atalanta at Marseille doesn't quite make the TAFC cut, but we had to squeeze in a Lionel Messi-esque finish from Lamine Yamal in Barcelona's 3-3 draw at Club Brugge, above.

And you remember I wrote about Piotr Zielinski's volley for Inter at the weekend being as smooth as chocolate? Well, this Dan Burn header for Newcastle United in their win against Athletic Club, below, is straight out of the same packet. Every time I roll it back, I'm convinced it's going wide. Genius.

Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff made 4-3-3 the staple diet at Ajax. Then they took it to Barcelona. It was so immensely successful for both clubs (and later under Pep Guardiola at Barca) that you'd think the system would have taken over the world.

Instead, it remains the domain of Dutch clubs, many of whom still cling to Cruyff's ideal of Total Football. That's not to say coaches elsewhere don't go 4-3-3 — Jurgen Klopp did at Liverpool, and Luis Enrique guided PSG to the Champions League title last season using that formation, after a fashion — but the Netherlands is its spiritual home.



That's shown by The Athletic's latest Tactics Board feature, a series which our readers have been all over (the potted histories of 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 were very popular). Since 2011-12, four of the five teams who have used 4-3-3 most often are Dutch, with Ajax top of the list. Only nine of the top 20 hail from elsewhere.

But even in the Netherlands, loyalty to it is fading. Go back 10 years or so and a staggering 79 per cent of formations deployed in the Eredivisie top flight were 4-3-3. Now it's down to 29 per cent. “Anyone with the guts to use 4-3-3 in the right way will be rewarded, as long as the right players are chosen,” Cruyff once wrote, and his word was gospel. But no corner of football is impervious to change.

Let's lower the tone with foul of the week. A Swedish top-flight game between GAIS and Osters IF was tied at 1-1 in the 97th minute when GAIS broke clear in search of a winner. Osters' defender Mattis Adolfsson had two choices: let the attack ride or stick a foot in. Like any loyal servant, he took one for the team. I can feel this one from here.

MIAMI — FIFA has announced the creation of a peace prize, which it plans to award for the first time at the draw for the World Cup on Dec. 5 in Washington.

The award, called the FIFA Peace Prize, will "recognize exceptional actions for peace," soccer's governing body said Wednesday. But FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has a close relationship with President Donald Trump, would not tip his hand Wednesday when asked if Trump will be the first recipient of the award.

"On the 5th of December, you will see," Infantino said. He was speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami, shortly after Trump addressed the same event.

Infantino said earlier Wednesday that, "in an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace." FIFA said the award, which Infantino will present this year, will be bestowed annually "on behalf of fans from all around the world."

Trump was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize last month despite lobbying from fellow Republicans, various world leaders and himself. And Infantino made no secret of the ties between himself, FIFA and Trump in his remarks Wednesday.

"I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, who I consider really a close friend," Infantino said. "Of course, he's been very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup. ... He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He says, actually, what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say. And that's why he's so successful."

FIFA recently added another link to Trump by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100 million education project part-funded by 2026 World Cup ticket sales.

The World Cup draw, and the awarding of the peace prize, is expected to draw about 1 billion viewers worldwide, Infantino said.

After eight consecutive holds to start the match on Thursday night, Djokovic faced double break point serving at 4-all, 15-40 in the opening set—but he won four points in a row to get himself out of trouble, and after the two traded a few more holds, he rolled through the tie-break for a one-set lead.And when Djokovic wins the first set this year, he doesn't lose—after breaking for a 4-3 lead in the second set, the only break of the match for either player, he eventually closed out a straight set victory, improving to 29-0 in 2025 after winning the first set.He sealed the victory with a big forehand winner down the line, his 22nd winner of the match (to 20 unforced errors)."It was a very physical battle," Djokovic said. "I thought that Nuno played on a very high level. I must say, honestly, I was a bit surprised with how good he played. I think we went toe to toe for most of the match, and just a few points determined the winner today. So he deserves a big applause for his performance."I just tried to hang in there. Obviously, serving well always helps in the important moments. I think it was 5-all, or 4-all in the first set, I faced two break points and had big serves—sometimes risks pay off in the big moments and you just have to trust your instincts and go for it. Then I played a good tie-break. There weren't many opportunities for both of us to break—I think that game I broke him was the only game I was able to break."All in all, very pleased with the performance. I want to thank everybody for showing up and supporting both of us tonight."Awaiting Djokovic in the semifinals will be either American Macros Giron or German qualifier Yannik Hanfmann.

Cameron Norrie overcame a stern test from home hope Kyrian Jacquet at the Moselle Open on Thursday. A finalist last year in Metz, Norrie rallied past the lucky loser 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-4 to reach his second semi-final of the season.

The only seed remaining at the ATP 250, Norrie won the final 11 points of the two-hour, 25-minute match to advance. 

“He surprised me a lot,” Norrie said of Jacquet, the third Frenchman whom the lefty has beaten this week. “He was mixing it up really well. A lot of slicing, then really aggressive at moments. His serve is really, really good.

"The French have so many good players, so many different kinds of players. I really liked the way he competed and he could have easily won the match in the second set as well, but I managed to stay tough.”



Jacquet crushed 48 winners, half of which came from his forehand, to Norrie's 28, but the 30-year-old Briton found his best tennis when he needed it most to earn his place in the last four. He will next meet Lorenzo Sonego after the Italian beat Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 7-6(6). Sonego has fond memories in Metz, having clinched the crown in 2022.

Norrie is aiming for his sixth tour-level title and first since 2023 in Rio de Janeiro, where he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the final.

Oscar-nominated actress Pauline Collins, best known for her role in Shirley Valentine, has sadly passed away. She also appeared in films such as “Quartet” and “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.” The beloved British actress passed away at the age of 85. 

According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, Collins passed away “peacefully” at her home in London in the presence of her family. Her death came after a years-long battle with Parkinson's disease. Collins leaves behind four children and her husband, John Alderton.

Collins appeared in over 70 roles throughout her legendary career. It's for this reason that many fans are flocking to social media to remember the screen legend. One person on X wrote, “Thanks for everything, Pauline Collins. Your quiet talent shone out no matter what the job. RIP”

Another person said on X, “Always guaranteed to light up the screen, either big or small, Pauline Collins has sadly left us. RIP.”

Someone else expressed their disbelief, saying, “Oh, it can't be true!! Shirley Valentine is my all-time favourite film, I must've seen it a million times. I'm so, so gutted and sad about this. Rest in peace, Pauline Collins. Shirley and Joe reunited 😔”

Another fan wrote, “Sad to hear we've lost Pauline Collins. A cracking actress. RIP” A Different fan stated, “RIP the wonderful, funny Pauline Collins. From Upstairs Downstairs to Mrs Caldicot's Cabbages via Shirley Valentine, she never failed to entertain in her own unique style.”

The social media tributes continued as someone else said, “One of my favourite actors – started watching Upstairs Downstairs again on ITVx. She was brilliant in everything she did. RIP Pauline Collins. #PaulineCollins”

Finally, another fan of her work wrote, “RIP Pauline Collins. She was magnificent in Upstairs Downstairs as the fiesty yet vulnerable Sarah, done wrong by that Master James and tragically losing her baby on the night the King came for dinner. Wonderful memories…💔”

According to IMDb, Collins began her on-screen career in 1963 with episodic appearances in “Emergency-Ward 10” and “24-Hour Call.” From there, she appeared in shows like “Pardon the Expression,” “The Three Musketeers,” and “Dr. Who.”

What most would call her big break came when she starred in “Shirley Valentine” in 1989. This is the film that led to her Oscar nomination and Golden Globe and BAFTA wins. Her most recent role was in the 2017 film “The Time of Their Lives.” Collins will be missed, but her legacy will live on.

Bianca Censori is taking her revealing everyday outfits to new heights.

On Thursday, she returned to the airport in Melbourne, Australia, wearing an all-black outfit comprised solely of a thong bodysuit and a long-sleeve top.

Evidently, Censori put on a pair of sheer black tights, slipped into a high-waisted thong bodysuit, added some heels, grabbed her oversized Hermès Birkin and was ready to catch her flight. 

At least she packs light?

The 30-year-old has worn little more than lingerie while visiting her family over the past few days. 

On Monday morning, she arrived at the same airport in a nude-colored version of her go-to travel look, complete with a long-sleeve tee and high-waisted briefs worn over super shiny tights. She accessorized with a matching pageboy hat.

During her short visit, she was spotted shopping with her mom and sister while wearing undergarments from Marc Jacobs' fall 2025 collection, including a purple bullet bra and sheer pink body stocking as a top.

It seems to be a trend for the designer, as she also caught a flight this past summer wearing briefs and knee-high boots, and kicked off the year with a Tokyo flight in a grey thong bodysuit and heels.

While Censori often takes to Instagram or is spotted out and about with husband Kanye West in barely-there looks, the choice of wearing lingerie on a 14-hour flight, let alone any flight, is questionable.

Most travelers, celebrities included, opt for more comfortable attire, like sweatpants or leggings…

Either way, she probably had to check a bag.

EXCLUSIVE: We have two more additions to Amazon MGM Studios‘ Road House 2: Peter Sarsgaard (September 5) and Rob Delaney (Dying for Sex).


	Character details for the duo are under wraps. As we first told you, there have been many other recent additions to the cast of the sequel, including Rico Verhoeven, Michael Chandler, Michael “Venom” Page, Dustin Poirier, Stephen Thompson, Tyron Woodley, Jay Hieron, Andrew “King Bach” Bachelor, Iko Uwais, and Hidetoshi Nishijima. Hieron is reprising his role as UFC fighter Jax “Jetway” Harris from the first film.


	Plot specifics for the sequel, which sees Jake Gyllenhaal return as UFC fighter–turned–bouncer Dalton, also remain under wraps. But the film is said to be a production of greater scope, scale, and ambition, with filming taking place across the U.K., Malta, and Savannah, Georgia. The sequel follows 2024's Road House — Amazon's reboot of the '80s classic starring Patrick Swayze — which drew 80 million viewers worldwide in its first eight weeks on Prime Video.

	A man standing near Donald Trump in the Oval Office collapsed as the president was holding a press event to announce discounts to two popular weight loss drugs.


	Media was rushed out of the Oval Office as figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz tried to assist the man. Fox News, NewsNation and C-SPAN were covering the event live, and NewsNation's White House correspondent updated viewers on the situation.


	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “a representative with one of the companies fainted. The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay. The Press Conference will resume shortly.” The event resumed about a half hour later, and Trump said “He's fine.” The president said the man, who collapsed as Eli Lilly‘s David Ricks was speaking, got “a little bit lightheaded.” He was not identified.

	At the event, Trump announced a White House initiative to lower drug costs, this time over innovative weight-loss treatments. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump said that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to offer their most popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs at “drastic discounts.” The drugs are Zepbound and Wegovy. The president said that the costs will fall from more than $1,000 per month to a couple or several hundred dollars.


	“All these drugs will be available directly to the consumer at trumprx.gov. They wanted to use my name,” Trump said.


	He said that Medicare and Medicaid would cover the cost for patients suffering from obesity.


	Fox News and NewsNation carried Trump's remarks; other cable networks did not. 


	Trump at one point said to Robert Kennedy Jr., his secretary of Health and Human Services, “Is there anything bad about them, Bobby? Someday, maybe it will come out, which we'll notify you immediately.”


	Trump's announcement comes after Tuesday's off-year elections, in which exit polls showed voters showed their top concerns were the economy and affordability. Republicans got a drubbing from Democratic candidates in the handful of races across the country.

Finally, with the shut down that is privately or purposely funding the military and ICE while not funding TSA, FAA, SNAP, etc., the big announcement is not that there has been made a compromise with the government “open” again, but the US citizens may see a reduction in the cost of weight loss drugs.  Lack of benefits and high costs of living, especially at the grocery stores, is plenty to affect weight loss.  Seems like another give away to those who can afford the mostly cosmetic drug anyway (see diet and exercise for most Americans).

Oz tended to him? Weren't there any real doctors nearby?

Great to see weight loss medicine reduced in price, put diabetes, cancer, blood pressure meds on the back burner.

Bravo's “Next Gen NYC” star Gia Giudice has officially moved out of her mom, “Real Housewives” icon Teresa Giudice's million-dollar mansion, and into her very own apartment.

On Instagram, Gia documented the process of moving all of her belongings out of her mom's New Jersey home. She later posted a series of Instagram Stories from inside her new digs, highlighting a large kitchen and floor-to-ceiling windows that offered gorgeous views of the city. 

Gia Giudice made the heartfelt decision to leave her mother's home and start a new chapter in her own Jersey City apartment. After documenting a moving company packing up all her belongings to take them to her new place, she took fans on a mini tour of her new space on Instagram Stories.

Reality Blurb shared Gia's photos, which showed that her mom, Teresa Giudice, her step-father, Luis Ruelas, and her boyfriend, Christian Carmichael, all joined her as she began to make her apartment feel more like a home.

Some of the photos captured the incredible floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city below, where she can even watch the sunset from her new place. Gia shared a photo of her family having takeout together with fans noticing her large kitchen island, which is perfect for Gia as she loves to cook.

Additionally, Gia showed off her walk-in closet, which was already filled with her clothes and will most likely be something many of her “Next Gen NYC” co-stars living in Manhattan will envy.

Prior to her big move, Gia shared on TikTok how she planned to navigate trips between Jersey City and New York City. Alongside her boyfriend, the two documented their adventure on the PATH train, from accidentally boarding the wrong train to rushing to catch the next, before finally making it to her co-star's Brooks Marks' apartment.

Before her move, Gia shared what would be her last “Get Ready with Me” video at her mom's home on Instagram. In the clip, the reality star shared that she would take her fans on a tour of her new apartment once she's settled.

“So tomorrow is move-out day. I found this gorgeous apartment in Jersey City, and I cannot wait to take you guys along this entire journey with me, room by room, step by step,” she began. “Moving is obviously super exciting, but really scary. I have always just loved being at home with my family.”

She then shared how participating in “Special Forces” motivated her to take this next major life step. “This move is definitely necessary just for me, my life, and my career. I think I really knew that I was ready to move, honestly, after “Special Forces.” Doing that show just showed me that I am totally okay on my own. And, I think I always knew that, I just needed that push for me to realize that I'm ready and it's okay to leave my family.”

Luckily, Gia does not have to travel far to see her family. Her mom's Montville home is just a 40-minute drive to Jersey City.

EXCLUSIVE: Mission Impossible and Captain America star Hayley Atwell is joining Gerard Butler in hostage crisis action-thriller Empire City, which is due to begin filming this month.


	Michael Matthews (Love & Monsters) is newly aboard to direct the pic scripted by Brian Tucker and S. Craig Zahler. We first told you about the movie last Cannes. The story has slightly tweaked since then. 


	In Empire City, when a hostage crisis erupts inside New York's landmark Clybourn Building, firefighter Rhett (Butler), his squad, and his NYPD wife Dani (Atwell) must fight and navigate their way through the building to rescue the captives.

You can accuse “All Her Fault” of a lot of things — exploiting parental anxieties, bland AirBnB home design, criminal misuse of Sarah Snook — but you can't accuse it of being subtle.

In the Peacock limited series' first scene, Marissa (Snook) stops by a friend's house to pick up her son from a playdate. Except Milo (Duke McCloud) isn't there. Neither is the mom who's supposed to be watching him. Instead, a bewildered stranger answers the door. While she's very nice — inviting Marissa inside, offering reassurance, helping her make phone calls — her every kindness only leads to more questions. The number for the mom-in-charge isn't working. (Why not?) Her son's playdate pal is at the park with a bunch of other kids. (But not Milo?) After a few exposition-heavy minutes of searching, there's only one conclusion left for Marissa to draw.

“I don't know where my son is,” she says, right before the title “All Her Fault” flashes across the screen.

Not subtle, sure — but also, kind of fun? It is for a while, at least, before an overextended story runs out of steam and the delayed answers stretch themselves silly to emphasize a point made patently clear from the start.

 










Throughout the hour-long premiere, Megan Gallagher's adaptation of Andrea Mara's 2021 novel balances the tragic urgency of a missing-kid mystery with the soapy indulgences of a trash-TV thriller. There are leading dramatic beats as suspects are introduced and new information comes to light. There are emotional meltdowns as the family's fresh reality dawns on each of Milo's loved ones. And there are outlandish twists that reframe who we like and who we hate, who we're leery of and who we implicitly trust, and, of course, what we think really happened to the innocent little five-year-old.

The cast largely helps to keep things grounded, rebutting the histrionics by treating each claim with legitimacy or reciting each gauche line with apt conviction. But really, they're all just suspects, as the first episode's closing flash-forward to a police lineup of each series regular's mugshot makes clear.

Marissa runs her own wealth management firm in Chicago, alongside her very handsome business partner, Colin (Jay Ellis). Despite looking like a fighter pilot who could win a game of dogfight football, Colin isn't framed as a temptation for Marissa, and a lack of sexy secrets proves to be a recurring blind spot for the series, even if those two have plenty of other skeletons in their massive, boring closets. (In case you couldn't tell from the moneyed term “wealth management,” everyone in this show is filthy rich — which makes the drab interior designs feel like an obvious oversight. They've got the cash! Give us our decor porn!)

 










Instead of pining over co-workers, Marissa is happily married to Peter (Jake Lacy), a commodities broker and, conversely, a gold-star human being. He supports his brother, Brian (Daniel Monks), and his sister, Lia (Abby Elliott), paying for their homes, their food, and their tertiary expenses. He loves his wife sincerely — and he's happy to prove it. After an early inquiry into his whereabouts — was he with another woman?! — it's clear he would never cheat on Marissa, and his lack of resentment over the accusation only serves as further evidence of his good-guy bonafides.

But… he is played by Jake Lacy, Hollywood's go-to actor for self-centered douchebags, so he's not to be trusted. (You could say the typecasting started with “The White Lotus,” and you wouldn't be wrong, except it actually started with “Carol,” and in this house we do not forget about “Carol.”) Brian is a nice guy, too, but vague allusions to a mysterious accident that left him in constant pain keep the door open to a hidden dark side. Lia's issue is out in the open: She's a drug addict who's spent half of Milo's life in rehab, so is she as devoted to her nephew as she claims? 

And what about Jenny (Dakota Fanning)? The fellow mom from school says she has no idea a playdate was scheduled with her son and Milo, but as another mom cattily voices directly to Jenny: “If someone did take Milo Irvine, why would they pretend to be you?” Yeah, Jenny! Why would they? What are you hiding?! Could it have something to do with Ana (Kartiah Vergara), the nanny, who's obviously guilty of something? (Because she's the nanny? Duh?)

 










For as dismissive as “All Her Fault” can be toward childcare professionals, it does sport a feminist edge so blunt it would struggle to cut Milo's birthday cake. When Marissa is first interviewed by the police, she's lightly chided by her otherwise respectful husband for not checking a parent's phone number against the school registry. When Jenny has to work late one night, her husband won't stop bugging her with questions about their kid — questions he should know how to answer if he was ever “on duty” (his words) for bedtime. The other moms at school cast dubious glances at both Marissa and Jenny for making mistakes any good mom could avoid, while the media pounces on the women for every perceived error whether it's rooted in fact or not. As the days mount and tension builds, inequities are exposed as often as breaks in the case.

Lending such prominence to an under-addressed parenting issue — the disparity in childcare, even in “progressive” couples that aim for an equal workload — makes “All Her Fault” that much easier to cheer, especially when you're already yelling at your TV. If that level the enthusiasm proved sustainable over eight long hours, perhaps Peacock would have another “Apples Never Fall” on its hands. (Hey, that's another Jake Lacy show!) Instead, episodes start to drag and the big reveals lose steam, leaving Sarah Snook to reign over a series that can't maximize her skillset.

 










The series' failures are not, of course, her fault, and it's to Snook's immense credit that a tender moment at the end of the first episode lands at all. If only she had more of them.

“All Her Fault” premieres Thursday, November 6 on Peacock. All eight episodes will be released at once.

Television personality Maury Povich has vulnerably discussed a personal difficulty he and his wife Connie Chung had to contend with earlier in their marriage. The former talk show host opened up about the fertility problems that prevented them from having any biological children but was full of praise for the adoption system and shared the love he has for his adopted son. 

Povich was incredibly honest when talking about the personal issue while appearing on an episode of Bunny XO's “Dumb Blonde Podcast” on November 2. In the podcast, the retired broadcaster revealed that he and Chung were unable to fall pregnant naturally.

“We tried to get pregnant,” Maury explained. “This is over 30 years ago. Connie had to take time off from CBS, and it became a big story that we were trying to get pregnant.”

With both Maury and Connie—who tied the knot in 1984—being public figures, their experience became a hot topic.

Povich and Chung married in 1984 and were both public figures. Povich launched his tabloid talk show “Maury” in 1991 and Chung was a respected journalist and news anchor who had worked for CBS, CNN, and MSNBC throughout her career. This meant that their personal life and fertility difficulties were often the subject of scrutiny — something they each found difficult.

“Late show guys, you know, Jay Leno and everybody was making fun, ‘I wonder if Maury and Connie are doing it tonight,'” the 86-year-old lamented. “Fox had this great show called In Living Color. They did a skit on Connie and I in bed trying to get pregnant and Jim Carrey played me.”

He continued, “There was all kinds of press and all kinds of stuff, so we finally adopted because we couldn't do it. It's tough.”

On the topic of adoption, Povich was gushing in praise of the process, which provides needy children with a home and gives families the chance to have children when they might otherwise not have the opportunity. The pair adopted their son, the now 30-year-old Matthew Povich.

“I'm a big fan of adoption,” he says. “He's just spectacular. He's now 30. He's engaged. He and his girlfriend have been together for like nine or ten years.”

Povich has often been candid about his personal life. Earlier this year, he detailed how he was financially broke before he found television success.

“I was dead broke at 44. I mean, really dead broke,” Povich told former Canadian hockey player Sean Avery during an episode of his “On Par” podcast. “At 44, I had just come back — how about this. Starting out in Washington, D.C., where I was a kind of a minor celebrity, trying to say, ‘Can I make it somewhere else?' And I worked in five cities in the next seven years, kind of like an itinerant hockey player, right? Bouncing around all over.”

 “A couple of years later, this wild, crazy Australian [Rupert Murdoch] buys the television stations. And in a second, I'm off to New York to do this crazy tabloid show called A Current Affair. And the rest is history.”

Bi Gan pushes against the edges of the cinematic medium once again with his new dream-logic epic, “Resurrection.” It's the 35-year-old Chinese filmmaker's first feature since he dared audiences to put on 3D glasses 70 minutes in for an unbroken take, which is also when the title card showed up, in “Long Day's Journey Into Night.”

“Resurrection” is an even more daring achievement, one that will enchant and alienate audiences in ways that will equally encourage conversation and, hopefully, more dreams. No 3D glasses required, though, when Janus Films opens “Resurrection” in theaters on December 12. IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer for the film below.

Across the six chapters in “Resurrection,” director Bi adopts the aesthetics of a number of genres and periods in film history as his canvas, from Méliès-inspired silent films and wartime epics to a con-artist buddy movie and even a millennial vampire romance, to tell stories revolving around the same monster's dreams.

Taiwanese superstar Shu Qi headlines as a woman who, in a far-off future, enters the consciousness of the only remaining creature who can dream. Jackson Yee, meanwhile, plays that creature, as well as various humanlike, wrought-from-a-dream versions of him that feature throughout the film's segments and — wait, did I get that right? Regardless, this film also boasts a oner for the ages, as a raincoat mafia descends upon a rave and a pair of bloodthirsty lovers. The phrase “bravura sequence” gets tossed around with abandon, but “Resurrection” has a truly special one.

Here's Janus' synopsis: “In a future where humanity has surrendered its ability to dream in exchange for immortality, an outcast (Jackson Yee) finds illusion, nightmarish visions, and beauty in an intoxicating world of his own making. A work of staggering imagination from visionary Chinese director Bi Gan, ‘Resurrection' conjures vast and ever-shifting worlds on the brink of collapse in an era-spanning journey through our deepest and most human desires.”

In my experience, one viewing at the New York Film Festival was not enough to parse the film's gorgeous riddles and meditation on cinema as a dream machine. 

IndieWire's own review by Sophie Monks Kaufman out of Cannes asked enthusiastically, “Endurance Test, or Imaginative, Boundary-Defying Cinema? You Decide!” 

 










It feels reductive in late 2025 to call a film or television series Lynchian anymore, but parts of “Resurrection” feel like Bi Gan somewhere out there mainlined “Twin Peaks: The Return” and it burrowed its way into his own unconscious: floating orbs, ghostly light patterns, time loops, and all.

“Resurrection” opens in select theaters December 12. Watch the IndieWire-exclusive trailer below.

Lily Allen's new album, West End Girl, has pulled the rug out from under happily-married-after dreams. The record is an odyssey of betrayal and heartbreak, an investigation of the way we perceive ourselves and the people we wake up next to every morning, and a litmus test for how honest we're allowed to be in art and life. As a result, her record stands as a marker on the musical landscape where storytelling is laid out in its barest and sharpest form. Impressively, she has found an audience that's ready to listen.


	From the title track — which begins like a whimsical skip down the altar to a brownstone in New York, before abruptly being rerouted to a devastating phone call  — to the shocking confrontation of “Madeline,” where Allen endures the hollow sympathy from a woman who slept with her husband, West End Girl has left every corner of social media knocked off its high horse. Allen deftly channels her pain into a masterful portrayal of modern love and loss, and the damaging moments in between. “Absolutely obsessed and horrified at how specifically relatable every track was,” wrote a commenter on Allen's Instagram, while another observed, “A load of lads'll get triggered cause they've cheated on their birds, but for every woman who's twisted herself into a human pretzel to keep some emotionally constipated bloke happy, this is our national anthem.”

	











	While many songwriters may opt for coy innuendos to discuss similar subject matter, Allen has detailed revelations of butt plugs, condoms, and a husband who is quite possibly a sex addict — all set against honeyed pop scores — making it all feel like the time D. H. Lawrence scandalized Britain by penning the word “fuck” in Lady Chatterley's Lover.












	The album has resonated with not just women in — and after — marriages, but also anyone who has considered the idea of coupling with another person and trusting them enough to hold you at your most vulnerable. There's a headline by satire website Reductress — “Woman Who Has Never Been Married or Cheated On Feeling Seen by New Lily Allen Album” — that rings true here, as each track is rooted in a fear that's at once ubiquitous, timeless, and vividly current. “Pussy Palace” salts infidelity with the discovery of a Duane Reade plastic bag filled with lube, while “Nonmonogamummy” and “Dallas Major” find Allen wandering dating apps and hating it: “You know, I used to be quite famous, that was way back in the day/I probably should explain how my marriage has been open since my husband went astray,” she sings.

	Pulling apart fact from fiction in Allen's story is tricky territory, however, despite the album being widely perceived as a tell-all about her ex-husband, actor David Harbour. As Allen told Vogue, “There are things that are on the record that I experienced within my marriage, but that's not to say that it's all gospel.” Listeners are left to explore the lyrics that echo in their own minds, and that's the bit that strikes the heaviest chord.


	“It broke me. It opened up the floodgates,” says Jessica Resendez when remembering the first time she heard West End Girl. Resendez, a social media editor with two children who is out of a long-term relationship, says that Allen's record has arrived at a time when women are reclaiming their autonomy, chipping away at patriarchal norms, and publicly holding men accountable for their misdeeds. “Women have financially, emotionally, and mentally done the work to advance ourselves, and now we're realizing we don't need to keep putting ourselves in situations where men embarrass us or do things that make us feel ashamed,” she says.


	As journalist Ella Alexander writes in Harper's Bazaar, the “David Harbour character is a recognizable one — a performative soft boy who talks the talk, but can't live up to the standards he sets.” Alexander compares Harbour's 2017 SAG speech, in which he waxed on the finer points of morality and offered marching orders in the battle against narcissism, with Allen's portrayals of the actor as a man who allegedly doubts her ability to lead a play (2:22 A Ghost Story) and gaslights her into thinking his betrayal was her fault all along. Following the release of West End Girl, the note that Harbour wrote Allen ahead of her stage debut resurfaced: “My ambitious wife, these are bad luck flowers 'cause if you get reviewed well in this play, you will get all kinds of awards and I'll be miserable. Your loving husband.”

	And then there's the wreckage of a broken heart and being left to mend it in an era where technology has plunged dating into overdrive. “When you put your trust into someone and they use it against you, or they have no empathy, the hardest part is learning how to navigate other relationships in your life. It puts you in this space where you're walking around and feel like no one is ever going to understand you,” says Resendez. “You see that in Lily's music. She sings about these sad, traumatic experiences, but the beat is uplifting. You still have to go about our day and go to work, take care of our loved ones, and do the song and dance every time you meet someone new on these apps, while still walking around with this gray cloud over you.”


	Yet there's liberation in Allen's ability to strip down the shame, jealousy, fear, and torment into art — something she can remember on her own terms. On the penultimate song, “Let You W/In,” she asks, “All I can do is sing. So why should I let you win?” before declaring, “I can walk out with my dignity, if I lay my truth on the table.”And when the tale of ill-starred lovers-turned-strangers closes with “Fruityloop,” Allen's defiant refrain, “It's not me, it's you,” lands less as a kiss-off and more as a resounding victory. The story's narrator has walked away from the disillusionment of divorce with not just her dignity intact, but also with her voice honed. West End Girl isn't an album about heartbreak — it's about having the audacity to survive it.

Keeping up with Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner.

The actor hinted at the major next steps his and his girlfriend's ultra-private relationship will take in a cover interview with Vogue, published Thursday.

The “Wonka” star did not divulge much about his romance with the “Kardashians” star, whom he's been dating since early 2023 — not out of “any fear,” he clarified, but because he doesn't “have anything to say.”

However, Chalamet hinted that starting a family could be in the cards, teasing that this milestone “could be on the radar.”

He mentioned recently watching a video in which someone was “bragging about not having kids and how much time it afforded them to do other stuff” — a mindset he considered “bleak.”

The Oscar nominee went on to acknowledge the “new stage of life” he is in as his friends mark major milestones.

“Zendaya is engaged. Anya [Taylor-Joy] is married,” he said of two of his “Dune” co-stars.

Page Six has reached out to Jenner's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Chalamet, 29, and Jenner, 28, first sparked romance rumors in 2023 when the latter's Range Rover was seen outside the Golden Globe nominee's Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion.

That September, the pair shocked fans when they were seen making out at one of Beyoncé's “Renaissance” tour stops in Los Angeles.

Later that month, the Oscar nominee and the beauty guru got touchy-feely at the US Open.

Jenner accompanied Chalamet to the Golden Globes in January 2024, where they shared several kisses during a commercial break, and she has since supported her beau at many awards ceremonies.

In August, reports surfaced that the duo hadn't seen each other in “weeks,” sparking breakup rumors.

Jenner and the “A Complete Unknown” star proved they are still going strong by grabbing coffee together in Hungary.

Last month, they made back-to-back outings for the New York Film Festival premiere of Chalamet's forthcoming movie, “Marty Supreme,” and a New York Yankees game.

Jenner shares daughter Stormi, 7, and son Aire, 3, with ex Travis Scott.

Columbus is on board to also direct the new sequel to the Warner Bros. 1984 classic, which the studio dated on Thursday for a 2027 release.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein are learning why you don't get a Mogwai wet.


	The directing duo behind this summer's horror hit Final Destination: Bloodlines have teamed up with Chris Columbus to write the new feature installment of Gremlins, Warner Bros.' horror comedy franchise featuring little mischievous monsters, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.




	The development occurs as the feature project moves full steam ahead at Warners, with the studio announcing Thursday on an earnings call that it is dating the movie for Nov. 19, 2027.

					New 'Final Destination' Movie Finds Its Director in Michiel Blanchart		
			









	Kristie Macosko Krieger and Holly Bario of Amblin Entertainment are producing the project, as are Columbus, Michael Barnathan and Mark Radcliffe via their banner, 26th Street Pictures. Steven Spielberg returns to executive produce.


	Lipovsky and Stein are working with Columbus as a writing team. Columbus wrote the 1984 original (but sat out the 1990 sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch) and is slated to direct this new installment. A script by Columbus has been in development since at least 2017 — Toby Halbrooks and Carl Ellsworth wrote previous drafts — and the boarding of Lipovsky and Stein, who are very much in demand around Hollywood thanks to Bloodlines, is an electric charge for the project.


	In talking about his to return to Gremlins, Columbus said to The Hollywood Reporter, “I'm filled with a tremendous surge of inspiration and passion, as I embark on this cinematic journey. It's an honor to reunite with Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros., as we bring this latest chapter of Gremlins to a brand new generation of moviegoers who will experience all of the thrills of this grand adventure on the big screen”

	











	“Few titles are as beloved and iconic as Gremlins, and we're beyond excited to bring it back for both lifelong fans and a whole new generation,” said Jesse Ehrman, Warners' president of development and production. “It's a privilege to be working alongside Steven (Spielberg), Chris (Columbus), and the entire creative team, and we look forward to audiences experiencing the magic, mayhem, and heart of Gremlins on the big screen in 2027.”


	With Bloodlines, Lipovsky and Stein reinvigorated a moribund Warners title, helming the first Final Destination movie in about 14 years. The movie, released in May, grossed $315.0 million worldwide on a budget of around $50 million, becoming not only the highest-grossing entry in the franchise but also the best-reviewed. The duo are known for their directing work, but the opportunity to work as writers on a movie series that was a childhood favorite to them both, and to work with Columbus, who also wrote 1980s classic The Goonies and directed Home Alone, was too good to pass up. Lipovsky and Stein have yet to pick their next directorial outing but are being heavily courted by studios.


	The original Gremlins, directed by Joe Dante, told of a young man who receives a unique cute and furry creature as a present from his father and who names it Gizmo. The pet comes with three rules: keep it away from light, don't let it come in contact with water, and don't feed it after midnight. Of course, all those rules are broken and soon, all hell breaks loose in the hero's small town, as not only new Mogwais appear, led by the nasty-tempered Stripe, but they then turn into reptilian killers as well.

	











	The movie was released the same weekend as Ghostbusters, with both becoming hits and making their mark on 1980s pop culture. Dante came back for the sequel, but Columbus did not.


	The franchise and IP went into a cocoon for decades, but talk of an eventual third movie would pop up intermittently. In 2023, HBO Max released the animated series Gremlins: The Wild Batch. Dante was involved with the series and, last year, as the second season launched, he commented on the prospects of a third movie.


	“That's up to the audience,” he told THR about the chances of a third film. “The fact is that it's too big a property for somebody not to make something. But it's been difficult for people to wrap their heads around, ‘Exactly how are we going to do this?'”


	Looks like Lipovsky and Stein, as well as Columbus and Warners, may have found an answer.


	Lipovsky and Stein are repped by Verve, Ground Control and Lichter Grossman.

The King of Pop is finally coming to theaters. Lionsgate released the first teaser for “Michael,” its long-awaited Michael Jackson biopic starring MJ's nephew Jaafar Jackson. 

And the first look is a thriller. The brief teaser shows quite a lot, including Jackson prepping for a show at Dodger Stadium, a recreation of the “Thriller” music video, and Jackson in the studio speaking with his producer, who tells him that, “in here, keep those feet still, my man.” 

Jaafar Jackson, Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Juliano Krue Valdi, Miles Teller, and Colman Domingo all star in “Michael,” which Lionsgate is releasing in theaters April 24, 2026. Antoine Fuqua is directing “Michael,” which has a script by John Logan and is produced by “Bohemian Rhapsody” producer Graham King along with John Branca and John McClain.

IndieWire understands that this first teaser for “Michael” will also be screened ahead of showings of Lionsgate's “Now You See Me: Now You Don't” in theaters, which opens next week.

 










The film was meant to come out as early as this year, but a massive legal snafu involving a big chunk of the movie, which reportedly centered on a child molestation accuser's lawsuit that the Jackson estate was not allowed to depict on film, forced filmmakers to completely reshoot and retool parts of the film, leading to it to be delayed for months indefinitely. Footage from the movie was even confidently teased at CinemaCon back in 2024 but was completely absent this past spring as the movie underwent its reshoots. That wait is over now, and this film has the chance to be one of the bigger box office smashes of 2026. 

Here's the official synopsis: ‘Michael' is the cinematic portrayal of the life and legacy of one of the most influential artists the world has ever known. The film tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.

The last time screenwriters Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet collaborated, on the Corbet-directed “The Brutalist,” they created a bold American epic that garnered deserved critical praise and awards attention for its textured 70mm images (captured via VistaVision) and sweeping vision of 20th-century art, culture, and politics. 

For their new film “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Fastvold steps back into the director's chair to tell another story of, as IndieWire critic David Ehrlich wrote, “a European iconoclast who comes to America in order to build a new kind of church.” Watch the teaser trailer below.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The Testament of Ann Lee” is an account of the rise of Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), founder of the 18th-century religious sect known as the Shakers. A fervent proponent of celibacy, Lee was also an activist for gender equality — and a utopian leader who believed herself to be the female incarnation of Christ.

Fastvold's film tells Lee's story — one which, like the tale of László Tóth in “The Brutalist,” works beautifully as an allegory for the struggles and passions of a 21st-century filmmaker — as an audaciously conceived musical, using over a dozen original Shaker hymns as the basis for spiritually inflected expressions of agony and ecstasy choreographed by Fastvold and Corbet's “Vox Lux” collaborator Celia Rowlson-Hall.

 










Shooting on 35mm with an eye toward 70mm blow-ups for the film's theatrical release, cinematographer William Rexer creates a sumptuous candlelit look for the film reminiscent of Caravaggio's paintings and atmospheric period pieces like Stanley Kubrick's “Barry Lyndon” and Ridley Scott's “The Duellists.” Like “The Duellists,” “The Testament of Ann Lee” is a sweeping epic made with limited resources — working with a budget comparable to that of “The Brutalist” (reportedly around $10 million), Fastvold and production designer Samuel Bader have crafted a film of astonishing scale and detail.

In his review of the film out of the Venice Film Festival, Ehrlich called “The Testament of Ann Lee” a “speculative, feverish, and altogether rapturous biopic” that works as “a celebration of — and then in its less rhapsodic second half, a plea for — the conditions required to make a movie like ‘The Testament of Ann Lee.' Just as Ann Lee's upbeat message appealed to a Christian population that had grown tired of being promised salvation through suffering, Fastvold and Corbet's model offers a more actionable response to an industry sick of Hollywood doomsayers.”

Watch the trailer below.

“The Testament of Ann Lee” opens in theaters on December 25 from Searchlight Pictures.

North West isn't keeping up with social media trolls.

Kim Kardashian shared her 12-year-old daughter's unbothered reaction to backlash over the fake tattoos and piercings she rocked in a recent TikTok video.

The Skims co-creator revealed to her “All's Fair” co-star Niecy Nash-Betts in a Complex “GOAT Talk” video on Wednesday that the pre-teen took her phone last month as naysayers raged in the comments.

“She writes back to a comment, and she goes, ‘This is such a non-issue,'” Kardashian, 45, recalled, labeling this a “good clapback.”

The response was pegged to Kardashian in October, which the reality star mentioned in the recent sitdown.

“Online, it was like, ‘Kim defends North to the end on this look,'” she noted.

While the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum did not break down her thoughts on the daring accessories, she did give context.

“Her and her girlfriends, they love doing costumes, they love doing looks,” she explained. “It's Halloween season, so they put on fake tattoos on their face, fake piercings. They all had their colored hair. 

“They looked like an opium Powerpuff Girls,” the “Kardashians” star continued. “[That's] what they were going for.”

Kardashian did, however, defend North's controversial fashion and beauty choices during an Oct. 15 “Call Her Daddy” podcast interview.

At the time, she told listeners it's “really hard and really interesting” when North goes viral for her clothing, as she did in August over a corset and miniskirt.

“All the kids are wearing the same things,” Kardashian said. “But then my daughter tries to wear it and then I'm like, ‘OK, we're never wearing that again.' Unfortunately, we made that mistake in front of the whole world.”

She noted, “As a mom, you're kind of learning at the same time. But what I do know is my baby's such a good girl and such a sweet girl.”

Kardashian went on to ask for “a little bit of grace” since she's “doing the best she can” raising North, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 6, “by [her]self.”

The Hulu personality, notably, welcomed her little ones while married to ex-husband Kanye West.

She revealed on the podcast that the rapper, 48, hadn't called their four children “in a couple months.”

Jimmy Kimmel is pleased that Democrats did well in the election this week, but even more pleased that Donald Trump isn't taking the news very well. 


	“It was a big night for Democrats,” Kimmel said during his monologue on last night's Jimmy Kimmel Live. “I'm glad it was because we needed a big night. Democrats have had fewer wins this year than the Jets. And so, the Democrats won everything—they won big races on the East Coast. They won the little ones in the South. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor with more than 50 percent of the vote. Which means your racist aunt and uncle have a new name to mispronounce this Thanksgiving.”


	Kimmel noted that it was “not a good night for the president” because “everything he touched was a loser.” “Trump hasn't been this embarrassed since he found out there was a Donald Trump Jr.,” Kimmel quipped. 


	He added that Trump, of course, has an excuse “for the losing.” “In fact, he's got two of them,” Kimmel said. “He wrote, ‘Trump wasn't on the ballot, and shutdown were the two reasons Republications lost elections tonight.' Now, if Republicans had won and he wasn't on the ballot, would he take credit for that? Oh yes, he definitely would.”

	Kimmel shared a second post from Trump, which read, “And so it begins.” Kimmel noted, “Which was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race or he just sat down on the toilet.”


	The host went on to recount how Republicans immediately began to “scream” about election fraud. “It's weird how it's only fraud when they lose, right? I mean, what are the chances?”

	Kimmel also reflected on the ongoing government shut down, which is impacting numerous sectors of the country in significant ways. “Trump has been desperately trying to convince anyone who will listen that Democrats are responsible for the shut down and that it has nothing to do with him trying to hide the Epstein files,” Kimmel said. “The gaslighting has reached a fever pitch as Trump cuts off the supply of food to children, families, senior citizens, etc.” 


	Earlier this week, Kimmel announced that he and his show created a food donation center — named the “Big, Beautiful Food Bank,” in reference to President Donald Trump's so-called Big, Beautiful Bill — to aid those in need. The food bank is being hosted at the ABC show's backlot in Hollywood and is set to gather both food and donations for local orgs St. Joseph Center and the Los Angeles Food Bank. “Cutting SNAP benefits creates uncertainty for American children, seniors, and families,” Kimmel wrote on Instagram. “To support our community members in need, we're starting a donation center.”

Chester A. Arthur is shitfaced. Stumbling out the back of a raucous bar in the wee hours of the morning, two hats stacked on top of his head, eyes shut so tight he can't see the wall he's about to walk into, the recent Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States (played by Nick Offerman, a master of drunken mimicry) only manages to find a ride home by the less-than-benevolent graces of a supporter he keeps mistakenly calling “Cousteau.”

Charles Guiteau, played with craven magnetism by Matthew Macfadyen, has been bending Arthur's ear all evening, spinning an accidental kindness — when Arthur saved Cousteau/Guiteau from being arrested — into a genuine opportunity. You see, Guiteau wants to work on Arthur's campaign. Back in Chicago, he was inspired by the top of the ticket, James Garfield (Michael Shannon), and now he dreams of “making an impact” just like his future president. If that means going by a different name — one that's not tied to the thefts, debts, and untold lies he's sown from Illinois to New York — then a different name he shall have.

So, despite his savior's soused state of mind, Guiteau can't say goodnight without bringing up his professional prospects one more time. “You are still angling for a slot,” Arthur says, slurring his words as he stumbles over his feet. “Wily bastard, you are.”

 










“Well, it takes one to know one, sir,” Guiteau says, matching Arthur's bemused chuckle. “It takes one to know one!”

Indeed it does. Although the future vice president (and, soon after, president) can only envision Guiteau's place in politics when he's blind drunk, the invoked comparison speaks as clearly as Arthur cannot. These two wily bastards have more in common than their social statuses would have you believe. After all, what relevant moral line can distinguish a man who slips on brass knuckles to whip delegates from a man willing to steal from the same sister he promises to make proud? Aren't they both feigning service while looking out for themselves? Is it not responsibility, be it to their vast constituency or their immediate family, that's supposed to guide their actions? Without it — without some sense of accountability to an idea greater than themselves — what does that mean for their work? Their function? Their impact on America, now and in the centuries to come?

In Mike Makowsky's exceedingly entertaining and vibrantly topical Netflix drama, “Death by Lightning,” the writer and creator uses a deceptively slight slice of history to illustrate the enduring flaws in our government as well as the defects in character of those drawn into it. While that may sound like old hat given the hordes of “timely” critiques tossed around in the last nine years, the four-hour limited series arranges its vivid political portraits into a rip-roaring yarn that's scalding and endearing, riotous and mournful, a plea for America's better angels to surface and a eulogy for a country that never lived up to its ideals.

 










To assess with how the righteous American dream grew distorted, Makowsky's series (directed by Matt Ross) peers all the way past our 25 most recent presidents to find the long-term lessons in our country's second-shortest presidency. It's a tandem tale split between Guiteau and Garfield, the assassin and the assassinated, enlivened by an exquisite cast of character actors. 

Shannon's Garfield is a classic reluctant hero. His Congressional obligations aside, Garfield prefers a simple life on his Ohio farm, where his days are consumed with making an “ugly” picnic table and his nights are devoted to reading on the front porch with his wife, Crete (Betty Gilpin). But when duty calls, he schlepps from his blissful haven in rural America to the bustling streets of Chicago, where the traveling circus has set up stakes. 

The only reason he even attends the 1880 Republican National Convention is to nominate another candidate, John Sherman (Alistair Petrie). Later, when Crete asks him why he gave such a speech to begin with — a speech so rousing, so honest, and so commanding that his words upstage the man they're meant to elevate and propel Garfield himself to the presidency — he responds, simply, “Because no one was saying what needed to be said.”

 










Garfield is soon labeled a progressive politician; an outlier who can put an end to the corrupt, conservative wing of Republican power who backed two-term president Ulysses S. Grant. The power-hungry crew finds its colorful embodiment in Roscoe Conkling (Shea Whigham, going full Whigham as only Shea can), a New York Senator whose control of the port lends him enormous sway and whose friendship with Chester A. Arthur — his unofficial enforcer — lends him an air of invulnerability. If you try to outmaneuver him politically, he'll cut you off at the knees, and if you try to out-muscle him, well, that's what Arthur's brass knuckles are for.

The one tactic they're ill-prepared for is the only one in Garfield's quiver: the truth. When his speech wins over the crowd, they don't know how to counter it. They can barely recognize it, and Garfield rides it all the way to the White House.

But no further. Waiting for him there, fuming from a bench with an unobstructed view of the North Portico, is the living manifestation of dishonesty. Macfadyen's Guiteau is an obvious charlatan; a man so easy to peg as a bad seed that a bank manager remembers him from a single confrontation five years earlier. So it's only fitting that after being rejected by a proper professional, Guiteau literally scurries across the street into the arms of improper politicians. As soon as he hears the name “President Grant,” he's barging through the gathered crowd, declaring himself “one of your biggest boosters” and concocting tall tales with just enough truth to sound plausible… if any other man was spouting them.

 










In the sober light of day, Arthur takes one look at the leach before him and wrenches it from its prey. “Hit the road, chief,” he says. “We ain't buying.” But how the promptly dismissed Guiteau shifts into a Cousteau worth defending is more than a matter of counting the whiskeys Arthur consumes. Once Charles latches onto an idea, be it how he sees himself or what he needs from others, he's a dog with a bone, and the kindness (or indulgence) of strangers becomes one too many scraps tossed to a desperate animal. He's relentless, shameless, and the only person willing to believe his own lies. To those who want to see the best in their fellow man, he's also pitiable, which protects Guiteau from Garfield himself during one of their few, brief meetings. 

And makes Macfadyen the perfect performer to play him. Having graduated with honors from the “Succession” School of Suck-Ups and Sycophants, the English actor applies the same cringey eagerness to his courtships with various power players, just as he finds immense pathos in the fleeting moments when Charles has to face the cold truth of his character. As a snake consistently twisting itself into knots to be seen as anything but itself, it's a credit to Macfadyen that there's no mistaking Guiteau's precise identity throughout “Death by Lightning.” His true self comes tumbling out in between every lie, and that's because Macfadyen makes sure of it. 

 










In his last project, “Bad Education,” Makowsky studied another charlatan. Frank Tassone (played by Hugh Jackman in his best performance to date) is fueled by personal entitlement. He works hard, helps his students get into good colleges, and therefore deserves the $2 million he embezzles from Long Island public schools. That's the promise oof the American dream, isn't it? That if you put in the work, you'll be rewarded for it. Well, the American public school system doesn't abide by dream logic, and “Bad Education” makes sure to expose the structural inequities that contributed to Frank's scandal, while still acknowledging the personal demons that led him astray. 

Here, however, Makowsky examines a purely ignoble figure who feels entitled without accomplishing a thing. As far as the show is concerned, Guiteau never works hard. (He dismisses his sister's offer to work at a patent office because that's a “business for those who lack their own ideas.”) He doesn't help anyone but himself. (His poor sister supports him again and again, nearly at the cost of her life.) He doesn't deserve anything, and yet he still demands everything. Moreover, he expects the President of the United States to make sure he gets it.

Guiteau is an angry white man, too resolute in his self-regard to accept blame for his own misfortunes and too stupid in his understanding of public service to realize the most powerful man in the country may have greater responsibilities than finding work for an asshole who won't do any. The modern parallels are as striking as their centuries-old existence is deflating, but you'll mainly feel emboldened by the end of “Death by Lightning.” 

 










Despite its dubious conclusion regarding the American experiment, the practitioners are realized with such vivacity and the goal glimpsed with such a warm glow, it's hard not to want to start the whole thing over and try again. The way things are headed, maybe we can. Until then, perhaps it's best to take Arthur's advice when asked what to do amid dark times.

“We get fucking sloshed, that's what.” 

“Death by Lightning” premieres Thursday, November 6 on Netflix. All four episodes will be released at once.

Defying an assumption we would have made with some confidence at pretty much any point between, like, 1998 and today, the American entertainment industry has apparently pushed Snoop Dogg's ability to self-promotionally appear in things to its limit. Admittedly, it took the confluence of the planet's biggest ice-based sporting event and its largest party holiday to do it, as Mr. Dogg reported today that he will be canceling his planned live NBC New Year's special, Snoop Dogg's New Year's Eve, in favor of focusing more of his energies on the Winter Olympics.

This is per Deadline, reporting on a statement from the rapper/professional appearer-in-things, who said that “Sometimes the calendar gets in the way of the celebration, which is why my NBC family and I decided this winter was time for us all to focus on the Olympics. But don't worry, we'll party together bigger and better later in 2026. Ya dig.”

Ya dig indeed, as NBC has clearly decided that getting Snoop's energy on hand for the Winter Games—after he was a breakout hit at the network's very expensive Paris coverage back in 2024—will be key to making next year's Winter Olympics pop. (The Games are scheduled to take up most of next February, and are set for Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy; apparently, when Snoop Dogg puts on a New Year's Eve party, he does so in such a way that it makes him unavailable for luge commentary duties for at least a month.)

The question now is what NBC will put on in the event's place, or whether it'll worry about it at all. (There's not enough time to organize a whole new New Year's event, apparently, although we've done some pretty bold things in less time with a couple of lovingly burnt mix CDs, and a cocktail best described as “Anything sold on the bottom shelf of the liquor store that happens to be blue.”) The network has been inconsistent about handling the holiday, in recent years to the point that it just ran a football game last year, since New Year's fell on Sunday anyway; in previous years, it tapped Miley Cyrus to handle its competition for ABC's regular Ryan Seacrest-focused offerings.

Reality TV fans will surely recognize Teddi Wright from Season 26 of “The Bachelor” with Clayton Echard and Season 8 of “Bachelor in Paradise,” which saw her leave during week two. In the time since, Teddi has found love offscreen. 

First opening up about her relationship with Nicholas Meyers in 2022 via Instagram, the pair then became engaged in April 2023, before getting married that November. Now, Teddi has revealed that they're expecting their first child.

Teddi took to Instagram to make the big announcement, sharing photos of herself and Nicholas at the beach together. Holding hands, smiling at each other and sharing a kiss, the parents-to-be look incredibly happy in the pics. Beyond that, Teddi shows off her baby bump both in a form-fitting black top as well as a light white shirt that exposes her belly.

She then took to the caption to write, “WE ARE HAVING A BABY!! can't believe I'm making a tiny human with my favorite person 🥹 #early2026 🤍”

When Teddi posted the baby news on Instagram, her friends and followers made it clear that they were excited for her and Nicholas.

One person wrote, “Eek!!!!! So excited for you guys! You'll be the best parents! 🤍”

“Aw Teddi! So precious! Congrats sweetness 💝,” another person added.

A third person left a comment saying, “Oh my goodness! Congrats sweet friend 🥹”

“Congratulations pretty Mama!! ❤️❤️,” came from another follower.

Yet another fan wrote, “You are absolutely glowing! 😍 So happy for you both.”

Before Teddi revealed that she's pregnant, she opened up about her wedding while talking to People.

Recalling the first look on the big day, Teddi recalled, “We were both so nervous, so it was so nice to see him ahead of time and just remember that these moments are what it is all about!”

She also noted the role their families filled during the wedding. Along with the fact that Teddi's father-in-law acted as the officiant, she noted, “All of our siblings were in our wedding.” 

Teddi explained each of their roles, saying, “My brother walked my mother down the aisle. His brothers were in the groomsmen party. My sister was my maid of honor and walked down the aisle with her husband and two sons as the ring bearers — they looked so cute in their tiny suits!”

In the sort of legal action that makes us want to cry into our Kleenex while xeroxing Photoshopped pictures of our Jet Skis, the Motion Picture Association has made it clear that it is not happy that Meta and Instagram have been using the term “PG-13” to refer to its upcoming guidelines for teen users. PG-13 is, after all, a trademark of the group (formerly billed as the MPAA, now sans final A), which puts a lot of work into ensuring that a “PG-13 movie” is what it says it is, not some more generic understanding of teen-appropriate content.

Specifically, the group has now (per Variety) issued a cease and desist order to Meta, ordering that it stop using “PG-13” as a way to describe its new teen-focused accounts. “The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public's trust in its rating system,” the letter, sent late in October, asserts. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta's automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA's rating system.”

The issue here points back to a Meta Blog post from mid-October, when the company explicitly used the MPA's rating structure as a benchmark for what would, and would not, be allowed on its newly deployed teen accounts. “Teens will see content on Instagram that's similar to what they'd see in a PG-13 movie,” the blog's writer asserted, apparently not cluing in to the idea that the whole concept of “PG-13” remains owned by a non-profit corporation that's extremely vigorous in pursuing and protecting its trademarks.

Among other things, the MPA sounds pissed that its own rating and curation work might end up getting smooshed together in the public consciousness with what Meta's doing, work that is likely to rely heavily on automation. “Meta's attempts to restrict teen content literally cannot be ‘guided by' or ‘aligned with' the MPA's PG-13 movie rating because Meta does not follow [the MPA's] curated process,” the letter notes. “Instead, Meta's content restrictions appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence or other automated technology measures.”

For its part, Meta has popped back with the response that typically crops up in these sorts of conversations about how trademarked materials get genericized, i.e., that obviously it wasn't trying to claim that content would actually be PG-13-rated, and that it's just a shorthand for a set of restrictions that most Americans are fairly familiar with. (Noting that it used “publicly available PG-13 standards” to set the new guidelines.) None of which seems likely to mollify the MPA, which knows better than most that you have to nip these kinds of things in the bud, lest you find yourself having to take an aspirin after weeping too hard into your Jell-O over having your trademark get genericized out from under you.

Universal Music Publishing Group, which owns Dylan's song catalog, says it has a "longstanding policy" of keeping his compositions out of political projects. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Bob Dylan's “The Times They Are A-Changin'” scored New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's final advertisement before his election night victory — but the campaign spot has now been removed from X amid a licensing rejection from Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG).


	The ad, posted by Mamdani's various social media accounts just before polls closed on Tuesday (Nov. 4), featured the caption “New York is a-changin'” and a montage of scenes from the 34-year-old progressive's campaign set to Dylan's famous protest song. Mamdani was declared the winner of the race Tuesday night, beating former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.


	But as first reported by the New York Times, the ad has since been taken down from X and replaced by a notice reading, “This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.” The video is still available on Instagram and TikTok. 


	It was not immediately clear who requested that the video be taken down from the social media platform, but a source familiar with the situation tells Billboard that UMPG, which has owned Dylan's publishing catalog since 2020, previously denied a request from Mamdani's campaign to license the composition.


	Reached for comment on the matter on Wednesday (Nov. 5), a spokesperson for UMPG said, “As a longstanding policy, we do not license Bob Dylan compositions for projects involving political figures.”


	The Mamdani campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. A rep for Sony Music, which owns Dylan's master recordings, declined to comment. Representatives from Instagram owner Meta and TikTok did not immediately respond to questions about whether the platforms also received takedown notices for the ad.


	While individual social media users are free to soundtrack their videos with songs covered by blanket licenses, advertisements must get clearance from copyright owners via a so-called sync license.


	Failure to get a sync license for a political video creates potential legal liability, as Billboard has recently reported in the wake of President Donald Trump's administration posting TikTok videos featuring Taylor Swift's No. 1 single “The Fate of Ophelia” and Zach Bryan's track “Revival.”

Jarrett “JT” Thomas gave fans a look at his new life—in Bali.  The former “Southern Charm” star opened up about the major change she made to his life one year after his sudden exit from the show weeks before the season 10 premiere.

In a video posted to Instagram on Nov. 5, Thomas explained that with his home country “imploding,” his goal was to “quickly find a new community of friends.”

“I came to this  ‘secret garden' estate earlier this year as I explored all over Asia in case s— hit the fan in the US,” he captioned the clip. “When I hit the eject button last week… I came straight back to the secret garden and reunited with this lovely family in paradise. Four days in, we've got some friendships brewing, and the core family didn't forget me. 🌱❤️”

In the video, Thomas explained, “When your country's imploding, you gotta leave sometimes and start something new for a while.'

The “Southern Charm” alum added that he sold everything he owned and embarked on a new journey in Bali, Indonesia. “Retired, at least for the time being,” he said.

Thomas then walked along the secret community where he is living, which is run by a Balinese family. He waved to a handyman on the site and introduced viewers to his “new sister,” her children, and the family dog.  “So now I am part of the family, the Balinese family,” he said. “Living in our secret garden.”

He also gave a brief tour of the garden, which includes a series of small houses adorned with coconut trees out front, a pool, and a yoga pavilion.

“They've taken me under their wing,” Thomas said of his new family. “I explained that I needed some friends.”

“It's starting to feel like home,“ he added of his new accommodations.

Thomas said he will leave Bali in a year, or maybe three, depending on how things go with U.S. elections next November.

The former North Carolina businessman first told fans about his plans on an Instagram post on  Nov. 2, “So today's the first day of my new journey in life,” he said in the video. “I have pulled the ripcord, and I am living in Bali. Just retired. Retired, living in Bali, after living my whole life in the US.”

He added that he will stay in Bali “until things become normal again, if that ever happens.”

Thomas was a cast member on the 9th and 10th seasons of “Southern Charm,” but his final season on the show didn't end well.

On November 8, 2024, he posted a message to Instagram to announce that he informed Bravo he would not be completing his remaining confessional interviews and that he no longer wished “to participate in any ways moving forward with the show.”

“I will leave it at that for now while I work on next steps to recover both physically and mentally from what has been an extremely challenging and exhausting year,” Thomas said of the stressful season, in which he was ostracized by most of the cast amid a love triangle involving his former best friend Venita Aspen.

Thomas returned for the “Southern Charm” reunion earlier this year, but it's clear that chapter of his life is now closed.

Adios man child … maybe grow up and come back ..or just stay in Bali

Guns N' Roses continues to be the rock band that keeps on giving (opportunities for its members to appear in court), as a former manager for the band has now sued it over claims that he's been blocked from releasing a memoir about his time in the Axl Rose trenches. Specifically, Billboard reports that Alan Niven—who managed the group during six of the most pivotal years of its multi-decade run, including the period when 1987's Appetite For Destruction saw them shoot up into international renown—is suing Guns N' Roses, claiming that a non-disclosure settlement he signed while getting fired in 1991 doesn't hold legal weight.

That's relevant in so far as Niven (who also managed Great White from 1982 through 1985) has written a new book, Sound N' Fury: Rock N' Roll Stories, which is currently languishin' in' warehouses over threats of legal action' from the band. (“Thousands of copies of Sound N' Fury have been printed and continue to incur storage expenses,” according to legal documents.) While Niven admits he signed an agreement not to talk about Guns N' Roses when he departed in 1991—after Rose reportedly refused to release Use Your Illusion until Niven was fired—he says the agreement is null for multiple reasons. For one, Rose himself has talked at least a bit of shit about Niven over the years, opening up room for the manager to rebut; more importantly, Niven claims that while most of the band's members signed the termination agreement, Axl didn't, which, yes, is extremely easy to imagine of 1990s-era Axl Rose.

Niven is clearly harboring his own negative feelings about all this—his legal filing include allegations that he was “betrayed” by the band—but basically just wants a judge to say it's okay for him to release his book. (Among other things, his lawyers claim it's not clear who's actually trying to stop the release from the GNR camp, asserting, “It is unclear who is attempting to enforce the agreement now, and whether they have standing to do so.”) The band itself—currently on the tail end of a tour featuring Rose, Slash, and Duff McKagan, among others—hasn't responded to Niven's lawsuit as of yet.

	Ten months after unleashing his last of many star-studded music sessions, Bizarrap returns with Daddy Yankee in tow for a new “BZRP Music Session.” 


	Titled “BZRP Music Sessions #0/66”— which can easily be interpreted as the first of 66 brand new sessions — the collaboration between the Argentine hitmaker and Puerto Rican global star was announced Tuesday (Nov. 4) on social media just hours before it officially dropped on Wednesday.


	In the nearly three-minute-long track, DY returns to his roots spitting bars and rhymes over a reggaetón drum. The electric beat speeds up at some points for that rhythmic DY approach, reminiscent of previous hits, including “Llamada de Emergencia.” In the Biza-produced session, he sings about that positive essence that's guiding his latest projects. 

	











	“If you ask me, I owe nothing to anyone,” DY sings. “When I leave here, I won't take anything with me, I will just leave [feeling] true love, my feet on the ground, always looking up at the sky.” 




	“BZRP Music Sessions #0/66” marks Biza's comeback after releasing “BZRP Music Sessions #61” alongside Billboard's former Latin Artist on the Rise Luck Ra last December.


	The collaboration also comes just weeks after Daddy Yankee's Superstar Q&A panel at Billboard Latin Music Week 2025, where he sat with Billboard's Leila Cobo for a one-hour-long conversation about his personal and professional rebirth after his conversion to Christianity. 


	“I feel reborn, reenergized, and truly joyful with everything I'm experiencing,” he said then. “The personal, spiritual, and faith-based change certainly feels good in my heart. Each person has a different purpose and design. Everyone has a purpose to fulfill in their lives, and mine was this path: to forefront popular culture, announcing the Kingdom — that's a challenge. My father is so strategic that he's calling many people.”

"It fell on my desk through my agent as something with the possibility to adapt. I laughed because I thought it was inherently not theatrical. Still, the idea got its hooks in me because it seems so far from plausible," admits playwright Levi Holloway as we discuss the stage production of Paranormal Activity.

The multimillion-dollar film franchise has spawned seven films so far, and now a theatrical production that has garnered solid audiences and reviews in Chicago is headed to Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre, with plans to arrive in London's iconic West End in early 2026. Holloway, working with producer Simon Friend, Punchdrunk's founder and artistic director, Felix Barrett, and illusionist Chris Fisher. 

"I spoke with Felix a couple of times, and we really hit it off. We were so simpatico in our notion of the genre and our love for the uncanny, the strange, and 1970s horror, as well as great films like Don't Look Now and Jacob's Ladder. They are pretty far afield from Paranormal Activity, but we liked the dare of it in terms of adapting it for the stage," the writer recalls. "I came up with a loose pitch that was mostly ridiculous, and Paramount, Simon, and Felix all bit. Paramount didn't lay down a hefty mandate. They just said, 'It should probably be about a couple who are haunted by something,' and that was it. It was tonal and it wasn't prescriptive at all. We did have many masters to serve, so it was our pleasure to run amok all over any mythology they had created, not as a reduction, but because we wanted to do our own thing."

Whereas the Paranormal Activity movies are set in the US, the stage production moves the action to the UK. In the story, James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape the past, but they soon discover that places aren't haunted, people are. So what made Holloway want to take this transatlantic to a city known for its ghosts?"It's a really boring answer," he laughs. "I live in Chicago, and I had to go to London to meet Felix over the course of a year, and I became completely enamored with the city. I also got deeply involved in my research on the spiritualist movement, Victorian-era mediums, the Davenport Brothers, Spirit cabinets, the UK's relationship with the aftermath of World War One, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Part of it was that it was the life I was living. I was newly married, so I was like, 'Okay, well, how about a couple from Chicago going to London for work?' What a big stretch of the imagination." 

"You are right, though, in saying London is drenched in ghost stories and folklore, and it just feels a lot more tactile over there. It was an exciting sandbox to be in. In any good horror story, you have to isolate your main characters and you have to answer the question right away, especially in a play." 

The question Holloway put at the heart of the story was a simple one: Why don't they run? He partly answered it with the production design.

"My goal was to have a single set. When it comes to horror on stage, I think it serves the work well to keep your characters on one set and to make that set a character in itself," he reveals. "I wanted to make them strangers in a strange land that was familiar, but somehow not familiar, with that sheen of bizarro over it. This version of Paranormal Activity isn't about demons, God, the devil, or anything else; it's about ghosts. My idea of a ghost is that people are haunted, not places, so that's another reason you can't run."

Paranormal Activity takes place on a single set, but that set is a multi-level house, which complicates things and can lead to mishaps."When I wrote the script, I set it in a two-story house, half imagining what that execution would be. Fly Davis is our scenic designer and has done an incredible job," Holloway enthuses. "I knew that to honor what the film does, you have to immerse the audience and instantly make them into a community, sitting in the dark, watching something they shouldn't be watching. That reminded me of Rear Window or When a Stranger Calls. As the Paranormal Activity movies do, we wanted to weaponize the mundane." 

"In the films, it's just a couple in a house, and it's unremarkable, but the set is designed within an inch of its life. Everything is alive in that house, but figuratively, and has a narrative responsibility tied to it. If you're an audience member, you can watch the nucleus of the action. You watch a married couple very familiar to you, arguing in the kitchen, but if your eye wanders up to the bedroom upstairs, maybe a little piece of storytelling is up there, too. It felt like a great way to pull the audience in, but, like you say, 100 million things can go wrong. It's a very treacherous piece of design in terms of all those possibilities for error."

With tension being key to Paranormal Activity's success in keeping things intimate and audiences on the edge of their seats, does that limit the production from playing specific venues? It's a problem easily solved.

"You have to serve a lot of masters when you're trying to dream up something like that, but a lot of it you don't have control over," Holloway muses. "If your biggest problem is that the house you've placed your show in is too big, that's a pretty good problem to have. You do need intimacy. If we were in an arena, I would have some concerns, but I think we're pretty confident that the intimacy holds even in a huge house. Right now, in Chicago, I think we seat around 700, and that's not nothing. The bigger the house, if you're lucky enough to sell tickets, the more community you have out there, and the more buy-in you get from the audience because your neighbor is as freaked out as you are. When you place it in a too small a house, the texture may change, which might cause the audience to withhold their response. There's something about safety and numbers that I think works very well for the show."

If you've been lucky enough to see Paranormal Activity already and plan to see it again in another city, don't expect the same show, as it continues to evolve. "I write for the actor, I write for the human, so those scenes would change from what we've done before. We learn more about what's honest, what isn't, and what is more impactful," Holloway reveals. "There's always that gap between intent and impact, but it changes all the time, and it streamlines, and it mostly just gets pared down to the point where over the course of two iterations, I've lost about 30 pages off the script. It's very lean in pages, because it doesn't ask for much more than that." 

"I always think there's a lot more storytelling in the negative space than in the ink. I only have so much confidence in the ink. I have much more confidence in every other artist in the room, from actor to designer, to fill in that in the negative space of the page, so a lot of the story is in the silence. It's a negative space which is on brand with the films."

As we conclude our chat, one thing we've been very clear about is steering clear of spoilers. The reason for this is that the best way to experience the show is to know nothing about what happens, except for the basic storyline. Holloway is so grateful that audiences have understood that and not revealed the surprises. 

"You have to guard your monster," the playwright concludes. "There are some things you can't withhold from an audience. They know from the title that they're going to get paranormal activity. In terms of the pieces of spectacle, the rug pulls, and the puzzle box that we tried to create for the audience to work out the math for themselves, I've been grateful that many of the audience members are really engaged. I think that when you're dealing with a piece of work like this, it creates something conspiratorial in the audience, a shared experience that becomes precious to them. That's the hope. They should be like, 'No, I saw Paranormal Activity and you should too. We'll talk when you do.' For now, that seems to be holding."

In its North American premiere production from Nov 13 to Dec 7

Center Theatre Group presents Paranormal Activity in its North American premiere production, running November 13 to December 7 at the Ahmanson Theatre as the third attraction of its 2025-2026 season. Based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film difranchise, the original story from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at the McKittrick Hotel, promises thrills and chills galore!



The play centers around newly married couple James and Lou who move from Chicago to London to escape the past. But they soon discover that places aren't haunted and deeply hidden secrets about each other will make them question how well can you really know another person? And can you even believe your eyes?

Here's my conversation with Levi Holloway on the development of the play, how it relates to the film franchise, and the creation of the special effects-filled Ahmanson production.

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today, Levi. I have read about your history of night terrors and dreams. How did that draw you to write plays filled with both horror and humor?

My dream life has always been a confounding, critical part of my identity. When I sleep, I rarely find myself at rest - I think some inner, secret me is trying to say something important. A story about who I am or what the world means to me. I don't know. But I'm led by those stories and try to put them down in ink in a shape that makes sense to me as soon as I wake. Most of my plays come from that. To me, plays, like dreams, have no rules. As far as mixing horror and humor, well, I try to bring as much light as I can into dark places.

Describe working with collaborator Felix Barrett on the production in Chicago which runs just prior to the Los Angeles production.

Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London - working to create an actual nightmare - has been a dream. We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror, right alongside all the mischief we're made to trouble their sleep.

I like to think Felix and I are the same species of storyteller, though really that's giving myself too much credit. We do share a language though, especially when it comes to the horror space. He's so thoughtful, agile, and creative. Full of mischief. And I love the way he sees the world. It's very contagious. Working with him has made me a better artist.

Paranormal Activity draws themes from the award-winning film series of the same name, a franchise of seven horror films that follow supernatural hauntings, primarily centered around a demonic entity. Is that part of your play?

When writing Paranormal, I really only ever concerned myself with the first film. To me, it's a very strong lesson in restraint, in the notion of less being more. I wasn't very compelled by the ideas surrounding a ‘demonic entity' which isn't a reduction - just something I don't have much to say about.

I was more interested in a ghost story. I think we're all haunted in some way. And I think a marriage can bring many ghosts. From the past and present, from the dead and the living. I think when we enter into a marriage, we're forced to contend with those ghosts, to appease them somehow. I wanted to write about how sometimes broken people find each other and try to fix one another, and how often that is an entirely tragic and fruitless endeavor.

Are the two characters in Paranormal Activity, newly-married couple James and Lou, related to the first film's characters Katie and Micah? How so? And if not, how did you develop them?

They are not related. James and Lou are my invention and like all my characters, much of me is in them. I think all writers do that, place themselves, however abstracted, within the people they create. It's the only way I know how to do it, anyway.

Have you previously worked with the two actors (Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger) who portray them? Or the others in the cast? (Shannon Cochran, Kate Fry) If so, where and when?

I've never worked with them but have been a fan of their work for a long time. Patrick and I met as teenagers and I've watched and admired his career since. I'm very glad to have gotten the chance to finally collaborate with him. Shannon and Kate, too, are some of my favorite artists working on the stage. It's quite an ensemble we have, quite the weaponry.

Why did you decide to set the play in London, and why do the characters move there from Chicago?

It's partially a product of a limited imagination. I was traveling from Chicago to London over the course of a year while developing the play. So, I was writing from much of my own experience. I also wanted to isolate the characters, give them no connections abroad. Make them alone together. It's another version of a cabin in the woods.

How does staging this play differ from the experience of watching the movies?

Film directors and editors can manipulate the way you see the characters and story through camera focus and stylistic editing. We don't have the luxury of doing that on stage since everything is done live and in the moment. So, we must capture the attention of the audience from moment to moment to make them feel what they are seeing is real, even if they don't believe their eyes. To accomplish this, we like to hide in plain sight and invite audiences in to bear witness to things they should not see.

Does that “we” refer to illusions by Tony Award winner Chris Fisher (Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter & The Cursed Child) which will again haunt us long after leaving the theater? Can you describe the process the two of us use to create that magic onstage?

No matter what uncanny, absolutely strange idea Felix and I came up with, Chris never said no. He's a mischief maker too. He's a brilliant engineer, making our nightmares materialize. I suspect people will talk about his work on this show for a very long time to come.

How did the two of you work in collaboration with the entire production team, including Fly Davis (Scenic & Costume Designer), Anna Watson (Lighting Designer), Gareth Fry (Sound Designer), Luke Halls (Video & Projections Designer), and Melanie J. Lisby (Production Stage Manager) to make them happen realistically?

Felix, myself and the designers worked together over the course of a year developing, horror-scaping the show. We'd meet and throw ideas at the wall, laughing all the while, delighted by each other's messed up imaginations. It felt like kids in a treehouse, holding flashlights in the dark, never picking truth - always only dare. I can't say enough about them as people and artists and what this collaboration has meant to me. I'm very lucky.

Please describe if and how cast members were frightened by any of the special effects the first time they took place in rehearsal.

The actors have been very brave. It's not easy, holding your body in a near constant state of tension and fear day after day. Even when you see how the sausage is made, it doesn't mean you want to eat it.

Please allow me to change direction for a minute. As someone who also works with special needs actors in the theatre, tell me about your reasons behind co-founding the Neverbird Project, a youth based deaf and hard of hearing theatre company specializing in working with deaf children and creating theatre for deaf people. And are you still actively involved with the project?

I spent nearly 20 years as an educator in Chicago, and a lot of that time was spent in Deaf classrooms. Best job I ever had. I saw the opportunity to give those young artists some work and took it. 90% of the plays I write feature a Deaf character. I plan for that to always be the case. I hope very soon to return to those classrooms, when life allows it. I miss it, them.

Thanks so much!

Legends really don't ever die, we guess


	By Tony Alpsen

With everyone having Google in their pocket at all times, we'd finally have reached a point where we could put this whole urban legend thing behind us. But lo and behold, here we are in 2025 with people still thinking that Steve from Blue's Clues died from a heroin overdose decades ago. Don't even get us started with Little Mikey from the Life cereal commercials dying from a fatal mixture of Pop Rocks and Coke. Both of them are alive and well, by the way—the last we checked, at least. While we're in this area, we thought we'd take a look at some of the more persistent myths out there, particularly the ones that have affected the world of comedy. Such as…

Texas stand-up hero Bill Hicks died in 1994 at just 32 years old after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer. That's how the “official” story goes anyway; “official” in this case meaning “true.” What's the unofficial story, you ask? Well, some would have you believe that Hicks didn't actually die all those years ago, and that he went on to become infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. How do the people who proposed this theory account for Hicks and Jones having wildly different ideologies? To put it as briefly as it should be: He's under the control of the CIA.

Perhaps one of the earliest rumors ever spread on the internet was that Paul Pfeiffer, best friend of Kevin Arnold on the late '80s/early '90s sitcom The Wonder Years, grew up to be controversial rock star Marilyn Manson. Josh Saviano, the actual actor who played Paul, first heard the rumor from his The Wonder Years co-star Danica McKellar when he was in college, and they've both been asked about it ad nauseam ever since. Saviano didn't even know who Manson (whose real name is Brian Warner) was at the time, but hoped to one day get onstage at one of his concerts and put the rumor to bed for good. He's also been told that he was really Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney, but he's pretty sure that's not true either.

Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro was the subject of a persistent rumor following his appearance in a Pepsi commercial with Michael Jackson back in 1984. Shortly thereafter, word had gotten around that the young Ribeiro had broken his neck while breakdancing on the set of the commercial. And although newspapers tried to dispel the rumors, people would still come up to him on the street and ask how he was alive. Apparently, they think he's supposed to be dead, which, of course, can't be true because he's still on TV to this day; and don't you dare try to convince us that Bill Hicks has been hosting America's Funniest Home Videos this whole time.

Well-known prankster Andy Kaufman, like Bill Hicks, passed away from cancer in his 30s. However, his penchant for practical jokes has led many to believe that he faked his death in 1984. Several people who knew him have said in the years since that he talked about doing just that in private conversations, and a documentary exploring the possibility was released in 2023. Kaufman's brother, Michael, even helped keep the idea of the hoax alive when he brought a woman on stage in 2013 who said that she was Andy's daughter and that her comedian father really had faked his death. Michael Kaufman later backtracked, saying he had, in fact, been the victim of a hoax perpetrated by the woman.

It's a code, it's a frequency, it's ... something extraterrestrial?

Whatever it is, it's about to change Carol Sturka's (Rhea Seehorn) life. Seehorn leads the new Apple TV+ series from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul  creator Vince Gilligan, which sees Earth's population afflicted with a mysterious virus. Well, everyone but Carol it seems.

Entertainment Weekly has an exclusive look at the mystery's beginnings with a sneak peek of the first four minutes of the sci-fi series, which feature a group of people trying to decode a very interesting signal from ... somewhere. It's like Morse Code. But it's also not. It repeats every 78 seconds and uses pulses and frequencies. It's not bouncing off the moon. And perhaps most importantly, it's coming from 600 lightyears away. "Imagine the power it took to send it," one of the characters says.

Apple TV+

Just as someone says, "I think I know what it is," the series' title card appears. Welcome to Pluribus.

Although Gilligan certainly made a name for himself in more recent years with his beloved dramas, a sci-fi series isn't new to the former X-Files writer — though the premise of Earth's most miserable person having to save humanity from happiness certainly is.

Seehorn's Carol is the aforementioned miserable person, a best-selling author of historical romance novels, whose life is turned upside down when a virus sweeps the planet. As maybe the only person immune to said virus, Carol is left with a lot of questions.

“The drama of the show is that the world's most miserable person is desperately trying to save the planet from happiness,” Gilligan previously told EW, later adding, “She doesn't really want to be tasked with saving the world, but she more or less feels like it's her duty.”

Gilligan created the show specifically with Seehorn in mind, whom he'd worked with across six seasons of Saul. “Initially I was thinking in terms of a male protagonist because that's how I think, being a guy,” he said. “But then I thought, well, what about Rhea? She's so good. She's so funny when she wants to be, but can also break your heart when she wants to.”

See how Seehorn's Carol deals when Pluribus premieres Friday, Nov. 7, on Apple TV+.

Astronauts could soon be able to move with greater ease, thanks to a soft robotic exosuit developed by researchers at the University of Bristol.Not only does the technology have extraterrestrial benefits, but it could also help people who need support with their mobility on earth, too. The soft robotic exosuit is designed to resemble a garment and is mostly made of fabric material. Worn underneath the spacesuit, the exosuit features artificial muscles that work automatically to help astronauts reduce muscular fatigue while maintaining natural movements during future Moon and Mars missions. Last month, Dr Emanuele Pulvirenti, Research Associate in the University of Bristol's Soft Robotics Lab, travelled to the University of Adelaide, Australia, home to the Exterres CRATER facility – the largest simulated lunar environment in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, the exosuit was tested as part of an international ‘proof of concept' simulated space mission run by the Austrian Space Forum.Dubbed the ‘World's Biggest Analog', the mission saw 200 scientists from 25 countries working together on different experiments and operational simulations across four continents and reporting back to the mission control base in Austria. The ADAMA mission, organised by ICEE.space, was the first time a soft robotic exosuit had been integrated into a spacesuit, and the first field test of its kind. The experiments evaluated comfort, mobility and biomechanical effects when performing planetary surface tasks ,such as walking, climbing and load-carrying on loose terrain. Dr Pulvirenti handmade the exosuit himself, teaching himself to sew as part of the process. “Fortunately, my grandmother worked as a tailor and she was able to give me some advice,” Dr Pulvirenti said. He developed the lightweight exosuit alongside Vivo Hub colleagues at the University of Bristol. The artificial muscles in the suit consist of two layers: an outer nylon layer and an inner thermoplastic layer that allows airtight inflation.The anchoring components, such as the waistband and knee straps, are made from Kevlar for high strength and tension resistance. Dr Pulvirenti said: “The hope is that this technology could pave the way for future wearable robotic systems that enhance astronaut performance and reduce fatigue during extra-vehicular surface activities.   “I would love to continue developing this technology so that it could eventually be tested at the International Space Station.” “It's exciting that this technology could also potentially benefit people too,” Dr Pulvirenti continued. “This exosuit is assistive, meaning it artificially boosts the lower-limb muscles, but we have also separately developed a resistive exosuit, which applies load to the body to help maintain muscle mass. “Our next goal is to create a hybrid suit that can switch between assistance and resistance modes as needed, which could be of great benefit for people in need of support with mobility going through physical rehabilitation.”

Celebrity medium Anthony Mrocka started as a skeptic, including toward his first mentor, who spotted him at a free public event and offered to help him. He had always felt psychic readings and all their trappings were a money grab, so he declined. Then she offered to mentor him and help him develop his gifts for free. That's when he became open to the possibility that he might actually have a gift. 

Once you start paying attention, you'll probably notice some weird things start happening, weird things Mrocka told Andrea Miller on the Getting Open podcast. Even more fascinating? Halfway through the episode, Miller admits that after meeting Mrocka, even her brilliant skeptic husband was blown away. 

So, how does it work? Mrocka tells Miller It's like a dream that's so vivid, you wake up and feel a revelation. It's not from you. It comes through you. He also believes everyone is a little psychic, in some ways, and shares how to tap into those "magical" talents. 

Allow yourself to be open to your own possible psychic abilities. You have to open your mind to your own abilities and what may not be as conventional as you have previously thought.

We talk about intuition, gut feelings, sixth senses, and other terms for what can also be seen as psychic abilities. Everything is made of energy, protons, electrons, neutrons, atoms, and molecules. That energy includes us. We just need to tune in to the vibration.

RELATED: My Mother Was Dying — So I Called A Psychic

Silence will tune you in to your energy, and all the energy around you, all the vibrations, all the molecules and atoms caught in their kinetic dance. To find silence, you can quiet your mind through meditation, listening to word-free music, or being still for a set period of time.

Meditation isn't only about concentration. It's not sitting there for hours, chanting, or following a checklist. Mediation is about learning to quiet your mind. Research shows that it benefits many areas of your health, well-being and success, possibly by allowing our busy brains to rest and recover. 

However you choose to do it, according to Mrocka, is fine as long as you start to breathe and start to focus on your breath, so you can learn how breath moves and vibrates with energy. Then you may start to feel the energy around you and realize your energy within it.

Listen to what you hear or sense when you walk into a room or start talking to a person. You're probably already sensing their energy, and the energy of the room. Mrocka met strangers, a few of whom he was immediately able to sense their backstory and the struggle they were carrying. He was able to sense their energy by being open to it and letting it flow through him.

At the base of who we are, underneath all the roles we play, the masks we wear, and the filters we perceive through, we are subatomic particles that are vibrating at a specific level. That is energy, we are that energy, so pay attention, and you can read it and understand it.

RELATED: 11 Signs You're Not Depressed Or Anxious, You Just Have Good Situational Awareness

In order to read and understand the energy around us, within ourselves, and inside other people is by practice. You have to test it by working to develop your sensitivity, then intuition, then psychic powers. You can practice by playing games with friends who are aware of what you are doing.

Mrocka would watch reality competition shows and practice reading the contestants to see who might be eliminated next. Spoiler alert: he got really good at it and could ruin the suspense for anyone who watched the shows with him. He suggests doing the same with sports or whatever you're interested in, simply for a fun way to hone your skills.

Establish your ethics around when and who you try to read. As Mrocka cautions, "It's so apparent to me how inextricably connected we all are through our energy, and the conduit is hugely in our emotions." Thus, we need to be responsible with how we use our energy.

You don't want to tune in to someone without their permission. Mrocka told Miller how, at the beginning, it wasn't going around purposely trying to tune into people. When he would walk by these people and immediately understand everything about them, it was part of his awakening. Once he understood what was happening, he gained better regulation, including something akin to an "off switch".

RELATED: 5 Questions To Ask Yourself Before You See A Psychic Or Medium

Realize you've taken on other people's energy, so it is important to have some sort of self-protection. Especially going out into the world, and especially in the world we're in right now. 

Mrockas says, "Grounding is always going to be the easiest number one way. Just going and putting your bare feet onto the grass somewhere. The other thing is Epsom salt baths. It will make you like new. It's the salt. That's why the ocean is so cleansing."

It's easy to be a skeptic, but there's no real risk in being open to your own sensitivities, even if you don't believe they're psychic. We are all made of the same energy from the same stars.

CELEBRITY FAMILIES

Riley Keough will soon be honoring her mom's third anniversary since she passed on January 12, 2023. But just because she is no longer on earth, doesn't mean she no longer has moments where she feels connected to her in unexplainable ways - especially since she cowrote her memoir, From Here to the Great Unknown.

Riley attended the Academy x Chanel's Women's Luncheon on Tuesday, November 4, where she told PEOPLE that she believes she has gotten signs from her mom that she approved of the memoir. 

“I think if you're open to those things, they're kind of everywhere,” Keough told PEOPLE.

Riley finished her memoir in 2023 following her passing. “So, I certainly feel connected to whatever that world may be. I do feel connected to it, yeah. There are certainly moments that are very... too weird to not be something,” the Daisy Jones & The Six star shared.

The 36-year-old did not touch on the specific experiences, but said it will be in the afterword of the paperback version of the book, which will be released next week on November 11. 

It's not the first time Riley has had an experience, and it's something she seems to have gotten from her mother.

Lisa Marie, the only child of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, was only nine when her famous father passed away. Leading up to his passing, she seemed to sense what was coming. 

"I'm apprehensive to say this because the headlines can be crazy, but she did have like a thing where she felt connected to… she was very intuitive,” Riley told Drew Barrymore in 2024. 

“And in a way that wasn't like woo-woo, or, you know, in the clouds—it was very kind of grounded and matter-of-fact. And it was pretty incredible," she continued. 

Just as her mom sensed her father Elvis' passing, Riley felt a similar intuition when her mother passed. She was on an airplane, trying to reach her mom, texting her dad, musician Danny Keough, when she sensed that “her mom was departing earth,” as Barrymore described it. 

“I did, yeah. I just had a feeling. I don't know. There had been incidents before—health incidents—and I didn't have the same feeling. Like, I just, I don't know. I felt this sort of surrender in the moment, and yeah, I just had a little bit of a sense,” she said.

Riley even texted her dad to ask if she was gone, and he replied, "Yes, 2 or 3 minutes ago."
