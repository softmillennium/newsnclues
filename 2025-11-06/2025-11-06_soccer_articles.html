                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite facing Champions League holders PSG, Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro inspired Chelsea to a 3-0 victory in the final game of the extended season. Maresca's gain in the 2024/25 season was Mauricio Pochettino's loss after the Argentine had failed to deliver a trophy or Champions League qualification. Despite not being present to see some of his foundations turn into glory, there are no sour grapes from the former Blues boss, who remains adamant Chelsea very much earned their win in the final. He said: “Chelsea was a fair winner, that is your question? I think they were better than Paris Saint-Germain in that game. That showed that in a short period of tournament, how important it is to arrive in a good form. “And I think Chelsea was a fair winner.” With Chelsea players earning £350,000 for winning the competition, they will be hoping they have the opportunity to defend their crown in four years' time. It was reported that Chelsea hadn't given their players suitable time off following the Club World Cup, due to how soon after the new Premier League season got underway. Levi Colwill suffered an ACL injury on the first day of pre-season, and issues to Liam Delap, Cole Palmer and Romeo Lavia have continued to plague them for prolonged periods in the new season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He specifically made a name for himself with Tottenham, where he spent five years between 2014 and 2019, leading the club to a Champions League final appearance. I am so happy in America, but also thinking one day to come back to the Premier League. Pochettino was asked about those comments while speaking with reporters on Thursday following the release of the Americans' 25-player roster for two upcoming 2026 World Cup tune-up matches against Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Chester, Pennsylvania, and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa. "I was involved for 12 years in different clubs like Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea. And it's normal to miss the good times when you spent very good times in someplace. "Maybe if you ask me in five years, or maybe I extend the contract [with U.S. Soccer] for another four years in the USA, and then after seven years or six years I move [to another job] and they ask me, ‘Oh, how do you feel about when you were manager of the national team of USA?' Pochettino lamented that one of the challenging parts about being an international boss vs. a club coach is the lack of contact with players. "We are going to be spending 10 days in Philadelphia and Tampa and then until March, you cannot be together," Pochettino added. "Yes, you can have contact by phone, [text] message or go visit, but it's never the same as when you are working [every day] and that's what you miss the most. "In the way that we work and the way we like to work, how we build our relationship with the player, it is really important to have contact every day. But at the same time, we are learning to build and develop our relationships in a different way. It's never the ideal world, but we will try to evolve as a coaching staff and think of a different strategy to provide the player the possibility to be present even if [there is] distance, and they're in a different environment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) — Hershey native Christian Pulisic will miss the United States' friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay, the next-to-last set of games before coach Mauricio Pochettino calls in players for his pre-World Cup training camp, while Gio Reyna is back on the roster for the first time since March. Midfielder Weston McKennie and goalkeeper Matt Turner were among the notable omissions from the 25-man roster announced Thursday. Forward Ricardo Pepi, midfielder Tyler Adams and defenders Joe Scally, John Tolkin and Auston Trusty are back with the 16th-ranked U.S. for the games against No. Pulisic injured a hamstring in an Oct. 14 friendly against Australia but AC Milan said he likely will be available for Saturday's Serie A match at Parma. Reyna, a son of former captain Claudio Reyna, has played for the U.S. team just once since the 2024 Copa America, appearing as a 69th-minutre sub in the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match loss to Canada. Slowed by a thigh injury following his transfer to Borussia Mönchengladbach, he has been limited to one start and four substitute appearances in the Bundesliga. Pepi and Trusty are back with the team for the first time since Pochettino's second camp in November. Adams missed the October games because his wife was due to give birth. In addition to Pulisic, others missing the matches because they are hurt or recovering from injuries include defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers (Achilles) and Antonee Robinson (knee), winger Tim Weah (thigh), midfielders Malik Tillman (thigh) and Johnny Cardoso (ankle), and goalkeeper Chris Brady (lower body).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Christian Pulisic leads his country to World Cup glory on home soil in 2026, he might not be the first man to get his hands on the trophy. Traditionally it is the captain that lifts the trophy at the end of six weeks of intense competition, but USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino might have to yield to a higher power rather than Pulisic, who wears the armband. Trump famously joined the Chelsea squad on stage during the Club World Cup presentation in July. It caused some confusion at the time, but should Pulisic and the USMNT pull off what would be a famous - and hugely unexpected - victory, there is a plan in place. "For sure, I will give -- in case we win -- I will give him the trophy and he can lift the trophy," Pochettino said. Trump's new-found love of soccer has yet to see him cross paths with Pochettino but the former Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain manager hopes to change that soon. "For sure, it's going to be in Washington. "In case I meet him, I think I'm going to say, 'Thank you for everything that he's doing for soccer in America and the continuing support.' "I think that is great because he's showing his support to football and soccer." Despite boasting stars like captain Pulisic, Fulham defender Antonee Robinson, and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie, the Stars and Stripes will not be among the favorites for a long run in the tournament. Pochettino - who has been dragged into a row with Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner - was a bold appointment, bringing plenty of pedigree, and his expectations are high. Jacobs asked what his goal was come next summer -- and suggested nothing short of President Trump holding the trophy aloft. "Also knowing that it's going to be difficult, but I think our mentality is to win every single game and to compete with no fear and thinking that we can beat any team." Pochettino has won 12 of 20 matches since taking over as manager in 2024, and believes he has been successful in creating a winning culture. After spells in England with Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, Pochettino continues to be linked with a return to the Premier League, most notably back to Spurs who he memorably led to the Champions League final. "With our quality to to try to be intelligent in the way that you build the team and how you are going to compete against these big teams -- talking about Spain, talking about Argentina, talking about England," said the 53-year-old. "I think we can we can be very competitive and create and build a very good team to compete. "And then winning depends on many factors, but they see the mentality is to win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has fired back at Cristiano Ronaldo and urged the club to look to the future, rather than focus on the mistakes made under his regime and those made by previous managers. The United manager has also highlighted the key problem "he cannot allow" to continue holding his team back this season. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo criticised Man Utd's continued struggles, stating the club "don't have a structure" and are "not on a good path". Ronaldo claimed that Amorim could not perform "miracles" with the current set-up and that some players don't have the right mentality for a club of United's stature. The comments came nearly three years after his explosive 2022 interview with Morgan, which led to his departure. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said: "You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have (done) so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary (Neville), Roy Keane, (David) Beckham, they became big players but they had youth. So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. What are you going to do? We say in Portugal, 'miracles is only in Fatima', and he's not going to do miracles." The Miracle of Fatima occurred in Portugal in 1917,  where observers claimed to have seen the sun dance, spin, and appear to fall towards the earth. What we need to focus on is the future. Let's not focus on what happened, let's focus on what we are doing now and we are doing that. We are doing that and we are improving, so let's continue and forget the past." Amorim added: "I think you can attack really well. "These small details that you watched during the last game, we have worked on that. In our last game, they had 17 shots and we cannot allow that. It's something we need to change. We can attack the same way, score even more goals, but we need to defend better." Spurs have an excellent away record, but have been woeful at home and Amorim believes his side have improved since losing the final in Bilbao. Amorim said: "The characteristics of the players, we have different characteristics in our team, but we also have a lot of players who played last year. At this moment, we play with a different confidence. We can play better, but also have a little bit of luck to win the game." He added: "I think we are more confident. The last game was tough on us because in some moments we weren't the team we were supposed to be in every minute. And compare that against Brighton, it was a different thing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'd be hard-pressed to find a more in-form, goal-scoring center back than Christian Gray. Over the past four months, he has scored against Western Springs AFC and Eastern Suburbs in the Northern League, and he also netted a late equalizer in Auckland City's recent draw vs. Auckland FC's reserve side. However, the most important goal of his career came on July 24 — not in his native New Zealand, but in the United States. Having lost their first two matches to Bayern Munich and Benfica by a combined 16-0, Auckland City were already eliminated from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, unlike Boca Juniors, who were seeking to book their ticket to the knockout round with a victory. When Boca opened the scoring in the 26th minute via an own goal, all signs pointed to Auckland suffering yet another heavy defeat in Nashville. Instead, they held firm and reached halftime with a manageable deficit, and in the 52nd minute, they pulled level as Christian Gray headed home from a corner kick. “Coming off the back of the previous results, if we were told that we'd get a point from that game vs. Boca, I don't think anyone would have believed you,” said Gray in an exclusive World Soccer Talk interview. “It was a funny feeling after the game… you're not sure how to react. Like many players such as Sergey Palkin, Diadie Samassékou, and Marco Verratti, he was hooked on soccer from a young age and sought to emulate his father. Initially a striker, Christian transitioned to midfield and later to center back, ultimately following in his father's footsteps by launching his senior career with Waitakere United in 2016. Academically, they were both involved in coaching, and Mum also has a teaching background, so sports were always a big part of my childhood.” Gray moved from Waitakere United to Hamilton Wanderers, then to Birkenhead United and Eastern Suburbs in 2019, before eventually joining Auckland City in January 2022. Unlike New Zealand's two professional clubs, Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix — who play in the Australian league — Auckland City remain an amateur side, and because of that, they compete in the New Zealand top flight. They have not only participated — they have dominated, winning 10 league titles and 13 OFC Champions League trophies, including each of the last four. The tournament was later rebranded and expanded into a 32-team Club World Cup, meaning Auckland would spend a full month abroad and have more chances to prove themselves. We've played against some huge names over the last four years, at big stadiums, and visited countries we might never have seen otherwise. I had the chance to play against Benzema a year after he won the Ballon d'Or, and other legends like Edinson Cavani and Ángel Di María.” He later scored an own goal vs. Birkenhead but responded by helping his team secure wins vs. Western Suburbs and Wellington Olympic, followed by a 1–1 draw with Auckland FC's reserves. “There are always lessons from these matches that we'll take back into the National League. Pyramids are obviously a strong side, so the big thing is taking what we learned and applying it at home.” Gray has become a key figure in Auckland's backline thanks to his timing, awareness, passing quality, and physical bravery. At 29, Gray has faced world-class opposition — yet has not been called up to the New Zealand national team, largely due to not being a professional player. Roskill Intermediate, while also coaching the school's boys' team. “It's been a busy year, juggling everything — especially with all the travel. I'll finish my diploma in December and become a registered teacher.” Whether Gray will someday turn professional or play for the All Whites remains uncertain, but one thing is certain: his goal against Boca Juniors will be remembered as one of the biggest shocks in FIFA Club World Cup history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Upcoming Friendlies vs. World Cup Qualifiers on Nov. 15/18 in suburban Philadelphia and Tampa; ATLANTA / HERRIMAN, Utah (Thursday, November 5, 2025) – Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna has been named by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino amongst the 25 players selected for upcoming U.S. friendlies on Sun., Nov. 15 and Wed., Nov. 18 against World Cup-bound opponents Paraguay – which will feature Luna's RSL teammate Braian Ojeda – and Uruguay, the two South American nations ranked 15th and 16th globally. Luna – RSL's 2025 Golden Boot winner with 10 goals and seven assists across all competitions in this most recent season – surpassed his goal output from last year in fewer MLS matches. All but one of Luna's career national team appearances have come this year. Earlier this year, Luna earned the game-winning assist during his first 45 minutes played under Pochettino, suffering a shattered nose in the process, during a January friendly against Costa Rica.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (Nov. 6, 2025) - Gotham FC midfielder Jaedyn Shaw has signed a contract extension through the 2029 season, the club announced Thursday in partnership with Dove. Shaw, 20, joined Gotham FC in September in an NWSL intraleague-record $1.25 million transfer from the North Carolina Courage. In her Gotham debut on Sept. 12, Shaw scored her first goal for the club against the San Diego Wave, where she began her professional career at age 17. “I'm so excited to continue to give my all for this incredible club and our amazing fans,” said Shaw. “I'm grateful to call this place home for the years ahead.” “Jaedyn has already demonstrated her incredible quality in the short time she's been with us,” said Yael Averbuch West, the general manager and head of soccer operations for Gotham FC. The 2022 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year began this season with the Courage, appearing in 19 matches, including 10 starts, and recording three goals and one assist. She became the youngest player in NWSL history to reach 15 career goals, surpassing Alyssa Thompson. Shaw received her first senior national team call-up since joining Gotham FC in October and assisted a goal in a U.S. win over Portugal. Shaw has made nine appearances for Gotham FC this season in all competitions, including seven starts, with one goal and one assist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA president Gianni Infantino (right) presents US President Donald Trump a FIFA World Cup ticket for the final Andrew Caballero-Reynolds In recent months, 2026 men's World Cup host cities in the United States have watched on as President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that he is prepared to relocate matches from cities he deems to be unsafe. President Trump has name-checked Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston as areas of concern during his presidency, all of which are due to be World Cup cities, even if the games themselves are in the broader surrounding areas. He said in late September: “If somebody is doing a bad job, and if I feel there are unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni (Infantino), the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location.' One challenge this has posed for host cities relates to their attempts to drive local sponsorship for the tournament. While FIFA has exclusivity for its own sponsors at stadium venues, the host cities are able to seek revenue around fan festivals in non-competing categories. However, several host city executives, speaking anonymously to The Athletic when discussing commercially sensitive matters, have expressed their concern that uncertainty could deter commitments from sponsors. Bob Lynch, a former partnerships executive at the Brooklyn Nets and Miami Dolphins, is now founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a global sports sponsorship intelligence platform. He warned that the political environment has the potential to place obstacles in front of deals for host cities. Lynch said: “It's definitely something I'm sure brands are bringing to the table in their discussions with local governing bodies around their sponsorship deals. “When you have things like that, which include the threat of leaving or pulling out, there are a couple of things that generally take place. They may say: ‘We need to watch and see.' That does slow down probably conversion on sponsorship deals. “In some cases, there are conversations taking place around, ‘If we're in an agreement or we're going to be in agreement, what are our rights to get out of this?' Those are generally no different than what actually takes place within sports to guard against an earthquake taking place. It is to ensure brands are legally protected. “I'm sure, like anybody, they would want the noise to stop. Chicago, which boasts an iconic venue in the 61,500 capacity Soldier Field, withdrew from the U.S.'s joint bid with Canada and Mexico in 2018, with the office of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying in a statement at the time that it would not be in Chicago's “best interests.” Seven years on, Chicago's decision-makers do not have regrets. In an interview with The Athletic, Chicago Sports Commission's long-serving executive Kara Bachman said: “There are people who think ‘Oh my God. I'm like, ‘You didn't see what we saw.' She also described FIFA's terms as “demands” rather than requests and said the World Cup organizers would not accept “any changes or edits” to the contract. A FIFA source, who remained anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said that FIFA was negotiating with the United (United States, Canada and Mexico) bid rather than with cities directly. They also insisted that the process has been collaborative between host cities and FIFA. She said the requirements had “taken over” for some host cities and constituted an opportunity cost for other possible ventures. Congressman Josh Gottheimer told The Athletic in March that New Jersey will take on $65m in costs for things such as transit security for all hubs, bridges, tunnels, and airports. Miami-Dade County has already approved $46m for services associated with hosting World Cup games at Hard Rock Stadium. Chicago has hosted other soccer events in recent years, such as the 2025 Premier League Summer Series, which Bachman says she would like to bring back to the city. Chicago is also currently part of a group of cities considering bidding to be a host city for the 2031 Women's World Cup, which is expected to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica. Yet Bachman also warned that Chicago “will not sell our soul to do it.” She said: “If they show up with the same terms, then I don't know. Before FIFA's revamped Club World Cup had reached its conclusion in the summer, Gianni Infantino gave a speech at Trump Tower, New York, and declared it a roaring success. Ahead of the tournament, FIFA announced it had partnered with Beyond Hospitality, with Beyond's initial press release outlining the “multiple tiers of social, premium and luxury” options available across the 12 venues. These included a “Flagship Lounge”, which Beyond described as “the most luxurious shared commercial hospitality space available,” and “Exclusive Private Suites” offering a “five-course dining menu.” FIFA sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, highlighted that this was an inaugural tournament being held in the U.S. for the first time and there were always bound to be inconsistencies in attendance. Beyond did not respond to a request for comment. FIFA intend it to be a summer competition again, which almost certainly rules out Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where the summer heat would render the games likely unplayable and require a move in the calendar to winter, as we saw with the men's World Cup in 2022. This would bring a collision between FIFA and domestic European leagues, not to mention European football's governing body UEFA, whose own competitions would be disturbed by the Club World Cup. For 2029 at least, this is not a fight FIFA wants. Australia have also been credited with an interest in potentially hosting the Club World Cup, but The Athletic can reveal another registration has come from Germany, who most recently hosted Euro 2024. It may also be a way to improve relations with the Premier League, which was aggrieved by a perceived lack of consultation ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. FIFA would also be able to rope in an additional Premier League team beyond the current country limit of two by giving England a host-country place, which was the mechanism by which Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were invited this summer. But, for now at least, there are high-profile advocates within FIFA who believe the competition should remain a 32-team affair, but with play-in rounds to help improve the quality of competitors without removing access for confederations across the world, while the two teams per country cap may also be altered.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea came crashing back down to earth on Wednesday night after staggering to a 2-2 draw against Qarabag in Europe, highlighting the inconsistencies that have frustrated Enzo Maresca since taking over. Maresca has been desperate to utilise his expensively-assembled squad this season, but has been forced to contend with injuries to key players including Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Liam Delap - a knock-on effect from their exertions at last summer's Club World Cup. To add more misery to the Blues boss, young midfielder Romeo Lavia was forced off with an injury during Wednesday night's draw in Azerbaijan. It has been a miserable time in London for the Belgian, who has picked up no fewer than 10 injuries during his stint at Stamford Bridge. In real terms, that's led to 495 days out injured, 77 matches missed, and just 29 minutes for Chelsea. The brutal reality is that he has spent more time injured than healthy. Enzo Maresca has bemoaned the Club World Cup's effect on his fatigued Chelsea squad The Blues boss has changed half his team every game, leading to inconsistent results ‘The Club World Cup affects a lot,' he said after Wednesday's draw. When we don't win, everyone is focused on that, and now I think it's important to recover energy for Saturday and go again.' Statement victories over Liverpool and Spurs have been interspersed with dismal defeats by Man United, Brighton and newly promoted Sunderland, seeing Maresca's side languishing in seventh position. The Italian's constant tinkering - he's made no fewer than 85 total starting lineup changes this season - has proved to be a double-edged sword for the boss. While he's managed to keep injury-prone stars like Reece James and Pedro Neto fit by shuffling his pack, rotation may be a key factor behind the team's struggle to find sustained runs of consistency. The foundation of any successful team can be found in a settled back line. While Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made 67 changes to his starting lineups and boasts impressive strength in depth at centre back, he rarely rotates his go-to duo of William Saliba and Gabriel. Even Pep Guardiola, who has been the source of frustration for many Fantasy Premier League managers with his regular first XI changes, has settled for Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol at centre back. Other contenders have shuffled their squad - not to the extent of Chelsea - but can still produce positive results and performances It can be no coincidence, then, that the young defenders Maresca has turned to when rotating his squad have been prone to errors. In Azerbaijan, £37million new boy Jarrel Hato made two key errors leading to the underdogs' goals, while Trevoh Chalobah was at fault for Sunderland's winning goal at Stamford Bridge. For the frontrunners - Arsenal, Man City and reigning champions Liverpool - they have a remarkably similar number of changes to their XI: 67, 64 and 69 respectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino pose for a photo in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025. The award, called the FIFA Peace Prize, will "recognize exceptional actions for peace," soccer's governing body said Wednesday. But FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has a close relationship with President Donald Trump, would not tip his hand Wednesday when asked if Trump will be the first recipient of the award. "On the 5th of December, you will see," Infantino said. He was speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami, shortly after Trump addressed the same event. Infantino said earlier Wednesday that, "in an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace." FIFA said the award, which Infantino will present this year, will be bestowed annually "on behalf of fans from all around the world." Trump was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize last month despite lobbying from fellow Republicans, various world leaders and himself. And Infantino made no secret of the ties between himself, FIFA and Trump in his remarks Wednesday. I have a great relationship with President Trump, who I consider really a close friend," Infantino said. "Of course, he's been very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup. He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He says, actually, what many people think as well, but maybe don't dare to say. FIFA recently added another link to Trump by appointing his daughter Ivanka to the board of a $100 million education project part-funded by 2026 World Cup ticket sales.</p>
