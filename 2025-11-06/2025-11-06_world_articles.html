                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The detention of Sami Hamdi “is about silencing political dissent to create a chilling effect,” his wife wrote. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) taunted the wife of a British journalist who is being detained by immigration agents on social media on Wednesday, after she publicly urged her husband's release and warned that he was suffering a health emergency in custody. U.K. journalist Sami Hamdi, a 35-year-old father of three and outspoken critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza, was residing in the U.S. on a travel visa when he was abducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at San Francisco International Airport on October 26. His wife, Soumaya Hamdi, only found out he was being detained after a friend sent her a text message about DHS bragging about the abduction on social media. In an interview with The Independent published Monday, Soumaya Hamdi said she was deeply concerned about her husband's health and the conditions he was being subjected to in detention. In addition to that ailment, the journalist is living in a “very overcrowded” space, sharing a room with around 80 to 90 people, Soumaya Hamdi said. Earlier this week, Soumaya Hamdi wrote an op-ed for USA Today, demanding her husband's release and condemning DHS and ICE for violating his speech rights. Sami was on a routine speaking tour in the United States when he was arrested — after a far-right social media influencer pressured the Trump administration to revoke his visa. Why are American taxpayers funding Sami's arbitrary detention when they could be used to support American citizens instead — at a time when the American government has been shut down and millions of children risk going hungry by losing their food aid?” she went on, stating that Sami Hamdi's “abduction by ICE is not merely an immigration issue; it is about silencing political dissent to create a chilling effect.” Soumaya Hamdi concluded her op-ed by asking the U.S. government to release her husband “immediately,” and to “reaffirm that America's strength lies in defending freedom of speech, not silencing it.” In response, the official account for DHS shared a screenshot of her op-ed on X, baselessly accusing Sami of being a “terrorist sympathizer” for his opposition to Israel's genocide and saying that the U.S. had “no obligation” to host individuals “who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.” His detention comes as the Trump administration is cracking down on anyone who voices opposition to Israel's genocide; among the people detained have been Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested and faced deportation for writing an op-ed in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and former student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained and nearly deported for leading protests at Columbia University. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump. He can be found on most social media platforms under the handle @thatchriswalker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A French court released a report Thursday slamming the leadership of the Louvre for its focus on headline-grabbing purchases and renovation projects over maintaining the security of on of the world's largest museums. The audacious daytime robbery, which saw four men walk away with priceless historic jewellery, was a “deafening alarm signal,” Pierre Moscovici, president of the Court of Accounts, which authored the report, told journalists Thursday. Since the heist, information has resurfaced showing that  gaps in security appear to have been known for years – including a 2014 warning that alleged one of the museum's key passwords was simply “LOUVRE.” The new report only adds to a number of security failings exposed by the heist. Only then were internal alarms triggered. Four minutes later, after breaking into a reinforced case and grabbing nine pieces of historic jewelry, the thieves were making their escape. Internally too, the situation seems stark. While that's a nearly 50% increase on the number available in 2019, it still left 61% of the galleries without any CCTV coverage. In comparison, the Detroit Institute of Arts boasts a similar footprint (including a theatre and recital hall) but has over 550 CCTV cameras, according to camera manufacturer Axis. Des Cars told French senators that she envisions a doubling of the number of cameras within the 37-hectare Louvre property in the years to come. In the virtual realm its track record left much to be desired. A 2014 report from the French information security agency (ANSSI) seen by French daily Liberation claimed that the password for the server managing the museums' sprawling CCTV network was simply “LOUVRE.” Access to software managed by the security technology company Thales was protected by a similarly foolproof password: “THALES” – according to Liberation. In the security audit, ANSSI reportedly recommended the Louvre boost its cyber security as well as move away from outdated software that could jeopardize its protective stance. The report focused on the museum's budgetary priorities in recent years, which saw some 27 million euros ($31.1 million) spent on maintenance works between 2018 and 2024, with a further 60 million on restoration of the Louvre palace. In contrast, that period saw the Louvre splash double that figure on altering the museum layout and buying up artworks. The museum spent 105 million euros on artworks in the six years to 2024, sweeping up 2,754 pieces in that time. In 2021, the Louvre spent some 5 million euros on two works by French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In April 2025, the Louvre made a 2.2-million euro purchase of an “exceptional” Fabergé triptych. Many of the Louvre's purchases are clouded in a certain secrecy, particularly regarding the purchase price. The Court of Accounts' report said the Louvre should pay greater attention to the price of acquired works and specifically warned the museum against buying art works at a higher price if they were sold at auction for less than two years prior. Recommended security upgrades from a 2015 audit still won't be completed until 2032, it revealed. The report examined nearly eight years of museum operations across periods helmed by two executives. At the time of publication, no executives (or other staff) have been fired or resigned over the theft. The offer of des Cars to resign as museum director was not accepted by French Culture Minister Rachida Dati. “Did the Louvre Museum's security measures fail? The Louvre Museum's security measures worked,” she told lawmakers on October 21. The following day, Macron requested an acceleration of improved security measures at the museum. The following week, Dati had softened her tone, admitting to French senators that although installed security systems had functioned and staff had followed protocol “to the letter,” the “spectacular theft” was obviously a failure for the museum. “Security failures did indeed occur,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Ukrainian court has found a Russian soldier guilty of killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war in a January 2024 incident and sentenced him to life in prison, in the first ruling of its kind. Dmitriy Kurashov, 27, was convicted by a court in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia for shooting dead a Ukrainian soldier who had just surrendered to his unit. According to Ukraine's security service, Kurashov had previously served time in a Russian prison for theft, and in November 2023, he signed a contract with the Russian defense ministry in exchange for amnesty. According to the prosecutor, the Ukrainian came out of a dugout unarmed, raised his hands and clearly indicated his surrender. At the request of the Russian soldier, he knelt down, but was shot with an automatic weapon and died on the spot. In a separate case, a Russian soldier who had been accused of robbing a house in the village of Blystavitsy in the Bucha district of the Kyiv region in March 2022 was found not guilty. This ruling was based on a lack of evidence. Kurashov's sentencing is unprecedented, marking the first time a Russian soldier has been jailed for killing a captured Ukrainian since the start of the war. Kyiv says many Ukrainian prisoners of war have been killed by Russia's forces, but there have so far been no legal ramifications. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office said it had, as of May 5, opened 75 criminal investigations into the suspected executions of 268 Ukrainian prisoners of war. It said the number of alleged executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war has been rising, with eight cases involving 57 soldiers in 2022, eight cases involving 11 soldiers in 2023, 39 cases with 149 soldiers in 2024, and 20 cases up to May 5 this year, with 51 soldiers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California voters overwhelmingly approved a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year's midterm elections. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans passed a map that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress. Republicans currently hold a razor-thin 219-214 majority in the US House. Democrats are poised to wipe out those gains by passing a new congressional map in Virginia, where they expanded their majority in the state legislature on Tuesday. That effort could add two to three more Democratic seats. After a court struck down Utah's congressional map for violating state constitutional provisions prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. Lawmakers put a new plan in place, which is still awaiting court approval, that added two competitive districts Democrats could win. In Ohio, lawmakers were required to redraw the state's map this year because they could not pass a bipartisan plan after the 2020 census. There is an outside shot both Democrats could hang on to their seats next year, according to the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan and well-respected election analysis website. Chris LaCivita, a co-manager of Trump's 2024 campaign, recently set up an outside group designed to pressure lawmakers on redistricting. “Now the real fun begins,” he posted on X. Republicans may still be able to pick up a significant number of seats in Florida. The GOP-controlled legislature has already convened a committee to work on the issue, and a state supreme court ruling earlier this year could give lawmakers more leeway to dismantle existing districts. A provision in the state constitution prohibits drawing districts for explicitly partisan reasons. Beyond those states, the redistricting path forward remains unclear in many places. Democrats are not uniformly on board with scorched-earth tactics to redraw maps and gain every possible advantage in the redistricting wars. In Maryland, the Democratic president of the state senate, Bill Ferguson, said he opposed a redistricting effort to get rid of Maryland's lone Republican seat, saying it was too risky and could result in a court-ordered map that might be friendlier to Republicans than the one currently in place. “Get our victory in Virginia out of your mouth while you echo MAGA talking points. The Maryland governor, Wes Moore, has also announced an advisory commission to gather input on maps. Any potential map would still have to go through the Maryland legislature. Democrats in Illinois are also tepid on redrawing their map to add more Democratic seats. Beyond those states, there is still much uncertainty about the redistricting landscape before next year's midterms. Democrats are suing over maps in New York and Wisconsin in hopes of having courts force those states to redraw districts to add more Democratic districts. It's unclear if the court will rule in time for the midterms, but getting rid of that protection could enable Republicans to gain about a dozen seats, according to a New York Times analysis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Roberts, whose group pushed Project 2025, had defended ex-Fox News host's talk with Nick Fuentes Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, previously defended the former Fox host Tucker Carlson for having Hitler fan Nick Fuentes on his podcast without pushing back on his white supremacist views. In leaked footage of a Heritage town hall from Wednesday, staffers largely said Roberts's decision to align the thinktank with Fuentes was a mistake. He said that a chief of staff, who has since resigned, wrote the video's script. Some called for him to step down. Roberts, who holds a PhD in history and spearheaded the rightwing manifesto Project 2025, has moved the foundation into more of a Trumpian stance since he joined in 2021. The Washington Post reports that “at least” five members of an antisemitism taskforce at the organization have resigned in protest. Roberts previously called those speaking out against Carlson a “venomous coalition”, a loaded phrase he subsequently said was a “terrible choice of words” that caused “justified concern” among those who worry about rising antisemitism. Fuentes – who used to be ostracized by the mainstream right for his views, including support of Hitler and claims that Jews run the country – said on Carlson's podcast that “organized Jewry” held outsize influence and said he was a fan of Joseph Stalin. Fuentes's appearance on Carlson's podcast has roiled the right, with many seeing the interview as a further invitation of extremist views into mainstream conservatism. Roberts said that, while supporting Carlson, he disagreed with and even “abhors” Fuentes's views. Roberts then wrote a detailed post on X explaining the depths of Fuentes's extremist views. “Fuentes made grotesque analogies to try to cast doubt on the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust and has said ‘I think the Holocaust is exaggerated. I don't hate Hitler,'” Roberts wrote. “Fuentes called for the death penalty for ‘perfidious Jews' and other non-Christians, stating that ‘when we take power, they need to be given the death penalty.' Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging,” he said in a video posted on X. “And we have them back now,” Rector said. Some at Heritage have said the culture of infighting and leaking to media has eroded people's ability to have difficult conversations. Roberts has sought to cast the turmoil as a needed conversation: “Movements like ours are not weakened by adversity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No one should be caged, tortured, detained, or deported by the state — all carceral violence is done wrongfully. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. This text was originally published by AK Press and has been reprinted here with permission. I 've been an organizer for half of my life now. I've been involved with struggles to abolish the death penalty, worked to kick racists and war criminals off campuses, to fund and expand abortion access, to form unions and strike committees; I've slept on concrete during youth rebellions, navigated supporting criminalized survivors of gender based violence, taught people how to reverse overdoses and test their drugs, built peer education amongst sex workers toward decriminalizing our labor, organized too many vigils for fallen comrades, gotten arrested symbolically and against all my best efforts, and liberated resources from institutional spaces and moved them to community as often as I could. For some of us, these are all too familiar conditions. As someone who has done (and continues to do) movement work within these spheres, I want to share some thoughts, and lessons I've learned, with people who are trying to do the work of collective survival in these environments. If you are not a sex worker or involved in harm reduction work, you may also have something to learn from people whose political work often occurs outside the law (or in direct opposition to it). As authoritarianism tightens its grip, more and more people are going to face criminalization upon choosing to organize as workers, resist unjust policies, or practice mutual aid. I cannot stress enough how crucial it is to have a small, tight-knit crew you call your chosen political family. There are no substitutes for these kinds of relationships. Lots of people will tell you what to do; these are the people whose advice you should consider first and foremost. Let go of any preconceived notions you had about “criminals.” In fact, let me officially welcome you to the criminal class. Divorcing oneself from respectability politics can be hard, especially when there are so many barriers to resources when you're perceived as criminal or charged as such. Innocence is irrelevant because the laws have already betrayed us. And it is my belief that no one should be caged, tortured, detained, or deported by the state — all carceral violence is done wrongfully. It might be tempting to give into something we call the whorearchy — or the hierarchical stratification of sex working/trading people whose perceived value or worth is ranked based upon the associated stigma of their particular form of sex work (i.e., “I'm better than them because I work indoors instead of on the street”, or “I don't deserve to be arrested because I'm paying for school, not drugs”). There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. When building a broad coalition, and involving people who have feminist and abolitionist politics, make sure you're not so quick to win them that you abandon your lived experiences for respectability. Remember, those elites in power don't actually care if you pander to them now, if your existence threatens their agenda, they will never honor your humanity, no matter how “good” and “respectable” you try to be. They just need to happen thoughtfully, carefully, and often. There is no substitute for off-line, in-person conversations about strategy, tactics, and navigating work outside of the law. Urgent in that these are timely skills that more of us need to learn and practice, especially since the majority of people will still call 911 even though they may be scared of the potential for police violence. Often this comes down to a lack of self-trust and lack of knowledge on how to intervene without the state in an emergency situation. When you're a sex worker, and your client or fellow worker overdoses, you need to be able to act swiftly and without state intervention whenever possible. Remember, you don't need to reinvent the wheel, radical harm reductionists and sex workers have been making toolkits, zines, and DIY guides for decades. Find what speaks to you, and use it as a template, build from something that already exists and fact check it with trusted friends. It's patient work because new skills may need to be acquired, language and practices change with new knowledge, and because people will say some really upsetting and problematic shit to you about drug use. Even the comrades who you think should know better. You can't see through everyone's journey, focus on the skills, recommit to a politics of solidarity and care. It's hard work doing peer to peer education, it can be draining, and you'll need to ask for help, a lot. There are no shortcuts to liberation, and winning rights for some at the expense of others in our criminal class is a kind of soul-death. Be discerning, and figure out who's in the room. What I'm expressly advocating, especially within criminalized workplace contexts, is moving things offline whenever possible. Work only with platforms that have clear terms of service that aren't already committed to throwing you under the bus, or expressly work with platforms that are built by community-minded people. But when it comes to our organizing work, we can opt in and out of using tools that don't serve us. This is critical — you have to move at the speed of trust. That will likely feel slower than you desire to act. Yes, it will present new challenges and there will be learning curves, but an emphasis on safer communication means talking to the people you are directly organizing with, regularly — checking in on materials, assessing needs and risks, outlining safer methods to trade sex or obtain substances, discussing the political landscape in real terms, and making space to do visioning work beyond immediate crisis-related tasks. You also cannot do this at a large general membership meeting of an organization that's open to the public. It will mean you have to repeat yourself, schedule more meetings, and develop an ear for infiltration. Some of these skills feel intuitive, but I promise, if you and your crew are paying attention, they can be learned, practiced and modified for your own needs. You're being hoisted onto the shoulders of some tough, resourceful worker-organizers. Something that remains, however, is how you embody your politics and values. Don't let people shut sex workers and drug users out of spaces you find yourself working in —  speak up, point to the outlaw legacies of harm reduction and mutual care, be bold in your comradeship. Remember you're not alone — like Eugene Debs said, “While there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So when American actress Angelina Jolie visited Kherson on Nov. 5, she and other local residents began to hope the world might finally look closer at how Russia is terrorizing them. If Jolie continues to speak out about what she witnessed in the front-line city firsthand, that could help with the delivery of relief aid, according to Virlich and others. On Nov. 5, Jolie traveled with the UK-based Legacy of War Foundation to Ukraine's front-line Kherson and Mykolaiv regions in the south, visiting schools and hospitals that have been forced underground to continue functioning despite constant Russian attacks. There was also speculation after a Ukrainian man in Jolie's entourage was reportedly detained by military enlistment officers, but local media confirmed that the man, a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue. Russian forces captured most of Kherson Oblast, including its capital, in the early spring of 2022, occupying it until a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive forced their retreat later that November. Day-to-day life in Kherson unfolds under constant threat with Russian forces positioned just across the river. Kherson faces more than relentless shelling, though — Russian forces are increasingly using FPV drones to hunt civilians in what they call a “human safari.” “Every month, we have dozens of civilians killed and hundreds wounded. Residential buildings, hospitals, museums, ambulances, and rescue workers have all become targets for almost every kind of weapon,” local historian Dementii Belii told the Kyiv Independent. “Lately, Russian forces have also been trying to block the only main highway that brings food, goods, and people into Kherson. Given the dangers of visiting Kherson today, Jolie's trip meant a lot more than words of support from afar for some locals — in a country where even safer areas can feel distant from their reality, it reminded them that they were not alone. These thoughts undermine people's strength and their hope for survival,” Belii said. “That's why people here deeply respect the courage of Angelina Jolie, because she was not afraid to come under bombs and shelling to support the people of Kherson.” Kate Tsurkan is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent who writes mostly about culture-related topics in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Her newsletter Explaining Ukraine with Kate Tsurkan, which focuses specifically on Ukrainian culture, is published weekly by the Kyiv Independent and is partially supported by a generous grant from the Nadia Sophie Seiler Fund. Around 40% of Ukraine's roughly $98 billion budget is covered by foreign support. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) is also investigating Zelensky's former partner Timur Mindich on suspicion of aiding the aggressor state, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak. During her visit, Jolie was shown how medical and educational institutions in Ukraine's southern front-line regions have been moved into reinforced underground spaces to continue their operations, according to a press release from the organization. The move aims to protect Bulgaria's only refinery — and a major supplier — from the impact of U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. "Seventeen men were lured into joining mercenary forces," the South African Presidency said. It is the first time Brussels Airport has closed due to drone activity. More drones were also spotted near Belgium's Kleine Brogel Air Base, which houses F-16 fighter jets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that it would reduce air traffic by 10 per cent across 40 “high-volume” markets to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the ongoing government shutdown. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be affected. Controllers already have missed one full paycheque and are scheduled to again receive nothing next week as the shutdown drags on. The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers. Airlines said they would try to minimize the impact on customers, some of whom will see weekend travel plans disrupted with little notice. United, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said they would offer refunds to passengers who opt not to fly – even if they purchased tickets that aren't normally refundable. The head of Frontier Airlines recommended that travellers buy backup tickets with another airline to avoid being stranded. Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be cancelled. “I'm not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we've had a situation where we're taking these kinds of measures,” Bedford said Wednesday. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1. Most work mandatory overtime six days a week, leaving little time for side jobs to help cover bills and other expenses unless they call out. Mounting staffing pressures are forcing the agency to act, Bedford said. “We can't ignore it,” he said, adding that even if the shutdown ends before Friday, the FAA wouldn't automatically resume normal operations until staffing improves and stabilizes. The FAA has been delaying flights at times when airports or its other facilities are short on controllers.MIGUEL J. RODRIGUEZ CARRILLO/AFP/Getty Images Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that they would meet with airline executives to figure out how to safely implement the reductions. Duffy warned on Tuesday that there could be chaos in the skies if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paycheque next week. Duffy said some controllers can get by missing one paycheque, but not two or more. Staffing can run short both in regional control centres that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don't always lead to flight disruptions. Throughout October, flight delays caused by staffing problems had been largely isolated and temporary. From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. During weekends from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional control centres and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis.

AI-driven power demand, industrial applications and LNG exports are driving up natural gas consumption, yet price pressures and competition from coal remain ongoing market challenges. U.S. natural gas futures fell over 4 per cent sequentially, extending a decline that began in the second quarter after snapping four consecutive quarters of gains. The drop in prices weighed on TC Energy's transport volumes. Adjusted core profit in the power and energy solutions business was $266-million in the quarter, down 18.4 per cent from a year ago. However, its Canadian natural gas pipelines saw adjusted core earnings rise to $913-million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $845-million a year ago. needs to conduct new assessment for natural gas pipeline The company operates a 58,100 mile-long network of pipelines, supplying more than 30 per cent of the clean-burning natural gas consumed daily across North America. On an adjusted basis, the Calgary-based company earned 77 Canadian cents per share for the three months, compared with analysts' average expectation of 80 Canadian cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces continue to stubbornly defend the pocket around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, despite relentless Russian assaults in and around the two cities, leading to an ever-increasing threat of encirclement. Over two weeks since Russian soldiers were filmed breaking into the urban area of the mining city in Donetsk Oblast en masse, the city has descended into a deep gray zone, in which the concept of territorial control is lost in a fog of chaotic movement. With more and more Russian forces flowing into Pokrovsk, after Ukrainian lines on the southern outskirts of the city quickly disintegrated, reversing the situation with large-scale clearing operations looks to be an increasingly impossible task. Meanwhile, for the neighboring industrial city of Myrnohrad, which the brigades deployed that have continued to hold despite an ever-worsening logistical nightmare, the threat of encirclement has only increased. As of Nov. 6, most of the urban area of Pokrovsk remains in a contested "gray zone" according to most open-source battlefield maps, including the Deep State map, widely trusted in Ukraine. Although both the gray zone and the areas assessed as firmly under Russian control have expanded over the past week, Ukrainian positions are still present inside the city, intermixing and overlapping with streets and buildings taken by Russian soldiers. "Logistics are the most important thing here, because they are what defines an encirclement, which bloggers and analysts try to determine," he said. As Russia's small assault and infiltration groups continue to move north through Pokrovsk and beyond, the lack of a stable Ukrainian line of defense makes Ukrainian drone teams increasingly vulnerable to being assaulted and caught in firefights themselves. This, said the drone pilot, disrupts their ability to focus on their own work, which is crucial for maintaining the kill zone that slows, if not stops, Russian advances. The Ukrainian defense is also hampered by Russian drone strikes on logistics further back in the rear, with dozens of drone teams from Russia's elite Rubicon school deployed to the front-line hotspot. "Thirty days ago, at an intersection on our way to positions, there was only one of our destroyed cars there, close to the enemy," Artem Fysun, a member of the Peaky Blinders drone unit, redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in summer, told the Kyiv Independent. "When I left the position, there were up to a dozen of our cars; in such a short period of time, in less than a month, the enemy has already destroyed a significant amount of our equipment." With winter and the cooldown of fighting that will likely come with it just around the corner, the battle of Pokrovsk has taken on a clear political significance, with both Ukraine and Russia keen to round off the year's campaign with a major success story. Russian President Vladimir Putin's premature claim on Oct. 29 that Pokrovsk — as well as Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast — was already surrounded by Russian forces of the importance placed on the capture of Pokrovsk by Moscow. Meanwhile, as he has done with front-line flashpoints throughout the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Ukrainian commanders in the Pokrovsk area entrenched the "fortress" mentality that had characterized the defenses of other Donetsk Oblast cities, especially Bakhmut and Avdiivka. "If someone does not sign an order to withdraw troops from Pokrovsk and Myrnhohrad in the near future, we may find ourselves in a situation where we will not only lose a significant number of highly motivated paratroopers and marines," journalist and volunteer Vitalii Deineha, co-founder of the Come Back Alive fund, wrote on Facebook. With less than five kilometers of drone-infested fields north of Pokrovsk left connecting Myrnohrad and the surrounding area, logistics into the pocket has become increasingly fraught. One Ukrainian battalion commander, who also spoke to the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity due to the unsanctioned nature of his comments, said that during recent rotations, his infantrymen came into direct firefights with Russian soldiers on several occasions. On top of the political importance attached by Kyiv to holding Pokrovsk, the reluctance to save lives by ordering a timely withdrawal is linked to the systemic culture of "not one step back," commonly associated with the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. "The reports of the General Staff sent upwards are made up of more and more lies every day," Deineha wrote. "In fact, we have practically lost Pokrovsk, which means that there is no point in holding Myrnohrad either. On Oct. 31, reportedly under the personal command of General Kyrylo Budanov, Ukrainian special forces of the country's military intelligence (HUR) landed a Black Hawk helicopter under cover of darkness near Pokrovsk. Further details of the mission, from its objective to its outcome, were not disclosed, but at the scale the landing carried out at — reportedly two special forces platoons — it was not a force capable of clearing a large urban area like Pokrovsk. Typical of a practice of "flag-raising" carried out by both sides along Ukraine's increasingly porous front line, the mission, while proving briefly that central Pokrovsk was not fully under Russian control, is a far cry from any evidence of a successful Ukrainian clearing of the city. Things are really tough on the front lines at the moment, as illusions of peace talks fade and Russian drones fly further and further past the front line. It's also getting a lot more dangerous for journalists, but while large foreign media outlets have stopped going, we will continue to work everyday to bring the battlefield to you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia responds to Trump's statements about resuming nuclear tests by signaling it may do the same; Canada moves forward with legislation to seize Russia's sovereign assets; and Russia and the US see surge in trade under Trump. At a meeting of the Security Council on Wednesday, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin drew President Vladimir Putin's attention to the statement made by US President Donald Trump on October 30, in which Trump instructed the Pentagon to "immediately" prepare for conducting nuclear tests so as not to fall behind China and Russia. A discussion ensued, ending with Putin ordering that the issue of a potential US resumption of nuclear weapons testing be examined and analyzed. Russia, for its part, has indicated that it won't just stand pat amid the US moves. However, most likely, the timeframe would be several months. If Washington resumes nuclear testing first, it will effectively give Moscow, Beijing, and other states the go-ahead to follow suit, Director of the Center for Military-Economic Studies at the Institute of Global Military Economics and Strategy Prokhor Tebin told Vedomosti. "All the more so since the Russian side is demonstrating that, in practice, everything needed for testing is already in place," he added. Russia is currently signaling its willingness to up the nuclear ante, but it should be noted that it's the US that sent things in this direction, Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics Dmitry Suslov believes. According to the expert, there are two ways the United States could go now that Russia has made its position clear. The first and more reasonable option would be to accept Russia's proposal to maintain for another year the quantitative limits outlined in the New START Treaty, refrain from escalatory steps such as resuming nuclear testing or conducting exercises simulating preemptive strikes against Russia, and instead begin a dialogue on arms limitation and strategic stability under new conditions. The second path, Suslov continued, is escalatory: rejecting Russia's proposal, issuing unfounded accusations of alleged covert nuclear testing by Russia and China, and resuming US nuclear tests. The Canadian Senate is officially considering a bill on the seizure of Russia's sovereign assets, Russian Ambassador to Ottawa Oleg Stepanov told Izvestia. According to him, Canada will continue coordinating its approach with Brussels and may share its legislative blueprint for asset confiscation. Within the European Union, there is no consensus on using Russian assets to fund a loan to Ukraine, with Belgium, France, and Italy opposing the measure. In the coming days, representatives of the European Commission intend to turn Belgium, while the other EU nations have been given two options by Brussels: confiscate Russia's assets or fund Kiev out of their own national budgets. Russia has already prepared a package of countermeasures should the decision to confiscate assets be adopted, Stepanov emphasized. Ottawa will undoubtedly continue coordinating its approach with Brussels," the diplomat told Izvestia. "There should be no particular difficulties in moving such a legislative initiative through both houses of the Canadian parliament. However, the consequences of Canada adopting such a law would be significant. "This would lead to lawsuits that will drag on for years. Moreover, Russia will almost certainly take reciprocal measures," the expert explained. Trade between the United States and Russia could double under Donald Trump's administration to $6-8 bln, according to experts interviewed by Izvestia. In the first half of 2025 alone, bilateral turnover increased by nearly one-third, reaching $2.8 bln. Nevertheless, mutual trade with Washington still remains low compared with Russia's other key partners, including China and the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition, the situation is complicated by new US sanctions targeting Russian oil companies. In particular, during the first half of 2025, bilateral trade hit $2.8 bln, a relatively modest amount, but still a notable one-third uptick. This expansion could be driven by US purchases of Russian-made fertilizers, enriched uranium, and platinum, Senior Analyst at AMarkets Igor Rastorguev noted. Some experts offered more conservative estimates: according to Freedom Finance Global analyst Vladimir Chernov, turnover may reach $4.8-5.6 bln. Fast forward to the beginning of November this year and it was significantly lower at around 80.9 rubles per dollar, according to the Bank of Russia's exchange rate. One factor behind this fluctuation has been political signals from Washington. According to her, increasing trade barriers and expanding export controls are reshaping trade flows and creating less favorable conditions for Russian exports. In reality, however, Kiev has continued to disregard these declared principles, which has caused dysfunction within the Ukrainian judicial system, as acknowledged by domestic analysts, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Brussels is painting a pretty picture in order to maintain an overall favorable narrative, though it recognizes that Ukraine's EU accession is still decades away, experts emphasized. Yet achieving this ambitious goal will require accelerating reforms in fundamental areas, particularly concerning the rule of law, the Commission indicated. "It is clear that for the leadership of the European Commission, it is important today to ensure at least the appearance of support for Ukraine by a majority of EU member states. Meanwhile, in a statement posted on social media on Wednesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban once again reminded that decisions regarding EU enlargement can only be made with the consent of all member states. Budapest will not support Ukraine's accession to the EU, he said, because doing so would risk bringing the military conflict with Russia onto European territory. Amid all this, US President Donald Trump could move Hungary off its position, that is, if he wants to, analysts at the US think tank Atlantic Council suggested. They noted that during his upcoming visit to Washington, Orban will likely attempt to secure exemptions from recently introduced US sanctions on Russian oil companies. After two years of voluntary output cuts under the OPEC+ framework, Russia's oil production is recovering, Kommersant writes. Analysts forecast that by the end of 2025 it will return to a level close to last year's - exceeding 9.5 mln barrels per day. However, due to slowing global demand and the potential for declining oil prices, the prospects for production growth in 2026 remain uncertain. According to a report by Euler analysts, Russia's oil output in 2025 will exceed 9.5 mln barrels per day (bpd), which is close to the previous year's figure. As a result, the average production volume will remain at last year's level. In 2026, Euler estimates that if all voluntary OPEC+ limits are removed, Russia's production could reach 9.7 mln bpd. The main risks, analysts warned, stem from a sharp drop in oil prices caused by weakening demand and, consequently, renewed supply constraints imposed by OPEC+. Maxim Malkov, partner at Kept, added that the marginal cost of producing an additional barrel often rises, forcing producers to focus on cost optimization and profitability rather than expanding volumes. Managing Partner at Kasatkin Consulting Dmitry Kasatkin estimates that Russia retains the potential to increase production by 1 mln bpd in 2026, despite constraining factors such as increasingly challenging extraction conditions, oil prices, the ruble exchange rate, the Bank of Russia's key rate, and labor shortages. According to his forecast, in 2026 Russian oil will likely maintain a discount of around $10 to Brent, with Urals trading in the range of $55-65 per barrel.

Before taking office earlier this year, Elbridge Colby, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, asserted that Taiwan should be “laser focusing on implementing a denial defense against invasion.” Indeed, an array of small, inexpensive weapon systems holds great promise for repelling a Chinese amphibious landing. The Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy is therefore correct to embrace a strategy of denial for stopping an invasion of Taiwan. But rebuffing an invasion might not end the war. Joel Wuthnow, an expert on the Chinese military, has warned, “There is no scenario in which China, following an unsuccessful invasion, accepts responsibility, acknowledges that military solutions are impractical, or pivots to a fundamentally different set of political objectives toward Taiwan.” In the wake of a failed invasion, Chinese leader Xi Jinping (or his successor) would be unlikely to simply pack up and go home. Instead, Chinese leaders might reason that they have less to lose by continuing the fight. This is why the political scientist Michael Beckley has argued that “war over Taiwan likely would become protracted, as nearly all great power wars have since the Industrial Revolution.” World War II ended only when Allied forces captured Germany's capital and the United States dropped nuclear weapons on Japan. But denial capabilities on their own will not be enough. A combination of forward bases and aircraft carriers allowed U.S. forces to operate worldwide. As tensions rose, Washington maneuvered two carriers near the island. But they also performed deterrence through punishment by threatening severe consequences if Beijing went through with it, since carrier-based aircraft could strike ships heading toward China and even targets on the Chinese mainland. In the last few years, however, the United States has begun tailoring its forces—and those of its allies and partners—for more specific missions. Pentagon officials are therefore pushing to acquire more “attritable” systems, which are relatively cheap to produce and designed to be expendable, for use by small units operating within the expanding area that China threatens. But attritable systems are of limited use against China's day-to-day coercive operations in the air and sea around Taiwan. Last year, Taiwan detected 5,105 Chinese sorties into its airspace. Defending against these aircraft requires expensive jets rather than low-flying drones. In the maritime context, responding to Chinese naval incursions in the waters around Taiwan will require vessels that can monitor those activities and challenge Chinese forces if necessary. Even after open conflict begins, denial is still only a partial answer. U.S. mines and missiles can sink Chinese vessels, killing thousands of troops in the process, but Chinese leaders might still seek at least a partial victory. The People's Liberation Army could attempt to seize Taiwan's outlying islands or conduct a maritime blockade while its military arsenal makes the waters around Taiwan a no man's land. That is why the United States must be able to convince China that it will face unacceptable costs if it continues fighting in the wake of an unsuccessful invasion. Russia's example serves as a warning about China's likely behavior. Ideally, the prospect of a failed invasion of Taiwan would deter China, but Chinese leaders might perceive several incentives for protracting a war following an initial loss. First, China's industrial capacity far outstrips that of the United States, so it could recapitalize its forces more rapidly. Over the last three decades, China has undergone a massive military buildup. Meanwhile, U.S. armed forces face significant munitions shortages, with some experts predicting that American stockpiles would be expended after just weeks, or even days, of a conflict with China. Beijing might believe it can outlast Washington and Taipei in terms of other supplies, as well. Getting provisions across land into Ukraine has proved challenging; delivering even basic necessities over water to Taiwan amid a conflict with China would be an order of magnitude more difficult. Taiwan is a relatively small island with limited food and energy stockpiles. Conversely, Beijing's rapid expansion of wind, solar, and nuclear power would help insulate it against a U.S. energy blockade. Chinese officials have described Taiwan as “the very core of China's core interests.” U.S. President Donald Trump's take is decidedly different: “Taiwan is 9,500 miles away,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. it's a very, very difficult thing.” The American people support Taiwan, but many do not want a direct conflict with China: when asked in 2024 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs about their commitment to defending Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, the majority of Americans surveyed either opposed such a policy or were unsure. A Chinese failure in a conflict over Taiwan could also threaten Xi or his successor's hold on power and undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Xi would want to avoid an admission of failure and thus might order the Chinese military to keep waging an unsuccessful war. For all these reasons, Chinese leaders might prefer to keep fighting even after an initial defeat. Colby and other Trump administration officials clearly recognize this; he co-authored a 2022 report advocating “selective punishment operations” and “cost-imposition to favorably manage escalation and seek to terminate a war with China.” These operations could include an embargo or the seizure of Chinese assets held abroad. But Beijing has been insulating itself against political and economic pressure, so military escalation might well be required, including strikes on critical infrastructure and parts of China's defense-industrial base. First is what researchers at the RAND Corporation have termed the “Goldilocks challenge”: threats of punishment must be high enough to persuade Beijing to end a conflict in which it is deeply invested but low enough to avoid provoking unacceptable escalation, such as nuclear use. Finding this middle ground would not be an easy task. Chinese leaders might back down after claiming to have taught Taiwan a lesson or taken some contested territory. Yet China's own messaging before a conflict could set a higher bar: Chinese leaders might demonize Taiwan and the United States to rally public support, while trumpeting the PLA's military superiority and China's great rejuvenation. An invasion of Taiwan might start with Beijing metaphorically burning its ships so there would be no turning back. They could seek to use Beijing's moment of weakness to constrain China's ambitions, formalize Taiwan's independence, or undermine the CCP's hold on power. A second challenge is that U.S. “horizontal escalation”—widening the scope of the conflict—may not be as effective today as it once might have been. Devoting more funding to denial capabilities risks cannibalizing resources for military platforms more capable of threatening punishment, such as stealthy bombers and submarines armed with cruise missiles. Therefore, the biggest challenge for the Trump administration's National Defense Strategy is not whether it allocates resources to a strategy of denial but how it integrates denial and punishment into a holistic deterrence framework. Rebuffing an initial attack on Taiwan is necessary but not sufficient. If the United States is to deter China, it will have to persuade Chinese leaders that Washington has a strategy not only for the early stages of a conflict but also for the end stage of a war.

MOSCOW, November 6. /TASS/. It is important to clearly understand Russia's intentions, which currently involve assessing whether preparations for nuclear tests are necessary rather than actually beginning them, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to a TASS question on whether the presidential administration shares the view that the world is closer to nuclear war today than during the Caribbean crisis.

"President [Vladimir] Putin reiterated that Russia remains committed to all its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We remain faithful to our undertakings. However, given everything that the participants in the Security Council's operational meeting said at the beginning of the session, Putin has instructed to assess whether it is necessary to begin preparations," Peskov said.

"Thus, we are not starting preparations right now; we are first trying to figure out whether we need to start them, given what we are hearing from the United States. It is very important to understand this and to clearly see Russia's intentions," the Kremlin spokesman emphasized.</p>
