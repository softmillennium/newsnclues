                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz's new-look serve has been the hot topic around the tennis world this past week and the Spaniard himself admitted in Melbourne that there might be a familiar influence behind it. On Monday night at the Australian Open, Djokovic was finally asked about the resemblance and he didn't miss the chance to have some fun with it. “Then when I saw him here, I told him we have to talk about percentage of his winnings. Every ace I expect, you know, a tribute to me. Djokovic, who could only meet Alcaraz in the final in Melbourne, was doing plenty of damage on his own serve in his first-round win at the Australian Open on Monday. The record 10-time champion won 93 per cent of his first-serve points and did not face a break point en route to victory against Pedro Martinez. Djokovic has now won 100 matches at the hard-court major, moving to within two wins of Roger Federer's all-time mark of 102. The 38-year-old Serbian was pleased with how he started. Let's see how it's going to feel in a few days' time,” Djokovic said on how his body and mind are feeling. Just overall felt really good on the court that has made me feel good on it for so many times throughout my career.” 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic will next face Italian Francesco Maestrelli in what will be a first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting between the two.

On Monday, the 2014 champion made good on Tennis Australia granting him the opportunity to play at Melbourne Park one last time. In all five of his United Cup contests, Wawrinka found himself playing from behind—winning once over 27th-ranked Arthur Rinderknech. Taking a spirited Kia Arena, a prepared Wawrinka rallied past Laslo Djere for a 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory after three hours and 23 minutes.“I've been working really hard to stay in shape, to push myself. I think also the week in United Cup helped me a lot because I played over three hours back-to-back, plus a lot of tennis on the court, high level,” Wawrinka reflected in his press conference.“It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.” I think also the week in United Cup helped me a lot because I played over three hours back-to-back, plus a lot of tennis on the court, high level,” Wawrinka reflected in his press conference.“It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.” “It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.” Wawrinka shared while he still feels the nerves on the match court, those butterflies—more than anything—are a driving force behind his passion.“That's always been positive for me. That means I really want to do well. I'm really pushing myself,” he commented.“That's when you need to be really disciplined with yourself, with your brain, with what you have to do during the match.”​ That means I really want to do well. Against Djere, Wawrinka produced 14 aces and won 75 percent of his total points on serve. 3 isn't trying to turn back the clock with what he brings to the court, but rather, unleash the best 2026 version of Stanimal.“I know I'm not as good as I was before. But I'm still happy with what I'm doing, always trying to push my own limit, always trying to be better.”Wawrinka, ranked No. 139 coming into this event, now holds 159 major match wins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic marked a triumphant return to his most successful event on Monday at the Australian Open, where he added another historic milestone at the hard-court major. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings delivered a near-flawless display to defeat Pedro Martinez 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, sealing his 100th career victory at Melbourne Park. The record 10-time Australian Open champion, Djokovic will now set his sights on surpassing Roger Federer's all-time mark of 102 match wins at the tournament. I like the sound of it… Centurion is pretty nice,” Djokovic said. History making is a great motivation, particularly in the last five, 10 years of my career. I'm blessed to still be playing at this level.” Djokovic's record at Grand Slam tournaments (prior to AO R2) Advancing to the second round in his 19th consecutive Australian Open appearance, Djokovic will next face 23-year-old Italian qualifier Francesco Maestrelli. The debutant fought past Terence Atmane 6-4, 3-6, 6-7(4), 6-1, 6-1 to earn his first main-draw victory at a major. Amid lingering questions surrounding his fitness, particularly during last year's run to the semi-finals in New York, Djokovic looked extremely sharp and mobile. In his first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Martinez — and first match since winning the Athens title in November — Djokovic controlled play from the baseline and struck more than three times as many winners as the Spaniard (49-14). The 38-year-old Serbian reached the semi-finals at all four Grand Slams last season, and his pursuit of an 11th Melbourne crown could hinge on a potential semi-final showdown with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner. Casper Ruud also safely advanced to the second round by defeating Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 for his 50th major win. “It was a perfect start to this tournament and this court is probably one of my favourites in the world,” 12th seed Ruud said of Margaret Court Arena. I'm excited to be back here in a couple of days. I have to thank Maria for letting me [come] in the first place. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

Every song is a hit on this album. But yeah, I guess you can find different stuff in art and music. If some people have different expectations and they look at an album like that, they will always find something to criticize.”Asked to name her favorite track, the six-time Grand Slam champion unsurprisingly picked a song from the album's stronger first half.“Honestly, it's hard to pick because she keeps the level high.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia -- Iga Swiatek advanced to the second round of the Australian Open on Sunday, defeating Yuan Yue 7-6(5), 6-3 after being pushed to a first-set tiebreak. Swiatek had been far more comfortable in their previous meeting, dropping only three games, but Yuan raised her level this time by extending rallies and holding serve, pushing the first set to a tiebreak before Swiatek closed out the match in two hours. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play Swiatek's composure showed late in the opening set. Several landed so close to the lines that Yuan hesitated, a reflection of Swiatek's precision under pressure. "There were some moments where I felt great, but the start of the match wasn't that perfect," Swiatek said in press afterward. "I'm happy that I worked through this and could, yeah, finish in two sets as you said. Swiatek carried that momentum into the second set, winning the first three games. At 4-3 in the second set, Swiatek took the final two games with one more break -- she won nearly half (40-of-82) of receiving points, compared to Yuan's 36% -- and earned her 25th straight Grand Slam first-round win on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. Yuan, who won three qualifying matches to enter the first round, jumped out to an early lead with a break of Swiatek and a hold in the first set. She often matched Swiatek's power in their rallies, and Swiatek racked up 21 unforced errors to Yuan's 13 in the first set. Compared to their first meeting where Yuan had just one break point opportunity, she converted 3-of-7. Though Swiatek tied the first set at 3-3, Yuan's next two games followed a similar pattern with a break and hold, setting herself up with two games to close the first set. Swiatek bounced back winning three of the next four games to force the tiebreak, which Yuan managed to win five points. In the second set, after falling 3-0 and taking a medical timeout for a lower back issue, Yuan won three of the next four, including a 16-point, 10-minute game to cut the deficit to 4-3. "I think she played well," Swiatek said of her opponent. "She used the opportunities that I gave her a bit. Yeah, was kind of playing pretty strong from the forehand side. In the first set tiebreak, Yuan and Swiatek alternated points up until Swiatek led 5-4. 2 had several backhand winners, but none more momentous than this one. Despite the net cord, Swiatek's quick adjustment allowed her to smash home a backhand winner -- she had 15 winners in the first alone -- and create a double set point opportunity. Though Yuan saved one with an ace, another Swiatek backhand winner ended the set.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seventh seed Felix Auger-Aliassime retired due to cramp during his first-round match at the Australian Open on Monday. Portugal's Nuno Borges led 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 when the Canadian could not continue. Auger-Aliassime, 25, reached the semi-finals of last year's US Open and was seeking to begin the 2026 major season in similar form. After playing two points in the fourth set, Auger-Aliassime retired. "It became very difficult to be competitive at this level. I tried for a set, but yeah, wasn't possible today." “I feel for him,” Borges said of Auger-Aliassime. “I know how he feels to struggle physically and it is part of tennis. I hope he gets better quickly and back to his best level. Maybe if he was 100 per cent, it would've been a different score, but I'm really happy to push through this one and get another opportunity on Wednesday.” Borges, who reached the fourth round in Melbourne in 2024, will next meet Juan Manuel Cerundolo or Aussie wild card Jordan Thompson. Auger-Aliassime believes he began cramping in the third set, but admitted it is tough to recall. "But then as I started moving left and right, having to sprint, and every time I cramped, you know what's happening." But that did not make it any less disappointing. I want to be on the court competing with my opponent," Auger-Aliassime said. "I don't want to be just standing there like a punching bag. So there's no point, and you know to move on."

One side openly battles through emotional upheaval, the other, more calm and circumspect.For all his struggles in 2025, the former No. 1 never appeared particularly worried about the long-term state of his game. While some mused that his days competing at the top of men's tennis were over, Medvedev was eager to look at tomorrow as another day.Tomorrow finally came for the 2021 US Open champion at the end of last season, and the day has only gotten longer in 2026 as Medvedev remains unbeaten through six matches Down Under.

Tomorrow finally came for the 2021 US Open champion at the end of last season, and the day has only gotten longer in 2026 as Medvedev remains unbeaten through six matches Down Under. Going back to last year, I feel like when things are maybe not going as well for you, you would maybe be frustrated on the court, but you would come to press and maybe not seem as concerned with where things were going. I feel like now, looking back, things are going well, were you more concerned than you were letting on? How do you find that sort of optimism?DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's a tough question, for sure. In general, outside of the court, I try to be more optimistic than when I am on the court. That's just the way I am, the way a lot of tennis players are.It's just that they show their frustrations differently. A lot of tennis players are negative on the court. Yeah, man, but you're up 6-3, 5-3.That's me, as well. I'm feeling great with my new team, so I don't really go too much into the past. I managed to finish the year like 12 or 13, which is, to be honest, it's great for many players.Of course I was not happy. It was still not that bad, and end of the year was better than the year itself.I made a big push to try to be more positive on the court. So far I'm doing it well, but I'm never the guy to say, okay, now, not anymore. We don't know what's coming, but just trying to be positive on the court as I am in life, actually.It might be tough for someone to come from a Daniil Medvedev match and imagine him seeing the glass as half full, but playing the long game has appeared to pay off for the three-time Australian Open finalist. He'll next face Quentin Halys for the chance to reach his first Grand Slam third round since the 2024 US Open. DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's a tough question, for sure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alycia Parks overcame a 0-6 first set and an energetic Court 6 crowd to defeat Alexandra Eala in three sets to advance to the second round of the Australian Open. All signs initially pointed to a straight-sets victory for Eala, but Parks came back and pulled off a stunning 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 win in the Australian Open first round. Parks said she finally started hitting her spots, converted more first serves and became more aggressive in the final two sets, and that was the key to overcoming the rowdy audience. "It was very difficult," Parks said to reporters. She definitely has a good crowd. I just kept telling myself to stay in the zone." To set the scene, the queue to watch Alexandra Eala's match on Court 6 at Melbourne Park on Monday afternoon was unbelievable. Hundreds of people organizing in a line that extended all the way back, adjacent to Rod Laver Arena, waiting for a spot to watch the 20-year-old's main draw debut at the Australian Open. "That's one of the things that makes a loss like today a little bit harder is I know a lot of people were rooting for me. Philippine flags decorated the stands in all directions, ‘Let's go Alex' chants transcended every few games and roars -- even in what might be considered an inconsequential point -- overpowered the Melbourne Park grounds initially. A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen) Yet, Parks found a way to conquer that barrier, one that she said she was too focused on in the first set. "I was starting to think I wasn't focused on the game plan, which is why I played better in the second and third set," Parks said. Eala delivered to begin the match. An opening game that lasted 20 points and ended with consecutive missed smash volleys by Parks foreshadowed how the afternoon would turn out. She was off and running, winning eight of the next nine points to take a 3-0 lead and ultimately closed the 34-minute first-set with a bagel. Sprinting out to a 3-0 lead with the early break, the American seemed to find her groove. Though Eala leveled at 3-3, Parks remained calm and collected, taking the final three games – a pivotal break to go up 5-3 allowed Parks, who relied on 12 aces in the match, to serve for the set. "I was starting to think I wasn't focused on the game plan, which is why I played better in the second and third set. One set to decide who would advance to the second round to face Karolina Muchova or Jaqueline Cristian, and pendulum had shifted into Parks' favor and the crowd had slowly started to simmer down. That break proved crucial as Eala and Parks traded holds up until Parks led 4-2 in the set. Eala saved two match points, but Parks serve proved too strong for an exhausted Eala, as the American successfully rallied to advance to the second round and did receive an ovation and applause. "I don't know what my record is with crowds against me," Parks said laughing. "It definitely puts a fire on me. Alycia Parks overcame a 0-6 first set and an energetic Court 6 crowd to defeat Alexandra Eala in three sets to advance to the second round of the Australian Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rejuvenation of Daniil Medvedev showed little sign of slowing down on Monday at the Australian Open. Medvedev, who began his year by lifting the trophy at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ, converted seven of 13 break points he earned against De Jong, according to Infosys Stats. Medvedev twice let slip a break lead in the opening set but still claimed it, and he carried that momentum into the second to take complete control in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with World No. After a largely difficult 2025 season in which he won just one Grand Slam match (at the Australian Open), Medvedev finished the year well and lifted an ATP 250 title in Almaty. He will hope to continue his success under coaches Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke when he takes on Quentin Halys in the second round in Melbourne. Frenchman Halys defeated Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-2, 7-6(2) to advance. First match, different tournament, a Grand Slam," said Medvedev in his on-court interview. "Last year, I lost almost [each major] in the first round, except here actually, so I'm happy to win in straight sets, even if some of them were up and down. The conditions felt slow, so we were both breaking each other's serve a lot. The most important [thing] is to win and hopefully I can play better next round.” Home favourite Alex de Minaur wasted little time joining Medvedev in the second round. "It feels great to get started here at the Australian Open," said De Minaur in his post-match press conference. It's never easy first match coming in. It was a tricky opponent, and I navigated my way through and did what I needed to do. His next opponent at this year's edition of his home major will be Hamad Medjedovic, who held off Mariano Navone for a 6-2, 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 first-round win. Tommy Paul, Andrey Rublev and Reilly Opelka were among the other players to advance early on Monday. The 19th-seeded Paul downed his fellow American Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, while 13th seed Rublev overcame Matteo Arnaldi 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Opelka fired 23 aces in his 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory against #NextGenATP star Nicolai Budkov Kjaer. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!
