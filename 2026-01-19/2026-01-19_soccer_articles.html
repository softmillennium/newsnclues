                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House Yuri Gripas / Abaca / Bloomberg via Getty Images The New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said he intends to raise the impact of travel bans on this summer's FIFA World Cup with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying it is “something (he) hopes will change” ahead of the tournament. On Sunday, Mamdani hosted a Manhattan watch party for the Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal, taking over New York City Surrogate's Court for fans to congregate and watch the game, which was eventually won in controversial circumstances by Senegal. Since Trump returned to power last January, the U.S. has imposed a string of travel bans on nationals from designated countries, including four countries (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Iran, and Haiti) that have qualified for the 48-team World Cup. In June, Trump signed off on another travel ban in which Haiti and Iran were among 12 countries impacted, a step Trump described as essential to “protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.” However, the FIFA PASS is not a visa in itself; it merely provides a prioritized visa appointment system for those who have purchased tickets to attend the tournament. Applicants will still face the same rigorous security and screening processes, and there has been no indication that nationals of countries facing travel bans will be able to enter by buying a FIFA ticket. On Sunday, members of New York City's Senegalese diaspora were brought together by Mamdani in one of the city's most iconic courthouses, which was built 119 years ago. In an interview with The Athletic, Mamdani said: “For a long time, a love of this game, of these countries, of this tournament, is one that New Yorkers only got to experience in their own homes or in specific neighborhoods. “It's time for those two things to be linked. Eight World Cup matches will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final, but FIFA's host-city agreement is with both New York City and New Jersey, lending Mamdani a seat at the table. “It's something that I hope will change,” Mamdani told The Athletic, in an interview which took place just as the final began. “I think that for this tournament to be the experience that we want it to be for so many, we have to think about the previous World Cups that came before it. Asked if it is something he can raise with Trump, Mamdani said: “I think it's part of a number of things that I will make clear about what the city is hopeful for.” Mamdani, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, came under significant fire from Trump during his campaign to win the New York City mayoralty, but the pair had an unexpectedly warm first public meeting in the Oval Office in November, in which Trump described Mamdani as a “rational person” and added that he would be “cheering” for him. During his campaign to become mayor, Mamdani also turned his ire on the World Cup organizers, FIFA, over its ticketing strategy. Mamdani launched a “Game Over Greed” petition that called on FIFA to abandon its plan to use dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, impose a cap on ticket resales, and set aside 15 percent of tickets for local residents at a discount. Since then, FIFA has rolled out prices for the World Cup that brought condemnation from supporter groups and some federations, but the governing body also claims it has received 500 million ticket requests for the competition. On Sunday afternoon, Mamdani reiterated his concerns about FIFA's approach, saying: “I continue to think that the right approach here is to end dynamic pricing, cap resale prices, and to have 15 per cent of tickets set aside at a discount for local residents. We are only asking for what we have seen (before), and I will continue to make that case now as the mayor of New York City, as opposed to just a candidate.” Mamdani is also in the process of hiring a World Cup czar to streamline local services ahead of the competition, with a focus on promoting tourism, encouraging access and affordability, and ensuring that public services scale capacity to accommodate the games and the arrival of tourists. They need to obviously have a passion for the game, a fluency in the different government agencies that you have to engage with and interact with to make events like this possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pape Thiaw could be bannned from the 2026 World Cup The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has officially opened disciplinary proceedings against Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw following his actions during the dramatic 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final. The decision places Thiaw under threat of a lengthy suspension, with reports suggesting he could potentially miss the 2026 FIFA World Cup, scheduled to be co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026. The proceedings stem from a controversial moment late in the AFCON final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on Sunday, January 18, 2026. A penalty was awarded to Morocco in stoppage time after a VAR review, sparking protests from the Senegal players. Watch how Senegal coach was forced to leave press conference after AFCON final While Senegal ultimately went on to win 1–0 in extra time, the incident has drawn the attention of CAF, who are investigating whether Thiaw's actions violated disciplinary codes regarding player conduct, match integrity, and engagement with match officials. Reports indicate Thiaw could face a maximum suspension that could go as long as the 2026 World Cup. A suspension for Thiaw could affect the team's preparation and leadership ahead of the 2026 World Cup, placing the country's national squad under scrutiny at a critical time. CAF has not yet announced a timeline for its investigation or potential sanctions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fulham have made a $35 million (€30 million) offer for U.S. men's national team star Ricardo Pepi, GOAL can confirm, and, despite seeing that bid rejected, several English clubs remain interested in the forward. The offer comes despite Pepi's recent arm injury, which hasn't prevented Premier League clubs from making a push to sign the striker this January. GOAL can confirm that Fulham are among the teams looking to sign Pepi this January. The Premier League club is among several sides in England interested in Pepi, who commanded similar interest last summer before suffering a knee injury. Fabrizio Romano first reported that clubs remain interested despite the setback, while The Athletic previously reported that PSV rejected an initial $35 million bid from Fulham. Sources confirmed to GOAL last year that Pepi was the subject of a $20.7M (€20M) bid from a Premier League club, although his knee injury and PSV's reluctance to sell ended any possibility of a move. Sources also confirmed that PSV rejected a loan-to-buy offer from West Ham last year. After building fitness to start this season, Pepi has once again earned his place in the XI and has 11 goals in 22 appearances this season. That includes eight goals in just 716 Eredivisie minutes as well as goals against Napoli, Olympiacos, and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, all off the bench. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting With Pepi out of action, PSV will look to maintain the club's stranglehold on the Eredivisie, which they currently lead by 16 points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tottenham have confirmed that defender Ben Davies is set to undergo surgery after fracturing his ankle in his side's 2-1 loss to West Ham. Pressure is mounting on Spurs boss Thomas Frank after a damaging home defeat to the relegation-threatened Hammers at the weekend. To make matters worse, Wales international Davies picked up the injury in the derby defeat and now he faces a lengthy lay-off. Callum Wilson's late winner at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday condemned Tottenham to a Premier League home record of played 11, lost six, and won just two. Two days on, Spurs manager Frank is walking a tightrope to stay in his role, although the north London team are sticking with the ex-Brentford boss for now. We are losing to a big London rival, there is nothing worse. On Monday, Tottenham revealed that Davies will go under the knife later today for a left ankle fracture he suffered early in the West Ham clash. It remains to be seen how long the experienced defender will be out for but the club have wished him a speedy recovery. When Tottenham sacked Ange Postecoglou after he guided them to Europa League glory last May, they turned to Frank for a more pragmatic approach. But Spurs, who finished 17th last term, are in a similar position to where they were under the Australian at this point last season but instead of swashbuckling, and often kamikaze, football, the north London team are utilising a style that has flattered to deceive. We are doing a lot of things right behind the scenes, but we are not getting the results which is crucial." Despite that, he was well aware that the defeat to West Ham was not good enough and even admitted his side's ability to deal with set pieces is at an all-time low. "It feels like we've seen this before, like at Bournemouth when we do very well second half, get the equaliser and push for the winner, having chances and opportunities, but not getting over the line. "We started well in the first 15, then went 1-0 down. Then we rushed too much, gave the ball away too much, half-time helped, the boys pushed and did everything right. It's super disappointing that we conceded in the last minute. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Tottenham have a chance to bounce back quickly from this West Ham setback when they host Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. If he fails to win any of those matches, Frank could be out the job by next week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mr Hoare, a senior Conservative MP, told Metro that could include not going to the World Cup, a day after he called for the King's state visit to the US to be cancelled. Labour MP Ms Osborne agreed that the tournament should be boycotted because Trump was ‘threatening Greenland and attacking our own government'. Craig Munro breaks down Westminster chaos into easy to follow insight, walking you through what the latest policies mean to you. He was also awarded FIFA's inaugural peace prize in December. England and Scotland have both qualified for the tournament in June, while Wales or Northern Ireland could also book their places through the play-offs. Questions have been raised about whether European countries should go to the tournament after Trump announced he would place 10% tariffs on the eight countries over their refusal to let Trump take over Greenland. Mr Hoare, who represents North Dorset, has joined those calls, telling Metro that dropping out of the spectacle would ‘refocus Trump's mind'. He told Metro: ‘We should send as many messages as possible to the Trump administration and the American people that there are certain red lines in regards to upholding sovereignty and international affairs. ‘If that means not going to the World Cup then we shouldn't go to the World Cup. ‘It doesn't allow you to behave like some modern-day pirate, gangster, bully.' On Sunday, Mr Hoare called for King Charles' spring visit to Washington to be scrapped – a suggestion endorsed by the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey. Labour's Kate Osborne MP, who is chair of the Women's Football All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), said she ‘supports those calling for a boycott.' The Jarrow and Gateshead East representative told Metro: ‘Trump's appalling record on human rights, climate change, his flagrant contempt for the rule of law, his attacks on democracy, and an illegal war in Venezuela is not enough for him. ‘Now he is threatening Greenland and attacking our own government & politicians. ‘Last year there was huge public support for the successful campaign to refuse to legitimise Trump by allowing him the honour of addressing Parliament. ‘The USA should not be able to participate in the World Cup, let alone be part of hosting it, so yes I support those calling for a boycott.' Three Lions Pride, England's official LGBTQ+ fan group, also announced last week they would not have a ‘visible presence' at the 2026 Men's World Cup due to what they called a ‘dangerous rollback of human rights' in the US. Labour MP Richard Burgon stopped short of endorsing a boycott, but called for the US to be barred from hosting the tournament. The US president announced over the weekend that he would be imposing 10% tariffs on the UK, increased to 25% from June 1, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark. The move sparked outrage across Europe, with Sir Keir Starmer telling an emergency press conference today that tariffs were ‘completely wrong'. ‘Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. ‘Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In years past, the U.S. men's national team coaching staff would have the chance to assess players during a January camp, often with friendlies for North American-based players. While some of the top USMNT players like Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun struggled to produce over the weekend, several fringe players stood out as they sought more significant opportunities in the national team picture. Aidan Morris has started to round into form with Middlesbrough and kept his consistency with a 90-minute effort in a 3–2 win over West Bromwich Albion on Friday.A former Columbus Crew academy player, Morris stood out in the American-heavy matchup, which saw him take on George Campbell and Darryl Dike, who both played in West Brom's first match under former Minnesota United manager Eric Ramsay.Continuing his blossoming partnership in a 4-4-2 midfield pivot with Hayden Hackney, Morris created two chances and made 20 passes into the final third, while also making six recoveries.Not likely a World Cup starter, his form through 2025–26 could put him in contention to play a key depth role this summer. Another product of an MLS academy, former New York City FC midfielder James Sands netted his first Bundesliga goal in FC St. Pauli's 3–2 loss to Borussia Dortmund.Saturday's loss marked the 16th start in 16 appearances for Sands with St. Pauli this season, but his first goal or assist in a season that sees his side sitting last in the table after 17 matches.Outside of the goal, the 25-year-old created a pair of chances and made six defensive contributions in a comeback effort that fell short.While not likely a contender for the 2026 World Cup squad, given his 14 previous caps, any sustained production would certainly have him on Pochettino's radar. 🕺🤩Enjoy Pat leading the bounce as we celebrate our three points together. The striker battle for the USMNT continues to heat up, and 2025 Gold Cup starter Patrick Agyemang is ensuring he stays in contention as a backup to presumed top choice, Folarin Balogun.The former Charlotte FC attacker found the back of the net for Derby County in a 1–0 win over Preston North End on Saturday, pushing his side up to 12th in the English Championship.With seven goals and four assists in 23 appearances this season, he has been one of the more consistent American players in the attack, outshining a player like Norwich City's Josh Sargent, who was demoted from the Canaries' first team as he looks for a transfer to Toronto FC.While not included among his 89-minute effort, Agyemang led the post-match celebrations between Derby's players and fans, showcasing just how quickly he has embedded himself in the club after joining in the summer. Tim Weah was central to Marseille's dominant 5–2 win over Angers in Ligue 1 action on Sunday, finding the back of the net for the second time in 2025–26.His goal came as Marseille's fourth before half time as he made a late run into the box, before rising for an aerial cutback from Hamed Traore, which he headed past the goalkeeper to cap off an outstanding first half for the squad from southern France. The 25-year-old played a key transitional role, providing vital linkups to Mason Greenwood, playing slightly inside and in front of him in the 3-4-2-1. Greenwood's goal to make it 2–0 came from Weah's skillful delay on the right side, before he lay off to the former Manchester United striker, who played a quick give-and-go with Emerson before finishing. With three goal contributions in 1,067 Ligue 1 minutes, Weah will look to maintain his form as a likely lock for the World Cup roster, vying for valuable minutes to showcase his skills in the USMNT's final four friendlies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's an eye-catching idea, says Simon Walters, but any European leader thinking about pulling out of the summer sporting showpiece would have to contend with a backlash from fans at home With England and Scotland already having qualified, possibly to be joined by Wales and Northern Ireland, he is far from alone in this country. Golf fanatic Donald Trump has never expressed much interest in football – until now. He has cultivated a close, some would say unhealthily so, friendship with the head of Fifa Gianni Infantino, ensuring Trump will be centre stage when the tournament kicks off. So imagine how embarrassing it would be to Trump if some countries pulled out in protest at his threats over Greenland. How much more damaging would such a boycott be if, for example, the nation involved was one of the World Cup giants? That is the notion that has been raised by German politician Jürgen Hardt of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's ruling CDU party. Clearly, the idea of a mass World Cup boycott is far-fetched, yet there is nothing new about such sporting boycotts – or of them being supported by Britain. There have been five boycotts of Olympic Games, including Hitler's Berlin in 1936. The Soviet Union had illegally invaded another country: Afghanistan. Would it even work as Herr Hardt seems to think? It is true that it a 2026 World Cup without the 16 European teams due to take part, including England, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Scotland, is almost unimaginable. The winners would be world champions in name only. Equally, Trump's supporters would doubtless argue that if Europe withdrew from the World Cup it would merely add sport to the continent's increasing economic, cultural, diplomatic and military irrelevance. Starmer and his fellow European leaders are currently in a desperate search for some means of applying pressure to the US over Greenland. A variety of means, mainly trade reprisals have been proposed. If the president matches his chilling threats to Denmark and Europe over Greenland with deeds, by the time he attends America's first match in the competition, against Paraguay on June 12 in Los Angeles, US troops may have taken over Greenland. Could they, or any other self respecting nation, take part if Trump has raised the Stars and Stripes over Greenland by then?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Big tournaments can often hinge on late drama. So when Mauricio Pochettino is considering his striking options for this summer's World Cup, he may keep in mind two forwards who are regularly proving capable of providing that critical cutting edge in England's Championship. Both, in different ways, have had to show resilience this season. First there is Haji Wright who, in coming off the bench to grab table-topping Coventry's late winner against Leicester City, ended a run of 17 league games without a goal stretching back to October. Frank Lampard's side had trailed against their Midlands rivals, but made it 1-1 just after half-time on Saturday before Wright's 85th-minute strike kept their title hopes well on track. Afterwards Lampard was full of praise for the 27-year-old's determination to end his dry streak through sheer hard work. “The problem for Haji and the team was that we haven't had training time so this week was a competitive training week, and when you train and things aren't dropping for you on the pitch, my only belief is that you work, work, work and stay positive and things will happen for you. ‘The thing that happened for him today is a tap-in and I'm not belittling it because that's the way it goes. “Now it's for him to continue in that vein. He was such a problem for Leicester when he came on: running in behind, holding it up, tracking back, giving fouls away because he's trying to make tackles on the halfway line to see out the game for us. That's what we needed from everyone, but when Haji can do it, he's a special player for us.” On that note, Patrick Agyemang said ‘hold my beer' — and in Derby's game went one better by scoring the only goal of a nail-biting victory at promotion hopefuls Preston North End. He celebrated like it meant an awful lot to him, too, soaking up the acclaim from a jubilant away end at Preston's Deepdale stadium. I can't let it dwindle my game,'” he said. We're all human, so nobody is always going to score every chance, but for me it's most important when I hear the fans backing me and my boys on the team cheering me saying: ‘Pat go again, next one.' “On a personal note, I've been working on this mental battle in terms of being a striker and those opportunities and knowing things won't go well all the time, but it's always about the next one and I was able to show that today.” It wasn't quite so upbeat for Chris Richards and Crystal Palace. This time last year, things were going so well for the USMNT defender and his Premier League team as they embarked on what would be a historically successful FA Cup campaign, and qualification for UEFA competition. Richards was loving playing as part of an ultra-dependable, three-man band of brothers at the back, alongside captain Marc Guehi and Maxime Lacroix. Holders Palace were dumped out of the cup at the third-round stage by a non-League team — sixth-tier Macclesfield beat them 2-1 — Guehi is joining Manchester City, and manager Oliver Glasner is off in the summer, too. Richards, who was voted 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year last week, came back down to earth with a hefty bump and would be forgiven wondering what can go wrong next. The former was at least part of a key victory for Milan on Sunday evening, as they edged past Lecce with a 1-0 win that kept them in the title race and three points behind rivals Inter at the top. Pulisic had a quiet game by his standards, and has now gone five games without a goal after an otherwise blustering individual start to the campaign. McKennie, who conversely has been in fine personal form, started but could not prevent Juventus dropping points on Saturday as they lost 1-0 to 15th-placed Cagliari. In the Italian second tier, though, it was a thoroughly positive weekend for American Gianluca Busio. Busio's former midfield team-mate in Venice, Tanner Tessmann, may have departed last year for bigger things at Lyon in France's Ligue 1 — he started as they won on Sunday — but the 23-year-old still in Italy is still playing an integral part in Venezia's hopes of getting back into the top flight. In Tessmann's current league, Tim Weah was on the scoresheet with Marseille's fourth in a 5-2 rout of Angers, ending a nine-match goalless run with his third score in all competitions this season. Last but not least, also in Ligue 1 and on the still-U.S.-eligible front, Connecticut-born Luca Koleosho made a winning impression on loan with Paris FC. The 21-year-old joined Paris earlier this month after briefly spending time on loan from Burnley with Espanyol, and made it a fairytale start by netting the winner in their 2-1 victory at Nantes. (Koleosho is currently an Italy youth international with eligibility for the U.S., Canada and Nigeria) It's Champions League time again, so all eyes are on the USMNT contingent in action this week. Balogun will be hoping for better fortune with Monaco. The USMNT striker missed two chances and was taken off injured in their 3-1 home defeat by Lorient on Friday. See if he recovers in time to face Real Madrid (Tuesday, 3pm, Paramount +). Also in Madrid, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso was back in Diego Simeone's first team at the weekend as Atletico beat Deportivo Alaves 1-0. He will hope he can make the cut again, after a spell on the sidelines, as Atletico take on Galatasaray (Wednesday, 12:45pm, Paramount +). Meanwhile, on Thursday, Auston Trusty will try and help Celtic overcome Bologna in their Europa League clash (12:45pm, Paramount +). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A FIFA spokesperson has issued a strong statement after calls for Donald Trump to be stripped of the 2025 FIFA Peace Prize, which the US President was awarded before the FIFA World Cup draw in December 2025. The 79-year-old was given a golden trophy, medal, and certificate by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who stood alongside Trump as he made a speech to the crowd in Washington D.C. During his speech, the US President claimed that he had saved “tens of millions of lives” through interventions and that he had “stopped wars happening just before they started”. FIFA has described the award as something that rewards “individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world”. However, since receiving the medal, the Trump administration has been heavily criticised for taking military action in Venezuela. On January 2, Trump announced that US forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro along with his wife, Cilia Flores, after a covert operation. Trump has also issued threats that the US will take military action against Iran, Mexico, Colombia, and Greenland. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the plans as “completely wrong”. Meanwhile, in a statement to The Guardian, FIFA has doubled down on its stance to give Trump the peace prize despite the threats to take over Greenland and take military action in several other nations. A spokesperson said: “FIFA strongly supports its annual peace prize, an award to recognise exceptional actions for peace and unity. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado] has given her medal to President Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Toronto and Vancouver gear up to co-host FIFA World Cup games this summer, an emergency doctor worries that Canada's overburdened health-care system won't be able to handle any extra demand that could result. Her concern is supported by years of research showing that health issues — like infectious disease outbreaks, food-borne illnesses and alcohol overconsumption — can strain emergency rooms during or after mass gatherings. For example, researchers found that a strain of measles was introduced to Vancouver during the 2010 Olympic Winter Games and resulted in an outbreak of 82 cases three months after the event. Researchers have also noted that during the Calgary Stampede, there is an increase in emergency department visits related to trauma, substance-abuse and minor injuries. And research has also found that World Cup matches could trigger an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies. There's also the possibility of large-scale attacks that can send many to hospital, like the one that took place early last year at Vancouver's Lapu-Lapu festival. Varner started looking into these sorts of examples after working at a Toronto hospital during the Toronto Blue Jays' World Series run this past fall. And while Varner says she knows that in extreme cases there's a process in place to quickly move patients and free up the emergency department, she questions how that would work given the current state of health care in Canada. "The challenge is execution of those plans in a health-care system that does not have enough hospital beds on any given day," she said. Canada is co-hosting this year's FIFA World Cup along with the United States and Mexico. Crowds of fans interacting with each other before, during and after matches is the perfect breeding ground for various infectious diseases, specifically respiratory or food and water-borne ones, according to a report from Public Health Ontario. Following a months-long risk assessment, the provincial health agency determined that measles, COVID-19 and food and water-borne outbreaks like food poisoning or hepatitis A, are "likely" during the World Cup games. And that'll put a strain not only on the health-care system … but the public health system will be doing contact tracing amongst a lot of people." Conway, who is not part of any health-care planning for the World Cup, said people should make sure they're up to date with their vaccinations. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),  some of which are on the rise in Canada, are another key concern for Conway, who says condoms and treatment for STIs should be easily available. "The health system does respond to issues like this with some regularity and does have mechanisms in place," said Lysyshyn, who is part of public health planning for Vancouver's FIFA games. And while Lysyshyn acknowledged that it's not ideal to have to cancel surgeries or move people around, he says that's how the system here works. St. Michael's Hospital trauma surgeon Dr. Andrew Beckett says all hospitals have robust plans to accept a large number of people in need of immediate medical attention. When it comes to the World Cup, Beckett says he's part of a planning group alongside leadership from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and Sick Kids. "We're looking at ways of being able to surge capacity within the hospitals by shutting down some elective surgeries if needed. He also said they would triage patients to hospitals depending on the severity of their injuries and the level of care needed. Beckett says the province has provided additional funding to support emergency resources during the World Cup games, though he couldn't say how much. Ontario's Ministry of Health didn't respond to questions about extra staffing or resources available to support an increase in demand, nor did it confirm whether additional funding is available for hospitals. In an email last week, a spokesperson said the government will work with all health-care partners to "ensure they have the tools they need to deliver high-quality care." In a report to city council, Toronto Public Health (TPH) listed several ways it's preparing for various health emergencies, including launching a food safety portal to keep track of inspections and more easily share information about possible illnesses with the public. As for extreme heat or wildfire smoke, the health unit says it will amp up its communication to visitors and will have misting stations and water trucks available. The city is also launching a wastewater testing program for the stadium and fan zone areas, which can be an early indicator of circulating infections. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.</p>
