Since then, plans have been scaled back, and the project has faced multiple delays amidst internal shakeups — but it was never abandoned. Bechtel posts loads of new jobs over the last few days looking for managers, welders and electricians to work on the New Albany project. Bechtel Group's Manufacturing and Technology unit, the construction firm responsible for building the Ohio One, has put up new recruitment offers on its website. At least eight of them directly mention New Albany, the city in Licking County serving as the location for Intel's "Silicon Heartland." Clicking on some of these listings reveals a project overview which says Bechtel is designing and building the first phase of Ohio One, spread across 2.5 million square feet, housing "as much steel as eight Eiffel Towers". Ohio One will start with two fabs, Mod 1 and Mod 2, but the space can accommodate up to eight in the future. By that point, Intel might've already moved past even its next-gen 14A process. Intel's latest Panther Lake lineup of mobile CPUs is built in the U.S. at its Arizona and Oregon facilities using the company's new 18A node, a major breakthrough for domestic chip manufacturing. But 18A doesn't have big external clients beyond the Blue Team's own needs, something that it desperately wants to change with 14A. Ever since his appointment, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been rather bearish about the node, but just a few days ago, the executive made a sharp reversal in his sentiments. Ohio One had been long prophesied as the birthplace of 14A, but as things stand right now, that window has likely slipped since 14A is tipped to be production-ready by 2027. That being said, the project was always intended as a leading-edge logic campus, so any new processes can be taped out in the future. We don't need to speculate that far ahead; let's stick with the present. Add to that a budding Nvidia partnership worth $5 billion, and we see a revitalized Intel that finally seems competitive again (especially in its Foundry business), accelerating work on Ohio One after years of stagnation.

I pay Apple premium price for their phones. I believed their leadership understood that.Looking at the article, the kind interpretation is that this is the same wrong-headed shift towards uniformity at all costs we've seen elsewhere in their products.

This makes me a bit uncomfortable because of how close it comes to infringing on freedom of speech, and how specific a rule it would for search engines (and chat bots) - i.e. there's no real analogy of "can't target trademarked terms" for any ad format other than search engines.I think my preference would be to simply enforce laws around fraud. Bring the enforcement hammer down so that companies don't dare make an ad that granny might mistake for not being an ad. Make them err far on the side of making ads look unmistakably like ads for fear of ruinous fines. I think my preference would be to simply enforce laws around fraud. Bring the enforcement hammer down so that companies don't dare make an ad that granny might mistake for not being an ad. Make them err far on the side of making ads look unmistakably like ads for fear of ruinous fines. That's fine, ads should be downright forbidden and get no "freedom of speech". It would require conflicts of interest to be disclosed clearly. I.e. labelling speech incentivized by someone else (ad buyer) clearly, as not organic speech (the search engine results).That is pro-transparency and ethics, not anti-speech. That's specifically what I'm proposing in the post you replied to? Googling a trademark should activate a "no bids" mode.If Google wants to defend this action, then they should explain why they turned the URL bar into a search product and bought up 90% of the real estate. They've been incredibly heavy handed in search, web, and ads.

They've been incredibly heavy handed in search, web, and ads. I heard someone randomly say that they should replace Tim Cook with Scott Forstall. I chuckled at the idea but this might be a great idea.Apple is having its Ballmer moment. Google did too before AI lit the fire under their feet.Who is going to be Apple's next Nadella? Google did too before AI lit the fire under their feet.Who is going to be Apple's next Nadella? Who is going to be Apple's next Nadella? Maybe I'm too old, but if Apple fixed every single bug and added absolutely zero features until the day of my death, I would still be a satisfied customer.The problem is not lack of innovation, the problem is that everything barely works. Either way it should be someone currently outside Apple. The company needs an external eye to review its processes and cruft that built up under Cook (nothing negative against the guy, but what worked 5-10 years ago won't necessarily work 5-10 years down the road). Unfortunately now under Nadella AI is taking the role Windows used to play, but even there he understood the importance of AI before most of his competitors did which is what allowed Microsoft to gain such a substantial footing in OpenAI. No.But for mega-tech CEO salary, I'd probably do exactly the same. But for mega-tech CEO salary, I'd probably do exactly the same. Same thing that killed Intel, Microslop, pretty much every american company. The enterprise is going to choose Windows regardless for the masses and even if consumers make a mass exodus to Apple (not going to happen because of price) or Linux (even less likely) they are out of $30 they charge OEMs. The workarounds to get rid of the nag to log into your icloud account on macOS are far more difficult than the workarounds to avoid using an MS account in Windows. Buy a new Apple Watch and notice that the settings app with have a [1] badge trying to upsell you to buy AppleCare+. They obscure dismissing these by clicking the "Add AppleCare Coverage" button and then having a button that says actually no. Not as egregious as what windows is doing with copilot everywhere or sneakily flipping user-toggled options during updates, but it's all some degree of gross. It's certainly not as bad _right now_ as what you'll see on Windows 11, but this is something that will almost certainly only get worse over time. Windows is absolutely miserable, but with WSL installed it's far and away the better dev environment. I say that as someone who dailies Linux and hates all three OSes. From 2008-12 it was genuinely exciting to see what new apps were being released every day. Mobile games from that era had cultural impact. I bought $2 apps without a thought.But Apple incentivized monetization above all else and killed that excitement. Apple's curated list of “essential utilities” includes a birthday countdown that costs $5/wk.I know every app will cost me hundreds over the span of just a few years for marginal utility so I simply stopped buying them. And I wonder if Apple's push for more ad revenue is a symptom of that trend. But Apple incentivized monetization above all else and killed that excitement.

If you've made a game, it doesn't matter how high quality it is, how many awards it has won, etc.The only thing that matters is that it's live service, that it doesn't "have an end", that it can drive engagement and perpetual revenue.Quite a few testimonies from game devs: according to them, Google representatives pretty much told them this.See also: the requirements to constantly update your app/game even if it's a "finished product" that does not inherently require any updates.

That said, I completely agree that you cannot find any interesting apps by just browsing the App Store as a whole. I'm relatively new to the space, but it feels like more and more of the time of indie devs / bootstrappers needs to get allocated towards marketing. If you're optimizing for searchers (SEO) you've been out of the loop for a decade or catering almost exclusively to the elderly I hope so, but the barriers to entry are mighty. Except on Android when you search for something and you get the big "match found" with "install" button, it's an ad and the real result is hidden like a search result.This practice ought to be illegal. These are trademarks, and monopolies are injecting themselves as market makers in a bidding war they created.This isn't enshittification.

For those that do, they won't get past scare wall #1 of enabling APKs and scare walls #2, #3, and #4 of downloading, installing, and enabling the app.Google knows this.Tyranny of defaults, trained user behaviors, ecosystem, scare tactics, and even SERPs manipulation to make this nigh undiscoverable.But they weren't content with some number of you slipping through the cracks!

I think KDE has something like connect that aims to do what iCloud does. I love Linux with CachyOS on my desktop. I think KDE has something like connect that aims to do what iCloud does. Seems like this is just plain old greed... You can't tell family to search for things in the app store anymore, I always provide direct links. Music.app is simply an ad for Apple Music, Books.app is like reading in a Barnes and Noble while someone from marketing looks over your shoulder and their TV app features their own shows to an overbearing degree — everything else is becoming more of an afterthought. If you use iTunes Match or load your own MP3s every time you open the app the search field is set to “Apple Music” and the search fails until you toggle it, every time.Been like that for 2+ years for example the listing for the official microsoft authenticator app (free and used in many corporate environments) is surrounded by results with similar looking icons and titles. not exactly a scam since they do work, but its obvious they are only there to confuse users into paying for something thats free. If they haven't switched yet, its not going to happen. Late users are always punished like my parents who still have a landline and cable tv. Apple's App Store ad initiatives have always been woeful, and doubt it makes enough revenue to warrant a separate line item on their public accounting reports. Some executive has seen yet another overfunded company potentially making bank with an ad-based business model (OpenAI, et al.), and has thought they could extract Google-level ad revenue due to the App Store's exclusivity. It could also be a response to potentially competing App Stores given their rocky relationship with the EU.It will have little effect, on revenue or user experience. It will have little effect, on revenue or user experience. I feel like that would only be tragic if you expected the App Store monopoly company to care about users instead of profits.For most of us on the sidelines this is a real "told you so" moment. For most of us on the sidelines this is a real "told you so" moment. I assume that means it increases the number of times users install the wrong app (possibly with serious consequences)? Shame apple is going towards the dark pattern of ads as results. I always use direct app links, from the developers' sites.I shudder to think of it getting worse. I shudder to think of it getting worse. I never visit the App Store outside of that. If I need an app, I search for it and go directly to its listing page (yes, technically the App Store) or install it directly from my Home Screen. Does your everyday user know that or do they assume the blue results are better? Does your everyday user know that or do they assume the blue results are better? Does your everyday user know that or do they assume the blue results are better? By removing distinctions between ads and normal results, you're going from a frying pan situation straight into the fire. These companies are overconfident.Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. How the hell Apple does not see this is beyond me. All of their fancy security in iOS is worthless if they allow people to be tricked into installing scam-ware. In fact, they had so many ChatGPT fake apps showing as top results that they had to do something as users couldn't find the real one and it reached the news. I think the situation is a lot more stark than this. But if the founder doesn't maintain controlling interest, the founder can be replaced.The promotion of Steve Jobs to interim CEO of Apple in 1997 was a rare exception. Apple fired its CEO, and the company was in danger of bankruptcy. They were running out of options and feeling the aforemention desperation. Note how the situation was very different in 1985, when the board of directors chose John Sculley over Steve Jobs in a power struggle. At the time, they weren't financially desperate.

Note how the situation was very different in 1985, when the board of directors chose John Sculley over Steve Jobs in a power struggle. At the time, they weren't financially desperate. With compensation so completely tied to "did our stock go up since you joined? They're already rolling in profits that dwarf the national budgets of most countries. And I say this as a shameless Apple fanboy. Frankly, Apple could have probably just totally replaced the App Store a long time ago if they were not slaves to financial reports by simply integrating app search into spotlight more closely or prominently… pull down, search “ai app” (or whatever) and you're provided with a list of app results that includes an install button.App updating could and should have been integrated into the settings app.These kinds of things will only increasingly start biting the Apple as Google has been forced to face the abyss of the death of the common search they've dominated for decades now. I don't think Apple has faced that existential Grim-reaper yet… what do you do when the app ecosystem, OS UI/UX advantages, and even hardware quality has vanished through the cascading integration of AI? I don't know that Apple has faced that yet or at least has been left blindsided, considering what I've been seeing from them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Preeti Suri reached the summit of Mount Rainier, she wasn't just celebrating a mountaineering milestone; she was completing a transformation from burned out investment banker to founder on a mission. Suri is co-founder and CEO of Bellevue, Wash.-based AdventureTripr, a travel marketplace leveraging technology and AI to help facilitate multi-day outdoor excursions. Launched just one month before the 2020 pandemic lockdown, the company has scaled today to a profitable platform offering 500 trips across 50 countries, fueled by a lean team and a “tech-first” approach to travel curation. AdventureTripr has found success in dismantling the economic and social-cultural barriers that often keep people of color and first-time hikers away from the world's most iconic trails and peaks. She eventually climbed every major Washington volcano, a journey she describes as “absolutely transformational” for her mental health. And she knew costs could be lowered by working directly with local guides. She also understood that many South Asian travelers felt a sense of “intimidation and hesitation” because they hadn't grown up in a hiking culture. “A lot of the U.S. companies assumed a lot of the people of color either didn't know how to do this stuff or didn't want to do this stuff, whereas my insight was it was a lot of aspiration,” Suri said. While the company's clientele has balanced out over time, roughly 40% of its business still comes from a high-net-worth South Asian demographic — a “sweet spot” of customers who value the personalized training plans and gear guidance AdventureTripr provides. Alongside co-founder Marat Khabibullin, a longtime software engineer at Microsoft, Suri integrated AI into AdventureTripr's workflow long before it became a mainstream buzzword, scaling more rapidly than legacy adventure companies. “It takes us 15 minutes to upload a new trip because we have AI tools built for that and to create our content,” Suri said. The company is also currently developing AI agents to handle tasks such as answering traveler questions about gear or local tipping customs. But Suri remains skeptical of the “AI travel planner” trend that is popular among many startups. “Curation and customization is where the expert knowledge comes into play. Looking back at her banking days, Suri says she works just as hard now but without the looming threat of burnout. Fulfillment comes from seeing clients — ranging from cancer survivors to groups of 40 Indian moms — conquer treks like Machu Picchu or the Tour du Mont Blanc. “It doesn't feel like work anymore,” Suri said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. Meftah's example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom's AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. “People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren't going rogue, aren't deleting files, aren't doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031. As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there's room for many approaches. Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. “We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn't easily subsume you,” he said. So the question is, how do you beat them?” He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony appears to have removed the entire catalog of games published by ThiGames, a German company whose output was known primarily for its popularity with gamers looking to flaunt their 100% completion of as many titles as possible. Nuking ThiGames' catalog meant removing a lot of games. The next day, the site Delisted Games—which catalogs games that are, for whatever reason, no longer available to purchase—goes into more detail about this number, noting that it counts various translations and regional variations as individual titles; when this multiple counting is removed, the number shrinks to a more sensible 150 or so. In any case, the games in ThiGames' catalog seem to have shared one thing in common: they're what's referred to as “shovelware,” the metaphor being that they are shoveled out the studio's door with no regard for quality. While games like The Jumping Bonbon, The Jumping Strawberry, and The Jumping Onion Ring have a certain outsider-y charm to them, any popularity they enjoyed with PSN subscribers appears to have been largely because they make it easy to earn Platinum Trophies, which are awarded for obtaining all of a game's individual trophies. (For those without a PlayStation, trophies are similar to achievements on other platforms—you obtain them for completing certain objectives within a given game.) The obvious conclusion here is that Sony decided that it didn't want its store filled with… well, let's say “games of low quality.” Some commentators are describing the removal of these games as a long-overdue exercise in house cleaning and celebrating the fact that their visits to the PlayStation store will involve less time slogging through titles about jumping thingamajigs in search of real games to play. But ThiGames aren't the only company to cash in on gamers' thirst for trophies; there are many others whose entire output is predicated on the desire for bragging rights. In addition, several users on Twitter have pointed out that it's not clear whether Sony would have the right to just unilaterally ban a publisher's entire catalog based on a decision that those games kinda sucked. This has led to speculation that the publisher must have done something more egregious than just flooding the PlayStation store with unabashed slop. Numbers speak louder than words, and in this case, Netflix will still get dibs on Sony's movie slate for years to come. Sony Honda Mobility introduced the Afeela Prototype 2026 at CES as a larger crossover EV. Maybe one day, we'll get an AI that can watch the movies for us. How about a whole car with built-in Remote Play? And it's making us even more excited for the rumored PlayStation 6 handheld.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Martin adaptation takes place in the same world as House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones, but in a different time period—we're long past the Dance of the Dragons, but also long before Daenerys Targaryen returned to Westeros and started clawing her power back. But don't let the lack of familiar characters turn you away: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms introduces new faces you'll quickly grow to love, loathe, or feel both ways about depending on their unpredictable actions. It also explores Westeros from the point of view of a hedge knight as tall as he is humble. After many years as a squire, Dunk is ready to figure out the rest of his life; he's not sure what lies ahead. All he knows is what he's been taught by Ser Arlen—the rough life of a hedge knight—mixed with the grit and tenacity baked into him during his early childhood in Flea Bottom, the most perilous part of King's Landing. First, though, there's a makeshift funeral that must happen. Not knowing what to say, Dunk must improvise: “You were a true knight. You never beat me when I didn't deserve it… except that time in Maidenpool.” This odd assessment of Ser Arlen's good judgment is accompanied by rapid-fire flashbacks of Dunk at various ages being smacked on many occasions. It also begins to give us an idea of his relationship with Ser Arlen, a mentor he misses despite all the knocks. “I wish you didn't die, Ser,” he says tearfully, and promises to look after the horses. He also keeps Ser Arlen's sword, and that's what helps him decide his next move. “There is a tourney at Ashford Meadow,” he says wistfully. Thinking about the life-or-death stakes involved in entering a tournament has, unsurprisingly, made his stomach lurch. But it doesn't deter him: next stop, Ashford. The title appears onscreen without an opening credits sequence. This isn't the Westeros you're used to seeing on HBO; A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is far more simple and stripped-down. We know, of course, that this is Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell)—and if you know who Egg is beyond that, HBO would like you to keep that to yourself for now. Dunk assumes the kid is a stableboy, albeit one with an attitude problem. (For those who've read Martin's source novella, here's where we get our first of many “clout in the ear” threats Dunk makes, but never carries out, across the series.) Dunk heads into the inn to deal with his hunger. She doesn't get it, she says: “Knights are built the same as other men, and I never knew a joust to change the price of eggs.” The only other customer in the inn is a man passed out drunk—at least, until he pops his head up, blearily stares at Dunk, brandishes a knife, and blurts out, “I dreamed of you. Stay the fuck away from me, you hear?” It's an unsettling encounter and the weirdness increases when Dunk heads back to the stable and finds the bald kid goofing around with his armor and his best horse. Initially apologetic, the little boy soon turns saucy, sniffing that Dunk sure doesn't look like a knight. Dunk's annoyance softens when he finds out the kid is motherless. This is familiar to Dunk, who grew up an orphan. But he still turns down the offer to take on a pint-sized assistant. The next morning, we see Dunk riding into Ashford Meadow. The steward of Ashford (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor)—an oily-looking man who pauses to dramatically hock up phlegm while they're talking—gives him a hard time about not looking like a knight, even after Dunk tells him the very earnest story about Ser Arlen knighting him just before he died. The steward doubts his story—as do we, to be honest—but he pulls the gullible Dunk's leg by describing how Ashford town will torture anyone who pretends to be a knight. But the games master shows a shred of kindness as Dunk turns to leave. If Dunk can find “a true knight” to vouch for Ser Arlen, and by extension speak to Dunk's good honor, he'll allow him to enter—though he reminds Dunk that anyone who loses in the tourney forfeits their arms, armor, and horse to the victor, and must ransom them back. It's a reality check for Dunk, who has no money for ransom, and he bashes his head again on the same doorframe as he leaves the room. Intent on finding a knight to support his entry, he heads to the pavilion of Ser Manfred Dondarrian (Daniel Monks), hoping he'll remember Ser Arlen. As he walks away, vowing to track down Ser Manfred later, he mutters to his horse about being called “sad.” And anyway, “Ser Arlen always said a hedge knight was the truest kind of knight.” As we'll continue to see, Dunk's chats with his horses—and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' fondness for flashbacks—helps get around the fact that Martin's stories are written as Dunk's internal monologues, without resorting to voiceover. Dunk's grumbling is interrupted when he sees two men practicing their combat skills in the practice ring. This is Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) and his younger cousin, Raymun (Shaun Thomas), who's his squire and recreational punching bag. What he really needs is some peace and quiet. He finds it in the nearby forest, where Dunk gets a chance to clean up a bit (you can check “bare butt” off your Game of Thrones bingo card) before venturing back for another crack at Ser Manfred. No dice: he's still asleep, and the snarky ladies take another crack at Dunk. I was only asking for a bit of help,” he complains. They're sorry, sort of, but there'll be no talking to Ser Marfred tonight. Dunk wanders off into the camp, finding a puppet show in progress. “Fate has set his lonely path through corridors of chance,” we hear from the stage. “A boy from nothing risks it all, ignoring looks askance.” A little Tyrion Lannister callback for Game of Thrones fans, but in this case it's the scrappy Raymun Fossosay making a joke, because Dunk is obviously “half-man, half-giant.” Raymun asks Dunk if he's hungry. He follows Raymun into a tent decorated with antlers: this is Baratheon territory. Here's where we first spy Ser Lyonel Baratheon, “the Laughing Storm,” a charismatic, drunken maniac wearing a crown festooned with more of those giant antlers. It's a colorful, bawdy gathering, and at some point, the Laughing Storm takes notice of the giant stranger in his midst. Dunk is motioned over, and Ser Lyonel's opening line is an all-timer: “You ever been punched in the face before?” The encounter starts off light (Ser Lyonel chastizes him for slouching and tells him “Be tall”), but it gets more prickly—and Dunk is rightfully intimidated as hell by this wealthy, powerful, eccentric lord who gives him a hard time for crashing his party. Eventually, they're huddled up at Lyonel's table, and Dunk earnestly confides his fears. Sure, he's big and strong, but he hasn't had the training most knights at this tourney have had. If Dunk loses, he'll be left with nothing. Lyonel has no answer, and stumbles off, leaving Dunk to ponder his choices. Dunk seizes the moment, earnestly pleading his case. All that effort was for nothing, and Dunk is snootily dismissed. He puts up a blustery front, but after the day he's had, the boy just about passes for a friendly face. “Ser Duncan the Tall,” Dunk says, pulling himself up to his full height. The kid sniffs that he's never heard of Ser Duncan the Tall, then reveals his own name is Egg. After a moment, Dunk reluctantly agrees he can serve him for the tourney. The smile on Egg's face is everything as Dunk explains he doesn't have much, but he will always share. Plus: “I promise not to beat you, except when you deserve it.” When Egg calls him “M'lord,” he corrects him. Lying on their bedrolls, the duo spots a shooting star. Egg says it's good luck, and also points out that they're probably the only ones to have seen it, since all the fancy knights are in their pavilions. Dunk is still grumpy, and this takes a minute to sink in. “So the luck is ours alone?” Dunk says, his voice full of genuine wonder, and we see that same smile on Egg's face. Will Dunk find someone to vouch for him so he can enter the lists? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. As 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' arrives on HBO, the author is once again addressing that long-awaited next entry in his 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series. Fitting thing for a Jon Snow show to do, honestly. Showrunner Ira Parker explains how the iconic music finds its way into HBO's latest journey to George R.R. Martin's Westeros brings a smaller-scaled but no less epic adventure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S. After learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI. The technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths, The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said. Now with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies' next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health.

If a PC mouse and keyboard could be used instead, we'd see greater potential. Sahib's social media feed reveals that he's been busy doing more than just shoehorning Microsoft's legendary OS into this sandbox RPG. The same modder has also managed to get Minecraft running in Hytale, delivering a fatal wound to its spiritual predecessor, perhaps. With all of these amazing modding achievements under its belt, within one week of Early Access launch, there are surely many great things to come. It came about from efforts of the Hypixel Minecraft team, with roots stretching back to 2015. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Hytale has been built from the ground up for modding, with “creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.” That's in addition to the more traditional fun of “exploration, responsive combat, and robust building.” The game developer's modding strategy was outlined last November. Hytale made an almighty splash when it entered Early Access last week. Reports say there were 2.8 million Hytale players on launch day, and 420,000+ Twitch viewers made it the global No.1 watched game, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you haven't checked your Facebook account in a while, fear not, the spam accounts are still doing very well. Now with eerie and ever-advancing AI slop in their arsenal—and, lately, football fans to prey on. There's a group of accounts on Facebook that claims to be a bunch of fan accounts for various National Football League teams. “After His Desire To Return To The Steelers Was Not Fulfilled, Instead Of Reacting With Anger Or Resentment, The Former Player Chose To Retire And Join The Pittsburgh Police Department To “Wear Pittsburgh Colors Once Again.” a Pittsburgh Steelers fan account with 11,000 followers claimed in a post earlier this week. Thielen recently announced his retirement, and briefly played for the Steelers late last year. He has not shared any plans to join Pittsburgh law enforcement. Another such account, a Denver Broncos fan account with more than 6,000 followers called “Wild Horse Warriors,” found a victim not in a player, but in Broncos reporter Cody Roark. Not only was Roark alive and well, he doesn't even have kids to begin with. “Usually you see that happen to, like, high-profile celebrities,” Roark told The Denver Post. The account was just created in November and has now been shut down by Meta after The Denver Post reached out for comment. In its two-month existence, the account reportedly disseminated a slew of misinformation posts about Broncos players as well, including a false claim that wide receiver Courtland Sutton refused to wear an LGBTQ+ solidarity armband during a game. But even though “Wild Horse Warriors” is now a thing of the past, similar accounts continue to proliferate on Facebook. What do these accounts have to gain from fake AI-generated news about football players? While it's not certain how these specific accounts operate, the pattern seems to fit what has long been utilized by Facebook spam accounts. Each post by these fake fan accounts links out to an article from a website that pretends to be a reputable news organization like “ESPNS” or “NCC News.” “Spam Pages largely leveraged the attention they obtained from viewers to drive them to off-Facebook domains, likely in an effort to garner ad revenue,” Harvard researchers wrote in a study from 2024. Other pages could be trying to accumulate an audience and good standing with the algorithm by using these fake shock-value clickbait news stories first, before completely changing the purpose of the page. “It could be that these were nefarious pages that were trying to build an audience and would later pivot to trying to sell goods or link to ad-laden websites or maybe even change their topics to something political altogether,” Georgetown researcher Josh Goldstein told NPR in a 2024 interview about AI spam accounts on Facebook. Personalization that is maybe a bit too personal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Figueira is alleged to have used multiple bank accounts, crypto exchange accounts, crypto wallets, and shell companies to conduct his money laundering operation. “The FBI has identified approximately a billion dollars' worth of cryptocurrency that was passed through crypto wallets utilized by Figueira and his laundering operation to individuals and businesses throughout the world,” said FBI Special Agent Reid Davis according to a DOJ press release. Court documents say Figueira mainly conducted his crypto activities in the stablecoin issued by Tether, known as USDT, on the Tron blockchain. A recent report released by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis found that stablecoins are becoming increasingly used in illicit crypto transactions, now accounting for 84% of such transactions after only amounting to roughly 12% of that activity in 2020. The report also indicated last year's record year of $154 billion in illicit crypto transfers was mostly due to use by nation states, such as Iran and Venezuela, to avoid sanctions. According to a report in DL News, Figueira is quoted touting the benefits of using USDT for money laundering on a phone call cited in court documents. Notably, Tron is also the crypto network founded by Justin Sun, who is at the heart of pay-to-play allegations made by House Democrats against the SEC due to Sun's involvement with multiple crypto projects linked to President Trump. Tron is generally viewed as a more centralized little brother to Ethereum; however, it is widely used for USDT transfers due to offering faster and cheaper transactions. In addition to the $1 billion in illicit crypto processing identified by the DOJ, court documents indicate Figueira was also bragging about processing up to $700 million worth of illicit funds on a monthly basis. Roughly a week ago, Tether froze $182 million worth of USDT around the same time a detailed report on Venezuela's use of the stablecoin to avoid economic sanctions was released in The Wall Street Journal. Crypto can be a double-edged sword for authoritarian regimes, as another recent report pointed to the massive increase in withdrawals from centralized crypto exchanges to the non-custodial Bitcoin network in Iran are a sign people are opting out of the traditional financial system in an effort to avoid the devaluation of the Iranian rial and potential capital controls amid nationwide protests. In other words, authoritarian regimes use crypto to avoid restrictions imposed by other nations (namely the United States), and the people living under those regimes use crypto to avoid restrictions imposed locally on them. The crypto industry has become increasingly centralized around stablecoins like USDT, despite their growing use for illicit purposes. Everyone from large tech giants to traditional banks are now interested in launching stablecoins, but whether they'll be allowed to move around freely despite continued criminal use remains to be seen. Then again, legal action like that taken against Figueira indicates there are plenty of eyes tracking the movement of stablecoins on the blockchain anyway, and Tether has made it clear that it's actively working with many law enforcement agencies around the world on a regular basis to guard against criminal activity. There's a new spotlight on crypto that's used to avoid sanctions after the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Elon Musk's satellite megaconstellation will provide free broadband internet access to Venezuela following the U.S. incursion.</p>
