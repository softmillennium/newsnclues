Related Stories ‘It Was Just an Accident': Inside 2025's Most Pivotal 15 Minutes and Best Supporting Performance For the Season Finale of ‘Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints,' Scorsese Called Upon a Trusted Collaborator: His Daughter Francesca Scorsese explained that when Stevens came back from World War II, his work took on a new sense of purpose and urgency in powerful works like “A Place in the Sun,” “Shane,” “Giant,” and “The Diary of Anne Frank.” “He began to pay very close attention to evil, to the greed and the hatred and the raw murderous violence that can overtake us all if we don't all pay attention,” Scorsese said. Although Stevens was not a particularly religious man, he saw in Jesus Christ a way to explore those themes on their grandest scale. Stevens chose to enact the story on a scale of mythic grandeur and timeless immensity. This picture was years in the making at a cast of thousands.” It also felt of a piece with Stevens' Westerns thanks to the unusual choices the director made when it came to locations. It's an extraordinary idea and it was really controversial because most biblical epics up to that time been shot somewhere near the Middle East or in the Middle East.” Scorsese noted that the film was part of a trend that included Nicolas Ray's “King of Kings” and Pier Paolo Pasolini's “The Gospel According to St. Matthew” that brought a new immediacy to the story of Jesus Christ. Scorsese added that the production encountered “one calamity after another” and ultimately didn't fully realize Stevens' vision. In a way, his ambitions were so grand that it wasn't possible to realize them fully, but the sheer intensity and artistry of the picture is moving all on its own. Stevens' son, filmmaker George Stevens Jr., supervised the Film Foundation's restoration and appeared in person at the Academy Museum to introduce Guillermo del Toro, a lifelong Stevens enthusiast and Film Foundation board member who was present to deliver a 20-minute lecture on “The Greatest Story Ever Told” before the film. As a Catholic raised in Mexico, del Toro estimated that he had seen “The Greatest Story” over 20 times — and he sat with the audience in the Academy Museum to watch it again in its exquisite new restoration. Del Toro provided rich historical context for the film, describing Stevens' path through several epochs of filmmaking. “He lived through every era of cinema,” del Toro said before exploring Stevens' innovations during the silent period, his wartime documentary work, his seminal post-war American epics, and the influence he had on the New Hollywood. This last topic was where del Toro's lecture was most revelatory, as he explained why the perception of Stevens as a staid classical filmmaker is dead wrong, and that in fact Stevens was a modernist who influenced one of the most groundbreaking films of the 1960s, “Bonnie and Clyde.” “He influenced Martin Ritt, Warren Beatty, Terrence Malick and many more.” Del Toro gave the example of Warren Beatty studying the sound mix of “Shane” and applying its principles to the climactic shoot-out in “Bonnie and Clyde.” “Beatty was the first man that noticed ‘Shane' was a modern film by a modern master. “ His canvas became Ultra Panavision 70, with a spherical system that gave him extra space,” del Toro said. “When he shot this movie, there was a battle between TV and cinema — we're there again — and the battle was how to get people into theaters. The larger formats were getting people into theaters, but very few directors really knew how to use it and how to use it expressively.” Del Toro added that Stevens used the vast potential of the Ultra Panavision 70 frame as a tool to examine his themes with sweep and intensity. “You can find out more about an artist by their art than by sharing space and time with them,” del Toro said when explaining that “The Greatest Story Ever Told” expressed Stevens' profoundly humanistic point of view. “The Greatest Story Ever Told” represented a demonstration of all that Stevens had learned and felt about good and evil since liberating Dachau concentration camp during his time in the service, an experience that informed the film he made right before “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” “The Diary of Anne Frank.” “One of the questions he was trying to grapple with was that no one group crucified Jesus,” del Toro said. Yet for del Toro, what stands out about “The Greatest Story Ever Told” and the rest of Stevens' body of work is its hopefulness and faith. “Don't let them lie to you that hatred is our superpower. “What would George Stevens have done after this film if given another chance at the canvas he was grappling with?” del Toro asked before closing his lecture with the memory of watching “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” “If you grow up Mexican, every Easter you saw this movie.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Norwegian director said that he was “very proud to see also a lot of local European support for the film.” Echoing themes similar to those reported over the weekend from Germany by Melanie Goodfellow, my Deadline colleague, Trier realized when he was at the awards ceremony that “this is a Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, French, German, British co-production. Who would have thought Europe united in the movies?” Stellan Skarsgård Reacts To Trump's Greenland Demands: "What's Happening Is Absurd" - European Film Awards Joachim Trier's 'Sentimental Value' Sweeps Board At   European Film Awards - Full Winners List Following the film's wild reception at the Cannes Film Festival last May, where it received a 19-minute ovation, I remember queuing up for the after-party with Eva Yates, director of BBC Film, who seemed thrilled that she and her team had backed the film. “They were very supportive,” Trier said of BBC Film's involvement. So I found that collaboration very valuable and it made it possible for us to have more money and work more with the actors and have more on the screen.” He continued: “Yesterday, I felt this embrace from a community outside of Norway. So for me, I've learned from this.” We were chatting at London's Soho Hotel following an awards Q&A session attended by Trier and Stellan Skarsgård, moderated by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, who described himself as the “fan of fans” of Trier's sublime film. With aplomb, Cranston cited scenes from the movie and it was clear that he was indeed the “fan of fans” in a big way, and how struck he was by the film's story about Gustav Borg, a once storied Norwegian filmmaker played by Skarsgård, a proud Swede, who attempts to re engage with his two adult daughters; Nora an actor, payed by Reinsve; and Agnes, an academic historian played by Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, following the death of their mother, from whom he was divorced. Addressing the audience, Cranston likened Sentimental Value to “one of those Russian dolls that you open it up, and there's another thing inside another. Cranston was referring to his late father, actor Joe Cranston and to daughter Taylor Dearden, who plays Dr. Melissa King on The Pitt. Cranston was eager to know how Trier and Vogt had come up with the storyline. Trier told Cranston that he'd had an idea about two grown-up sisters negotiating narratives. Trier's fond of quoting Joan Didion's famous observation that  “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” He explained: ”I think there's something fundamental about having a story to try to understand yourself. The sense of identity is a story. Who am I because of this and that? And so I feel responsible…I've been a child in a film family and I know how much it takes out of your parents to make movies. And I'm asking that question, why did I have children quite late in life and my anxiety of kind of being Gustav Borg? [“He's a lovable asshole,” Cranston chimed]…And how do I make that work? Then I knew I had one man in the world,” he said pointing to Skarsgård seated on his left. The'd never met or spoken before, although Trier had seen the actor at a party but was too shy to approach him. Skarsgård said that he'd been waiting a long time for Trier to call him. ”It took some time,” Skarsgård said, mocking at being affronted. But eventually we sort of … We have two versions of this, but my version is that we were sort of like dogs sniffing each other,“ he said as his nose drifted upwards. Trier did a double-take and exclaimed, “That's Stellan's version!” Skarsgård revealed that he didn't have to read Trier's script in the same way that he would never read a screenplay by Lars von Trier or Martin Scorsese, his reason being that “good directors, they're really rare…even if the role isn't that good, I mean, you get a good experience from it.” Cranston asked Skarsgård if he'd needed to research the role or was it just like slipping on “a pair of comfortable shoes?” ”I knew things about the [movie] business and stuff, but he could be a painter, he could be a musician. Cranston's currently starring in a critically acclaimed revival of Arthur Miller's drama All My Sons at Wyndham's Theatre with an ensemble that features Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Glynn-Carney, and Hayley Squires, all on top form. On the topic of live theater, Cranston had “a bone to pick” with Trier about Gustav Borg's disdain for the stage. He wanted to know if that was Trier's “own personal feeling?” Trier admitted that “I'm a film guy 100%,” but said that he attended theater shows regularly with his wife, who is an architect who sometimes works as a stage production designer. “So I know that world quite well and adore it. I wouldn't know how to direct anything without a camera being present. But I'm also the person that weeps at the end even of a bad play because I love actors getting on stage,” Trier told Cranston in mitigation. Back on stage at the Soho Hotel, Cranston asked whether Skarsgård's own personal life, as the father of eight children, had shaped his performance as Gustav Borg in any way? Skarsgård said it had no bearing on how he played Borg. “So I've been changing diapers and wiping asses,” he said. Cranston asked Skarsgard for his thoughts about awards season and what it has meant for Sentimental Value and himself. I mean, on one hand you appreciate the love of your peers and of the audiences and everything, and especially when you're with a film like this, because it gets very warm response and it gets interesting discussions. But on one side, as an actor, you're a whore. The three men on stage then engaged in a conversation about the film's “beautifully delicate ending,” as Cranston put it, that offers a sense of reconciliation. And the same could be said for Sentimental Value. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attending the event in Saudi Arabia, Brown, 21, showed off a brand new chin-grazing bob haircut. The “Stranger Things” actress went all-out for the red carpet, too, shimmering in a Tamara Ralph Couture fall 2025 gown covered in sequins and floral appliqués. She added even more sparkle with enormous Chopard diamond drop earrings. Over the course of a decade, Brown has tried out many different looks, including shaving her head for the first season as her supernatural character, Eleven. After trying out a platinum blond bombshell color, she went back to brunette in March 2025. Accepting the Joy award for personality of the year, she slipped into a second gown from the same designer's spring 2024 couture collection, this one featuring voluminous feather-covered sleeves, a sequined corset waist and a thigh-high slit. “Pursuing creativity and becoming an actor at eight years old wasn't a dream I chased on my own. It was encouraged and supported by my parents who never doubted me for a second.” She concluded with a special shoutout to her loved ones, including her daughter, whom she and husband Jake Bongiovi welcomed via adoption last summer. “I wouldn't be able to do any of this without them.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's far behind the first 28 Years, which posted a three-day opening of $30 million in June, as well as behind the $20 million projection for Bone Temple headed into this weekend. 'Bone Temple' Director Nia DaCosta Is Building a Formidable Resume on Her Childhood Obsessions James Cameron's Avatar wasn't the only Disney release making headlines. Thanksgiving  juggernaut Zootopia 2 became the top-animated film of all time globally of the MLK weekend after passing up Disney and Pixar's Inside Out 2. It is also the ninth-highest film among  all times with global receipts north of $1.313 billion. Avatar 3, now in its fifth weekend, easily stayed iin first place as it races toward the $400 million mark domestically. So far, the film has collected an estimated $358 million domestically and north of $1.23 billion globally. The 28 Years Later franchise hails from director Boyle and writer Alex Garland, who brought the film series to Sony after a heated bidding war. Filmmaker Nia DaCosta is in the director's chair for Bone Temple, the second part in a planned trilogy, with Sony saying last month that it will make a third installment with Cillian Murphy — star of the original 28 Days Later — with Boyle returning to direct. It is not known how this opening weekend could change that calculus. Sony insiders remain hopeful that word of mouth could give Bone Temple legs. Bone Temple stars Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams, Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry. Filmmaker Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme landed in fifth place after winning several top Golden Globe wins last weekend. From A24, the specialty pic has been an overperformer since its Christmas release, and observers were correct in predicting it  would get a bump following Timothée Chalamet's best actor win at the Globes. Focus Features' Chloé Zhao's Hamnet, produced by Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes, expanded after it took home best drama at the Golden Globes Jan. 11, with Oscar contender Jesse Buckley winning the actress prize. The film, which opened in limited release over Thanksgiving, upped its count to 718 theaters this weekend and is expected to bring in $1.6 million or more for the four-day frame, bringing its domestic total to $15 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(Tuesday actuals will determine the final numbers for all films.) That's well behind the opening of the last film, 28 Years Later, which posted a three-day debut of $30 million in June 2025, on its way to topping out at $151 million globally. It also came in behind tracking, which showed Bone Temple launching to $20 million domestically. 'Bone Temple' Director Nia DaCosta Is Building a Formidable Resume on Her Childhood Obsessions The 28 Years Later franchise hails from director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, who brought the film series to Sony after a heated bidding war. Filmmaker Nia DaCosta is in the director's chair for Bone Temple, the second part in a planned trilogy, with Sony saying last month that it will make a third installment with Cillian Murphy — star of the original 28 Days Later — with Boyle returning to direct. It is not known how this opening weekend could change that calculus. In 2002, 28 Days Later opened to just $10 million before transforming into a water-cooler sensation and pushing the boundaries of the zombie genre. Sony insiders remain hopeful that word of mouth could give Bone Temple legs. Bone Temple stars Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams, Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry. So far, the film has collected an estimated $358 million domestically and north of $1.2 billion globally. James Cameron's threequel wasn't the only Disney release making headlines. Thanksgiving juggernaut Zootopia 2 became the top-animated film of all time globally over the MLK weekend after passing up Disney/Pixar's Inside Out 2, not adjusted for inflation. Filmmaker Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme landed in fifth place. From A24, the specialty pic has been an overperformer since its Christmas release, and observers were correct in predicting it would get a bump following star Timothée Chalamet's best actor win at the Golden Globes last weekend. With a domestic tally of $80 million through Sunday, it has now passed up Oscar best-picture winner Everything Everywhere All at Once to rank as A24's top-performing title of all time. Elsewhere at the specialty and awards box office, Chloé Zhao's Hamnet — another awards frontrunner — expanded after it took home best drama at the Golden Globes Jan. 11, with Oscar hopeful Jesse Buckley winning the actress prize. The film, which started off playing in select runs in November, added more runs over Christmas and again this weekend. Focus plans further expansion after Oscar nominations are announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1964, Brando sent King a telegram regarding this support, which has since become an important piece of Americana. In the telegram, Brando expressed his regret at not being able to join King in what he called “activities of liberation” due to recent health issues. However, he made his feelings on King's cause very clear. “I feel that those who take active part in demonstrations for equality and freedom are the heroes of our time,” the actor wrote. “I regard it as an honorable duty to participate.” Despite not being able to stand beside King and other leaders in this instance, Brando was a major supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. He also famously participated in the pivotal March on Washington that same year. “King got shot, and I sat in front of the television set, and I wondered what it meant to me [that] he's dead,” Brando began. He eloquently recalled King's last words from the night before his death. ” I thought somehow this has got to matter somewhere,” Brando said. “And if we don't — all the citizens — do something that is a person-to-person contribution, I don't think that we're really gonna have any place to come home to if we do get a job.” “I couldn't think of any other alternative rather than to make my time, my energies, and my money fully available to do what I can as an individual.” As I Love Ancestry reported, Brando donated thousands of dollars and even decided to forgo a movie role so he could devote more time to participating in the movement. Although King died long before he could personally see his vision for peace and equality realized, his tragic passing lit a new fire. Sixty years later, Martin's legacy lives on through what the movement accomplished. The beloved leader is also remembered for his public speaking talents, including the last words he ever said to his followers. “Like anybody, I would like to live a long life,” King said in what would be his final speech. But I'm not concerned about that now.” He went on to say that God had allowed him to climb the proverbial mountain. But I want you to know tonight, that we as a people, will get to the promised land.” That journey is still ongoing, thanks to King and other Civil Rights Movement leaders being brave enough to take the first steps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story was originally presented as part of Rolling Stone‘s “500 Greatest Albums” podcast series. Dolly Parton has a number of songs that could be considered her signature: the warning “Jolene,” the tireless “9 to 5,” and the royal ballad “I Will Always Love You.” But none come close to “Coat of Many Colors,” her 1971 autobiographical tale about growing up in Appalachian poverty and the hand-sewn clothes that Parton and her siblings would wear to school. By the time Parton walked into RCA Studio B in 1971 to record Coat of Many Colors, she had already been living in Music City for seven years. Wagoner even helped Parton pick which songs to record and was a looming presence in the studio. Parton ended her musical partnership with Wagoner in 1974, writing him a heartfelt goodbye with “I Will Always Love You.” But when Parton recorded Coat of Many Colors in 1971, she was already starting to break away. To fully come into her own as a solo artist and songwriter, Parton knew she had to write the bulk of the album, and it all started with the title track, a clear-cut origin story about her childhood in East Tennessee. Parton grew up poor in Sevierville, Tennessee, near the Great Smoky Mountains. The memory of her one-bedroom cabin was still fresh in Parton's mind when she moved to Nashville in 1964 after graduating high school. “Mama used to sew all of our quilts and curtains for the windows, remake our clothes, and make clothes out of feed sacks or scraps.” Mama said, ‘I don't want to ever hear you say that we're poor. Memphis Kee Sees 'Dark Skies' Ahead on Brooding New Album See Dolly Parton's Star-Studded New ‘Light of a Clear Blue Morning' Video Chase Rice on Why He Decided to Quit Touring: ‘Everything Felt Wrong' Grammy-winning songwriter Brandy Clark says “Coat of Many Colors” succeeds because it's so universal. Parton first wrote the lyrics to “Coat of Many Colors” on a tour bus with Wagoner. I finished the song pretty much on that,” she recalls. Rolling Stone writer Chet Flippo described it as “the first true flowering of Dolly Parton's faltering steps to emerge as a free musical soul and a major songwriter.” Along with the title track, she wrote “Traveling Man,” about a young woman who makes plans to run off with a salesman, only to have her mother steal him first. Clark recognizes clues in the song, as well as in another Coat track, “She Never Met a Man She Didn't Like.” “She was working her way to ‘Jolene,'” Clark says of the songs. “Those kind of songs are like a tribute to my Tennessee mountain home,” Parton says. “I wanted to get that old world sound with it.” Dolly has figured out a way to make her music feel like that part of the country.” Sonically, there's one outlier on the mostly acoustic album: “Here I Am” is more funk-rock than country music. It's also the most aggressive example of Parton owning her art. “I wanted to do something a little more bluesy or little more rock, and I remember kind of having to fight a little bit: ‘That's not really country enough,'” she recalls of the recording session. Country singer Carly Pearce, who considers herself a Dolly Parton superfan, says that Parton's most open secret is in the simplicity of her lyrics. “She just has a way of writing that is really to the point,” Pearce says. “I'm reminded when I try to overcomplicate things, that these songs really have stood the test of time, and they were quite simple.” BTS Reveal ‘Deeply Reflective' Title for Their Comeback Album Bruce Springsteen Blasts Trump at Surprise Benefit Gig: 'ICE Should Get the F-ck Out of Minneapolis' See John Mayer Perform Emotional 'Ripple' at Bob Weir's Public Memorial ENHYPEN Share the Secrets of Their Seven Remix Albums Coat of Many Colors peaked at Number Seven on Billboard‘s Country Albums chart. It also scored Parton her first Album of the Year CMA Award nomination. And that little coat, people relate to it for many different reasons.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Buckley just celebrated his rom-com ratings slamdunk in the most Robert Buckley way possible — by cracking up his fans and colleagues. On the screen behind him was a still shot of himself in the 2025 Hallmark movie “An Unexpected Valentine,” which was just added to Netflix. “Unexpected Valentine is the #3 movie on Netflix today,” Buckley captioned his pic. Buckley's post was flooded with comments from fans, famous friends, and even his wife — actress Jenny Wade, who amusingly wrote of his tank top, “I didn't say to stop wearing it, I said to take it off. Hallmark screenwriter Russell Hainline — one of the writers behind Buckley's “Merry Christmas Ted Cooper,” also weighed in on the skin-tight top. Buckley's “Christmas House” co-star Jonathan Bennett called him a “legend” and their mom in the movies, Sharon Lawrence, cutely commented, “As your TV Mom, I feel a bit responsible and I don't know how to process this…” Hallmark's Andrew Walker chimed in with, “Unleashed star power,” and tons of fans commented too, including one who wrote of the movie's Netflix popularity, “I'm just waiting for what happens when it hits #1.” When “An Unexpected Valentine” premiered in early February 2025, Buckley said on the “Deck the Halls” podcast that it was an easy yes for him when he learned Chabert was involved. Hallmark's synopsis of the movie says, “A chance encounter on Valentine's Day brings Hannah and Finn together as they race through New York City to return a lost engagement ring and save one couple's special day.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mara Wilson, the star of Danny DeVito's 1996 movie Matilda, has revealed how she worried about the cast of Stranger Things getting caught in the “deepfake apocalypse” after she herself was a victim of child sexual abuse material. She said her own experience of being “used for child sexual abuse material” led to anxiety about other actors, including the stars of Disney films and Stranger Things. 'SNL' Satirizes 'Stranger Things' As Finn Wolfhard Jokes He's Ready For "Adult Films" & Co-Stars Make Surprise Appearance X Service Returns For Most Users After Widespread Outage “Before I was even in high school, my image had been used for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). I'd been featured on fetish websites and Photoshopped into pornography,” Wilson wrote. I wasn't a beautiful girl – my awkward age lasted from about age 10 to about 25 – and I acted almost exclusively in family-friendly movies. And nothing made me more accessible than the internet.” Wilson's fears became a reality when X/Twitter users asked AI tool Grok to remove the clothing from images of 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher, who played Holly Wheeler in Stranger Things. Elon Musk‘s company later said it would stop the Grok account from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” It is now infinitely easier for any child whose face has been posted on the internet to be sexually exploited. Millions of children could be forced to live my same nightmare.” The Miracle on 34th Street star added: “Boycotts aren't enough. We need to be demanding legislation and technological safeguards. We also need to examine our own actions: nobody wants to think that if they share photos of their child, those images could end up in CSAM. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another birthday is the centerpiece at Sir Henry Muck's (Kit Harington) ancestral home. But instead of a celebratory dinner announcing an engagement, relative newlyweds Henry and Yasmin (Marisa Abela) are already coming apart at the seams. It doesn't help that Yas isn't even allowed to open the drapes in her husband's bedroom as he staves off another hangover. Everyone in this stately home lacks purpose, so what better time to throw a decadent, Versailles-themed costume party for Henry's fortieth? Similar to how the premiere jumped in as Harper's (Myha'la) fund fell apart, Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay waste no time building to the Mucks breaking point. There is zero drag in the storytelling, and this breakneck pacing is part of what makes Industry a deliriously compelling option amid wheel-spinning streaming slogs. In this week's episode, we learn that Henry didn't share how the events actually unfolded on the morning of his father's 40th birthday. There's nothing quite like the British stiff upper lip and its unique ability to brush the worst moment under an heirloom carpet. It would be easy to cast Yas in the Lady Macbeth role, whispering in her husband's ear to benefit her own ambitions. While this archetype isn't entirely off the mark, her scheme to get Henry a position within Whitney Halberstram's (Max Minghella) “bank killer” Tender is as much about dragging Henry out of his debilitating funk as it is getting Yas back into the game. First, there's the saddest handjob perhaps ever committed to television, where we hear rhythmic splashing before Henry cuts it short. He has already stood to attention in his proverbial birthday suit for his wife when she asked him to stand in the bath. Yasmin just wants them to look at each other again properly, but Henry struggles to meet her eye and maintain an erection. She's trying to give him a confidence boost before his pre-party meeting with Whitney. However, this only makes Henry feel like more of a “fraud touched by success.” Whitney is eager to find a partner who can open doors that money can't buy. “Longevity in Britain is about access,” he tells Henry. What Whitney needs is connections that come from centuries of titles. Given that Yasmin told Whitney he could put his silver tongue to work on Labour MP Jennifer Bevan (Amy James-Kelly) in the last episode, he turns his attention to Henry, with Yasmin providing that particular entry point. A subtle callback to “happier” times for the couple comes in the shade of blue sash worn by Henry that matches his bow tie when he announced his engagement to Yas at his uncle's birthday dinner. Of course, that color links to King Louis XVI, but this visual tether to the past doesn't read like a coincidence. Costume designer Laura K. Smith decks Yas out in a chartreuse and peach Marie Antoinette-inspired frock with an elevated, contemporary twist: stacked Vivienne Westwood platforms that cause Yas to tower over Henry. The appearance of Yasmin's aunt, Cordelia (Claire Forlani), also underscores Yasmin's urgency to shed her current role as a spectator and caregiver. The pointed juxtaposition of Cordelia telling Yas to get off her knees and Yas later witnessing Cordelia on her knees giving Otto a blowjob is a reminder that Yasmin's family tree is equally thorny. Daddy issues course through Yas and Henry's veins. But Henry has to battle his demons alone rather than turn to his wife, who knows a thing or two about this topic. Henry leans hard into his “poor little rich boy” mythologizing when it comes to a head. Yas cuts to the core of the romanticizing with precision and cruelty, suggesting it would be procedural, boring, and small if he died by suicide. She knows that Henry lied about the circumstances of his father's death, and later, we learn why Henry's construction involves his dad walking out onto the moor alone. Henry is no match for Yasmin, who has been in numerous screaming bouts before, whether with her father or Harper (who is on the receiving end of Yasmin's spiky mood in this episode). Earlier, Henry told Yas she could sleep with other people, which she now reads as a clumsy, calculated move due to an adultery clause. He cowers in the corner of the room, looking even smaller than he did earlier when Yas threatens to hit him. This piece of music also accompanies Henry's solo walk home across the fields as he prepares to take his own life. Cutting from Henry in the same position at the harpsichord in his robe to dressed for his meeting with Whitney, as if someone clicked their fingers, is as destabilizing for us as it is for Henry. It is something that comes up later when Henry's memories overlap with the present, as he watches his father's suicide, standing alongside his childhood self. Like Jack Torrance in The Shining, Henry is haunted by ghosts. While I didn't catch it on first viewing, watching any of the scenes back when Henry is interacting with the Commander (Jack Farthing) makes it clear that no one else can see this hallucinated version of Henry's father. But Henry is so wasted that no one questions his chatting to thin air. His Scottish accent adds an extra emotional punch to what looks like a self-fulfilling prophecy: “The first person the coward deserts is himself. We choose to be ruined rather than change.” But Henry doesn't die by suicide, and those words are to offer comfort in the dark. He will take Whitney's job offer, and everything is looking up for the Mucks. Only then does she subtly lick it clean.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sharna Burgess is opening up about her fraught relationship with food. Burgess, 40, added that she “had a super complicated relationship with food” as a teen and into her 20s, but that habits “changed” once she hit her 30s. “I remember being 15 and put on the scale every two days by my teachers and we were told whether we needed to lose weight or not. Burgess said that dance “instilled a negative body image,” which carried on to the way she ate. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “It also started a negative pattern of eating whereby I'd binge one day, and then starve the next. I struggled with that throughout the years,” she explained. “Even in my 20s, I'd look in the mirror and see the 15-year-old that was told every week she needed to lose more weight.” However, things began to change when she joined the cast of “DWTS” in 2011. “It was seeing just how much the celebrities on the show transformed and ended up loving their bodies through being able to move and dance that really shook my perspective,” she explained. “I started to see something else in the mirror, I started to see a body that had gotten me through some incredibly difficult times, that had created some beautiful moments, that had won championships, that had landed me a life I never ever thought possible.” She left the following year after welcoming their son, Zane. “I was supposed to do something with them last season, but I was already working on a play in NYC and couldn't commit.</p>
