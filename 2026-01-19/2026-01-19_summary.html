Proceeds from the oil sale are being stashed in Qatar, an arrangement critics say opens the door to more corruption.

The first US sale of Venezuelan oil since the Trump administration illegally attacked the South American country earlier this month went to the company of a trader who donated millions to President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.

The roughly $250 million sale of Venezuelan crude went to Vitol, a Geneva-based energy and commodity trading firm whose US arm is headquartered in Houston. The Financial Times reported late last week that John Addison, a senior trader at Vitol, was involved in his company's efforts to secure the deal.

Addison, who attended a recent White House meeting with other top oil executives, donated $6 million total to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign via several super PACs, including $5 million to MAGA Inc.

“Addison pledged to Trump at the [White House] event that Vitol would attain the best price possible for Venezuelan oil for the US, ‘so that the influence you have over the Venezuelans will ensure that you get what you want,'” according to the Financial Times.

US Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), noted on social media that Vitol has a “criminal history of bribing foreign governments” and called the Venezuelan oil deal “fundamentally corrupt.”

“Trump took Venezuela's oil at gunpoint, and gave it to one of his biggest campaign donors,” Murphy wrote. “Vitol had to buy access to Trump because under normal circumstances, they wouldn't be able to get a deal like this.”

Vitol is one of a number of corporations positioned to reap windfall profits from the Trump administration's assault on Venezuela, abduction of its president, and efforts to seize and indefinitely control the country's vast oil reserves.

As the Washington Post reported over the weekend:

Hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer's firm Elliott Investment Management has for years been in the process of acquiring distressed Venezuelan-owned assets in the US and is on the cusp of owning them. After clearing final regulatory and legal approval, the firm can use them to make a considerable profit turning newly available Venezuelan oil into gasoline. The company that would be acquired by an Elliott affiliate is Citgo, the Houston-based refining firm owned by Venezuela's state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Citgo owns refineries in Illinois, Louisiana and Texas that are well-positioned to profit off the millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil that Trump says will be steered to US refineries because it is a particularly heavy blend of crude that is difficult to process. Only certain refineries, like those run by Citgo, are equipped to handle it.

Proceeds from the US sale of Venezuelan oil are being stashed in Qatar — an arrangement that critics said opens the door to additional corruption.

“After illegally and unconstitutionally striking Venezuela, Trump is now selling Venezuelan oil through a campaign donor, and funneling the proceeds to an offshore account in Qatar — creating a potential slush fund with no accountability, oversight, or guardrails for Trump and his allies,” US Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote late Sunday. “His continued abuse of power doesn't serve the Venezuelan people or the American people — and it certainly doesn't lower costs for Americans.”

“This outrage,” Booker added, “is yet another example of his unchecked corruption as he again ignores laws and enriches his friends, donors, and himself.”

“The EU cannot simply move on to business as usual,” said one member of European Parliament.

The European Union appears to be done trying to appease US President Donald Trump over his demands to be given control of Greenland.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that the EU is considering deploying what has been described as an economic “bazooka” at the US after Trump threatened European countries with new tariffs because of their refusal to cede Greenland, which has been part of the Danish kingdom for hundreds of years.

Specifically, the EU has an “anti-coercion instrument” that the Times writes “could be used to slap limitations on big American technology companies or other service providers that do large amounts of business on the continent.”

Enacting this policy would dramatically escalate tensions between the US and its European allies, but some international relations experts think the EU might have little choice given Trump's fixation on seizing the self-governing Danish territory.

“This is just all brute force,” Penny Naas, an expert on European public policy at the German Marshall Fund, told the Times. “The president really wants Greenland, and he's not backing off of it.”

Bernd Lange, a German member of European Parliament, said in a social media post that European leaders could no longer try to appease Trump with concessions given his overt aggression and urged the EU to respond with maximum retaliation.

“New US tariffs for several nations are unbelievable,” he wrote. “This is no way to treat partners. A new line has been crossed. Unacceptable. POTUS is using trade as an instrument of political coercion. The EU cannot simply move on to business as usual.”

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil also signaled on Monday that European nations are at the end of their rope when it comes to Trump's relentless threats against them, reported Bloomberg.

“We are constantly experiencing new provocations, we are constantly experiencing new antagonism, which President Trump is seeking, and here we Europeans must make it clear that the limit has been reached,” said Klingbeil. “There is a legally established European toolbox that can respond to economic blackmail with very sensitive measures, and we should now examine the use of these measures.”

European officials said in a report published by Politico on Monday that they were considering fully breaking with the US over Trump's demands of territorial concessions, as they no longer feel that the US can be a trusted international partner.

“There is a shift in US policy and in many ways it is permanent,” said a senior European government official. “Waiting it out is not a solution. What needs to be done is an orderly and coordinated movement to a new reality.”

Europeans aren't the only ones criticizing Trump's latest actions, as Melinda St. Louis, director of Global Trade Watch at US-based government watchdog Public Citizen, said the president's latest tariffs over Greenland show that he has never cared about protecting American jobs, but only about exerting power.

“Misusing tariff authority over his wildly unpopular and head-scratching imperial claim of right to Greenland shows just how little he cares for the everyday struggles of Americans and undermines the legitimate uses of tariffs,” said St. Louis.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

US justice department announced it is investigating protesters in Minnesota who disrupted church services

Kristi Noem first denied that federal agents were using chemical agents against protesters, then after being shown video footage turned to blaming the protesters themselves, as tensions continued to run high amid the Trump administration's surge of federal officers into Minneapolis.

The head of homeland security, who has acted as spearhead for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in the city – known as “Operation Metro Surge” – told the CBS show Face the Nation on Sunday that her department had not used pepper spray against crowds.

A federal judge on Friday had ordered that federal law enforcement stop using pepper spraying against peaceful protesters, whom Noem has accused of attempting to hinder the immigration crackdown. Kate Menendez found federal agents had used “chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected first amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations”.

Noem first denied the judge's finding, but after being shown a video of chemical agents being used on four occasions, she backtracked and said her department “only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe”.

Tensions continue to run high in Minneapolis, with the Pentagon ordering around 1,500 active-duty soldiers stationed in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment, which Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has described as a “ridiculous” overreaction to largely peaceful protests against the violent behaviour of ICE agents.

On Sunday the Department of Justice also declared it is investigating a group of protesters who disrupted services at a church where a local ICE official is reportedly a pastor. Footage livestreamed by Black Lives Matter Minnesota showed people interrupting services at the Cities church in St Paul by chanting “ICE out” and “justice for Renee Good”, referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE agent.

The assistant attorney general, Harmeet Dhillon, announced on social media an investigation into purported civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers”, adding: “A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!”

Nekima Levy Armstrong of the Racial Justice Network was dismissive of the threat of an investigation. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts,” she told the Associated Press.

It is not clear whether David Easterwood, the pastor who also reportedly heads the local ICE field office, was present at the church. He has defended ICE tactics in Minnesota such as swapping out license plates and using pepper spray on protesters.

Those tactics have inflamed an atmosphere that the Minneapolis parks and recreation department cited as the reason for canceling youth sports on Friday and Sunday “out of an abundance of caution”. Meanwhile, the newly installed Laotian American mayor of St Paul, Kaohly Her, said she had “received advice to carry my passport with me because they may try to target me based on what I look like as well”.

Some protesters arrested during ICE operations in Minneapolis have been denied their right to see an attorney, according to ABC News, citing four attorneys who said there were denied access to clients at the federal building in Minneapolis, the site of now daily protests.

“ICE agents were physically restricting me from seeing them,” one immigration attorney who asked not to be identified told ABC. “I stood outside the attorney visitation room for about four hours on Thursday, trying to see one of my clients who had been there for multiple days. I kept saying, you got to let me see my client. And they just kept repeating, we don't do attorney visitation.”

A DHS spokesperson denied the claims, saying all detainees “have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers” and said “all detainees receive full due process”.

New Jersey musician said during concert in home state that US core values ‘have never been as endangered' as now

Bruce Springsteen used a Saturday concert to decry what he called the “Gestapo tactics” of the Trump administration's surge of immigration officers and said the country's founding values “have never been as endangered as they are right now”.

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it's worth speaking out, and it's worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump's actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump's authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society. They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.”

Donald Trump has responded to Springsteen's remarks by calling the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member “highly overrated”, “not a talented guy” and a “pushy, obnoxious jerk”.

Housing First policies are being replaced with punitive reforms that could push 170,000 people back into homelessness.

Last fall, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) nearly triggered a homelessness disaster of its own making. A rush of policy changes that were rolled out with almost no warning and even less guidance threatened to push up to 170,000 formerly unhoused Americans out of stable housing.

The strangest part? Much of this upheaval traces back to a little-known think tank that was born in Silicon Valley.

The Cicero Institute, created by tech investor Joe Lonsdale, has spent the past few years promoting aggressive policies targeting encampments for the unhoused and pushing cities to move away from Housing First, the U.S.'s primary model for responding to chronic homelessness. Over the summer, HUD quietly adopted several of Cicero's key recommendations. And the result was widespread panic among the local agencies responsible for keeping people housed.

Joe Lonsdale, best known as a founding partner of Palantir and a member of the original “PayPal Mafia,” created the Cicero Institute in 2016 to inject what he calls “entrepreneurial thinking” into government. The group operates on a roughly $10 million annual budget that is financed by undisclosed donors, and its board is dominated by Lonsdale's family members, other entrepreneurs, and political staffers. Its messaging leans heavily on the idea that homelessness persists not because of poverty or a shortage of affordable housing, but because service providers are enabling poor behavior.

On his social media accounts, Lonsdale warns of a “homeless industrial complex” supposedly enriching itself through failed policies. That claim is not grounded in evidence, nor does it match the reality I've seen after eight years interviewing and observing frontline service workers in the homeless sector. If anything, the people running U.S. homeless shelters and supportive housing programs are overworked, underpaid, and overwhelmed by needs that far exceed their funding.

Yet Cicero's arguments have found a national platform through the work of Devon Kurtz, the organization's “public safety policy director.” Kurtz has a background in classics and criminology, but there is no evidence of any experience working in U.S. homelessness systems, according to his LinkedIn profile. Despite this, he has become a frequent commentator, urging lawmakers to ban encampments, expand involuntary psychiatric commitment, move unhoused people into transitional housing programs with strict behavioral requirements, and dismantle key federal institutions that design homelessness policy.

The proposals are sweeping. The evidence behind them is thin.

Cicero's preferred target is Housing First, a model adopted by the George W. Bush administration and expanded under both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, during the latter's first term. Housing First prioritizes moving chronically unhoused people into permanent housing without requiring sobriety or treatment upfront. The model rests on numerous randomized controlled trials, which find that people stay housed at far higher rates and reduce consumption of some costly emergency services when basic stability comes first. By contrast, evidence for mental health, income, and employment impacts shows no advantage for the conditional services that Cicero advocates.

Kurtz argues that Housing First has “failed,” pointing to rising numbers of unsheltered people over the past decade. But this argument misuses the data in several ways.

For one, “permanent supportive housing” is the closest thing to Housing First that the federal government provides homeless service recipients. That program  wasn't designed to end all homelessness. It was specifically created for “chronically” homeless households who have been unhoused for at least 12 months and who have a documented disability. Rising unsheltered homelessness, by contrast, has been driven largely by soaring rent costs, the expiration of pandemic-era protections, and insufficient supply of emergency shelter, not Housing First.

There's also the question of outcomes. HUD tracks Housing First retention each year, and the results are consistent: Since 2015, roughly 90 to 95 percent of people in these programs remain housed. If chronic homelessness is rising, the problem is not that Housing First “doesn't work.” The problem instead is that there aren't enough preventative services to keep people housed during crises or sufficient rental subsidies for people who have been unhoused for less than 12 months.

Still, Cicero frequently cites outlier studies to suggest Housing First is dangerous, ineffective, or too expensive. These studies are often based on narrow samples, misapplied to the wrong populations, or interpreted in ways the original authors explicitly warn against. The broader research consensus is clear: Housing First works extremely well for the population it serves. What it cannot do is counteract years of rising rents, stagnating wages, catastrophic shortages of affordable housing, and the collapse of political will to end homelessness.

The Cicero Institute's advocacy department, “Cicero Action,” has employed “high-powered” lobbyists to push its agenda in states around the country. Cicero Action, for example, hired Alfred Parks, a former state representative, and a corporate lobbyist, Jason Weaks, in New Mexico to advance model bills that criminalize homelessness and redirect funding from permanent to transitional housing programs.

After passing its model legislation in red states like Florida, Missouri, and Utah, it appears the Cicero Institute has expanded its influence to the federal government. In July 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing HUD to shift federal homelessness funding away from permanent housing and toward transitional housing and encampment enforcement. And HUD has quickly moved to comply.

Federal contracts that were supposed to run through 2026 were abruptly cut short. A new funding notice, released in mid-November, gave local agencies just months to redesign their entire homelessness systems, which took over 10 years to build.

The notice leaned heavily on the same weak evidence that Cicero uses. HUD cited a non-representative survey from 15 states to justify claims that most unsheltered people have severe mental illness or addiction, despite the study's own authors warning against using their data to generalize about causes. HUD suggested Housing First had failed, even though the agency's own metrics belied that claim.

Local administrators were stunned. I conducted 12 interviews with local administrators across the country over the past three months. My contacts would only speak to me under the condition of anonymity due to fear of political retaliation from HUD. The administrators I spoke to described HUD's abrupt change as chaotic, reckless, illegal, dangerous, and impossible to carry out.

“You're talking about historical supporting of permanent supportive housing,” one administrator said, “and essentially giving us eight months to wind those down. That's not enough time.”

In addition to this unrealistic deadline, most administrators would have to make those reforms with less funding and, as a result, fewer staff to deliver the intensive case management that HUD is now demanding. “There are some many consequences to this on down the road that they're not looking that far ahead,” another administrator said. “They are not looking at, ‘If we cut this, how do other services pick that up,' because we don't have those services and they aren't giving us the money to create those services.”

The recently announced $2 billion cuts to community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment will exacerbate this crisis by shrinking, if not eliminating, the case management agencies that deliver the kind of support HUD expects homeless service users to receive. 

A lawsuit was quickly filed to thwart disaster. Ninety minutes before its court hearing, HUD abruptly withdrew the funding notice until problems could be worked out.

Even though HUD pulled back its proposal, the uncertainty it created has already strained homelessness systems that were stretched thin long before this episode. With another winter underway and the threat of policy whiplash still looming, governors cannot afford to wait and see what happens next.

Roughly a third of contracts were ending between January and June 2026. A large number of people would therefore lose their rental assistance in the dead of winter if HUD followed through with this disastrous policy. This will cause unsheltered homelessness to spike at a time when emergency shelters already cannot meet demand.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, states used eviction moratoriums, utility shutoff protections, and emergency rental assistance to keep millions of people housed. They may need to use these tools again if HUD continues to pursue abrupt policy shifts without adequate planning.

Thousands of people are depending on them to act before the next crisis hits.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

EU should issue ‘smart' response to US president's threat of tariffs against several countries, say business leaders

Could the EU hit back with its ‘big bazooka'?

Business live – latest updates

Europe live – latest updates

European industry has hit back at Donald Trump's “ludicrous demands” to hand over Greenland or face a trade war.

A fresh round of tariffs on European exports would cost Germany and Europe dearly, the president of the German auto industry association has said, as he called for a “smart” response coordinated by Brussels.

“The costs of these additional tariffs would be enormous for German and European industry, especially in these already challenging times,” said Hildegard Müller, the president of the VDA trade organisation.

“What is crucial now is a smart, strategic response from Brussels that is coordinated with the countries affected,” she added.

Trump's shock threat on Saturday to impose additional tariffs of 10% in February with a further 25% in June have derailed a period of relative transatlantic trade calm after the EU-US agreement struck at the US president's Scottish golf course last July.

European leaders are expected to meet in Brussels on Thursday for an emergency summit to discuss the prospect of imposing counter-tariffs on US exports on 7 February that would hit everything from liquid gas to aircraft and machinery.

The German engineering trade group, whose members include vital tool machine exporters, urged the EU to face Trump down. “If the EU gives in here, it will only encourage the US president to make the next ludicrous demand and threaten further tariffs,” said Bertram Kawlath, the president of the German engineering association VDMA.

The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) said it was wrong of Trump to link the economies to political ambitions. “Highly controversial political goals are being tied to economic sanctions in an unacceptable manner,” said Volker Treier, a member of the DIHK executive board.

On Monday the EU struck a diplomatic note, calling for calm on all sides as leaders tried to work among themselves and with the White House to avert the crisis over Greenland spiralling into a full-on trade war in two weeks' time.

Manufacturers have been scrambling to work out whether try to get more products into the US before the tariffs, as they were forced to do in April last year when Trump announced his “liberation day” levies. However, one senior figure in the UK automotive industry said the short deadline meant there was limited time to rush cars into the US before the levies.

An executive at a large carmaker that exports to the US said they were “reaching for the same golf bag and pulling out the same clubs again”, although they were still in “wait and see” mode given the lack of formal direction on how tariffs will be implemented – or whether they are a merely an opening negotiating tactic.

The carmaker is considering how it can “play for time” in the hope that talks between governments will avert the threat, the person said. “We did not see that one coming,” they added.

Stephen Davies, the chief executive of the Welsh whisky maker Penderyn, which exports to 20 states in the US, said the tariffs would add more costs than could be absorbed. “It's just not going to work,” he said.

He added: “People will disappear from the market and just hold fire until conditions get better. But you've been working for years building reputation and building product knowledge with consumers and you don't want to stop doing that.”

Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said Trump's tariffs “threaten to take a wrecking ball to key British manufacturing sectors and jobs”. “That's why [the British] government must continue to prioritise a closer trading relationship with the EU. It's common sense in an increasingly volatile and unpredictable global economy that we forge stronger ties with our closest neighbours and largest trading partner.”

A senior steel executive said the UK industry had reached an “equilibrium” on US trade, with customers accepting the previous 25% tariffs. The prospect of another 10% will force exporters to restart negotiations over who bears the costs – with either the US importer paying the tariff, or the exporter forced to cut prices.

It was too late to try to rush products over the Atlantic before 1 February, with lead times and shipping times measured in weeks, said another steel industry source. “There will be a lot of instability with the customers,” the person said.

Data shows 133% increase from 2017 to 2025 as anti-ICE and No Kings protests push mobilization against White House

In the year since Donald Trump retook office, the number of protests in the US outpaced those at the same point in his first administration, according to data from the Crowd Counting Consortium, an open-source project collaboration between Harvard University's Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut.

There were more than 10,700 protests in 2025, a 133% increase from the 4,588 recorded in 2017, the first year of Trump's first term. According to the data, an overwhelming majority of US counties – including 42% that voted for Trump – have had at least one protest since he was re-inaugurated last year.

“It is a very historic time, in the sense that people are mobilizing where they live in ways that I don't think I have seen before in my lifetime,” said Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard Kennedy School and co-director of the Crowd Counting Consortium.

From protests for trans youth healthcare at the beginning of in 2025, to protests against US support of Israel in Gaza and “Tesla takedowns” against Elon' Musk's efforts to dismantle the federal government in the spring, to anti-ICE protests as federal agents raided US cities over the summer and into the fall and winter, Americans took to the streets to show their resistance to the Trump administration's policies. That meant more protests in general, as well as highly attended, coordinated, single-day protests such as the No Kings and Hands Off protests, Chenoweth said.

Typically, they said, flash points of protest have been localized to big cities or a march on Washington. “We're not seeing that,” they said. “We're seeing very diffused protest mobilization all around the country.”

The diversity of locations, especially in red and rural corners such as Cut Bank, Montana, and Sparta, North Carolina, shows that the movements defy stereotypes around where protest happens. “It definitely cuts against the narrative that protest is confined to major cities, to the coasts, and to predominantly liberal areas where it doesn't change anybody's mind,” said Chenoweth.

During Trump's first term, there were a few major spikes in protest: the 2018 student walkouts following the Parkland high school shooting, the summer 2018 protests over immigrant family separations, and the 2020 uprisings over the killing of George Floyd – thought to be possibly the largest recorded protest movement in US history. Chenoweth said spikes last spring (pro-Palestine, anti-ICE and No Kings protests) and in October (No Kings) come close to those numbers.

That trend of broadly dispersed, nonviolent protesting has carried forward into 2026, as anti-ICE mobilizations continue in cities across the US. After Minneapolis protests broke out following the killing of Renee Good during an ICE interaction on 7 January, coalitions of groups rapidly planned and held a “weekend of action” with more than 1,000 participating protests.

“What's really notable now is how much grassroots, improvised and then organized response there is to ICE operations,” said Chenoweth. “The defining feature of [the Minneapolis ICE] protests is absolutely focused on that issue and sense of outrage, and just finding unbearable and intolerable, the way the administration is approaching this.”

Over a decade ago, Chenoweth's research, studying a data set of more than 300 nonviolent protest movements between 1900 and 2006, found that no government has ever overcome a nonviolent movement that involved at least 3.5% of its population. However, Chenoweth cautions that this is not a prescriptive rule.

When asked if the US is at a tipping point akin to that number, they replied, “I would think about it more as an inflection point,” noting that public opinion is shifting.

Most importantly, said Chenoweth, growing protest movements can give people hope and “a sense of agency” in a situation where they feel powerless: “That's a very important thing for people to feel and internalize when the more dominant narrative is otherwise.”

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. The most difficult situation with power supply disruptions is currently reported in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and the cities of Dnepropetrovsk, Krivoy Rog, Odessa, Kharkov, and Chernigov, Vladimir Zelensky said.

Following a meeting with his government members on the subject, Zelensky wrote on Telegram that power supply problems also plagued several settlements near the capital, as well as the regions of Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Sumy, Kharkov and Chernigov.

Reports of emergency power outages have been coming from Kiev and several Ukrainian regions since morning.

Currently, an emergency situation regime is in effect in the Ukrainian energy sector. There are hours-long blackouts every day in all regions. Supermarkets, cafes and restaurants suspend their work, and schools extend holidays or switch to distance learning.

Corporate chiefs and government leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress – even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind.

The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees – or at them.

Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geoeconomic conflict; tariffs that have rocked long-standing trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries.

“It's really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dusek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we're in a transition. Some people think we've already entered a new era. But I think it's undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.”

Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike.

Trump's peacemaking credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “Board of Peace” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center.

The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics.

Critics will also be nearby: He's blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, will be on hand.

The two likeliest counterweights to Trump's administration on the international scene – China and the European Union – get top billing on the first day of the event: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China's “economic czar” – as Dusek put it.

The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge.

This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with some celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon.

The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes.

The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand.

Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.”

“People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favour nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we' to ‘me'.”

The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbours, while nearly 70 per cent believed institutional leaders – such as from business or government – deliberately mislead the public.

Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report ahead of the Davos event which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16 per cent last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than US$18-trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world's richest people.

Oxfam said the US$2.5-trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world's population lives in poverty, the group said.

The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies.

The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying.

With such concerns filtering through to policy-makers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday.

As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure.

Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike have joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States – a USA House is making a debut this year – to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies.

Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week.

Critics have long accused the annual meeting in Davos of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem.

“It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.”

Fear, abuse and eroding rights have forced many trans people to leave the US – can they claim asylum in the Netherlands?

The transgender refugees fleeing the US – podcast

Ter Apel, a small, unassuming Dutch town near the German border, is a place tourists rarely have on their itinerary. There are no lovely old windmills, no cannabis-filled coffee shops and on a recent visit it was far too early for tulip season.

When foreigners end up there, it is for one reason: to claim asylum at the Netherlands' biggest refugee camp, home to 2,000 desperate people from all around the world.

Some, like the Eritreans and Somalis, are fleeing war; the Syrians insist it remains unsafe for them to return home after the fall of Assad. But in the last year they have been joined by a curious new cohort: a bunch of Americans, who say they have feared for their lives ever since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Their presence has surprised many of the camp's residents. “My dream is to go to America or the UK. America for me is the paradise,” said Usama, a 21-year-old Libyan-Algerian hanging around the main gate. “You can work, you can make a million if you have a good idea. Why they come here?”

It is a fair question. Last year, 76 Americans claimed asylum in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch asylum and immigration ministry, up from nine in 2024. Unlike the UK, the Netherlands does not rent out hotels or houses for asylum seekers, instead housing them in fenced-off camps, officially called reception centres, dotted around the country.

Many of the American refugees, like Jane-Michelle Arc, a 47-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, are transgender. In April last year she flew into Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and, sobbing, asked a customs officer how to claim asylum. “And they laughed because: what's this big dumb American doing here asking about asylum? And then they realised I was serious.”

Arc said the US had become such a hostile environment for trans people that she had stopped leaving the house “unless there was an Uber waiting outside”. She said she had been abused on the street and using the ladies' toilets, and resolved to leave the country after a frightening incident when she feared a woman was going to run her over with her truck.

The customs officer gave her a train ticket to Ter Apel and told to report to the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND). The first few days were hard, holed up in a 2 metre-square room covered with graffiti and what she feared were body fluids on the walls. In some ways she was lucky to be indoors: at least once in recent years the camp has been so overcrowded that new arrivals have had to sleep in tents outside.

Ter Apel is not a prison, but it looks a little bit like one, surrounded by fences, with guards on every gate. Residents are free to come and go but must be in their rooms each morning for a bed check. After their first few days in the central reception area, asylum seekers are dispersed to different low-rise blocks, where they are given a small food allowance so they can cook their own meals.

For Arc, that meant being transferred to what she calls “the queer block”, rather like a student halls of residence where all the LGBT asylum seekers are placed. There, she insists, sharing meals in the communal kitchens and over cigarettes outside, she found common ground.

They all feared the police as well as their governments and fellow citizens, she said. “We were in danger from the people around us. And in fact, all of us thought of America as a place we wanted to live in – a beautiful country of opportunities. And that's all still true, but it was surprising and sad and validating that the people there – a trans dude from Tehran and a trans woman from Libya – our stories were so similar.”

Arc knows how that might sound. “I hear a lot of people saying: ‘You are an idiot. You came here from America.' People will tell me: ‘Did you think about moving to California?' And then I say: ‘Well, I lived in San Francisco' and then they go: ‘Oh, that's a heaven for gay people.' But it's different for trans people, particularly for trans women, to the extent that my experience in San Francisco, robot taxis aside, was indistinguishable from [that of] the people that I knew from Libya and Iran and Morocco and Algeria.”

Trans men are also unsafe in the US, according to Ashe Wilde, another American who has been living in Ter Apel since the end of October. He transitioned in 2019 and anti-trans hate has only grown since then, he said, particularly with the return of Trump, who was re-elected using the attack ad: “Kamala Harris is for they/them. Trump is for you.”

In his very first speech on inauguration day, Trump declared: “As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the US government that there are only two genders – male and female.” He signed an executive order denouncing “ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex”, which effectively erased federal recognition of transgender identities.

“That was hugely shocking,” said Wilde, 40, “because Massachusetts is one of the most liberal states and one of states that's really trying to preserve our identities across the queer spectrum, and I was still met with pushback.” People increasingly equated transgenderism with paedophilia, he said: “I was called a paedo and a groomer.” There were physical altercations too, he claimed.

Arc began to transition at the end of 2012, changing her ID to female the following year and having bottom surgery in Thailand in 2014. Yet Trump's re-election meant no more anti-discrimination protections in their employment, housing, and healthcare. When her passport ran out, a new one would declare her a man again. So she left.

“This is the dumbest thing I've ever done,” she said in a Ter Apel cafe. “And I did it because I was afraid for my life. I didn't do this in secret. I talked to everybody I knew. I said: ‘I am planning to do this wildly stupid thing.' Everybody said: ‘I don't love this for you, but there is no other option.'”

She could have applied for a tech job in the Netherlands and then a work visa. But that would have taken too long, she said. Hence choosing the nuclear option of asylum, leaving everything behind to live in a grubby refugee camp. She estimates there are between 35 and 50 other trans asylum seekers from the US in the Netherlands, though the Dutch government does not keep statistics on transgender applicants.

The chances of Americans actually being granted asylum are very low, according to Marlou Schrover, a professor of economic and social history at Leiden University, who studies the Dutch immigration system.

The UN refugee convention has very strict conditions, said Shrover. Not only must a refugee prove that they faced persecution in their home country, but they must also show that they tried to get help from the local authorities but were denied protection. “And after that, you have to see if there is a safe flight alternative within your country.”

Even getting beaten up by the police is not enough: “Of course Afro-Americans might say: ‘Look, I'm beaten up in the street by police officers, so I can claim refugee status in the Netherlands' based on this. So the claim has to be really strong.”

For a claim to be successful, the US would have to start detaining trans people for their gender identity, suggested Shrover: “If the US moves towards putting people in prison, treating them really, really bad because of their [gender identity], and with no other claim added to the reasons why they're in prison, then the situation would definitely change.” But simply denying someone the right to put their chosen gender on their passport is nowhere near enough, she added.

The Dutch authorities are also very wary about declaring the US an unsafe country and provoking Trump, said Shrover. They think: ‘How will it look? How will the Americans respond to that? We can't do this to our most important ally, saying that they don't have a functioning democracy.'”

Only in exceptional cases have US passport holders been granted asylum, according to the Dutch ministry of asylum and migration. In recent years “a few dozen” children with US passports have been granted asylum in the Netherlands, mostly dependents of Yemeni, Turkish, and Syrian parents, a government spokesperson said.

So far, no American has been successful since arriving during Trump's second term. Among those refused and earmarked for deportation is Lisa Gayle Carter-Stewart, who fled Montana with her transgender teenager, 14-year-old Nox, last April.

“It was automatically rejected because America is considered a safe country of origin,” said Carter-Stewart. “Nox even told the IND during their interview when they asked, what will you do if you have to return to America? Nox told them: ‘I will kill myself.' None of that was considered in their decision-making process.”

Nox has tried to take their own life three times at Ter Apel, said Carter-Stewart. “They are not getting on well. Nox stays in our room 24-7. They don't go outside, not even on sunny days.” Still, she insists, Nox doesn't want to go home: “Nox has said they're glad we're not in the US any more.”

Earlier this month, they were moved to a more family-friendly refugee camp near Leiden as they await their appeal hearing. “I would love if we did get a residence permit, and I could work again, and we could get back to living a normal life, and want them to feel like it's OK for them to be themselves and to not feel judged every time they walk through a door,” she said.

Trans women fear a terrible fate if they are sent back to the US, said Arc. “My guess is that re-entering the US, we would be detained by ICE, or customs, we would be put into detention with men, and then that would lead to us being harmed or killed. And the method of execution is incarceration. I don't think that the US government wants to murder me specifically. I think that they don't care if I am murdered, and I think they think that I deserve it if I'm murdered in custody.”

For Wilde, a forced return means a forced detransition. Access to hormones has already become fraught in the US, he said: “Come 2027, there won't be access to it via government healthcare, so you'd only have it through private providers. So without the hormones, you're basically forced to de-transition. I can't go back to that … I've been free for the last five years, almost six years. I can't imagine trying to stuff myself back into that person that I used to be … I don't know about physically, but emotionally, mentally, spiritually, I would absolutely be dead.”

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin marked Orthodox Epiphany with a traditional icy dip, his press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.

"Vladimir Putin took an icy plunge, as he does every year," he told reporters. "Naturally, Epiphany is a great holiday for him, as for all Orthodox believers who work in the Kremlin."

"This is a tradition and many honor it," Peskov noted. "However, some don't do this. This is a personal matter."

Immersing in ice-cold water on Epiphany is not bravado for 73-year-old Putin. This is a tribute to cultural and, in a sense, Christian tradition. The president is known to be a religious man. In addition, he is in excellent physical shape and can afford practicing customs that are extreme for most ordinary people without risk to his health.

The Kremlin first reported that the president had taken part in Epiphany bathing in 2018. Back then, Putin was on a trip to St. Petersburg. He plunged into an ice hole at Lake Seliger while visiting the Nilov Monastery in the Tver Region. Peskov explained then that it was not the first experience of Epiphany bathing for the president. Putin, in his words, took part in Epiphany events "in a more private environment."

Since then, the president's plans for January 19 have been the focus of public interest fueled by videos released by the Kremlin press service in 2021, featuring the Russian president, wearing a sheepskin coat and felt boots, approaching a cross-shaped ice hole, crossing himself, and immersing himself in ice-cold water.

According to official reports, since then, Putin took part in Epiphany bathing in the Moscow Region, skipping only 2020 and 2022. In 2020, he was barred from doing this by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2022 he was recommended by medics and the church to avoid the epidemiological situation.

The tradition of plunging into a cross-shaped ice hole on Epiphany symbolizes the Baptism of the Lord in the Jordan. While visiting Jordan in 2007, President Putin immersed his hands in the waters of the river and visited the place where John the Baptist met the Savior. During his next visit to Jordan in 2012, Putin took part in the opening ceremony of the Russian Guest House near the site of Jesus Christ's baptism.

Epiphany bathing organized in Russia overnight on January 19 is rather a popular tradition than a church rite. The Orthodox Church, however, generally approves of this tradition if it is treated with reverence and poses no health risks.

MINSK, January 19. /TASS/. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has asserted that, in the post-war era, only Russia and Belarus will have a vested interest in Ukraine's future. Speaking during a meeting with Kirov Region Governor Alexander Sokolov, Lukashenko emphasized that the resolution of the conflict is within reach.

"We will resolve the war," he stated confidently. "This opportunity is greater than ever, regardless of how much the Ukrainians resist now." He urged Ukrainians to recognize that the issue is not merely about territorial gains. "People will decide where they need to live. Territory itself does not determine anything. Ukraine should understand this – rather than destroying thousands of lives daily and forcing millions to flee, this must be the main consideration."

Lukashenko also warned Kiev that, once the special military operation concludes, its current international partners are unlikely to offer assistance. "No one but us will support Ukraine in the post-war period," he declared. He further predicted that the United States "will shift its focus to Iran, Yemen, or Taiwan and neglect Ukraine altogether."

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump will undoubtedly go down in world history if he resolves the issue of annexing Greenland, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Commenting on Trump's statements about Greenland, the spokesman said: "Perhaps here we can detach ourselves from the question of whether this is good or bad or whether it complies with international law or not. But there are international experts who believe that by resolving the issue of Greenland's accession, Trump will go down in history. Not only in US history, but in world history as well. And, I repeat, without discussing whether this is good or bad, it is difficult to disagree with these experts."

Trump has repeatedly emphasized the importance of Greenland joining the US. During his first term, he proposed buying the island, and in March 2025, he said it could be annexed. On January 17, Trump announced on Truth Social that the US would impose a 10% tariff on goods from the U.K., Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, France, and Sweden. The tariff will remain in effect until the parties reach an agreement on Washington's "complete and total acquisition" of Greenland. The tariff will take effect on February 1, and increase to 25% on June 1.

In addition, the US leader criticized Europe's intention to send its forces to Greenland, calling it a "very dangerous game." Trump argued that owning the island is necessary to strengthen US national security and deploy the Golden Dome missile defense system effectively.

Greenland is Denmark's autonomous territory. In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen signed the Greenland Defense Agreement in addition to their NATO alliance commitments. Under the treaty, the US committed to defend the island from potential aggression.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to join US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza, his spokesman said on Monday.
    


            Speaking to reporters during a regular media briefing, Dmitry Peskov said: “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace.”
    


            He said the Kremlin is now reviewing the invitation and “hoping to get more details from the US side.”
    


            CNN has asked the White House for a comment.
    


            Later on Monday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said President Alexander Lukashenko also received an invitation to join the board.
    


            The ministry's press service said Minsk “highly appreciates that the American side sees Belarus – and this is clearly stated in the text of the address – as a country ready to take on the noble responsibility of building a lasting peace and leading by example, investing in a secure and prosperous future for future generations.”
    


            Lukashenko is Putin's closest ally and has been described as Europe's last dictator.
    


            The establishment of the board, chaired by Trump, is a key step in the United Nations-backed American plan to demilitarize and rebuild Gaza, which was ravaged by two years of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group.
    


            However, signs of discontent have already started to appear. Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee issued a statement on Sunday warning that the body proposed by Trump “would have a mandate wider than the implementation of the Gaza Peace Plan.”
    


            “The United Nations has a unique mandate to maintain international peace and security, and the legitimacy to bring nations together to find common solutions to shared challenges. While it may be imperfect, the UN and the primacy of international law is more important now than ever,” she said in a statement.
    


            Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            Trump has also invited Israel to join the board as a founding member state, a senior Israeli official told CNN on Monday. According to the official, the invitation was extended to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or another Israeli representative on his behalf.
    


            It is unclear how many invitations have been sent out – the information about which countries and global leaders have been asked to join has been coming from the individual states, rather than the White House.
    


            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Argentinian President Javier Milei and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also received invitations to join, according to statements from them or their offices. The US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, said India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also invited to join.
    


            Some of the leaders, including Orbán, have shared the invitation letters publicly. They show that, while Trump addressed the letters personally to the leaders, he was inviting their country to join the board as a “founding state.”
    


            Members of the committee will receive a permanent seat if they pay $1 billion, according to a US official, who told CNN that, while there was no requirement to contribute funds to the board, members who do not make the $1 billion payment will have a three-year term.
    


            All funds raised will go toward rebuilding Gaza, the official said, adding that “there will not be exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat that plagues many other international organizations.”
    


            Putin's appointment to the board would mark an extraordinary return to the global stage for the Russian leader, who has been mostly shunned from international cooperation projects since he ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            The Kremlin's involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been limited, although it did offer to mediate soon after the war started, touting its ties to both Israel and Hamas.
    


            Unlike many Western countries, Russia does not officially consider Hamas to be a terror group. Senior Hamas leaders visited Moscow just weeks after the militant group launched the October 7 terror attacks against Israel, despite the fact that at least 20 Russian citizens were killed or kidnapped in the attacks.
    


            In 2024, Palestinian factions, some of whom had been at odds for almost two decades, met in Moscow. The Russian state news agency TASS reported earlier this month that the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas was set to visit Russia later this week.

Vehicles ready for export are seen at a port in Yantai in China's eastern Shandong province. The world's second-largest economy posted a record trade surplus of US$1.19-trillion in 2025.STR/AFP/Getty Images

China reported it had hit its full-year GDP growth target of 5 per cent Monday, with exports to other markets more than compensating for slowing U.S. demand.

The Chinese economy bore the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war last year, with both sides engaging in tit-for-tat tariffs that threatened to spiral out of control until Mr. Trump agreed to a new trade deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a summit in South Korea. 

At one point, Washington imposed cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on most Chinese goods, a rate that threatened to essentially halt exports from China to its largest trading partner. But for all the uncertainty this engendered, in China and global markets, Beijing refused to back down, imposing its own tariffs and negotiating hard ahead of the October agreement. 

That tactic appeared to have paid off Monday. The world's second-largest economy posted a record trade surplus of US$1.19-trillion in 2025, underlining how China remains the dominant global supplier despite competition from developing markets and domestic challenges, including increasing labour costs and a shrinking population. 

Though growth dropped to 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, raising fears of slowing momentum heading into 2026, Beijing has cause to remain optimistic on this front, having stabilized trade with the U.S. – for now – and agreed to new trade deals with Canada and South Korea, as well as making progress on similar agreements with Britain and the European Union. 

“Trump's tariffs have essentially failed to deliver the desired effect,” said Huang Weiping, a professor of economic at Renmin University in Beijing, pointing to China's increased diversification and a growth in exports to Southeast Asia and other developing markets. 

Opinion: Is more trade with China really a good idea?

Indeed, China has been helped in this regard by Mr. Trump: The U.S. President's advisers once framed tariffs as a means of containing Beijing, but instead Washington's all-out global trade war has driven many countries – Canada among them – closer to China. 

That includes even the EU, where long-standing concerns about oversupply and a yawning trade deficit are being offset by new threats of U.S. tariffs over EU support for Greenland and even a potential invasion by the U.S. of the Danish territory. China agreed to open its market to Spanish pork and Irish beef after recent visits by those countries' leaders, while French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly planning to invite Mr. Xi to a G7 summit hosted in France this summer. 

In an editorial Monday, the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times said “China has always viewed Europe as an indispensable force in a multipolar world and genuinely supports Europe in pursuing strategic autonomy.” 

For all that China's export economy – long the engine of its stratospheric growth in recent decades – remains relatively rosy, domestic consumption did not improve significantly in 2025, despite concerted efforts to boost demand both to offset external pressures and reduce China's increasingly politically toxic trade deficit with overseas partners. 

“The domestic contradiction of strong supply and weak demand is prominent, and there are still many old problems and new challenges in economic development,” National Bureau of Statistics official Kang Yi told a briefing Monday. 

Chinese policy-makers have vowed to “significantly” boost domestic consumption over the next five years, including by adopting proactive fiscal measures. Despite this, household spending in China remains around 20 per cent below the global average, making up less than 40 per cent of annual economic output. 

In a note, analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit said China “remains a K-shaped economy in 2025, characterized by a robust external sector and soft domestic demand.” 

Xu Mingqi, deputy director of the Institute of World Economy at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said, “Consumption remains underwhelming, prompting the rollout of a raft of pro-consumption measures spanning fiscal, tax and financial policies.” 

These policies could yet “deliver notable effects in 2026,” Prof. Xu said. 

However, falling property prices – investment in the sector slumped 17.2 per cent last year – high youth unemployment and a weak social safety net have all combined to drive down domestic demand. Chinese consumers have so far responded tepidly to stimulus measures such as vouchers or government-backed electronics trade-in programs. 

As well as the growth statistics released Monday, China also published its latest population figures, with the one-time world's most populous country shrinking for the fourth consecutive year. The total number of births in 2025 was 7.92 million, the lowest in decades, down from 9.54 million in 2024. 

While China is far from the only developed country in East Asia to be grappling with a rapidly aging population, the situation is exacerbated by the legacy of the country's “one child policy,” which has created a situation where one person of working age may be supporting six people: two parents and four grandparents.

            Speaker Mike Johnson is actively working to unite his conference behind another Republican-only policy bill ahead of the midterms, with members clamoring for more wins and eager not to waste what they fear could be the waning days of their majority.
    


            Despite facing one of the smallest House margins in history, Johnson has outlined an extraordinarily aggressive legislative plan for 2026 that, if successful, Republicans believe could help preserve their fragile hold on the chamber next year — and potentially protect the speaker's own political survival. And the Louisiana Republican is moving quickly, telling CNN he held a “productive” meeting last week with key chairmen and has spoken with Senate GOP Leader John Thune in recent days.
    


            “We want to use all the tools that we have in the arsenal. And I'm very bullish, very optimistic. I think we can do something,” he said last week, discussing the prospect of Republicans passing a party-line package under a process known as reconciliation.



            Johnson has instructed chairmen to come up with a menu of ideas they'd like to see in another GOP economic bill. But whether the bill is focused on health care, tax policy or further deficit reduction is still not clear. And it will be difficult for Johnson to start cobbling together a new bill when he is still constantly quelling internal fights about GOP priorities on the floor and begging members to show up for votes with no room to spare in their narrow margin. Last week alone, GOP leaders lost a floor vote they didn't even realize was in trouble and were forced to pull several other measures from their agenda.
    


            Johnson's agenda 2.0 plan is a long-shot effort that comes with no shortage of potential downsides for him and for the party. Trying and failing — like Republicans did with their Obamacare repeal effort in 2017 ahead of Trump's last midterm — could highlight GOP ineptitude just months before the election. And conservatives are already telegraphing they want to see significant cuts to a federal budget that moderates are struggling to defend on the campaign trail.
    


            “You never know ‘til you try,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy said. “If you spend half your time in Congress and half your time running … that's stupid.”
    


            Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio is another fiscal hawk with big dreams of enacting across-government cuts in the style of the Department of Government Efficiency in the next bill. But he also offered a reality check: “We barely had the votes to defund NPR. I don't know how aggressively we'll be able to reform some of the things.”
    


            Many Republicans agree that choosing not to use a legislative tool that allows them to pass conservative bills with just their own party's votes would be a major waste in a GOP-controlled Congress. But that is where the agreement ends.
    


            GOP lawmakers acknowledge it will be much more difficult to deliver another package after Congress passed Trump's tax break, spending cuts and immigration bill last year. To start, there is no clear idea of what the bill would include. One major faction of House Republicans, known as the Republican Study Committee, is pushing for housing policies and an expansion of health care savings, which they say would also cut $1 trillion from the federal deficit. They even have a name: “Making the American Dream Affordable Again.”
    


            “I think we have some really good proposals that leadership is looking at, that's in line with what the president wants to do, some creative ideas,” the group's chairman, Rep. August Pfluger of Texas, told CNN, saying the ideas have vast support among the American people, not just GOP voters. “I think we're going to get some Democrats eventually to say, yeah, those are good ideas. … There's a lot of legislative proposals that truly are 80-20 issues.”
    


            Other conservatives are pushing their Senate colleagues to relitigate a series of messy fights they already lost on pieces of the first bill that were deemed out of compliance with strict Senate rules, such as immigration policy.
    


            And there isn't even consensus on whether Johnson should attempt another party-line push at all.
    


            Multiple centrist Republicans told CNN they're more interested in bipartisan wins and have told the speaker directly. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he would rather see a bipartisan immigration bill or a debt commission, adding: “I just think it creates a very polarized environment. I think it's bad to lean on it.”
    


            Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he'd rather the GOP sit down and “really regroup,” and then focus on issues like health care that he thinks the party has been ignoring.
    


            “I pray to God we don't do something stupid,” Van Drew said when asked about a possible second Trump agenda bill. “I don't give a damn how many reconciliation bills you do unless it's going to have a health care component to it.”
    


            House GOP leaders are aware of the hurdles. But they are also feeling immense pressure from many in their conference, who have been frustrated by months of slow legislating, including a lengthy shutdown that kept members out of town for 43 days. GOP leaders are also driven to shield the president from being perceived as a lame duck. Many are also increasingly worried about their party's fate in the November elections, as voters warn that Trump isn't doing enough to shore up the economy.
    


            Still, one top Republican, Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, acknowledged that fears over losing the House majority isn't enough to unite the conference behind a bill.
    


            “You still have to get votes. We can't just deem it as passed. So, if everybody comes along and says, ‘We agree with what's being put in the bill,' that would be awesome,” Hern said.
    


            Hern said the biggest concern for leadership will be: “Do we have enough in there that satisfies everybody?”
    


            And this time, Johnson is dealing with a House margin that will require perfect unity within his famously unruly conference. The sudden death of one colleague and the abrupt resignation of former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have left the speaker with almost no room to maneuver — and a special election in Texas is expected to send another Democrat to the House in just two weeks.
    


            There is also no guarantee that any House effort would have a future in the Senate, where Thune has had to contend with his own unpredictability among his conference. That includes Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who is now fully entrenched in her reelection fight in a Democratic-leaning state, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who was a very hard-fought yes vote for Thune the first time around.
    


            There are also concerns that the GOP hasn't yet done a good enough job of selling the bill it passed last year. There is fear among GOP lawmakers that the signature policy bill of Trump's second term, which the president dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” has been struggling to land with voters. Johnson and his leadership team have been repeatedly stressing to their members that they need to better sell the package back home.
    


            Voters, they argue, are still understanding the impact of the massive piece of legislation that included broad tax cuts for Americans as well as big changes to tighten access to Medicaid and food stamps that conservatives cheered. The bill largely extended tax cuts Trump passed in his first term — and showing voters the benefit of not losing the tax breaks has been harder than expected to campaign on, some have acknowledged.
    


            Republicans who are facing tough reelection fights are among the most vocal in pushing for another big Trump package, arguing it would help them to expand their list of legislative wins.
    


            “I think maybe it would relieve some of President Trump's frustration with the filibuster and demonstrate we can actually get things done,” said Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is in the fight of his political life in a three-way primary in Texas.

Ukraine's capital Kyiv, home to over 3 million people, has rarely been prepared for winter.

Frozen, icy sidewalks, bursting pipes, and year-long infrastructure collapse have been a key feature of the city under Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

Now, following Russia's Jan. 9 attack, Kyiv has been pushed into a humanitarian crisis, leaving residents without heating, hot water, and electricity through the coldest winter in years.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has been open about who he holds to blame. Zelensky called the situation in Kyiv "especially difficult," slammed the local authorities, and compared the capital's readiness to that of other cities — heavily bombarded Kharkiv — saying they were better equipped to handle the consequences of Russian attacks.

"Kyiv, unfortunately, has done much less — far too little has been done in the capital. And even these past few days, I haven't seen sufficient effort — all of this must be urgently corrected," Zelensky said on Jan. 14.

Klitschko hit back, dismissing the accusations as "groundless" and politicized. He said the government had not coordinated any joint response to the crisis.

Experts, who spoke with the Kyiv Independent, said that while the capital has been poorly run overall, the responsibility for the ongoing crisis lies with both the central and local authorities.

"The city was not prepared," Victoria Voitsitska, member of the supervisory board of the We Build Ukraine think tank, told the Kyiv Independent.

"Lots of things could have been done. But it seems like everyone was looking at each other, prepared to blame the other party for the misgivings that ordinary people are going through right now."

Zelensky's outbursts have also been expected. The president and the mayor have been in an open political conflict since 2019.

Observers see the back-and-forth as a power struggle for control over Ukraine's capital and its finances, while also pointing to Klitschko's presidential ambitions.

Zelensky's leverage over the city comes from Kyiv's unique status, both as a city and as a region. The mayor is elected and, historically, is also appointed by the president to lead the Kyiv City State Administration.

While Klitschko maintains both posts, during the all-out war, Zelensky has appointed Tymur Tkachenko to lead Kyiv's Military Administration. The unclear division of powers between the two undermines the efficient governance of the city. Klitschko has accused Tkachenko of trying to take over the mayor's powers. 

The standoff between Klitschko and Zelensky unfolds as Kyiv faces a dire situation.

Zelensky said the Kyiv leadership had "lost valuable time" and tasked the government with taking charge of resolving the consequences of the energy crisis in the capital and fixing the situation.

Since Russia began its consistent campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure in 2022, the defense of the country's energy grid has taken center stage, with authorities reporting on the construction of protective structures for energy facilities.

"Given the fact that we're a country at war, I believe that first of all, it was the responsibility of the central government to take full responsibility for preparing the country for the worst to come," said Voitsitska.

"We had a state of emergency in the energy sector for a couple of years already, so we should have changed the status quo of how to manage this situation a long time ago."

According to Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy prime minister and the community and territories development minister, Kyiv authorities failed to properly deploy a backup power system, critical infrastructure lacked backup energy sources, and there was no public communication with residents about what to do in case of power outages.

In May, Kuleba took charge of the task force preparing the country for the heating season, coordinating the actions of both central and local authorities. He also leads the task force dedicated to protecting energy infrastructure.

Kyiv has the largest local budget among Ukrainian cities, with a surplus. Voitsitska argues that the government could have reviewed local expenditures, helping to better prioritize its spending. However, despite having the surplus, Klitschko "irresponsibly spent funds," including on park renovation, she said.

The local authorities may still face bureaucratic hurdles, requiring approval from the central government to make certain decisions. But the tensions between Zelensky and Klitschko seem to be disrupting communication.

"It's a pity that instead of supporting (the mayor), we are killing ourselves," Klitschko's adviser told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity.

Voitsitska suggests Klitschko should have addressed the city's energy crisis needs and the issues he's facing with the central government earlier. The Kyiv mayor said that he hasn't had any personal meetings with Zelensky since the all-out war began.

Over the past four years, the city has also received substantial assistance from donors. Olena Pavlenko, president and co-founder of the Ukrainian DiXi Group think tank, said many international projects "did a lot for Kyiv's heat supply, with generators, with other stuff."

"The question is how much of that stuff was installed and whether it was destroyed before or not," she told the Kyiv Independent.

Despite his popularity abroad, Klitschko often faces criticism at home for how he handles the city, with his reputation further marred by illegal construction and corruption allegations involving his allies.

From the start of his presidency, Zelensky sought a loyalist to head the Kyiv City State Administration. But a legal provision stood in the way — under the law, the post belongs to the city's elected mayor.

Zelensky reportedly considered ousting Klitschko from his role as head of the Kyiv City State Administration after a Russian attack killed three people near a shelter in Kyiv in 2023.

The shelter was locked.

"If we focus on finding who is guilty and punishing them in the middle of winter, I think we might end up with no heat at all," Pavlenko said. "I would suggest keeping these investigations and punishments until at least after the heating season is over."

Hello there! This is Kateryna Denisova, the author of this piece. Despite the ongoing flurry of diplomacy, here in Ukraine, we see no readiness from Russia to end its brutal war, as relentless attacks continue. My colleagues and I are working around the clock in the bitter cold of Kyiv to deliver you the latest updates from the ground. 

Please consider supporting our reporting. This makes our work possible.

Thank you.

Editor's note: The story has been updated with the latest details.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 19 that his administration would move to remove what he called a "Russian threat" to Greenland, arguing that "Denmark has been unable to do anything about it."

The comments come as Trump threatens to impose up to 25% tariffs on European countries that oppose his ambitions to annex Greenland, the world's largest island and semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally.

"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. "Now it is time, and it will be done!"

Trump has repeatedly staked his claim to the strategically valuable island, not ruling out the use of military force after Danish and Greenlandic authorities rejected his offer to buy it.

European leaders have hit back at Trump's threats and are reportedly drawing up their own economic countermeasures, including tariffs or restrictions on U.S. companies.

The escalating dispute is seen as the most serious rupture in transatlantic relations in a decade, a development openly praised by Russia.

Trump has justified his claim to the island on national security grounds and accused Danish authorities of insufficient investment in its defense, arguing it makes Greenland vulnerable to Russia and China. 

Washington already operates a military base on the island, and a 1951 treaty with Denmark grants it broad rights to station forces there.

European leaders have rejected the accusations and dispatched a small contingent of troops for exercises on the island last week.

In a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Trump reportedly linked his claim to Greenland to not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

"The world is not secure unless we have complete and total control of Greenland," Trump wrote, according to Bloomberg.

The U.S. president reiterated his stance in a phone interview with NBC News, once again declining to rule out military options. He also rebuked European leaders for pushing back on the matter.

"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them," Trump told NBC News. "That's what Europe should focus on — not Greenland."

In private discussions with top aides, Trump has also complained about Canada's alleged inability to counter the Russian and Chinese threat in the Arctic region, NBC News reported, citing undisclosed sources.

While Trump previously also floated the idea of annexing Canada as the "51st U.S. state," officials told NBC News that the U.S. president is not discussing purchasing the country's territory or seizing it by force.

Trump's warnings about the Russian threat contrast with his often conciliatory stance toward Moscow, especially in regard to the war in Ukraine. Only last week, the U.S. president declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks peace, accusing Kyiv of standing in the way despite ongoing talks on a peace deal between U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

Based in Lviv, Martin often reports on international politics, with a focus on analyzing developments related to Ukraine and Russia.  His career in journalism began in 2021 after graduating from Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, earning a Master's degree in Conflict and Democracy Studies. Martin has been invited to speak on Times Radio, France 24, Czech Television, and Radio Free Europe. He speaks English, Czech, and Ukrainian. 

The development is driven by a stronger ruble and low oil prices, according to the news agency's calculations.



Moscow is currently studying the proposal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to state news agency TASS. 

Chief of the Royal Danish Army Major General Peter Boysen will also deploy to the island alongside soldiers.



"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'" Trump said, accusing Denmark of being unable to counter it.

Czechia will not sell its L-159 light combat aircraft to Ukraine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Jan. 19, despite Czech President Petr Pavel advocating for the move.

Russia struck energy infrastructure overnight in “several regions,” cutting power in five oblasts as freezing temperatures add strain to Ukraine's grid, Deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said.


According to Axios reporter Barak Ravid, the Russian official will meet Trump's envoys, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, on Jan. 20 to discuss the Washington-backed peace plan for Ukraine.

Among the Russian air defense systems that endured "destruction" are S-300, S-350, and S-400 air defense systems, as well as Russian anti-aircraft missile systems BUK-M1 and BUK-M2, and Pantsir-S1 and Pantsir-S2 air defense systems, according to the SBU. 

Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures.



Ukrainian and U.S. officials will continue peace proposal discussions during the World Economic Forum in Davos, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said Jan. 18.

After quickly hitting the initial target, organizers raised the goal to 2 million zloty ($550,000) — a figure that has since been surpassed, with donations now exceeding 2.4 million zloty (around $660,000).

The European Union is preparing possible retaliation against the United States, including up to 93 billion euros ($101 billion) in tariffs or restrictions on U.S. companies operating in the bloc, amid escalating tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland, the Financial Times reported Jan. 18.

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. Work is underway to document the Kiev regime's crimes against civilians in the Kherson Region, Governor Vladimir Saldo said in an interview with TASS.

"We have created a register of the crimes that the Kiev regime is committing in the Kherson Region. It covers destruction, fatalities, and casualties. The time will come when those responsible will answer for it all," he noted.

Saldo pointed out that Kiev sought to present its crimes as the fight for its interests but in fact, "they are on a human hunt." "It's clear that those who are in charge of these processes are criminals," he added.

The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into possible violations stemming from a protest by anti-ICE demonstrators at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Jan. 18, according to officials.

Footage circulating on social media shows protesters gathering inside Cities Church in St. Paul during a Sunday service, while chanting phrases like “Justice for Renee Good” and “Who needs justice, we need justice.”

            The US Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.
    


            A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.
    


            The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.
    


            US Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

            “A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.
    


            Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
    


            “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,” said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.”
    


            The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.
    


            Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.
    


            Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.
    


Aftermath video of latest ICE shooting involving a man officials say assaulted an officer contradicts officials' account



            In a January 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents “knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.”
    


            “Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,” the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. “They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.”
    


            Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.
    


            “If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?” Cullars-Doty said. “We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.”

The Las Vegas Sphere had some fun with local golfers nearby. The LED structure appeared to judge the golfers game using a large emoji. See the funny moment!

A popular music and entertainment arena in Las Vegas is expanding and opening another venue outside of Washington, D.C.

The Sphere, a dome 366 feet high and 516 feet wide and spanning a total of 875,000 square feet, will be opening a smaller-sized model in National Harbor, Maryland, according to a release. 

James Dolan, Sphere Entertainment's chair and CEO, said in a press release the organization is looking forward to bringing an immersive experience to a new area.

            • US President Donald Trump tied his ambitions to annex Greenland to his unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in an extraordinary message to Norway's prime minister. Trump said he no longer feels bound “to think purely of Peace.”
    


            • European countries are weighing using their so-called “trade bazooka” after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies, including the UK, until a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland.
    


            • UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies, and that the future status of Greenland belongs to its people and Denmark.
    


            • Meanwhile, an Israeli official said Trump invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin also received an invitation.
    


            NATO will continue to work with Denmark and Greenland on matters relating to the security of the Arctic region, the military alliance's Secretary General Mark Rutte said Monday.
    


            His comments follow a meeting with Denmark's Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt.
    


                    “We discussed how important the Arctic – including Greenland – is to our collective security and how (Denmark) is stepping up investments in key capabilities,” he posted on X. “We'll continue to work together as allies on these important issues.”
                





            During the meeting, Poulsen said he and Motzfeldt raised the possibility of having a NATO mission in Greenland and the Arctic, according to Reuters news agency.
    


                    “We have proposed this. The NATO secretary general has also taken note of this, and I believe we can now hopefully establish a framework for how this can be achieved,” Reuters quoted Poulsen as saying.
                





            President Donald Trump linked his interest in acquiring Greenland to his unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in a stunning message to Norway's prime minister.
    


            Meanwhile, stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold reached a new high after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until they agree to a deal for the US purchase of Greenland.
    


            In response to Trump's threats, António Costa, the president of the European Council (EUCO), called for an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders on “transatlantic relations,” which is scheduled to be held in Brussels on Thursday at 1 p.m. ET, according to the council.

President Trump has told the Norwegian prime minister that he is 'no longer obliged to think purely of peace' after he was snubbed of the Nobel Peace Prize. In the message, Trump also reiterated his calls for Greenland to be handed over to the United States.


CNN's Kevin Liptak, Olesya Dmitracova, Auzinea Bacon, James Frater, Catherine Nicholls, Inke Kappeler, Rebekah Riess, Benjamin Brown, Amy Croffey, Billy Stockwell and Henrik Pettersson contributed to this report.



            Europe is not interested in picking a “fight” with the US over President Donald Trump's ambitions to annex Greenland, but the bloc will “hold our ground,” according to the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
    


                    “We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground. Europe has a slate of tools to protect its interests,” Kallas said in a social post Monday.
                





            Trump's threat to hit his allies with tariffs unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland is “not the way to go about this,” Kallas said.
    


                    “Denmark and Greenland are not alone,” she said. “Arctic security is a shared transatlantic interest, and one we can discuss with our US allies.”
                





            Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said there are “red lines which can't be crossed,” referencing US President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland. However, he added that he has no intention of escalating the situation.
    


            He said he believed the United Kingdom and the European Union would stand behind Denmark, citing the “strong statement” of support from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
    


            Starmer said earlier Monday that it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies and reaffirmed that any decision about the future status of Greenland “belongs to the people of Greenland.”
    


            Asked if he felt betrayed by the US, Rasmussen said Monday: “I use the word surprised… I have no intention to escalate things.”
    


                    “It's so important that all our allies in the NATO alliance, European Union, stand up for these principles to show the American president you have a desire, you have a vision, you have a request, but you will never be able to achieve that by putting pressure on us,” Rasmussen said.
                





            Greenland's Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen said today that dialogue should prevail as US and Europe clash over President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland and subsequent threat of tariffs on European allies.
    


                    “We don't let ourselves be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,” Nielsen said in a social post referring to Trump's latest announcements.
                





            Nielsen said support for Greenland from other countries and state leaders “means something,” calling it a “clear recognition that Greenland is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions.”
    


                    “The demonstrations at home and in Denmark have shown a strong and dignified unity. Many people have peacefully expressed love for our country and respect for our democracy. I am very grateful for that,” he added.
                





            Three US cardinals have issued a rare joint statement calling for a “genuinely moral foreign policy” for America, citing recent events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland.
    


            “We renounce war as an instrument for narrow national interests and proclaim that military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations,” the cardinals said.
    


            The statement was signed by Cardinals Robert McElroy of Washington, DC, Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark.
    


            The three cardinals quoted from Pope Leo XIV's recent “state of the world” address in the Vatican, where the pontiff warned how “zeal for war is spreading” and the post-Second World War principle that prohibited nations violating the borders of others has been “completely undermined.”
    


            The US' “moral role” in the world, the cardinals state, was now coming “under examination,” while attempts to build peace are being “reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies.”
    


            Their unusual joint declaration comes after both the pope and US bishops have criticized the Trump administration's policy on immigration. McElroy, whose doctoral thesis was published as a book titled “Morality and American Foreign Policy: The Role of Ethics in International Affairs” in 1992, last year described immigration deportations as “morally repugnant.”



            Meanwhile, the US archbishop who has responsibility for the military expressed concern that “service personnel could be put in a situation where they're being ordered to do something that's morally questionable” when it came to any US action against Greenland.
    


            Archbishop Timothy Broglio told the BBC yesterday that “he cannot see any circumstances” that a US operation in Greenland could be a just war, describing Denmark as “an ally.”
    


            European countries are weighing using their “trade bazooka” after US President Trump threatened tariffs on European allies.
    


            But what is this so-called anti-coercion instrument?
    


            The tool — adopted in 2023 with countries like China in mind — can be applied if a third country tries to pressure the European Union or one of its member states “into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment.” It could block some of America's access to EU markets or impose export controls, among a broader list of potential countermeasures.
    


            Trump announced Saturday that he would impose 10% tariffs on February 1 on goods from eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland. It would increase to 25% if an agreement is not reached by June 1.
    


            The types of measures the European Commission can take using this anti-coercion instrument include restricting “foreign direct investment, financial markets, public procurement, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, export controls, and more,” according to the policy.
    


            However, the implementation of the “trade bazooka” could take time to implement.
    


            The European Commission would first need to examine the existence of economic coercion in an individual case. Then the council has a maximum of eight to ten weeks to “expeditiously” implement the act and would request “the coercing third country to stop the coercion,” the policy reads.
    


            Efforts would then be made to consult with the coercing third country to resolve the issue, but “if those efforts do not bear fruit,” the EU would then implement its anti-coercion instrument.
    


            CNN has obtained the full message exchange between Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, writing on behalf of himself and President Alexander Stubb of Finland, and US President Donald Trump. Here's that conversation:
    


Text message from Prime Minister Støre to President Trump [January 18 at 3:48 p.m.]:



«Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine - and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today - with both of us or separately - give us a hint of what you prefer! Best - Alex and Jonas»






Text message from President Trump to Prime Minister Støre [January 18 at 4:15 p.m.]:



«Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States.The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT»






            When US President Donald Trump began his second term last year, he immediately started threatening steep tariffs on goods imported from countries around the globe.
    


            On Saturday, he announced that he would impose 10% tariffs on goods from eight European countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany. Those eight nations had sent troops to Greenland Friday to take part in a joint military exercise on the island over the weekend.
    


            Trump did not specify whether the announced levies would be enacted on top of other tariffs already in existence. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Tariffs are taxes on imported goods or services. In some countries, exports can also be subject to tariffs.
    


            The levies typically amount to a percentage of the value of the import and can vary based on what the imports are and where they come from.
    


            Domestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front. They may choose to absorb those extra costs or pass them on in part or in full to their customers.
    


            Tariff transactions occur at hundreds of points of entry into the United States, designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.
    


            China hit out at the United States today, rejecting the claim that it poses a threat to Greenland.
    


            “We urge the US to stop using the so-called ‘China threat' as a pretext for seeking selfish gains,” China's foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a news briefing in Beijing, according to CNN affiliate CCTV.
    


            The rebuke comes as US President Donald Trump, in a lengthy social media post Saturday, said the United States needed possession of Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian threats in the Arctic and develop what he has called the Golden Dome to protect North America from ballistic missiles.
    


            “China has stated its position on multiple occasions on Greenland. The international law underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter is the foundation of the current international order and must be upheld,” Jiakun added.
    


            There will be a “substantial increase” in the number of Danish troops in Greenland after today, a Danish military spokesperson told CNN, with soldiers being deployed to the Arctic island this evening.
    


            The troops will be sent to the municipality of Kangerlussuaq, the spokesperson said. Kangerlussuaq, in the south-west of the island, is in the Arctic Circle.



            The chief of the Royal Danish Army, Major General Peter Boysen, will be deployed with the soldiers, the spokesperson added.
    


            US President Donald Trump has invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” a senior Israeli official told CNN.
    


            According to the official, the invitation was extended to Netanyahu or another Israeli representative on his behalf. Israel hasn't officially replied yet to be a founding member state, the official said.
    


            Over the weekend, the US extended invitations to multiple world leaders to join the Trump-led board, which is expected to oversee governance and reconstruction of post-war Gaza.
    


            The Kremlin earlier said Russian President Vladimir Putin was also invited to join the committee.
    


For more context: Netanyahu is facing internal political pressure following the advancement of the Gaza ceasefire deal to phase two. On Saturday, he harshly criticized the inclusion of Turkey and Qatar in key roles on the executive board after trying to prevent their involvement in Gaza.
    


            We're getting more updates on the special European Council meeting being convened regarding US-Europe tensions over Greenland.
    


            António Costa, the current president of the European Council (EUCO), called for the extraordinary meeting of EU leaders on “transatlantic relations” to be held in Brussels on Thursday at 1 p.m. ET, according to the council.
    


            Costa has said that after consulting with member states, European leaders are in agreement that US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations.
    


                    “We do not want a trade dispute with the United States of America,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today in Berlin. “But if we are confronted with tariffs that we consider unreasonable, then we are in a position to respond, and that is exactly what we will be discussing in Brussels on Thursday.”
                





            Amid threats from US President Donald Trump that he will impose tariffs on several European countries in his pursuit of acquiring Greenland, a spokesperson for the European Commission has said that the priority among EU leaders is to “engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs.”
    


                    “It's clear from the consultations among EU leaders, including President von der Leyen, that the priority here is to engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs. Why? Because this will ultimately harm consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” Olof Gill said today.
                





            If tariffs are imposed, however, the EU “has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond, because we will do everything necessary to protect EU economic interests,” he said.
    


            European leaders are “consulting intensively,” while “engagement with the US is continuing at all levels,” Gill said.
    


                    “Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint and responsible leadership is what President von der Leyen and indeed the European Union as a whole are all about,” he added.
                





            President Donald Trump's niece has urged Europe to “fight back” following the US leader's threat to impose tariffs on eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland.
    


            Quoting a New York Times headline that reads “European Officials Lean Toward Negotiating, Not Retaliating, Over Trump Threat,” Mary Trump said that she was “so f**king tired” of people trying to negotiate with her uncle.
    


                    “I am so f**king tired of the failed strategy of negotiation and appeasement. It only empowers him. Fight back!” she posted on X on Sunday night.
                





            Stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold – a safe-haven asset – reached a new peak after US President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until a deal was reached for the US purchase of Greenland.
    


            In the United States, where markets are closed Monday, Dow futures were 0.9% down, while S&P 500 futures dropped by a steeper 1.2%.
    


            The US president announced Saturday that he would impose a 10% tariff from February 1 on goods from eight European countries. Trump didn't specify whether the tariff would be on top of what they're already paying.
    


In response, the European Union is considering imposing €93 billion ($108 billion) of previously announced retaliatory tariffs against the United States. French President Emmanuel Macron has also reportedly called for the activation of the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument. Colloquially known as a “trade bazooka,” the instrument could block some of America's access to EU markets or result in export controls, among other potential measures.
    


            “Given their deep economic and financial ties, both the US and Europe have the ability to impose significant pain on each other, but only at great cost to themselves,” Jonas Goltermann, a senior markets economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said in a note Monday.
    


            “As such, the more likely outcome, in our view, is that both sides recognise that a major escalation would be a lose-lose proposition, and that compromise eventually prevails. That would be in line with the pattern around most previous Trump-driven diplomatic dramas.”
    


            US President Donald Trump tied his ambitions to annex Greenland to his so-far unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in an extraordinary message to Norway's prime minister, according to a European diplomat who has seen the note.
    


            “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the message, which was addressed to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
    


            It came in response to a text message Støre had sent to the president opposing his plans to levy new tariffs on European nations who oppose his bid to control Greenland.
    


            The contents of the note were sent to other European diplomats afterwards.
    


            “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,” Trump wrote in the message.
    


                    “I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” the note concluded.

This post has been updated with additional reporting.



            Russian President Vladimir Putin's top economic envoy will travel to the Swiss resort town of Davos to hold meetings with members of the US delegation, sources with knowledge tell CNN.
    


            Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) and Kremlin special envoy will meet Trump administration officials on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, the sources added.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to join US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza, his spokesman said on Monday.
    


            “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
    


            He said the Kremlin is now reviewing the invitation and “hoping to get more details from the US side.”
    


Some context: The establishment of the board, chaired by Trump, is a key step in the United Nations-backed American plan to demilitarize and rebuild Gaza, which was ravaged by two years of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group.
    


            Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent requires it to have good relations with the United States.
    


                    “It is in our national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defense, security and to intelligence,” Starmer said Monday, fielding questions from reporters about whether US President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland might cause a fundamental rupture in relations between the US and the UK, along with other NATO allies.
                





            The prime minister said the UK's nuclear deterrent “is our foremost weapon… when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom, (which is) my primary duty.”
    


                    “That requires us to have a good relationship with the United States,” he said. “But that doesn't mean… that we pretend we don't have differences.”
                





            The prime minister stressed that it is not right for the UK to “choose between the US and Europe,” because it remains allies of both.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will attend the Supreme Court's oral argument Wednesday in a case involving the attempted firing of Fed governor Lisa Cook, an unusual show of support by the central bank chair. 

The high court is considering whether President Donald Trump can fire Cook, as he said he would do in late August, in an unprecedented attempt to remove one of the seven members of the Fed's governing board. Powell plans to attend the high court's Wednesday session, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 

It's a much more public show of support than the Fed chair has previously shown Cook. But it follows Powell's announcement last week that the Trump administration has sent subpoenas to the Fed, threatening an unprecedented criminal indictment of the Fed Chair. Powell — appointed to the position by Trump in 2018 — appears to be casting off last year's more subdued reponse to Trump's repeated attacks on the central bank in favor of a more public confrontation. 

Powell issued a video statement Jan. 11 condemning the subpoenas as “pretexts” for Trump's efforts to force him to sharply cut the Fed's key interest rate. Powell oversaw three rate cuts late last year, lowering the rate to about 3.6%, but Trump has argued it should be as low as 1%, a position few economists support.

The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, an allegation that Cook has denied. No charges have been made against Cook. She sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court Oct. 1 issued a brief order allowing her to stay on the board while they consider her case. 

If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, he could appoint another person to fill her slot, which would give his appointees a majority on the Fed's board and greater influence over the central bank's decisions on interest rates and bank regulation.

The collision occurred when the tail end of a train traveling between Malaga and Madrid with some 300 passengers went off the rails near Cordoba at 7:45 p.m. It slammed into a train coming from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif. Rescue efforts were still underway Monday morning. (AP video by Alicia Leon Perea, Produced by Luke Garratt)

Spanish police said Monday that at least 39 people are confirmed dead in a high-speed rail collision the previous night in the south of the country when the tail end of a train jumped the track, causing another train speeding past in the opposite direction to derail.

A high-speed train derailed on Sunday evening and jumped onto the track in the opposite direction, slamming into an oncoming train, killing at least 21 people and injuring dozens more, the country's transport minister said.

ADAMUZ, Spain (AP) — Spanish police said Monday that at least 39 people are confirmed dead in a high-speed rail collision the previous night in the south of the country when the tail end of a train jumped the track, causing another train speeding past in the opposite direction to derail.




The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 4-meter (13-foot) slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters (feet) from the crash site, Andalusia regional president Juanma Moreno said, describing the wreckage a “mass of twisted metal” with bodies likely still to be found inside.

Efforts to recover the bodies continued Monday, and the death toll could rise. Authorities are also focusing on attending hundreds of distraught family members and have asked for them to provide DNA samples to help identify victims.

The crash took place Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track. Puente said that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.

Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.




The accident shook a nation which leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash.

“Today is a day of pain for all of Spain,” Sánchez said on a visit to Adamuz, a village near the accident site, where many locals helped emergency services handle the influx of distraught and hurt passengers overnight.

Moreno, the regional leader, said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching for bodies.

“Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact,” Moreno said. “The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away.”

Video released by the Civil Guard showed the worst-hit carriages shredded open, train seats cast on the gravel packing under the tracks. One carriage lay on its side, bent around a large concrete pillar, with debris scattered around the area.

Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the glass.

Andalusia's regional emergency services said 43 people remained hospitalized, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 79 passengers were discharged by Monday afternoon, authorities said.

Train services Monday between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled, causing large disruptions. Spanish airline Iberia added flights to Seville and another two to Malaga to help stranded travelers. Some bus companies also reinforced their services in the south.

Transport Minister Puente early Monday said the cause of the crash was unknown.

He called it “a truly strange” incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the Italian-owned company Iryo, while the second train was part of Spain's public train company, Renfe.

According to Puente, the back part of the first train derailed and crashed into the head of the other train. An investigation into the cause could take a month, he said.

The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers told the AP that in in August, it sent a letter asking Spain's national railway operator to investigate flaws on train lines across the country and to reduce speeds at certain points until the tracks were fully repaired. Those recommendations were made for high-speed train lines, including the one where Sunday's accident took place, the union said.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph); one was going 205 kph (127 mph), the other 210 kph (130 mph). He also said that “human error could be ruled out.”

The incident “must be related to the moving equipment of Iryo or the infrastructure,” he said.

Iryo issued a statement on Monday saying that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15. 

Various Spaniards who had loved ones on the trains posted messages on social media saying they were unaccounted for and pleading for any information.

The Civil Guard opened an office in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash, as well as Madrid, Malaga, Huelva and Seville for family members of the missing to seek help and leave DNA samples.

“There were moments when we had to remove the dead to get to the living,” Francisco Carmona, firefighter chief of Cordoba, told Onda Cero radio. 

A sports center in Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid, was turned into a makeshift hospital. The Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. 

“The scene was horrific. It was terrible,” Adamuz mayor Rafael Moreno told The Associated Press and other reporters. “People asking and begging for help. Those leaving the wreckage. Images that will always stay in my mind.”

One passenger had been treated in a local hospital along with her sister before she returned to Adamuz with hopes of finding her lost dog. She was limping and had a small bandage on her cheek, as seen by an AP reporter.

Pope Leo XIV expressed his condolences for the dead and hope for the quick recovery of the injured, the Vatican said in a statement.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said she was following the “terrible news.”

Spanish King Felipe VI expressed his condolences Monday, adding that the royal house was looking into a visit to Adamuz.

“I understand the desperation of the families and the number of injured people who have suffered this accident, and we are all really worried,” the king said, speaking from Athens.

The Spanish flag was flown at half-staff in front of Parliament in Madrid for the victims on Monday.

Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains and currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains moving over 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.

The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024.

Iryo became the first private competitor in high-speed to Renfe in Spain in 2022.

Sunday's accident was the first with deaths on a high-speed train since Spain's high-speed rail network opened its first line in 1992.

Spain's worst train accident this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country's northwest. An investigation concluded the train was traveling 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks. That stretch of track was not high speed.

The Sundance Film Festival may be a little bittersweet this year. It will be familiar in some ways as it kicks off on Thursday in Park City, Utah. There will be stars, from Natalie Portman to Charli XCX, and breakout discoveries, tearjerkers, comedies, thrillers, oddities that defy categorization and maybe even a few future Oscar nominees. The pop ups and sponsors will be out in full force on Main Street. The lines to get into the 90 movies premiering across 10 days will be long and the volunteers will be endlessly helpful and cheery in subfreezing temperatures.

But the country's premier showcase for independent film is also in a time of profound transition after decades of relative stability. The festival is bidding farewell to its longtime home and forging forward without its founder, Robert Redford, who died in September. Next year, it must find its footing in another mountain town, Boulder, Colorado.

It's no surprise that legacy will be a through-line at this year's final edition in Park City. There will be screenings of restored Sundance gems like “Little Miss Sunshine,” “Mysterious Skin,” “House Party” and “Humpday” as well as Redford's first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama “Downhill Racer.” Many will also pay tribute to Redford at the institute's fundraising event, where honorees include Chloé Zhao, Ed Harris and Nia DaCosta.

“Sundance has always been about showcasing and fostering independent movies in America. Without that, so many filmmakers wouldn't have had the careers they have,” said “Mysterious Skin” filmmaker Gregg Araki. He first attended the festival in 1992 and has been back many times, including at the labs where Zhao was one of his students. 




Quite a few festival veterans are planning to make the trip, including “Navalny” filmmaker Daniel Roher. His first Sundance in 2022 might have been a bit unconventional (made fully remote at the last minute due to the pandemic) but ended on a high note with an Oscar. This year he's back with two films, his narrative debut “Tuner,” and the world premiere of “The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,” which he co-directed with Charlie Tyrell.

“We're going through a weird moment in the world … There's something that strikes me about an institution that has been evergreen, that seems so entrenched going through its own transition and rebirth,” Roher told The Associated Press. “I'm choosing to frame this year as a celebration of Sundance and the institute and a future that will ensure the festival goes on forever and ever and ever and stays the vital conduit for so many filmmakers that it has been.”

Over the past four decades, countless careers have been shaped and boosted by the festival and the Institute. Three of this year's presumed Oscar nominees — Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryan Coogler and Zhao — are among those the Institute supported early in their careers.

Jay Duplass, who first came to Sundance in 2003 with his brother, Mark, with what he calls a “$3 film” said it was the place where his career was made.

“I'd probably be a psychologist right now if it wasn't for Sundance,” Duplass said.

While he's been to “probably 15 Sundances” since, it hasn't lost its luster. In fact, when a programmer called him to tell him that his new film “See You When I See You” was selected, he cried. The film is based on a memoir in which a young comedy writer (Cooper Raiff) attempts to process the death of his sister (Kaitlyn Dever). It's one of many films that finds humor amid grim subjects.

As always, the lineup is full of starry films as well, including Cathy Yan's art world satire, “The Gallerist,” starring Portman, Jenna Ortega, Sterling K. Brown, Zach Galifianakis and Da'Vine Joy Randolph. The romantic drama “Carousel,” from Rachel Lambert, features Chris Pine and Jenny Slate as high school exes who rekindle their romance later in life. Araki is also bringing a new film, “I Want Your Sex,” in which Olivia Wilde plays a provocative artist (Araki described as a cross between Madonna and Robert Mapplethorpe) who takes on Cooper Hoffman as her younger muse.

“It's kind of a sex-positive love letter to Gen Z,” Araki said. “It's a comedy. It has elements of mystery, thriller, murder — a little bit of ‘Sunset Boulevard' … it's fun, it's colorful, it's sexy. It's a ride.”

Wilde also steps behind the camera for “The Invite,” in which she stars alongside Seth Rogen as a couple whose marriage disintegrates over the course of an evening. Olivia Colman is a fisherwoman looking to make the perfect husband in “Wicker,” co-starring Alexander Skarsgård. Zoey Deutch plays a Midwestern bride-to-be seeking out her celebrity “free pass” (Jon Hamm) in the screwball comedy “Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass.” And Ethan Hawke and Russell Crowe lead the Depression-era crime drama “The Weight.”

Pop star and noted cinephile Charli XCX will also be out and about, starring in the self-referential mockumentary “The Moment,” and appearing in “The Gallerist” and “I Want Your Sex” as well.

The 2026 festival features a robust lineup of documentaries too, which have a good track record of snagging eventual Oscar nominations and wins. There are a handful of films about famous faces, including basketball star Brittney Griner, Courtney Love, Salman Rushdie, Billie Jean King, Nelson Mandela and comedian Maria Bamford.

Others delve into newsy subjects past and present, like “When A Witness Recants,” in which author Ta-Nehisi Coates revisits the case of the 1983 murder of a boy in his Baltimore middle school and learns the truth. “American Doctor” follows three professionals trying to help in Gaza. “Who Killed Alex Odeh” examines the 1985 assassination of a Palestinian American activist in Southern California. “Everybody To Kenmure Street” is about civil resistance to deportations in Glasgow in 2021. And “Silenced” tracks international human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson in her fight against the weaponization of defamation laws against victims of gender violence. 

And some don't fit into any easy category, like “The History of Concrete” in which filmmaker John Wilson takes what he learned at a “how to sell a Hallmark movie” seminar and tries to apply it to a documentary on concrete. 

There might be a bit of wistfulness in the air too, as everyone takes stock of the last Sundance in Park City and tries to imagine what Boulder might hold.

“It feels very special to be part of the last one in Park City,” Duplass said. “It's just a super special place where, you know there are going to be movies there with giant stars and there's also going to be some kids there who made movies for a few thousand dollars. And they're all going to mix.”

Araki, like Redford, knew long ago that the festival had outgrown Park City. It will be strange to no longer have its iconic locations like Egyptian Theatre and Eccles and The Ray anymore, but it's also just a place. 

“The legacy and the tradition of Sundance will continue no matter where it is,” Araki said.

Buffalo Bills defensive lineman Jordan Phillips appeared to be upset with the organization's decision to fire head coach Sean McDermott on Monday following a tough playoff exit.

The Bills made the decision nearly two days after Buffalo lost to the Denver Broncos in overtime. It marked another season where the Bills have bowed out of the postseason amid Super Bowl expectations.

Phillips made his feelings known on Instagram.

"This s--- here is so stupid honestly sickening," Phillips wrote in a post on his Instagram Stories. "The best coach I've ever been around."

Phillips joined the Bills for his third stint in the middle of the 2024 season. He played for the Dallas Cowboys for two games before he was released and re-signed with the Bills. Phillips played in 11 games this season but his year was cut short due to an ankle injury.

McDermott was the head coach in each of Phillips' stints with the Bills.

Buffalo will embark on its first head-coaching search since the 2017 offseason.

"Sean has done an admirable job of leading our football team for the past 9 seasons," team owner Terry Pegula said in a statement. "But I feel we are in need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level. We owe that to our players and to Bills Mafia.

"Sean helped change the mindset of this organization and was instrumental in the Bills becoming a perennial playoff team. I respect all the work, loyalty and attention to detail he showed for this team and the community. I wish Sean, Jamie and his family all the best."

As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon's legacy.

In the year since Donald Trump's second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized. 

One year ago, Trump's executive orders, “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” and “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump's birthday.

The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city's Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for. 

Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon's plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump's comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.

“I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven't always been perfect, but we've always strived to be this more perfect union, and that's what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland's first Black governor and only the nation's third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation's oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration's priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement. 

“From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank is encouraging the holiday's focus to stay solely on King himself. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago.

But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King's ambition for the country, Hafera argued.

“I think efforts should be conducted in the spirit of what Martin Luther King actually believed and what he preached. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don't judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.”

The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn't, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy.

“As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said. 

The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, has planned its events under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action.” Organizers planned demonstrations in Atlanta, Chicago and Oakland, California, among other cities, over the weekend and Monday.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK's radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

For the first time in its 60-year history, Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King dinner. Over the years, the event drew notable guest speakers including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and activist Angela Davis. 

The reasoning was “budget constraints,” according to a social media post by the school's Black Student Union. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported. 

Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. But a member of the church's “social justice and peace committee” told NewsCenterMaine.com that the pastor was concerned about people's safety amid rumors of ICE agents being in the area.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether. 

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. The museum is located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968. The museum is offering free admission on the holiday, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.

According to two European officials, Trump's message to Gahr Støre read in part: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” It concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”

Starmer's comments came after Trump has argued repeatedly that the U.S. needs control of Greenland for its national security. He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. Trump has not ruled out military action.

U.S. President Donald Trump linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year's decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, telling Norway's prime minister that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” in a text message released on Monday.

Trump's message to Jonas Gahr Støre appears to ratchet up a standoff between Washington and its closest allies over his threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark. On Saturday, Trump announced a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight nations that have rallied around Denmark and Greenland, including Norway.

Those countries issued a forceful rebuke. 

The White House has not ruled taking control of the strategic Arctic island by force. Asked whether Trump could invade Greenland, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said on Monday that “you can't leave anything out until the president himself has decided to leave anything out.” 

Rasmussen, speaking to reporters following a meeting with his British counterpart Yvette Cooper in London, encouraged Washington to instead discuss solutions. 

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also sought to de-escalate tensions on Monday. “I think this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion,” he said, adding that he did not believe military action would occur.

In a sign of how tensions have increased in recent days, thousands of Greenlanders marched over the weekend in protest of any effort to take over their island. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Monday that the tariff threats would not change their stance.




“We will not be pressured,” he wrote.

Meanwhile, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business, minerals, energy, justice and equality, told The Associated Press that she was moved by the quick response of allies to the tariff threat and said it showed that countries realize “this is about more than Greenland.”

“I think a lot of countries are afraid that if they let Greenland go, what would be next?”

Trump's Sunday message to Gahr Støre, released by the Norwegian government, read in part: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”

It concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”

The Norwegian leader said Trump's message was a reply to an earlier missive sent on behalf of himself and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, in which they conveyed their opposition to the tariff announcement, pointed to a need to de-escalate, and proposed a telephone conversation among the three leaders.

“Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,” the Norwegian leader said in a statement. “As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.”

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is an independent body whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the president's approach in Greenland during a brief Q&A with reporters in Davos, Switzerland, which is hosting the World Economic Forum meeting this week.

“I think it's a complete canard that the president would be doing this because of the Nobel,” Bessent said, immediately after saying he did not “know anything about the president's letter to Norway.”

Bessent insisted Trump “is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States,” adding that “we are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.”

Trump has openly coveted the peace prize, which the committee awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last year. Last week, Machado presented her Nobel medal to Trump, who said he planned to keep it, though the committee said the prize can't be revoked, transferred or shared with others.

In his latest threat of tariffs, Trump indicated they would be retaliation for last week's deployment of symbolic numbers of troops from the European countries to Greenland — though he also suggested that he was using the tariffs as leverage to negotiate with Denmark.

European governments said that the troops traveled to the island to assess Arctic security, part of a response to Trump's own concerns about interference from Russia and China.

Starmer on Monday called Trump's threat of tariffs “completely wrong” and said that a trade war is in no one's interest. 

He added that “being pragmatic does not mean being passive and partnership does not mean abandoning principles.” 

Six of the eight countries targeted are part of the 27-member European Union, which operates as a single economic zone in terms of trade. European Council President Antonio Costa said Sunday that the bloc's leaders expressed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion.” He announced a summit for Thursday evening.

Starmer indicated that Britain, which is not part of the EU, is not planning to consider retaliatory tariffs. 

“My focus is on making sure we don't get to that stage,” he said.

Denmark's defense minister and Greenland's foreign minister are expected to meet NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Monday, a meeting that was planned before the latest escalation.

A hiker was found dead in the remote mountains of Southern California over the weekend after searching for friends who had gotten lost on a trail, according to authorities.

Deputies responded just before 8:30 p.m. Saturday to a call about a missing hiker near State Route 74 in Anza, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said.

The caller said four members of their group had set out on a hike early that morning and failed to return. Concerned they were in distress, another member of the group went searching for them.

The sheriff's Aviation Unit and Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit launched a search.

Tom Brady and Colin Cowherd discuss Drake Maye's first playoff appearance and ask if he can continue his winning streak in the playoffs against a stout Texans Defense. 

NFL legend Troy Aikman brought up the harsh reality the Houston Texans will have to address in the offseason following their brutal loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday.

Aikman, who is a color commentator for ESPN, summarized C.J. Stroud's play against the Patriots and made clear that the powers that be in the Texans' organization will have to make some tough decisions in the offseason.

"DeMeco Ryans and Nick Caserio, they've got some tough decisions they gotta make about this team on the offensive side of the ball," Aikman said. "They replaced Bobby Slowick last year after his two years as the offensive coordinator.

"C.J. Stroud has been chasing his rookie success for the last two years. He's not been the same player. We've not seen the development from him. There's a reason for that, and it has to be addressed."

Stroud had four interceptions in the 28-16 loss to the Patriots. He was 20-of-47 with 212 passing yards and one touchdown pass. While the defense gave Houston plenty of chances to score points and make it a close game, Stroud was never able to elevate the offense.

The one-time Pro Bowler also struggled against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC wild-card round, fumbling the ball five times and throwing an interception in a 30-6 win.

"Seven turnovers in the two playoff games," Aikman added. "Your most important games of the year, you can't just overcome that kind of quarterback play."

Ryans backed Stroud after the loss to New England.

"C.J.'s our guy," Ryans said. "I believed that he could come back out in the second half and flip it."

DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind.

The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them.

Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries.

“It's really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we're in a transition. Some people think we've already entered a new era. But I think it's undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.”

Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike.

Trump's peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center.

The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics.

Critics will also be nearby: He's blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, was set to speak but organizers on Monday canceled his appearance, saying “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. 

The two likeliest counterweights to Trump's administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China's “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. 

The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge.

This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. 

The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. 

The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand.

Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.”

“People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we' to ‘me'.”

The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public.

Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world's richest people.

Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world's population lives in poverty, the group said.

The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies.

The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying.

With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. 

As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. 

Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. 

Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week.

Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. 

“It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.”

The European Union's executive arm, Russia, Belarus and Thailand on Monday were the latest to be asked to join U.S. President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace that will supervise the next phase of the Gaza peace plan, while France is holding off accepting for now.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin received the invitation and that the Kremlin is now “studying the details” and would seek clarity of “all the nuances” in contacts with the U.S. 

It's unclear how many leaders have been invited to join the board. But a Trump reference in the invitation letters that the body would “embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict” suggested it could act as a rival to the U.N. Security Council, the most powerful body of the global organization created in the wake of World War II.

France does not plan to join the Board of Peace “at this stage” despite receiving an invitation, a French official close to President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. The issue is raising questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, said the official, speaking anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices. 

A top Israeli official said the initiative is “bad for Israel” and should be scrapped.

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has been invited and is ready to take part, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. The Thai Foreign Ministry said it was also invited and that it was reviewing the details.

European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill confirmed that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, received an invitation and would be speaking to other EU leaders about Gaza. Gill didn't say whether the invitation had been accepted, but that the commission wants “to contribute to a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.”

According to the World Bank's Gaza and West Bank Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (IRDNA) report released last year, it'll take $53 billion to rebuild the strip.

Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday dismissed the Board of Peace as a raw deal for Israel and called for its dissolution. 

“It is time to explain to the president that his plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,” Smotrich said. “Gaza is ours, its future will affect our future more than anyone else's. We will take responsibility for what happens there, impose military administration, and complete the mission.”

Smotrich, a hard-liner who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, even suggested that Israel renew a full-scale offensive on the territory to destroy Hamas if it doesn't abide by a “short ultimatum for real disarmament and exile.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later on Monday that while there are differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza, it would not harm his relationship with Trump.

“There will not be Turkish soldiers and Qatari soldiers in the (Gaza) Strip,” he said. 

Netanyahu's office earlier said the formation of an executive board that will work to carry out the vision of the Board of Peace wasn't coordinated with the Israeli government and “is contrary to its policy” without clarifying its objections. Israel hasn't been invited to join the committee, unlike Turkey, a key regional rival.

The U.S. is expected to announce its official list of members in the coming days, likely during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

Board members will oversee an executive committee that will be in charge of implementing the tough second phase of the Gaza peace plan that includes the deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-devastated territory.

A $1 billion contribution secures permanent membership on the board, with the money going to rebuild Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the charter as he wasn't permitted to speak publicly about details of the board, which hasn't been made public. A three-year appointment has no contribution requirement.

Details of how this will also work remain murky. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday the United Kingdom is talking to allies about the Board of Peace. Although the U.K. hasn't said whether Starmer has been formally invited to join, he said it's necessary to proceed with the Gaza peace plan's second phase and that his country has “indicated willingness to play our part, and we will.”

Egypt's top diplomat on Monday met with the leader of the newly appointed committee of Palestinian technocrats who will be running Gaza's day-to-day affairs during the second phase of the peace plan.

Foreign Minister Bader Abdelatty met with Ali Shaath, a Palestinian engineer and former official with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, who was named last week as chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza.

Abdelatty expressed the Egyptian government's “complete support” of the committee and affirmed its role in running Gaza's daily affairs until the Palestinian Authority takes over the territory, said a statement from the Egyptian ministry.

He also underscored “the importance of preserving the unity of the Palestinian territories, ensuring geographical and administrative continuity between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.”

The U.N. World Food Program on Monday said it has “significantly expanded” its operations across Gaza 100 days into the ceasefire, reaching more than a million people each month with hot meals and food parcels. But it warned the situation remains “extremely fragile.” 

It noted that malnutrition has been prevented for 200,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children under 5. 

Still, the most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis in December indicated that 77% the population is facing crisis-level food insecurity.

Israeli military and security forces launched what they called a large-scale counterterrorism operation in the West Bank city of Hebron to dismantle “terrorist infrastructure, eliminating illegal weapons possession and strengthening security.”

The Israeli military said Monday the operation is expected to continue for several days. Israeli armored vehicles and soldiers patrolled city streets and put up barriers where operations were being conducted. 

Hebron Mayor Khaled Dudin said Israeli forces targeted the area that's home to 80,000 people because it obstructs the construction of additional Israeli settlements.

The West Bank has seen a surge in Israeli military activity since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack into Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.

Israeli forces on Monday killed three Palestinians, including a teenager, in southern Gaza, hospital authorities said.

Two men crossed into Israeli-controlled areas east of Khan Younis before being shot dead, while 17-year-old Hussein Tawfiq Abu Sabalah was shot and killed in the Muwasi area of Rafah, according to the Nasser hospital. It wasn't immediately clear whether the teen had crossed into or came close to the Israeli-controlled area.

More than 460 people were killed by Israeli fire and their bodies brought to hospitals since the ceasefire went into effect just over three months ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts

A protest was held in Denmark's capital Copenhagen on Saturday in support of Greenland, amid US President Donald Trump's insistence that the U.S. should control the self-governing island.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Red baseball caps spoofing Donald Trump's iconic MAGA hats have become a symbol of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the U.S. president's threat to seize the frozen territory.

The caps reading “Make America Go Away” — parodying Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan — have gained popularity along with several variants on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration held in freezing weather in the Danish capital.

European governments are rallying behind Denmark, citing the need to defend Arctic regions and warning that threats against Greenland undermine Western security.

Protesters, however, are less diplomatic.

“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don't like the president of the United States,” said 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest Saturday.

The mock hats were created by Copenhagen vintage clothing store owner Jesper Rabe Tonnesen. Early batches flopped last year — until the Trump administration recently escalated its rhetoric over Greenland. Now there are popping up everywhere.

“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn't a joke — it's not reality TV, it's actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do?” Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”




Demand suddenly surged from a trickle to selling out in the space of one weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand.”

The original version designed by Tonnesen featured a play on words: “Nu det NUUK!” — a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it's enough,” substituting Nuuk, Greenland's tiny capital.

Protesters at Saturday's rally waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and carried handmade signs mocking U.S. claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia.

“No Means No,” read one sign. Another declared, “Make America Smart Again.”

Wearing one of the spoof hats, protester Kristian Boye, 49, said the gathering in front of Copenhagen City Hall struck a lighthearted tone while delivering a serious message.

“I'm here to support the Greenlanders, who are going through a very hard time right now,” he said. “They are being threatened with having their country invaded. I think it's totally unacceptable.”

Terron Armstead joins Jason McIntyre to discuss the matchups between the Broncos and Bills, Bears and 49ers, and Sam Darnold's oblique injury. 

NFL rules analyst Walt Anderson weighed in on the controversial interception ruling in overtime of the Denver Broncos' victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday night.

Broncos defensive back Ja'Quan McMillian took the ball away from Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks on a deep pass from Josh Allen. It appeared that Cooks had come down with the ball and that McMillian had taken it away after Cooks completed the catch. But NFL officials ruled that McMillian had intercepted the pass and created the turnover.

Denver came down the field and scored the game-winning field goal to advance to the AFC Championship Game.

Anderson appeared on the NFL Network and explained that Cooks never had complete control of the ball as he hit the ground and because the ball was still loose in his arms, McMillian was able to secure it for the interception.

He also addressed the issue of why there was no proper explanation of the play. Head referee Carl Cheffers didn't address the play to the crowd or the TV audience. Anderson said replay assistant and officials in New York reviewed the play quickly and made the call.

"Replay has all of these angles to take a look and see ‘was the ruling on the field wrong, or was the ruling on the field correct?'" Anderson said. "If you can confirm that the ruling on the field is correct, they really want to move the game along, and they don't want to have unnecessary stoppages."

BILLS DOOMED BY BIZARRE INTERCEPTION IN PLAYOFF LOSS TO BRONCOS

Bills head coach Sean McDermott was irate over the process of how the call was confirmed. He wanted officials to take a long look at the play, which is why he said he took a timeout after the interception.

"It would seem logical to me… that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it, just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium to there are on the same page. That's too big of a play, in my estimation, and a play that decided the game potentially as well, to not even slow it down," McDermott said.

"It's hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled. If it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down just to make sure that we have this right? That would have made a lot of sense to me, to make sure that we have this thing right. Because that's a pivotal play in the game. We have the ball at the 20, maybe kicking a game-winning field goal right there. So I'll just leave it at that."

But he did not leave it at that. In fact, according to the Buffalo News, the coach called the outlet from the team plane and berated the officials even more.

"That play is not even close," he told the outlet. "That's a catch all the way. I sat in my locker and I looked at it probably 20 times, and nobody can convince me that that ball is not caught and in possession of Buffalo."

How public opinion on crowdfunding soured, explained in one chart.

Today, no American tragedy is complete without a GoFundMe.

It took less than a week to raise over $1.5 million for the family of Renee Nicole Good, the woman fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. At the same time, a parallel fundraiser for her killer raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. And last year saw GoFundMe campaigns for people rebuilding their homes after the Los Angeles wildfires, therapy for the Camp Mystic flood survivors in Texas, struggling families affected by the SNAP shutdown, and far more.

But even as one in five Americans donate directly to those in need through crowdfunding, many feel uneasy about the rise of platforms like GoFundMe, which has raised over $40 billion since 2010, according to a recent survey by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The poll of 1,146 adults nationwide measured the extent to which Americans now participate in crowdfunding, the details of what that participation now looks like, and the nature of how they perceive crowdfunding campaigns.

The survey found that less than 10 percent of Americans — including both donors and non-donors — felt very confident in the effectiveness of crowdfunding campaigns, and many harbored serious doubts about who really stands to profit from them. More than half of those surveyed said they had very little confidence that crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe charge reasonable service fees. And nearly as many doubted that crowdfunders themselves use the money they raise responsibly or raise enough to meet their goals at all.

As I previously reported in October, the evidence shows that some of their fears are justified.

Start with those service fees, which the highest share of survey participants had qualms about. While the for-profit GoFundMe, the biggest name in the game, technically only charges a nominal processing fee like any other fundraiser, the platform defaults donors into “tipping” some 17.5 percent (on my browser, at least) of their donation to benefit the company's bottom line.

And for a fundraiser as big as the one for Good's widow, those tips can really add up. If all donors tipped the full 17.5 percent on the $1.5 million campaign, GoFundMe would rake in over $260,000.

Another point of doubt was the idea that many who crowdfund don't actually need the money and, even if they do, might not use it responsibly. The data on such fraud is difficult to come by, and while GoFundMe claims it affects only about one in 1,000 campaigns on its platform, the disperse nature of crowdfunding makes it virtually impossible to verify whether most fundraisers ultimately use their funds “wisely” or even for their intended purpose at all.

What's more, Americans' hunch that few crowdfunds ultimately reach their initial goals is also right on target. Some studies show that as few as one in ten crowdfunding campaigns succeed by that metric. And while every dollar counts, the people who need the most help often struggle to get their fundraiser off the ground at all.

More often than not, the wealthier and whiter the fundraiser's neighborhood and network is, the more successful their campaign is likely to be, according to several studies measuring the success rate of medical crowdfunds, meaning that many people who need help get left behind.

A week before Good's shooting, another American citizen, Keith Porter Jr. — a Black father from Los Angeles — was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE officer on New Year's Eve. Porter had just fired a celebratory shot in the air from an AR-15-style rifle when he was confronted and killed by the agent, who lived in the same apartment complex. Yet, for days, a fundraiser for his family struggled to gain the same traction as the one for Good, who is white. Amid some outcry over the disparity, a GoFundMe for Porter's daughters has managed to raise nearly $260,000 out of a goal of $300,000.

Still, even though crowdfunding can be a flawed way to give, it's one of the only venues we have for directly helping individual people in need quickly during times of crisis. According to the AP-NORC survey, medical expenses and health care causes are the most common kind of crowdfunds people donate to, followed by memorials and funeral expenses. Oftentimes, these fundraisers act as a lifeline for people in intense distress who have no other options. For beneficiaries, even a mildly successful campaign can be transformative.

Sure, there are probably more efficient, more equitable ways to handle medical bankruptcies and funeral costs than an endless string of crowdfunds. But until those solutions materialize, giving to one another — however imperfectly — might be the best we've got.

            The president of the United States ordered the secret construction of a secure underground facility at the White House and built a new extension of the East Wing on top.
    


            It was 1941, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had been encouraged to build a bomb shelter at the White House in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
    


            At the time, “no public acknowledgment was made of there being a bomb shelter under construction, only the East Wing,” according to White House Historical Association historian Bill Seale.
    


            More than 80 years later, the East Wing is again under construction in preparation for President Donald Trump's sprawling new ballroom, and the historic, if dated, underground facilities have been dismantled. And once again, there's a lot of secrecy around plans to rebuild the bunker.
    


            Little is publicly known about the construction taking place in what was once a secret submarine-like bunker, which included the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, and the underground infrastructure around it. The space has been used for everything from watching a parody film the Nixon administration deemed pornographic and wanted killed, to planning former President Joe Biden's clandestine trip to Ukraine. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney was evacuated to the space moments before an attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
    


            The space is now likely being reimagined and replaced with new technology to counter evolving threats, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.
    


            But there has been very little acknowledgment that the project even exists.
    


            During a recent meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission where the ballroom was discussed, White House director of management and administration Joshua Fisher said broadly that the overall ballroom project will “(enhance) mission critical functionality,” “make necessary security enhancements” and “(deliver) resilient, adaptive infrastructure aligned with future mission needs.”
    


            Fisher was pressed on why the project broke with precedent by starting the demolition process without the commission's approval — and he indicated that the “top-secret” work taking place underground was the motivation.
    


            “There are some things regarding this project that are, frankly, of top-secret nature that we are currently working on. That does not preclude us from changing the above-grade structure, but that work needed to be considered when doing this project, which was not part of the NCPC process,” he said.
    


            The White House declined CNN's request for comment. But in a court filing last week for a case seeking to stop the East Wing construction, the White House defended the process, saying that halting the underground construction would “endanger national security and therefore impair the public interest.” It said the reasoning for this was described in a “classified declaration” attached to the case.
    


            Here's what we know about what was there before — and what's going on now.
    


            Though Roosevelt's construction was initially envisioned as a bomb shelter, underground facilities beneath the East Wing evolved over time to serve multiple functions.
    


            Those who enter through the East Wing would go down a few levels and then walk through a massive, protected vault-style door to enter a self-contained bunker with low ceilings that included beds, shelf-stable foods, water, and other supplies, plus secure communications to the outside world, according to a source who has been inside the space and was not authorized to speak on the record.
    


            The underground space also included the PEOC, a centralized command and control facility for the president and his staff that was fortified to withstand a potential nuclear explosion or other major attack.
    


            The PEOC works in tandem with the Situation Room, said Jonathan Wackrow, a former US Secret Service agent and CNN contributor.
    


            “The Situation Room is a much more focused watch center that will feed information over to the PEOC, but because it is a complex that's in the West Wing, it is secure to a point, but it's not a hardened facility,” he said.
    


            “The PEOC is used during emergencies. It's not something that everybody goes to,” he added. “The Situation Room is used almost by the whole of government, 24 hours-a day.”
    


            The PEOC has been depicted on the silver screen with varying degrees of accuracy — most recently in the 2025 thriller “A House of Dynamite,” along with 2013's “Olympus Has Fallen,” which depicted a terror attack on the White House.
    


            The “tomb-like” space was visited by Roosevelt only once, according to Seale, the historian. In subsequent years, “an inspection of the bomb shelter became a first-day custom for all incoming presidents who followed, until the last twenty years, when the relevance of the shelter was lessened,” he wrote in 2011.
    


            A second source familiar with the space granted anonymity to speak freely described the underground complex as “a very complicated submarine that was built in the 1940s — a self-contained unit, [with] separate power backups, separate water backups, separate air filtration.”
    


            “But all the infrastructure is 1940s infrastructure,” they added.
    


            The complex also had a secure evacuation route, according to the first source, through which the president can be removed from White House grounds to another location.
    


            Demolition on the East Wing began in October, and the excavators that dismantled the East Colonnade and office space historically occupied by first ladies took the dated underground facility along with it.
    


            “With a high degree of confidence, I would say that all of the subterranean structures,” including the PEOC, heating and air utilities, and underground facilities for the White House Military Office and US Secret Service Uniformed Division, “all of that seems to be gone,” the second source said.
    


            For anyone concerned about presidential security in the absence of the bunker, that source said there are plenty of redundancies to keep the president safe in the event of an emergency.
    


            While it's unlikely that plans will emerge in public anytime soon, details could come with time: The PEOC played a significant role on September 11, 2001, and select images from inside the center that day were released via a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015.
    


            Trump has suggested the US military is “very much involved” in the ballroom construction, and it's likely that the project is being executed by some combination of military officials; Secret Service; the Executive Office of the President; contractor Clark Construction, which has significant experience in highly secure facility construction; and Shalom Baranes Architects, the group leading the ballroom construction, which also led the project to rebuild and fortify the Pentagon after the 9/11 attack.
    


            Wackrow, now a risk management executive, predicted that whatever replaces the underground space will be able to anticipate and respond to emerging threats, including kinetic threats like a nuclear explosion or plane crash; chemical or biological instruments; or electromagnetic pulses, among other potential concerns, and do so without telegraphing details to potential adversaries.
    


            “You have to think about a facility that can be built in secret, highly classified, that can sustain the current and future state threat environment,” he said.
    


            What will be virtually impossible: learning how much this aspect of construction costs. Trump has offered an ever-growing price tag on the ballroom aspect of the project, which started at $200 million and is now up to $400 million, but that doesn't account for what will happen underground. Trump has made clear that the ballroom will be paid for by private donors, but any subterranean security infrastructure will ultimately be paid for by American taxpayers.
    


            “If you think about trying to mitigate the threats today and the threats for tomorrow, you're really talking about emerging technologies, emerging infrastructure — stuff that may not be commercially available. We're never going to get the line of sight on how much that costs,” Wackrow said.

BANGKOK (AP) — European shares mostly fell and U.S. stock futures skidded Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 10% extra tariff on imports from eight European countries because they oppose having America take control of Greenland.

Germany's DAX lost 1.3% to close at 24,960.33 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.9% to 8,101.96. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.4% to 10,190.26. 

Among U.S stock futures, the S&P 500 was down 1% as of 11:48 a.m. Eastern Time, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.2%. U.S. stock markets are closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 

Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland because of their opposition to American control of Greenland.

The European countries targeted by Trump blasted his threat to raise tariffs, saying they “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” The unusually strong joint statement was the most forceful rebuke from the European allies since Trump returned to the White House almost a year ago. 

Trump's moves are testing the strategic alignment and institutional trust underlying support from Europe, the largest trading partner and provider of financing to the United States, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

“In a world where geopolitical cohesion within the Western alliance is no longer taken for granted, the willingness to recycle capital indefinitely into U.S. assets becomes less automatic. This is not a short-term liquidation story. It is a slow rebalancing story, and those are far more consequential,” Innes said.




In Asia, shares were mixed after China reported that its economy expanded at a 5% annual pace in 2025, though it slowed in the last quarter. Strong exports, despite Trump's higher tariffs on imports from China, helped to offset relatively weak domestic demand. 

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.1% to 26,563.90. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.3% to 4,114.00. 

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 declined 0.7% to 53,583.57. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was due to hold a news conference later Monday as she prepares to dissolve the parliament for a snap election next month. 

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.3% to 4,904.66, pushing further into record territory on strong gains for tech-related companies. Computer chip maker SK Hynix climbed 1.1%. 

Taiwan's Taiex added 0.7%, while the Sensex in India fell 0.6%. 

On Friday, stocks edged lower on Wall Street as the first week of corporate earnings season ended with markets trading near record levels.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% and the Dow industrials lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%. They all notched weekly losses, while smaller company stocks fared better. The Russell 2000 eked out a 0.1% gain. 

Technology stocks were the strongest forces behind the market's moves throughout most of the day. Several big technology stocks made strong gains and helped offset losses elsewhere.

Earnings updates might give investors a better sense of how consumers are spending their money and how businesses are faring with persisting inflation and higher tariffs. Results from the technology sector are being scrutinized by investors trying to figure out whether the high stock prices fueled by the craze around artificial intelligence are justified.

This week will bring a broader mix of earnings from airlines, industrial companies, and technology companies. United Airlines, 3M, and Intel are all scheduled to release their quarterly earnings results.

The U.S. central bank will get another update on inflation this week with the government's release of the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE. It is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure for inflation.

The Fed's next policy meeting is in two weeks, when it is expected to keep its current benchmark interest rate as it strives to balance a slowing jobs market with stubbornly high inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% goal.

In other dealings Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 12 cents to $59.58 per barrel. Price moves have settled down after a spate of volatility during widespread protests in Iran against that country's leadership.

Brent crude, the international standard, added 5 cents to $64.17 a barrel.

The price of gold resumed its upward climb, gaining 1.8%, while the price of silver jumped 6.2%. 

The U.S. dollar rose to 158.10 Japanese yen from 157.93 yen. The euro rose to $1.1643 from $1.1581.

            President Donald Trump has pitched NATO into what could become its worst-ever crisis by threatening new tariffs against US allies that oppose his grab for Greenland against the will of its people.
    


            Whether the world's relative peace is endangered by the fracturing of its most powerful military alliance will partly depend on whether Republicans in Congress show rare resolve in challenging their incorrigible president.
    


            Another key factor is whether European leaders, who responded to the latest escalation with steely unity, will threaten consequences for Trump and the US. The European Union is a huge trade bloc, and retaliation could hammer US stock markets that Trump touts as a barometer of economic well-being. But trade reprisals or limiting military cooperation could end up damaging America's allies more than their protector.
    


            European Union ambassadors held emergency consultations in Brussels on Sunday, and several leaders of NATO allies who are friendly with Trump called to express resolve over Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory.
    


            There is palpable alarm on both sides of the Atlantic that NATO could collapse. Such a previously unthinkable scenario would represent a historic win for Russia and China and represent perhaps the most destabilizing outcome of Trump's two White House terms.
    


            There is also concern in Congress about Trump's antics. But are there sufficient senior Republicans so protective of NATO, a bedrock of US global power, that they'd gamble on an exceedingly rare breach with him? Cracks have emerged in Trump's power base in Congress — notably over the Jeffrey Epstein files — but he remains feared by many GOP lawmakers.
    


            Ultimately, however, the parlous fate of the alliance rests on a president who sees US military power as his to wield without legal or constitutional constraints and who disdains NATO as a protection racket. Acquiring Greenland would be a legacy item greater than putting his name on the Kennedy Center or building a new White House ballroom; it would place him alongside Thomas Jefferson and William McKinley as presidents who expanded the territory of the United States.
    


            Trump sent shockwaves across the Atlantic on Saturday by intensifying his aggressive demands for Greenland as he pushes his “Art of the Deal” foreign policy to extremes. He said Saturday he'd impose a 10% tariff on “any and all goods” from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland starting February 1, increasing to 25% on June 1, until an agreement is reached.
    


            Trump has correctly pointed out that many NATO nations took the US security umbrella for granted by running down their armed forces in recent decades. His anger, as well as the threat highlighted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has prompted many member states to promise to substantially increase defense spending.
    


            But by failing to rule out military force to take Greenland, he risks destroying NATO and its Article 5 mutual defense clause over a personal obsession. This is despite no tangible desire among American voters to own the island or to pay for it. They're more worried about high prices a year into Trump's second presidency.
    


            “The president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat. So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that's one thing. But for him to militarily invade would turn Article 5 of NATO on its very head, and in essence, put us at war with NATO itself,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees, told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.
    


            “It would end up abolishing NATO as we know it, an organization that has … protected us from world wars,” McCaul said.
    


            Trump's first-term vice president, Mike Pence, told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that while the US has an interest in controlling and ultimately owning Greenland, Trump's methods were counterproductive. “I do think that the current posture, which I hope will change and abate, does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our NATO allies,” Pence said Sunday.
    


            Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, who heads the US delegation to NATO's parliamentary assembly, agreed that Trump had legitimate national security concerns in Greenland. But he told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “there certainly is no authority that the president has to use military force to seize territory from a NATO country.”
    


            But will Congress do anything to stop Trump?
    


            Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul and Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine are planning to impose speed bumps. They said in a joint appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” that they are discussing a new war powers resolution on Greenland. They also plan to challenge the new tariffs and highlight a law that stipulates a president can't withdraw from NATO without congressional approval.
    


            Paul said Trump was “rattling the cage” by refusing ruling out taking Greenland by force. But he added: “I've heard of no Republican support for that, even though most hawkish members of our caucus have said they won't support that.”
    


            Some Republicans hope Trump is merely playing real estate shark. “I think it's just the way Trump deals with things. I mean, look, he's gotten good deals done by taking an aggressive position,” Florida Sen. Rick Scott told Fox News.
    


            But an administration empowered by topping Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro seems to have moved on from master dealmaker mode. Days after Trump said he wanted Greenland because it was “psychologically important for me,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday appeared to confirm perceptions that the administration thinks the US is so strong it can take what it wants.
    


            “The United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world. We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. The US projects strength,” Bessent said on “Meet the Press.”
    


            NATO has faced many tensions in its nearly 77 years. In the Suez Crisis in 1956, the US opposed a British-French invasion of parts of Egypt. In the 1990s, some European nations were frustrated about Washington's initial reluctance to involve NATO to stop the war in the former Yugoslavia. In the early 2000s, after a period of soul-searching over its post-Cold War role, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in defense of the US after the 9/11 attacks. It later led the Afghan campaign. But angry divides flared over Iraq.
    


            Trump's pressure on NATO follows a banner period for the alliance after Sweden and Finland joined during the Biden administration following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The current split is unprecedented because none of the leaders who nurtured it for seven decades could fathom the scenario of one member threatening another. That the belligerent party is the United States — the most important member state — makes the situation even more unbelievable.
    


            Trump's fixation on Greenland, which is becoming more important as a race for control of the Arctic speeds up, makes strategic sense. But his rationale for why the United States must have it for itself is more opaque.
    


            The US has treaties with Denmark that allow it to send troops there. Trump says the island is vital for his Golden Dome missile defense project. But a US Space Force base there already focuses on missile early warning systems. Greenland and Denmark are also open to commercial deals with the US to exploit rare earth minerals. And Trump's claim that China and Russia might invade is disingenuous because the island is already NATO territory the alliance would defend.
    


            But Bessent advanced a stunning rationale that implies Trump could act unilaterally on any global issue. “The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency. It is a strategic decision by the president,” he told NBC. Trump's invoking of emergency powers to impose tariffs as part of his trade wars is the key point at issue as the Supreme Court deliberates on whether the president's tariffs usurped Congress' trade prerogatives.
    


            In the wake of Trump's demands for Greenland, European leaders who've spent the last year trying to appease and flatter the president hardened their tone.
    


            The issue is not just about territory. It cuts to the core of the European ideal, forged through centuries of continental bloodshed, that nations and peoples have the right to self-determination and are not mere vassals of all-powerful states.
    


            President Emmanuel Macron drew a striking parallel between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's territorial gangsterism when he wrote on X that France favored the independence and sovereignty of all nations. “No intimidation or threat will influence us—neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” he said.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — each of whom has tried to befriend Trump — both spoke to him by phone. Meloni, a populist conservative, said she “doesn't agree” with Greenland-related tariffs.
    


            But it will take more than words to appease Trump. Can Republicans on Capitol Hill or NATO allies show him that there will be personal and political consequences for making the annexation of Greenland a top priority?
    


            There are signs Trump's threats could scupper the ratification of an EU-US trade accord that offered the US advantageous conditions — partly because Europe knew it could not risk the withdrawal of US defense support. The collapse of the deal or retaliatory tariffs could hurt Trump by spiking prices of imports in a midterm election year in which voters have soured on his economic performance.
    


            A splintering of the NATO alliance could ultimately cause problems for the United States if it involved the closure of military bases in Britain, Germany or elsewhere that the US uses to project force in the Middle East and Africa. And it could saddle the stretched US military with sole responsibility for defending the Arctic.
    


            A severing of transatlantic ties would also complicate some of Trump's other priorities, such as his desire for European support and funding for his initiative to stabilize and rebuild Gaza. And if he really is serious about ending the Ukraine war, it can't be done fairly without Europe. NATO alliance members might also turn away from US arms purchases and investment.
    


            Yet NATO states remain deeply vulnerable to Trump. Decades of underspending on defense have left them reliant on America's military might 80 years after World War II and nearly 35 after the Cold War ended.
    


            There is a genuine will in Europe to be more independent. But it will take decades to build scale and all-around resilience, assuming weak governments can convince disgruntled voters to make sacrifices for defense spending.
    


            Ultimately, this unbalanced dynamic in the Western alliance has as much to do with the current impasse as the off-the-rails American president.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday.

Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.

The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans.

For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual.

But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences for it.

Trump said in late August that he was firing Cook from the seven-member Fed Board, citing claims that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two homes she owns. 

Cook denies any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any crime.

She sued Trump in federal court in D.C., seeking to block her removal.

A district court judge there on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing her as the lawsuit continued. A federal appeals court soon after upheld that order.

The Department of Justice, in filings with the Supreme Court, has called the lower court orders barring Cook's removal "yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to  remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause."

One thing many workers are keen to leave behind heading into 2026? The 9-to-5 schedule. In its place, many are interested in adopting a practice called "microshifting."

In Owl Labs' 2025 State of Hybrid Work report, 65% of workers reported being interested in microshifting, defined as working in "short, non-linear blocks based on personal energy, responsibilities, or productivity patterns."

"Microshifting appeals to employees not just as a scheduling preference, but as a way to reclaim control over their increasingly fragmented work lives," Owl Labs CEO Frank Weishaupt tells CNBC Make It. "Employees are improvising solutions to reconcile the demands of their jobs with the realities of their lives."

During the pandemic remote work boom, many workers had greater control over their time during their workdays. The interest in microshifting could represent interest in keeping that flexibility, particularly among those with some degree of remote or self-directed work, as it may be more difficult for office workers in traditional 9-to-5 jobs.

But microshifting isn't an entirely new practice. Doug Gregory of Grand Rapids, Michigan, says he's been doing it as a remote worker for decades, before it had that name, and even more so since the Covid-19 pandemic.

"We kind of got used to the idea of being present or available for loved ones," he says of broader sentiment in the workforce stemming from the pandemic remote work era. "We got used to taking better care of our health."

While Gregory acknowledges that "not everybody has control over their calendar," he finds "the day is more fluid" when he's microshifting.

"If I need to take an hour off during the day to go do something with the grandkid or to go see a doctor or whatever, it's okay, I make up for it in the evening, I make up for it early in the morning," he says. "It really comes back to what am I responsible for getting done, how do I do it, and how do I organize my life to do it."

Gregory previously held sales roles but today is self-employed working in audiovisual integration.

"I earn a living based on outcomes," he says. "Nobody sends me a check for how many hours I work in a week."

Microshifting could be particularly useful for parents and caregivers; Owl Labs' report found caregivers were roughly three times as likely to try microshifting as non-caregivers.

Theresa Robertson of Elkridge, Maryland, is one of them. Robertson says she juggled her work, including a former role as a project manager, with caregiving for her late husband, who had chronic health issues, for 25 years.

"To me, it was just making sure I didn't lose my job," she says. "I had to take care of my husband, and I had to work, so I had to figure it out."

That meant scheduling meetings around his doctors' appointments and starting some days early or ending others late to take him to those appointments, manage his medications and handle other caregiving responsibilities.

"We had a routine; after I got him settled, made sure he was dressed and he had his medicine and he had his food, then I could relax and focus on work," she says. "I had more control over my day where I could stop and decide, okay I need to check his blood pressure and then go back to work."

Some of her jobs during this period, like in project management, were more outcome-based so she was trusted to manage her time as long as she handled her work, she notes.

"As long as I got the job done on time and on budget, they weren't really looking at did I punch a clock to see was I in the building at 7 a.m." she says. "I've had so many Zoom meetings in hospital rooms because wherever I go I take my laptop and when I can work, I can work."

Today, Robertson runs a virtual assistant agency, which she says helps her continue to microshift. She sets her hours such that she's mostly free on Friday afternoons, for example, to tend to personal matters.

"I microshift all the time," she says. "That's the only way I'm able to have a life and produce an income."

Amid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. 

From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. 

"Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation," Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  "Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door."

Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. 

Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using "virtually worthless" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. 

While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. 

Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. 

That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an "escape valve" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  

"This was a violent repricing driven by fear," Li said. "As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight."

He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, "they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible," in an emergency situation, Li said. 

"That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack," he added.

The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  

Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.

"If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse," said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  

However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of "put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug," Campbell said.

And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. 

"When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option," Campbell said.

In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really "driverless" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel?

One startup is fully embracing it.

Vay is a Berlin-based startup founded by two engineers and a former Zoox employee.

The company is taking a somewhat contrarian approach to what it calls a "driverless car."

Instead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.

To do so, Vay wants to leverage remote-driving technology and, eventually, autonomy to deliver cars without humans inside to people who need a private vehicle for less than a day.

Thomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program.

"It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport," von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. "It's half the price of Uber and half the price of robotaxis. How it works: We just bring the car, you then drive, and then when you're done, you don't have to park."

Von der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. The Vay cofounder said he oversaw some of the first public testing of Zoox cars when there were safety drivers inside the vehicle.

At the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline.

"It always felt like it was three years out," he said of autonomous driving. "And then every year it shifted by a year. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. And then it was 2021 and so forth."

Von der Ohe left Zoox in 2018. Instead of fixating on robotaxis, von der Ohe wanted to stay in mobility but work on something that could be faster to bring to market and easier to scale with less capital. Vay was born.

Customers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. To rent a car, users have to upload a driver's license and a photo of themselves.

Vay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. If you're out of the service area, then you're out of luck.

Once the car is delivered, the renter takes over.

The startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said.

The Vay cofounder told Business Insider that the service area is about twice the size of San Francisco.

Inside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat.

A large red button to the left of the driver's seat activates an emergency protocol during which the car pulls over to the side of the road.

Vincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride.

"It's similar to kind of like a high-grade racing sim," Reddy said of the driving experience. "The thing that feels the most different is not having the feedback of what it feels like driving over bumps and things on the road because the seat doesn't move. There's no G-force, or you don't get the feeling of accelerating or braking."

To deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. The car can go on the highway once the customer takes over the vehicle.

There were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office.

Vay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber.

Von der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride.

Users are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym.

When Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25.

When asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure.

The CEO said he can keep the costs low because Vay's vehicle fleet doesn't have a complex sensor suite, and the remote operators manage multiple cars.

Von der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle.

"So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price," he said.

Vay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia.

While von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features.

"We're not in competition with them," von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators.

Since its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO.

He said the service has especially seen high demand during the Consumer Electronics Show.

When Von der Ohe opened the app, the wait time to get a car was 31 minutes.

"It's extremely busy today already," he said. "It's a long way. It should be five."

BEIJING — An Alibaba-backed AI startup is currently being valued at $4.8 billion in a fresh funding round, two people with knowledge of the deal said, just weeks after it was valued at $4.3 billion.

Moonshot AI is the company behind the Kimi chatbot, which surged in popularity in China months before DeepSeek's release last year.

Since Moonshot's previous in December, rival Chinese AI companies — Zhipu and MiniMax — surged after going public in Hong Kong.

The sources told CNBC that Moonshot was closing a funding round that will value it at least $500 million higher than the December round. The sources said the round would likely close soon due to high demand.

Both asked to remain anonymous while discussing private information. Moonshot AI had not responded to a request for comment as this article went live.

The sources added that the company could be valued even higher in subsequent rounds that could follow, due to a surge of interest in Chinese AI IPO candidates.

Chinese AI companies have particularly boomed as U.S. AI chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, aren't officially available in mainland China.

Beijing restricts access to many U.S.-based internet services, while American companies have faced growing restrictions from the White House on doing business with China.

The previous funding round was announced on Dec. 31. IDG, Alibaba and Tencent participated in it, according to Chinese financial news outlet LatePost.

Moonshot AI has not commented on any plans for an IPO.

Zhipu, listed under the name Knowledge Atlas, had a market value of $13 billion as of Monday's close, according to Wind Information data. MiniMax was worth $15.2 billion, the data showed.

In this article

DETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.

U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.

Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.

Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.

Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.

"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well," he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. "So, I believe it's a year of execution."

Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.

He said he believes the company should "stay together" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.

Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.

Investors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his "Dare Forward 2030" business plan.

U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. 

Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.

Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.

"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need," he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

Gold and silver surged to fresh highs just days after breaking previous records, as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid a choppy geopolitical and economic ‍outlook.

U.S. gold futures for February delivery rose 1.71% to $4,674.20 per ounce on Monday, after earlier hitting a record high last week. Spot gold was 1.6% higher at $4,668.14.

It comes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods from eight European countries until a deal for "the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," as he ramps up his rhetoric on annexing the Arctic island.

"Gold's rally has been powerful, but it has also been grounded in fundamentals that are still very much in place. With real rates likely to fall and central banks continuing to diversify their reserves, we see more reason for gold to consolidate or edge higher than to sell off sharply," George Cheveley, natural resources portfolio manager at Ninety One, said in the asset manager's 2026 sectoral outlook, published on Monday.

At current prices, margins are expected to be four to five times higher than in 2024, per the outlook. 

Silver followed gold's upward swing and looks comfortable at such prices. U.S. silver futures for March advanced to a record $93.035 per ounce and were last seen 5.06% higher at $93.02. Silver's spot price was 3.55% higher at $93.16 per ounce.

Gold and silver tend to perform well in periods of heightened uncertainty as riskier assets, such as equities, fall out of favor.

The tariffs over Greenland follow the U.S. capturing the Venezuelan president on Jan. 3 and taking control of the country's oil industry; and Trump suggesting a military strike against Iran was imminent amid that country's clampdown on civil unrest, only to appear to back down from the threat last week.

European and Asia-Pacific markets mostly slipped on Monday as investors assessed geopolitical threats. Shares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers and key luxury goods names fell on Monday morning as investors digest possible tariffs on European countries. Trump said these would be 10% from Feb. 1., rising to 25% from June 1 if no deal is done. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index was 2.2% lower in early dealmaking, while the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 index 2.9% lower.

European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader economic counter-measures. 

The Justice Department's criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may also be rattling markets as investors weigh up the long-term impact of Trump's war of words aimed at pressuring it to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, conflict in Ukraine persists and progress in Gaza is expected to take years.

Other base metals also gained but were driven by megatrends rather than geopolitics. Copper in particular has an "attractive" risk-reward profile thanks to demand from energy and data center infrastructure, per Cheveley.

U.S. copper futures for March were last seen 0.54% higher at $5.8625 per ounce, paring gains from a Jan. 6. peak.

In this article

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a rising wave of tariffs on several European allies, raising the alarm for industries and businesses across the region.

Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, a part of the United States. 

The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said. 

European political leaders are set to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response, with retaliatory measures and broader punitive economic policies reportedly on the table. 

CNBC takes a look at some of the sectors expected to be the most exposed to Trump's tariff threats.

Europe's car giants, which were hit hard by Trump's back-and-forth trade policies last year, are considered to be highly exposed once again.

The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. 

Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group were all trading more than 2.5% lower on Monday morning, with Milan-listed Stellantis last seen down by around 2.1%.

Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, said Trump's tariffs clearly represent a negative development for Germany's economic outlook, a country traditionally seen as Europe's growth engine.

"If we do get tariffs, and, of course, we have to see how the geopolitical situation pans out, then … the chemicals, industrials, autos sectors, these will be the most impacted, which directly feeds to German growth," Kumar told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday. 

Of the eight European countries threatened by Trump's Greenland tariffs, Germany, by far, enjoys the greatest trade surplus with the U.S., followed by France and the U.K., according to data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.

Luxury stocks were seen as largely sheltered from U.S.-EU trade tensions in the first quarter of last year, given their robust pricing power and ability to pass on added costs to consumers. 

Analysts warned at the time, however, that the prospect of tariffs ushering in a broader economic downturn could have spillover effects, even for the wealthiest shoppers. 

Alongside seven other European countries, Trump's proposed tariffs single out France, which is home to the likes of industry bellwether LVMH and Kering. 

Shares of LVMH and Kering fell around 3.5% and 2.6% on Monday morning. Luxury groups, including Switzerland's Richemont, Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, and Britain's Burberry, were also trading lower. 

Europe's pharma sector could face a significant impact from the proposed U.S. tariffs, given that medicines and pharma products represent the EU's largest export to the U.S. 

EU exports of pharma products to the U.S. came in at 84.4 billion euros ($98.1 billion) during the first three quarters of last year, ahead of machinery and mechanical parts (68.3 billion euros) and organic chemicals (66.3 billion euros) over the same period, according to Eurostat data. 

Some of the sector's biggest European names fell slightly on Trump's latest tariff threats on Monday morning.  

Denmark's Novo Nordisk was 2.1% lower, Switzerland's Roche dipped 0.3% lower, and France's Sanofi fell 0.9% during early deals. Swiss-based Novartis, meanwhile, traded 0.3% higher.  

Europe's oil and gas stocks could also be indirectly impacted by Trump's latest tariff threats, due to factors such as weaker global demand, lower crude prices and increased supply chain costs.

Oil prices were last seen trading slightly lower amid heightened concerns of a trade war between the U.S. and Europe — and what this could mean for global demand.

Norway's Equinor was among the energy stocks leading the sector's losses on Monday, down around 3.4%. France's TotalEnergies, Britain's Shell, and BP fell between 1% and 1.5%, respectively.

Ozan Özkural, founder and managing partner at Tanto Capital, said Trump's latest tariff threats should not have been unexpected, warning of a broad impact for European sectors.

"Welcome to 2026. I think this is going to be the sort of year that we are going to talk a lot more about what it means not to have the U.S. play ball with the traditional allies," Özkural told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday.

"It's going to have an impact on oil prices, commodity prices, equity markets, debt markets, private credit. You name it, we have it," Özkural said.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for cool heads as tensions rise between Washington and its European allies after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose fresh tariffs on a number of countries if they block his bid to buy the Arctic territory.

In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.

"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies," Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.

"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone," he added.

Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to "buy" Greenland.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland. The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU.

Over the weekend, Starmer said that the U.K.'s position on Greenland was clear, although he, like other European leaders, also looked to appease Trump by saying NATO allies should do more together to address Russian threats across the Arctic.

"Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes," Starmer said in a statement released by the British government on Saturday.

"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration," he added.

Trump contends that U.S. ownership of Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, would make the world safer and deter Russia and Chinese activity in the Arctic island. Moscow and Beijing have dismissed his claims while European leaders insist that Greenland's future is a matter for the island and Denmark.

European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory levies and wider economic counter-measures against the U.S. but the U.K. has traditionally held off from threatening counter-tariffs.

Starmer said again on Monday that the use of tariffs to resolve such an issue was "completely wrong" and was not "the right way to resolve differences within an alliance."A trade war is in no one's interest," he said.

Still, the PM is known to have a warm and friendly relationship with Trump, despite their political differences. 

The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.

"The U.K. and the U.S. are close allies and close partners. That relationship matters profoundly, not just to our security, but to the prosperity and stability that people here depend upon ... we're determined to keep that relationship strong, constructive and focused on results," Starmer said Monday.

But, at a time when "events are moving fast," he said that "what matters most is being clear about the values and motives that drive us."

"While we are pragmatic, we are resolute in defending those values when it matters."

European states are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened fresh export levies, deepening a rift over Greenland.

Trump announced Saturday that eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the mineral-rich island which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland. The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU. 

Regional diplomats held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday afternoon to discuss their response to Trump's threat to escalate tariffs, with France reportedly pushing for the EU to use its strongest economic counter-threat to the U.S., known as the "Anti-Coercion Instrument" (ACI).

The much-vaunted instrument is seen as a nuclear option when it comes to economic counter-measures as it could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region.

Despite being seen as a "big bazooka" against Trump's tariffs playbook, it has not been used before, and regional leaders have already said they want to pursue dialogue with the U.S. in the coming days to resolve the rift over Greenland.

The Financial Times reported that the EU was contemplating imposing 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of tariffs, as well as considering the use of the ACI. 

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the European Parliament will likely now suspend its work on the EU-U.S. trade deal struck last July. The assembly had been due to vote on removing many EU import duties on U.S. goods on Jan. 26-27, but that approval could now be delayed, Reuters reported.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure said Monday that the EU "must be prepared" to use its anti-coercion mechanism, in comments translated by Reuters.

While France is more gung-ho about the ACI, Germany is among the countries that have tended to shy away from using it before.

"The key question to watch is whether the EU will try to keep the confrontation confined to such a more "classic" trade war, or whether calls for a harsher line prevail," Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in emailed comments. 

"Representing the latter camp, France has called on its partners to formally invoke the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument ... [but] other EU member states, including Germany, will likely remain careful." 

The reasons for this divide are multifaceted, Nickel noted, including factors such as France traditionally advocating for a more independent European role in continental security, and it being less export-dependent than other nations like Germany.

European leaders were quick to react to Trump's surprise tariff threat, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that "applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong," while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as "unacceptable."

Nonetheless, leaders are expected to use the World Economic Forum taking place in Davos, Switzerland, this week, as an opportunity to try to talk to Trump, who is addressing the forum on Wednesday.

Economists warn that, much like last year when months of wrangling took place before a trade deal was signed between the U.S. and EU, this spring will likely be dominated by similarly thorny discussions over Greenland.

"My base case is that the Feb. 1 [tariffs] deadline is going to be postponed as diplomatic measures are implemented," Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, told CNBC Monday.

"That said, I think this is different from the usual TACO [Trump Always Chickens Out] trade. For Greenland, the position for Europe is very clear: it's not for sale, and they will not tolerate aggression ... But what Trump has shown is that he wants Greenland. I don't see how the issue is going to go away that soon. So we are looking at months, or potentially quarters, of uncertainty over tariffs."For Europe it's a negative. Growth will be reduced," he warned, ahead of what could be a frantic market day for European bourses on Monday, with regional indexes looking set to slump at the open.

If economic sanctions are designed to apply pressure without firing a shot, then U.S. President Donald Trump has aimed directly at America's closest military allies.

Trump said Saturday the U.S. will impose a 10% tariff on imports from eight NATO nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland — starting Feb. 1. 

Trump added that duties on those nations would rise to 25% on June 1 until "a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland."

European leaders moved quickly to condemn the move, calling it "unacceptable." After a meeting Sunday and broadly agreeing to dissuade Trump, EU officials are weighing retaliatory tariffs of as much as 93 billion euros ($108 billion) on U.S. goods, reported Reuters.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to address the Greenland-related tariffs in a speech later Monday, London time.

Beyond the immediate political fallout, the move threatens to derail the EU-U.S. trade agreement reached in August and risks the prospect of retaliation from Europe.

Duties slapped on European nations "could likely mean a significant E.U. pushback, where the E.U. could respond in kind, leading to a sort of trade war with the U.S.," Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at Alpine Macro, told CNBC over email before Trump announced the latest tariffs.

Until now, markets had largely taken geopolitical tensions in stride. Equity markets entered the year higher because disputes involving Greenland, Iran or Venezuela had not yet pulled in major economies or military partners, said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for Chicago-based Northern Trust Wealth Management, last week.

That calculus may be changing. By drawing European allies into the dispute, the tariffs increase the risk of greater market volatility. Major U.S. indexes were in the red for the week even before Trump's Greenland-related tariffs, signaling growing unease among investors.

All of this unfolds as the World Economic Forum begins today, Jan. 19, at Davos. World leaders will convene for talks on trade, security and geopolitical tensions, with Trump in attendance — and set to come face to face with leaders of several countries now in his tariff crosshairs.

Just barely four weeks into the year, and fault lines are already building. What emerges from the snowy peaks will, like an avalanche, have a disproportionate impact on those below.

— CNBC's Holly Ellyatt, Chloe Taylor and Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.

China's economic growth slows. Fourth-quarter growth came in at 4.5%, the weakest pace in nearly three years. However, economic output for the whole of 2025 was 5%, meeting Beijing's target of "around 5%."

'Very unlikely' for Supreme Court to overturn tariffs: Bessent. "I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos," Bessent said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." On Greenland tariffs, Bessent said they are a response to an emergency.

U.S.-Taiwan deal unlikely to shift balance. Analysts say expanded chip manufacturing in the U.S. will not significantly reduce Washington's reliance on Taiwan's production through the end of the decade.

Major U.S. indexes were mostly flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, fell 0.17% on Friday. Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1% on the release of mainland China economic data, but South Korea's Kospi bucked the trend to rise.

[PRO] Best-performing hedge funds in 2025. An annual ranking of hedge funds revealed that the industry reaped its largest-ever dollar gain last year, led by a single fund that delivered $18.9 billion to investors in 2025.

Global week ahead: Hopes that cooler heads can prevail in Davos

Over the years, I have seen many versions of Davos: the fall-out from the Great Financial Crisis and European debt crunch; the trading scandal that rocked French banking giant Societe Generale; the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic and now the upending of the world order that has been in place since the end of the Second World War.

Everyone has an opinion about this meeting, but one thing is true — it is never dull. And 2026 will certainly be no different. The tension between countries that call themselves allies is palpable going into this meeting.

LONDON — European stocks were lower on Monday as traders reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to hike tariffs on European countries if they oppose his bid to buy Greenland.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was preliminarily 1.23% lower the closing bell in London, with most sectors in negative territory.

The market slump comes after Trump announced on Saturday that eight European allies would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached that allows Washington to "buy" Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory that's part of Denmark.

Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland, Trump said. European leaders said the tariffs were "unacceptable" and vowed to stand behind Denmark.

European carmakers and the luxury goods sector were hit hard as investors reacted to the tariff proposals. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index was 2.22% lower. Volkswagen slumped about 2.82%, while Porsche fell 2.68%, paring some earlier losses, and BMW shed almost 3.74%.

Among the continent's luxury names, LVMH dropped 4.69%, Kering slipped 3.9%, Hermes tumbled 4.45% and Moncler was down by 1.98%. Overall, the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 closed the session 3.15% down.

In contrast, some of Europe's defense stocks rallied. Rheinmetall, the continent's largest defense company, traded 1.08% higher by the end of trading hours, while French tech and aerospace giant Thales added 0.73%. 

Elsewhere, ASM International's share price had a rocky day, having made morning gains but was lower by early afternoon. It rebounded and closed 0.81% higher. The Dutch computer chipmaker reported stronger-than-anticipated preliminary bookings of around 800 million euros ($930 million) for the fourth quarter, boosted by a rebound in Chinese orders and above forecasts of 669 million euros. Preliminary revenues came in at 698 million euros, outweighing LSEG poll estimates.

Shares of fellow chip name ASML were flat, having earlier dropped 3.6%. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker hit a record high last week. 

U.S. gold futures hit a 52-week high on Monday, advancing 1.7% to reach $4,673.30 an ounce, while spot gold prices were last seen at $4,672.66, a 1.69% rise.

Markets will be keeping a close eye on the World Economic Forum kicking off in Davos, Switzerland, this week. Trump is due to address the Forum on Wednesday.

There are no major earnings this week, though on the data front, eurozone inflation data is due.

China's birthrate fell to a record low last year, underscoring a deepening demographic crisis as Beijing struggles to reverse a shrinking and aging population. 

Births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023, marking the lowest level on record, according to data compiled by Wind Information going back to the 1950s.

About 7.9 million babies were born last year, sharply fewer than 9.5 million a year before, data from the statistics bureau showed Monday, despite Beijing's efforts to encourage larger families through widening subsidies and expanded parental leave. 

Even though the country began easing its stringent one-child policy nearly a decade ago, the birth rate continued to plummet — except for a brief spike in 2024, when it climbed to 6.77 per 1,000 people. The increase was widely attributed to the Year of the Dragon, which is traditionally considered an auspicious time to have children. 

"The pace of the decline is striking, particularly in the absence of  major shocks," said Yue Su, principal economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.

She added that the boost from fertility stimulus measures has faded, while young people are delaying marriage and child-bearing plans due to growing economic pressures and intensifying competition in workplaces.

Policymakers have rolled out various incentives, including cash rewards and tax breaks for households with children under age 3. Beijing has also extended the maternity leave to 158 days, from 98 days in 2024. 

China has faced a looming population crisis as its elderly population grew. The share of the population aged 60 and above rose to 23% in 2025, up from 22% in 2024.  

The population fell for a fourth year, declining by 3.4 million to 1.405 billion last year, according to the statistics bureau.

Economists warned that a shrinking workforce and an ageing population pose major economic risks. Fewer babies mean a shrinking workforce in the future to support a rapidly growing cohort of retirees, piling pressure on the already-stretched pension system. It could also force higher social security contributions, squeezing disposable income for younger workers.  

"A shrinking population implies a smaller consumer base in the future, increasing the risk of wider supply-demand imbalances," Su noted, calling for a more forceful policy response on fertility.  

World Bank data showed that the fertility rate, defined as births per woman, fell to 1 in China in 2023, the most recent year available, below the global average level of 2.2.

Gold and silver prices climbed fresh peaks on Monday, as investors flocked to safe-haven assets on intensifying tensions, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose extra tariffs on European countries over the control of Greenland.

Spot gold rose 1.5% to $4,663.37 per ounce by 0335 GMT, after scaling an all-time high of $4,689.39.

U.S. gold futures for Feb. delivery jumped 1.6% to $4,669.90 per ounce.

On Saturday, Trump vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark's vast Arctic island.

European Union ambassadors reached a broad agreement on Sunday to intensify efforts to dissuade Trump from imposing tariffs on European allies, while also preparing retaliatory measures should the duties go ahead, EU diplomats said.

"Geopolitical tensions have given gold bulls yet another reason to push the yellow metal to new highs," StoneX senior analyst Matt Simpson said.

"With Trump throwing tariffs into the mix, it is clear that his threat to Greenland is real, and that we could be one step closer to the end of NATO and political imbalances within Europe."

U.S. stock futures and dollar slid as Trump's latest tariff threats raised investors' appetite for safe-haven gold, yen and Swiss franc, in a broad risk-averse move across markets.

Non-yielding gold thrives in a low-interest-rate environment and during economic uncertainties.

Spot silver advanced 3.3% to $92.93 per ounce, after hitting a record high of $94.08.

"On silver, the medium-term narrative remains constructive, supported by persistent physical deficits, resilient industrial demand and safe-haven demand," said Christopher Wong, a strategist at OCBC.

"But the pace of the recent extension may warrant some near-term tactical caution," Wong said, noting that the gold-silver ratio declined sharply from highs near 105 in late 2025 to low-50s, signaling silver's outsized performance versus gold.

In other precious metals, spot platinum added 0.9% to $2,348.32 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.5% to $1,808.46 per ounce.

The U.S.-Taiwan deal aimed at expanding chip production capacity in the U.S. is unlikely to fully wean Washington off the island's most advanced semiconductors anytime soon, several analysts told CNBC, leaving the so-called "silicon shield" largely intact for now.

Taiwan dominates global chip production, with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company producing most of the world's advanced chips. Nearly one-third of global demand for new computing power is estimated to be fabricated in Taiwan.   

The island's central role in the global semiconductor supply chain has made preserving its de facto autonomy — and deterring any Chinese attack — a strategic priority for the U.S. and its allies, an idea referred to as the "Silicon Shield." Beijing claims territorial control over the democratically-governed island. 

As part of a trade deal struck Thursday, the Taiwanese government promised to guarantee $250 billion in credit to its chip and technology companies to expand their production capacity in the U.S. Taiwanese companies will also enjoy higher quotas for tariff-free imports of their chips into the U.S. 

In return, Washington would lower its levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, and waive tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically.

The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S., Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday. But experts doubt the plan would be easy, given Taipei's hard line on keeping its most advanced technology at home.

Taiwan's "silicon shield" will remain strong through the end of the decade, with the world's most critical advanced capacity concentrated on the island, said Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst at SemiAnalysis.

Taiwanese authorities restricted TSMC's overseas fabrication plants from operating technologies at least two generations behind those developed domestically, known as the N-2 rule.

While TSMC produces its most advanced chips using 2-nanometer technology, or nodes, at home, its Arizona plant has only recently begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers, with plans to scale up to 2-nanometer and A16 nodes by 2030. 

In semiconductor manufacturing, smaller nanometer sizes mean denser transistors, which boost processing speed and improve energy efficiency.

That four- to- five-year lag ensures Taiwan retains its advantage, said Kundojjala, adding that the global economy would face a "depression-level event if Taiwan were invaded tomorrow." 

A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said at a news conference Friday that Beijing "firmly opposed any agreements signed between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China," urging the U.S. to stick to the "one-China principle."  

Wendell Huang, CFO of TSMC, told CNBC on Thursday that the company will continue developing its most advanced technologies in Taiwan due to the need for "very intensive collaboration" between its domestic research and development teams and manufacturing operations. 

"We'll be sending hundreds of engineers back and forth [between] different sites in Taiwan. Therefore, it will stay in Taiwan when we ramp [up] the most leading-edge technology," Huang said. 

Still, the world's largest contract chipmaker has already pledged to invest $165 billion into chip fabrication and processing facilities in the U.S., along with a research and development lab, supplying customers such as Nvidia and Apple. 

Wu Cheng-wen, who oversees Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, told the Financial Times last year that it was crucial for Taiwan to keep its cutting-edge research and development at home and ensure that the domestic industry would not be "hollowed out."

"If we move our R&D overseas, it'll be dangerous for us," Wu said in the interview. 

Shifting chip production away from Taiwan will be difficult, analysts said. 

Taiwan's engineering talent pipeline and production capabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, especially in advanced fabrication, are "not replicable at scale anywhere else," said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

The lack of trained workers and higher production costs have led to delays in TSMC's U.S. plant openings, Reinsch said, adding that the new trade deal does little to address these constraints. He expects fulfilment of the pledged investment commitments to take longer than expected and is unlikely to reach the promised level. 

"The semiconductor ecosystem cannot be relocated overnight, so the silicon shield may weaken but still exist in the near term," said Dennis Lu-Chung Weng, an associate professor of political science at Sam Houston State University. 

"The bigger question is what happens after Trump: if future U.S. administrations keep pushing for large-scale relocation, Taiwan losing its exclusive advantage becomes less a question of if and more a question of when," Weng cautioned.

Taiwanese officials have stressed the need to diversify its economic model, encourage more industries to grow, and bolster its defense capabilities to counter China's military pressure. 

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan remains a low-possibility event, and the trade deal is unlikely to change Beijing's calculus, said Ava Shen, a Taiwan and Chinese foreign policy expert at Eurasia Group. The mainland authorities would focus more on their military balance vis-à-vis the U.S. and the level of American defense support for Taipei, Shen said.

Billionaires' wealth has risen sharply to a record high of $18.3 trillion — with the super-rich seeking power "for their own gain," according to a report by the global charity Oxfam released Monday.

The number of billionaires reached more than 3,000 last year, and collectively they saw their fortunes increase by 16%, or $2.5 trillion, the report said. 

Added to this, billionaires' wealth has surged by 81% since 2020, the charity said, describing the past  as "a good decade for billionaires."

And while the rich have become richer, poverty reduction has slowed, with levels "broadly where they were in 2019," according to a news release from the charity.

Oxfam also said the super-rich often use their wealth to secure political power as well as media ownership, noting billionaire Elon Musk's involvement in the U.S. administration at the start of 2025, Jeff Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post and billionaire Vincent Bollore's acquisition of French news site CNews.

"The outsized influence that the super-rich have over our politicians, economies and media has deepened inequality and led us far off track on tackling poverty," said Oxfam's Executive Director Amitabh Behar in the charity's report, titled "Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power."

The charity has released inequality reports to coincide with the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, every year since 2014. Last year, Oxfam predicted the world would see at least five trillionaires within a decade and called for global tax policies to ensure the rich pay their fair share.

This year, "Davos," which starts on Monday, will host around 65 heads of state and 850 CEOs, with U.S. President Donald Trump set to address delegates on Wednesday.

"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is ... creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable," Behar said.

"Governments are making wrong choices to pander to the elite and defend wealth while repressing people's rights and anger at how so many of their lives are becoming unaffordable and unbearable," Behar said.  

In 2025, Trump's "big beautiful bill" introduced several tax breaks for the wealthy, with those earning $1 million-plus seeing about a 3% income boost. 

Meanwhile, most Americans can no longer afford a "minimal quality of life," according to a 2023 report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. About 10% of Americans lived in poverty in 2024 according to U.S. census data published in September.

Oxfam called on governments to make national inequality reduction plans, tax the super-rich to reduce their power and prioritize stronger "firewalls" between politics and wealth as well as provide stronger protection for freedom of expression.

The report comes as more than 2,500 people have been killed in Iran since protests against a long-running economic crisis began last month. Last year saw more than 140 "significant" anti-government protests in 68 countries, Oxfam said, which authorities "typically met with violence." 

"Being economically poor creates hunger. Being politically poor creates anger," Behar said. 

Rich nations are "cutting aid further and faster than before," Oxfam's report stated. These cuts, including the closure of USAID, could lead to an additional 14 million deaths by 2030, the charity said.

In my early 30s, I was working long hours as the editor in chief of a magazine, juggling deadlines and the looming "should we have kids?" question — all while feeling completely wrung out. I drafted a resignation email.

When my boss called me in, she surprised me: "Take some time off," she said. "Come back to manage a new launch later this year."

My plan for a year off collapsed into two months.

It began quietly in India at a yoga retreat near Kerala and ended with an adventure in Indonesia, climbing Mount Bromo and motorbiking through Yogyakarta.

It wasn't a true gap year, but it was long enough to reset. The next year, I stepped into my boss's role, leading the creative team I'd almost left behind.

That experience made me realize that time off doesn't have to derail a career — it can redefine it.

I wasn't a student with few obligations or a 20-something who hadn't settled on a career path. I was an established professional stepping away when the stakes were high.

Extended time off can carry long-term costs — lower earnings, disrupted savings, slower compounding — but for some, the benefits outweigh the risks.

David Burkus, an organizational psychologist and author, began researching sabbaticals in 2015.

"People report better mental and physical health, increased confidence, and a greater sense of purpose after an extended break," Burkus told Business Insider.

He also notes the benefits for employers: Teams cross-train, share knowledge, and become less dependent on a few "indispensable" people.

Paid sabbaticals are still a rarity in the US. Society for Human Resource Management data showed that 5% of companies offered them in 2019, rising to 7% by 2023.

And despite employers not rolling them out broadly, employees are increasingly seeking time off. In SHRM's 2025 benefits survey, leave was the second-highest priority for workers — trailing only health benefits — for the fourth year in a row.

A peer-reviewed study published in the Academy of Management in 2022 interviewed 50 professionals who had taken extended time off. All interviewees said they came back as better leaders.

DJ DiDonna, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and coauthor of the study, says everyone he interviewed wished they had taken one earlier.

DiDonna told Business Insider that the best times for a sabbatical often coincide with natural life transitions, like a honeymoon, a newly empty nest, or the "twilight career" stage before retirement.

This collection brings together people who took that pause at different ages, for different reasons, and for vastly different lengths of time.

Oops, something went wrong

The price of Bitcoin dropped to $0 on perps decentralized exchange Paradex overnight, according to numerous users, after a database migration issue affected the Paradex blockchain, its block explorer, bridge, and API. 

An issue was first flagged on the Paradex status page at 12:36 a.m, ET on Monday, shortly after social media posts flagged a cascade of liquidations as the price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on the exchange. 

Around 2:00 a.m. ET, the exchange identified the issue and began instituting a fix that resulted in rolling back the state of Paradex Chain, a blockchain built using the Starknet stack. Starknet is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.

“We have identified the issue and will be rolling back chain state to block 1604710,” the status update reads. “This is the time before the DB maintenance and is the last known correct state. All accounts will be restored to the state before the DB maintenance. We will provide more updates as we continue with rollback.”

Shortly thereafter, Paradex force-cancelled all remaining open orders, and around 5:00 a.m. ET it confirmed that all user funds were safe as its recovery process was ongoing.

“Recovery efforts are ongoing. We can confirm that all user funds are SAFU,” a post on the status page at 5:16 a.m. ET reads. 

It's still unclear how much the liquidations tallied up to, but data from DeFiLlama indicates that the perps protocol has around $641 million in open interest. The protocol has facilitated around $37 billion in volume over the last 30 days. 

All Paradex services are now operational, according to an update on the status page.

Bitcoin Slips On Trade War Fears, Sparks $865M in Liquidations

The exchange's price glitch followed a volatile period of trading for BTC, which dropped from more than $95,000 to $92,284 just after 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The 2% drop in the last 24 hours has eaten into the top crypto asset's weekly gain, which now stands at 1.4% with BTC recently changing hands at $93,318. 

The slide triggered a growing number of liquidations, which have now extended to more than $875 million over the last 24 hours—$234 million of which can be attributed to Bitcoin, according to data from CoinGlass.

The Ethereum (ETH) 4-hour chart is flashing warning signs as price hovers around a critical support zone. After months of sideways trading, ETH remains trapped in a consolidation, signaling weakening momentum amid uncertain broader market conditions. According to a crypto analyst, ETH's 4-hour chart suggests that the cryptocurrency could be heading for a major price dump if buyers fail to regain control. 

Ethereum Price Chart Signals Major Crash Ahead

A new market analysis by crypto expert Tyrex draws attention to a 4-hour chart, warning that ETH may be preparing for another price crash. Tyrex noted that Ethereum recently bottomed inside the purple rectangle on the lower timeframe, where price dipped below a key support around $3,260, briefly triggering a liquidity sweep. The move, however, was quickly reversed, indicating it was a fakeout rather than a true bearish breakdown.

Even after the rejection, the analyst revealed that Ethereum's broader 4-hour pattern remains largely unchanged. He stated that ETH has also repeatedly returned to the same support area, raising concerns that demand may be weakening. Notably, when price keeps revisiting the same lows, it often signals growing pressure, not strength. 

On the chart, Ethereum is now consolidating just above the highlighted support zone. Momentum has slowed compared to the earlier impulsive rally, and the price is still struggling to gain upward traction. Instead of continuation, the market appears to be hesitating at a critical area.

 According to Tyrex, this hesitation could be a major risk. Repeatedly retesting the same lows makes the market more vulnerable, increasing the likelihood of a deeper price dump. Notably, each retest makes it easier for sellers to break through support as buyers gradually lose control. 

The analyst's chart also outlines a potential path lower if support gives way. A drop beneath the purple zone would put Ethereum at risk of sliding toward the next downside area between $3,209 and $3,221. At the time of Tyrex's analysis, ETH was trading around $3,312, which means a move to this range would have represented a roughly 3% decline.

However, as of writing, Ethereum has dropped to $3,200–which is already below the analyst's initial breakdown target. This suggests that upward momentum has weakened further, and the recent price drop could signal an even larger decline, according to Tyrex's analysis. 

Analyst Recommends A “Wait And See” Approach

While the Ethereum price navigates bearish trends, Tyrex has advised investors and targets to adopt a wait-and-see approach. He indicated that ETH's outlook is not entirely bearish. According to him, if Ethereum can hold above $3,230, it would shift his bearish bias to a cautiously bullish one. 

Maintaining that level suggests buyers are defending the range and preventing further downside. In that scenario, ETH could stabilize and potentially climb toward $3,420, as highlighted by the green zone on the chart.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has argued that modern DAO design is “inefficient, vulnerable to capture, and fails utterly at the goal of mitigating the weaknesses of human politics.”

In a tweet, Buterin said he once believed that systems of code and rules existing on decentralized networks could “manage resources and direct activity more efficiently and more robustly” than conventional governments and corporations.

We need more DAOs - but different and better DAOs.

The original drive to build Ethereum was heavily inspired by decentralized autonomous organizations: systems of code and rules that lived on decentralized networks that could manage resources and direct activity, more…

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 19, 2026



However, he claimed that since Ethereum's founding, DAOs in practice have drifted toward “essentially referring to a treasury controlled by token-holder voting.” This, he argued, leaves them open to control by centralized actors and has made many observers cynical about DAOs as a concept.

“We need more DAOs – but different and better DAOs,” Buterin wrote.

Among the solutions he proposed were improvements to the oracles that power DAOs and DeFi protocols. In crypto, blockchain oracles connect blockchains to external real-world systems, enabling smart contracts to execute by bridging on-chain and off-chain data. Buterin criticized both token-based oracles and human curation, calling the latter “not very decentralized.”

Buterin identified two core problems that he thinks must be solved for DAOs to function effectively: privacy and decision fatigue.

“Without privacy, governance becomes a social game,” he said.

He said modern technology could open “the door to a renaissance” in terms of solving the above problems, specifically the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy. In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof is a method used to prove that something is known without revealing the known information directly, which can be useful for privacy-centric applications.

Buterin also highlighted the ability of AI to reduce decision fatigue, but warned against putting a mainstream large language model like OpenAI's GPT or China's DeepSeek in charge of a DAO.

Zero-knowledge specialist Harry Halpin, CEO and co-founder of mix network Nym Technologies and a former research scientist at MIT, told Decrypt that the technology could help DAOs function more fairly.

"DAOs are the future of democratic politics, and just as we don't want our votes for president in a national election to be public, we don't want our votes in token governance to be public either," Halpin said, adding that, "Zero-knowledge proofs are one way to achieve that."

Halpin acknowledged that zero-knowledge DAOs are not yet “technically mature”, but said Nym would be happy to adopt them once the software is ready. Halpin pointed to projects such as AnonDAO, a project associated with privacy-centric Layer-1 blockchain DarkFi, as proof that private DAO governance is feasible in practice.

Members of the DarkFi project told Decrypt they were inspired by the AssangeDAO project, which helped to raise over $50 million for Australian political activist Julian Assange.

Rachel Rose O'Leary, a founder and core developer at DarkFi, told Decrypt that “transparency forced us to hand control of the funds to an off-chain nonprofit foundation,” during her work on AssangeDAO.

"DAOs cannot do real shit without anonymity," she told Decrypt. "Give DAOs anonymity and you give them real political power."

Key Takeaways:

A sudden and violent sell-off of the crypto market occurred, destroying more than $100 billion of the total market value in half a day. Mega assets shifted down almost at the same time, indicating a general de-risking action and not a specific failure of a single token



The global crypto market cap dropped sharply over a 12-hour window, erasing roughly $100 billion as sellers took control across large-cap and mid-cap tokens. Data from heatmap indicated that there was a close-to-global sea of red with Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP and Solana recording significant losses.

Bitcoin fell about 2.5% – 3%, taking the rest of the market along. Ethereum was the next in line as it lost over 3%, whereas XRP and Solana had even greater losses within the day. Smaller-cap altcoins experienced greater declines with liquidity drying up and stop-losses being called.

The speed of the move stood out. What began as a controlled pullback quickly turned into a cascade, suggesting that positioning and leverage played a major role in the scale of the decline.

Bitcoin was the main trigger when it was not able to maintain significant short-term support areas. When BTC fell under closely monitored amounts, the selling force escalated in both spot and derivatives markets.

Any traders who had hedged a higher continuation were compelled to undo. This formed a market of its own where declining prices spawned liquidations, which further pushed the prices down.

The fact that Bitcoin could not recover higher weekly closes contributed to the bearish momentum. A failed close can be viewed as an indicator by short-term traders to minimize exposure, particularly when the overall macro environment is in question.

Altcoins were a swift succession of Bitcoin. Ether fell over 3%, which was indicative of risk aversion across the market, as well as less interest in leveraged trades. XRP has been dropping nearly 4% and Solana by more than 6%, which is not doing well compared with the majors.

Correlations between crypto assets had gone up drastically during the sell-off. This is common when markets are under stress, diversification benefits are going to disappear and traders are viewing crypto as a risk bucket.

Even smaller percentage losses were experienced by smaller tokens. The thinness of order books and low depth of bids exposed the prices to abrupt sell orders, particularly during the off-peak hours.

Bitcoin and gold have split in recent months as gold soars and the bitcoin price plummets—with U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff trade war again threatening to weigh on the U.S. dollar.

The bitcoin price has fallen sharply overnight, dropping from almost $96,000 per bitcoin to just over $90,000 in a matter of minutes, while gold hit a fresh all-time high after Trump threatened to escalate tariffs on eight Nato allies unless Denmark agreed to a deal for Greenland.

Now, as Bank of America's chief executive issues a stark $6 trillion crypto warning, traders are braced for this week's inflation reading to be higher than previously expected—triggering warnings of "unprecedented stagflation."

Economists at Barclays and Morgan Stanley have increased their December U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) forecasts to 2.8% or 2.9%, while BNP Paribas's Andy Schneider wrote in a note seen by Reuters that the reading will be "significantly" higher than last week's 2.7% consumer price index (CPI).

The latest PCE data, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and energy prices, will be released on Thursday, potentially reviving fears of so-called stagflation that sees sluggish economic growth combined with soaring prices.

“A coming collapse in the dollar will send consumer prices soaring,” Peter Schiff, a gold investor who is typically bearish on the dollar and critical of bitcoin, posted to X. “Get ready for unprecedented stagflation.”

Ahead of the latest inflation reading, the U.S. dollar has weakened as last year's so-called debasement trade—which saw investors bet against the dollar and pile into scarce assets like bitcoin, gold, silver and copper alongside stocks—returned.

"President Trump's fresh tariff threat to his trading partners and Nato allies over Greenland led to a U.S. dollar selloff," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “The Dollar Index snapped sharply lower to trade back under 99.00, having hit a six-week high at the end of last week.”

Gold and silver have both hit record highs as the U.S. dollar declined, with David Wilson, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas, telling Bloomberg that gold at $5,000 per ounce “looked like a big target” not that long ago, but is now within sight.

Meanwhile, traders are betting bitcoin price weakness continues due to the geopolitical uncertainty weighing on risk appetite.

“From here, it's likely we'll see further downside unless buyers step in, with strong support around $88,000,” Nic Puckrin, digital asset analyst and co-founder of the Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments, adding “the uncertainty and fears around Greenland are likely to get worse before they get better.”

India's RBI wants BRICS to link CBDCs like the e-rupee and digital yuan by 2026, creating a shared rail for trade and tourism that bypasses dollar-based systems.

The Reserve Bank of India has proposed a plan to interconnect the central bank digital currencies of all BRICS nations to streamline cross-border trade and tourism through direct digital settlement.

The statement, reported in Reuters, states that India's central bank hopes to link other BRICS nations via a common digital currency. 

The RBI has recommended that the Indian government place the initiative on the formal agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is scheduled to host later this year, the report stated. The proposal would mark the first coordinated effort to link sovereign digital currencies, including India's e-rupee and China's digital yuan, within a shared, multilateral framework, if adopted.

The proposal aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in international settlements, according to the RBI. By enabling direct payments in local CBDCs, BRICS members could settle trade and tourism flows without routing transactions through dollar-based correspondent banking systems. The central bank stated that such a system would improve efficiency by eliminating intermediaries, lowering settlement delays, and reducing transaction costs.

The proposal follows recent geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. RBI officials referenced recent tariff threats and criticism of BRICS from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has described the bloc as “anti-American,” according to the report. The central bank has positioned a shared CBDC infrastructure as a tool for economic resilience, allowing member states to insulate trade flows from external political pressure.

Implementation would require consensus on technical interoperability standards and governance rules across the member countries. The challenge has grown more complex as BRICS has expanded to include newer members such as the UAE, Iran, and Indonesia, the report noted.

One mechanism under discussion involves bilateral foreign-exchange swap lines between participating central banks to address potential trade imbalances, according to the RBI. The central bank continues to emphasize the e-rupee's role as a regulated alternative to private stablecoins, which it views as posing risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

As of January 2026, India's e-rupee has reached approximately 7 million retail users, while China is actively promoting international use of its digital yuan, according to the report. Brazil, Russia, and South Africa are all operating advanced CBDC pilot programs.

The RBI's proposal could become a foundational step toward a BRICS-wide digital settlement layer if endorsed at the 2026 summit, potentially reshaping how emerging economies conduct cross-border trade, the report stated.

Indie game developer Oxalis Games has decided to shift direction for their upcoming cozy role-playing game, Moonfrost, by moving away from using web3 and NFTs. The studio is now focusing on delivering a "handcrafted, premium" experience, with plans to launch on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

Along with this change, there has been a shift in the company's leadership. Gina Nelson has stepped up as the sole CEO after previously co-leading with fellow co-founder Ric Moore until July 2024. Nelson had been the Chief Operating Officer for over five years prior to this change.



Ric Moore announced his departure from his role at the company via LinkedIn, explaining that he stepped down after Nelson expressed her desire to lead the company independently. According to Companies House records, Moore was removed as a director on December 31, 2025, but he remains connected to Oxalis as an advisory board member and is identified as a significant stakeholder, alongside Nelson.

CEO Gina Nelson commented on the decision to move away from NFTs, stating, “We chose a path that didn't suit Moonfrost and listened closely to our community. Those who are passionate about cozy games seek enriching worlds and impactful progression, not NFTs. Therefore, we're fully committed to building Moonfrost in line with these beliefs.”

Nelson further explained that while web3 communities are often focused on earning and speculation, this was not the foundation on which Moonfrost was built. The game aims to create a welcoming environment for players, beyond farming or adventures, and is intended for the premium PC gaming market.

The studio has also explored AI tools but is committed to emphasizing craftsmanship. Nelson stated, "Moonfrost is crafted by individuals down to the pixel and system, with an original soundtrack that immerses players in its world. It's deliberate, hands-on work, and we're proud of it. Our human touch distinguishes us in a landscape of automated content."

Oxalis Games was established in August 2020 and initially raised $4.5 million in seed funding with support from investors such as Blocore, Supercell, Animoca Brands, Griffin Gaming Partners, Sir Ian Livingstone, and Phil Mansell, then CEO of Jagex. More recently, they secured an additional $2 million in late 2025, led by L1D and Arete Capital.

Co-CEO and co-founder Ric Moore has stepped down, Gina Nelson is now the studio's sole chief executive

Indie developer Oxalis Games is changing direction on upcoming cosy RPG, Moonfrost, ditching web3 and NFTs.

The company now says it is focused on releasing the game as a "handcrafted, premium" release and is targeting Steam and the Epic Games Store when it comes to launch.

This news also comes alongside a change in leadership at the company; Gina Nelson is now Oxalis Games' sole CEO, having previously shared the role with fellow co-founder Ric Moore as of July 2024. Before that, she spent five and a half years as COO.

Moore announced his departure from the studio on LinkedIn, saying that he had stepped down after Nelson "expressed a desire to run the company on her own".

Companies House has him being removed as a director as of December 31, 2025, but he has remained at Oxalis as an advisory board member, adding that he is still a "major stakeholder"; on Companies House, he is still a person with significant control, alongside Nelson.

“We tried a path that didn't fit Moonfrost,” Nelson said.

“And we heard you - loudly and clearly. The communities that truly care about cozy games want rich worlds, meaningful progression, and a safe, welcoming place to escape into. They don't want NFTs. So we're closing that chapter completely and building Moonfrost the way it should always have been."

She added: “Web3 communities are often shaped around earning and speculation. That isn't a foundation for the kind of game we're making. We've built Moonfrost with an enormous amount of care and passion, because it's meant to feel like a world players can truly come home to. It's about more than farming or adventuring, and it belongs in the premium PC space.”

Nelson also said that while Oxalis has "explored AI tools", the studio will be focusing on "doubling down on craft"

"Moonfrost is made by people - pixel by pixel, system by system - with a beautiful original soundtrack that pulls you into the world," she said. "It's intentional, hands-on work, and we're proud of that. We have no interest in replacing our team, and I believe the human touch is what will stand out in a sea of low-effort, automated content."

Oxalis Games was founded in August 2020. Two years later, the company attracted $4.5 million in seed funding led by Blocore, but also including names including Supercell, Animoca Brands, Griffin Gaming Partners, and Sir Ian Livingstone and then-Jagex CEO Phil Mansell. The company has since attracted another $2 million in a late 2025 funding round led by L1D and Arete Capital.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed linking the official digital currencies of BRICS nations to make cross-border trade and tourism payments smoother, reported news agency Reuters, citing two officials familiar with the matter.

According to the report, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that the government place the proposal on the agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, which India will host later this year.

If accepted, it would mark the first formal attempt to link the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) of BRICS members, a move that could reduce dependence on the US dollar at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.

The BRICS grouping includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, along with newer members such as the UAE, Iran and Indonesia.

Any initiative to operationalise digital settlements among these nations is likely to draw scrutiny from Washington, especially as US President Donald Trump has previously labelled BRICS “anti-American” and threatened tariffs on member countries.

The RBI, the Indian government, and several BRICS central banks either declined to comment or said they had no information to share, the Reuters report added.

The proposal expands on a 2025 declaration at the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, which encouraged interoperability between members' payment systems to improve cross-border efficiency.

India has repeatedly spoken of its interest in linking the digital rupee with other nations' CBDCs to speed up cross-border settlements and support greater use of the Indian currency globally.

Although none of the BRICS members have fully launched their CBDCs, all five core economies are running pilots. India's e-rupee has gathered about seven million retail users since its introduction in December 2022, while China has been pushing for wider international use of its digital yuan.

The RBI has also enabled offline payments, programmability for government subsidies and fintech wallet integration to encourage adoption.

For BRICS currency linkages to work, a shared framework for technology, governance, and settlement of trade imbalances will be essential, one official told Reuters. Differences over which technology to use or which country's platform to rely on could slow progress, making consensus critical.

One option being explored involves bilateral foreign exchange swap lines between central banks to settle transactions on a weekly or monthly basis. This may help avoid the kind of imbalance that emerged when Russia accumulated large amounts of rupees after India imported Russian goods but could not offer equivalent exports in return.

The broader BRICS project has regained attention amid Trump's revived tariff threats and geopolitical realignments. India's ties with Russia and China have strengthened economically even as New Delhi faces trade frictions with Washington.

However, the bloc's effort to create a common BRICS currency has been shelved, and global enthusiasm for CBDCs has been tempered by the rapid spread of stablecoins.

Indian officials remain wary of stablecoins, which the RBI argues could undermine monetary stability and fragment the payments ecosystem. Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar recently said CBDCs offer a safer alternative because they avoid risks associated with privately issued digital tokens.

India's proposal to link BRICS digital currencies now sets the stage for what could become one of the most consequential financial discussions at this year's summit, potentially reshaping how emerging economies settle trade and challenge the dominance of the US dollar.- EndsPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 19, 2026Tune InMust Watch

Synergy Week 3 in Kaidro's play-to-acquire ecosystem is currently enticing players to strategically optimize their NFT lockups. This event, spanning from January 18 to January 24, 2026, leverages a detailed synergy system where players must configure their NFT sets to boost reward outcomes.

KAIDRO P2A UPDATE! 🐉The grind continues and the stakes are higher than ever. Synergy Week 3 has officially begun!Are you pushing for the top… or settling for your current rank? 👀  🗓 Start Date: January 18, 2026 | 12:00 AM UTC 🗓 End Date: January 24, 2026 | 12:00 AM… pic.twitter.com/8bksH2tT7N

Participants in Kaidro's Synergy Week 3 can capitalize on the synergy system that calculates two main outputs: Rank Points and Kalodium ($KALO). To generate these rewards, players must lock in a set of three NFTs from the same clan, keeping the locked setup for the entire week to obtain maximum points. Specifically, for every 5 Rank Points accumulated from these synergies, players are rewarded with 1 $KALO.

To garner optimal benefits, players are prompted to keep their strategic NFT sets locked from the start of the week at midnight GMT on a Sunday to just before midnight on the following Saturday. Adjustments or changes to the active NFT set during the week could decrease the full potential earnings compared to maintaining a steady set throughout the entire period.

The pricing for creating Synergy Slots in Kaidro employs a tiered model to encourage a broader investment in diverse NFT combinations. The cost for each additional slot decreases progressively; starting at 1 RON or 1 AKDR for the first slot, and going down to 0.1 RON or AKDR for the fifth slot onwards.

The gaming mechanics demand strict adherence to the rules for the NFT lockups to be deemed valid. Each assembled lockup must contain exactly three NFTs from the same clan, with daily scores derived from systematically calculating tier values and bonus multipliers, ensuring fairness in reward distribution.

Besides the principal Synergy feature, Kaidro's ecosystem also integrates additional player engagement tools such as the Spin Wheel and Quests. These components aim to keep players actively involved and accumulating Rank Points consistently throughout the monthly cycle.

Synergy Week 3 kicked off on January 18, 2026, capturing considerable interest in Kaidro's gaming community. The event signifies a pivotal period where players can delve into intensive strategic play, configuring and maintaining ideal NFT sets to optimize their rewards before the event concludes on January 24, 2026.

Bitcoin traded near $93,200 (roughly Rs. 84.7 lakh) on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market remained range-bound amidst cautious investor sentiment. The world's largest cryptocurrency was priced around $93,200 (roughly Rs. 84.7 lakh), based on today's market data. Analysts said recent profit-taking and macro uncertainty are driving consolidation at lower levels. Ethereum (ETH) was trading near $3,200 (roughly Rs. 2.9 lakh), holding steady alongside Bitcoin, signalling continued confidence in the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin is currently priced around Rs. 84.7 lakh in India, while Ethereum trades near Rs. 2.9 lakh, as per today's Gadgets 360 price tracker.

According to market participants, Bitcoin is currently trading in the low-$90,000 range (about Rs. 81.86 lakh) as investors continue to exercise caution anticipating impending US inflation data and Federal Reserve remarks that may cause interest rate expectations to be reset. Analysts added that the absence of ETF trading during the US holiday period has kept institutional flows muted, reinforcing the lack of near-term directional conviction.

Altcoins traded mixed on Monday. Binance Coin (BNB) was priced around $926.25 (roughly Rs. 84,200), while Solana (SOL) traded near $133.80 (roughly Rs. 12,170). XRP hovered around $1.97 (roughly Rs. 179), and Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading close to $0.12 (roughly Rs. 10.91).

Highlighting near-term trading trends, Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst at Mudrex, said, “The market is seeing a bout of near-term profit taking, with Bitcoin hovering around $92,500 (roughly Rs. 84.13 lakh) and Ethereum near $3,200 (roughly Rs. 2.91 lakh). Data shows a spike in short-term holder deposits, with roughly 41,800 BTC moving to exchanges in the last day, driving short-term swings. Despite this, the underlying trend remains healthy [...] Added confidence comes from Strategy indicating continued buying interest.”

Sharing his outlook, Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO of Pi42, said, “Ethereum's steady participation alongside Bitcoin signals continued confidence in the broader digital asset ecosystem. For investors, this is a time to stay disciplined, focus on long-term conviction, stagger allocations rather than chase short-term moves, and align exposure with assets that have strong network activity and liquidity. 

Commenting on broader market conditions, Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus.com, said, “On-chain data suggests this is a consolidation phase rather than one of panic selling. Buyers are consistently defending the $90,000 (roughly Rs. 81.86 lakh) support zone even as rallies face resistance near the $93,000–$95,000 (roughly Rs. 84.56 lakh–Rs. 86.41 lakh) area. For investors, this is a time to avoid chasing short-term moves. As long as key supports hold, staggered accumulation and disciplined position sizing make more sense than aggressive trading in a macro-driven market.”

Overall, Bitcoin's ability to hold above the $90,000 (roughly Rs. 81.86 lakh) support zone and attempt a move toward the $96,100 (roughly Rs. 87.41 lakh) resistance will remain central to near-term direction.

              Highlights            



                        Crypto payments are moving closer to scale as WalletConnect works to hide blockchain complexity from merchants and payment providers.                      


                        Stablecoins are emerging as the practical bridge between crypto wallets and real-world commerce, especially when paired with instant settlement.                      


                        The WalletConnect-Ingenico partnership extends crypto payments into physical retail without forcing merchants to hold digital assets.

Cryptocurrency payments have spent years hovering at the edge of mainstream commerce.

Now, momentum is building as infrastructure providers focus less on blockchains and more on making digital currency usable at scale.

WalletConnect Pay CEO Jess Houlgrave said the long road to adoption reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what payments actually require.

“People conflate what settlement is and what a payment is,” she said during a PYMNTS TV interview. “Blockchains are really great for settling value and for moving value, but all of the other pieces of a payment—all of the messaging and the complicated bits—are not really designed for a blockchain ecosystem.”

That gap, described by the CEO as the “messy middle” of payments, includes authorization, capture, refunds and disputes. Houlgrave said those elements explain why crypto payments have struggled to move beyond experimentation.

Stablecoins have emerged as the most practical crypto asset for payments, especially as wallets increasingly link to traditional card rails.

“A number of crypto wallets have now linked Visa and Mastercard to those wallets, and the transaction volumes have shot through the roof during 2025,” Houlgrave said.

Card-based stablecoin volume reached roughly $500 million in December, growing rapidly month over month, even if still small in the context of global payments, she said. But those transactions still rely on Visa and Mastercard infrastructure.

WalletConnect Pay is designed to move more of the transaction onto crypto rails. Users want choice, like the ability to pay with the wallet and assets they already trust, without worrying about chains, swaps or bridges, she said.

Crypto fragmentation remains a central challenge.

“Crypto is super fragmented,” Houlgrave said. “You have different blockchains, different wallets, different assets. Even stablecoins alone have been the top topic in crypto, and there are hundreds of different stablecoins and new ones launching every day.”

For merchants, that fragmentation creates operational and regulatory hurdles. WalletConnect Pay keeps choice with the consumer while standardizing areas regulators care about most, she said.

“When we think about information capture, privacy, who has what kind of information and how we share that, of course, that needs to be standardized,” she said.

A core objective is to shield merchants and payments companies from crypto complexity altogether.

“The payments company and the merchant shouldn't even need to know about any of this stuff,” Houlgrave said. “They should just be able to serve this as an offering.”

WalletConnect positions itself as an orchestration layer, handling compliance, sanctions screening and off-ramping.

“Our job is to remove the complexity,” she said.

That philosophy underpins WalletConnect's new partnership with Ingenico. The integration enables stablecoin payments directly at physical checkout using Ingenico's Android payment terminals.

Merchants can accept supported stablecoins without new hardware and without holding digital currencies on their balance sheets.

“What we're doing with WalletConnect is trying to be that messaging layer that sits alongside the settlement,” Houlgrave said.

The rollout builds on WalletConnect's existing scale. The network connects more than 700 wallets serving over half a billion crypto users and facilitated more than $400 billion in network volume in 2025, including hundreds of billions in stablecoin transactions.

Ingenico's global footprint gives WalletConnect access to millions of payment terminals across retail, hospitality, transportation and self-service environments. The partnership allows crypto payments to move beyond eCommerce and into everyday, in-store commerce.

Most merchants do not want to hold stablecoins, a reality that WalletConnect's roadmap addresses.

WalletConnect manages the conversion between crypto and fiat, enabling refunds that resemble card-based timing.

“You can expect that to be very much in line with how a card refund timing works today,” Houlgrave said, adding that near-instant refunds are on the roadmap.

Adoption will accelerate as banks and neobanks enable customers to hold stablecoins directly, she said.

“Even some very established old banks are really getting their heads around this,” she said.

The goal, she said, is simple: “If people are able to hold stablecoins, we need to give them ways of using that in-store as well as online.”

India's central bank has quietly floated a proposal that could carry far-reaching geopolitical consequences: linking the official digital currencies of BRICS countries to facilitate cross-border trade and tourism payments.

India's central bank has quietly floated a proposal that could carry far-reaching geopolitical consequences: linking the official digital currencies of BRICS countries to facilitate cross-border trade and tourism payments. According to sources, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that the idea be placed on the agenda of the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is set to host later this year. If accepted, it would mark the first formal attempt by the bloc to connect their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) into a shared framework.

The proposal comes at a moment of heightened global tension. Trade wars have resurfaced, the U.S. dollar's political centrality is increasingly contested, and emerging economies are searching for ways to insulate themselves from financial coercion without openly declaring war on the dollar-based system.

At its core, the plan aims to make payments between BRICS members faster, cheaper, and less dependent on existing dollar-centric channels. By linking CBDCs, countries could settle trade invoices, tourism expenses, and potentially trade finance directly in their sovereign digital currencies. This would bypass correspondent banking bottlenecks and reduce exposure to sanctions or tariff-driven financial pressure.

India has been careful to frame the proposal as technical rather than ideological. The RBI has repeatedly stressed that promoting the digital rupee internationally is not about de-dollarisation, but about efficiency, resilience, and modernising cross-border payments. Still, the strategic implications are difficult to ignore.

The timing is significant. BRICS has regained prominence amid President Donald Trump's renewed tariff threats and warnings against countries seeking alternatives to the dollar. Trump has previously labelled BRICS “anti-American” and openly threatened punitive trade measures against its members.

Against this backdrop, a BRICS-linked CBDC system would not replace the dollar overnight, but it would represent a subtle shift: from dependence on U.S.-dominated financial plumbing to parallel infrastructure controlled by emerging economies themselves. In a world where access to payment systems has become a geopolitical lever, that shift alone is meaningful.

Despite its ambition, the proposal faces a long and uncertain road. None of the major BRICS members has fully launched a CBDC, though all are running pilots. Interoperability—both technical and regulatory—remains a major challenge. Questions around governance, data sharing, settlement of trade imbalances, and trust in each other's platforms are unresolved.

Past experience offers cautionary lessons. Earlier efforts by India and Russia to expand local-currency trade ran into problems when Russia accumulated large rupee balances it could not easily deploy. To avoid similar pitfalls, the RBI is exploring mechanisms such as bilateral foreign exchange swaps and periodic settlements to manage imbalances more smoothly.

Political hesitation may prove just as difficult as technical complexity. Countries may be reluctant to rely on platforms designed or dominated by others, especially when strategic trust within BRICS remains uneven.

India's persistence on CBDCs stands out at a time when global enthusiasm has shifted toward stablecoins. The RBI has taken a firm stance against that trend, arguing that privately issued stablecoins pose risks to monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and regulatory control. For India, the e-rupee is not just a payments tool but a safeguard for its digital financial ecosystem.

By contrast, linking CBDCs within BRICS would allow countries to experiment with innovation while retaining full state control an appealing compromise for governments wary of both dollar dominance and private digital currencies.

If even partially realised, a BRICS CBDC linkage would strengthen financial ties within the bloc and deepen South–South economic integration. It would also reinforce BRICS' role as a forum for practical cooperation rather than grand but unrealised ambitions like a common currency.

Globally, the impact would be incremental rather than revolutionary. The dollar's dominance rests on deep capital markets, legal trust, and liquidity advantages no CBDC network can easily replicate. But incremental erosion matters. Over time, alternative systems can reduce the dollar's exclusivity, even if they do not dethrone it.

This proposal is best understood not as an anti-dollar rebellion, but as strategic hedging. India, in particular, is walking a careful line: seeking insulation from geopolitical shocks without provoking outright confrontation with the United States. By emphasising efficiency, tourism, and trade facilitation, New Delhi is framing a geopolitical move in technocratic language.

Yet intentions matter less than perceptions. In Washington, any effort that reduces dollar dependence especially within a bloc that includes China and Russia will be viewed through a strategic lens. That alone could raise the political cost of implementation.

The deeper significance lies elsewhere. Finance is becoming modular. Instead of one dominant system, multiple overlapping payment networks are emerging, each reflecting different power centres. A linked BRICS CBDC system would not end dollar dominance but it would mark another step toward a more fragmented, multipolar financial order where states, not markets alone, decide how money moves across borders.

Best altcoins to buy now are in focus again as Bitcoin dropped below $93,000 during the early Monday session after Donald Trump's new Greenland-related tariffs on eight European allies over the past weekend.

The U.S. President announced a 10% tariff on European countries that are supporting Denmark against his bid for Greenland. Across 8 countries, he imposed a 10% tariff, effective from 1 February, warning that it could rise to 25% in June.

This has triggered a sharp “risk-off” move in the global financial markets. Investors are reacting to the escalating trade tensions by liquidating speculative positions in favor of traditional safe havens like gold and reducing exposure to assets like cryptocurrencies. This led to a sharp sell-off in the broader crypto market. 

The total crypto market cap has fallen from the January 15 peak of $3.37 trillion to $3.26 trillion. While this might seem like a cautious sign for early investors, veterans know that this lenvironment presents an ideal time to add potential tokens for the next leg up. 

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still holding above the current support level, some altcoins are showing immense strength despite broader market weakness.

Here are the top four altcoins that could outperform the market in the upcoming bull run:

Bitcoin has dominated the crypto landscape since its inception. Its high security and demand have positioned it as the number one crypto, despite its limited ability to expand its ecosystem for tokenization, dApps, or NFTs like Ethereum and Solana have achieved. This is precisely what Bitcoin Hyper is addressing. 



Bitcoin Hyper is built to make Bitcoin faster and more practical. Instead of processing every transaction directly on the main network, it uses zk-rollups to group thousands of transactions off-chain and then settle them together on Bitcoin. This approach eases network congestion and sharply lowers transaction costs, without compromising security.

What truly sets Bitcoin Hyper apart is its integration of the Solana Virtual Machine. By tapping into a system capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin Hyper opens the door to high-speed applications on the Bitcoin network. This makes advanced use cases such as DeFi platforms, blockchain games, and NFT trading possible at a scale that Bitcoin alone could not support.

Currently, the project is in its presale phase with each HYPER token priced at just $0.013605. Bitcoin Hyper offers 38% p.a. Staking rewards, the highest in the industry. It has already amassed over $30.8 million, demonstrating strong investor confidence and positioning it as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Monero (XMR) has been a trending token in the crypto market over the last week, following a sharp 70% surge in just a few sessions. The move was triggered by investors shifting towards privacy tokens after a series of multi-million-dollar swaps to Monero following a social engineering attack. This increased the demand for privacy tokens like XMR.

Following a strong breakout on January 11, the altcoin surged to a new all-time high of $801. However, after the recent correction hit the market, it dropped to a low of $533, but as dip buyers stepped in, it has recovered above $620. Currently, XMR is trading at $624, up 6.8% over the past 24 hours.

During the drop, the 20-day moving average has served as strong support for the price. At the moment, the $600 and $570 levels are immediate support, while the $650 and $700 are local resistance. If another breakout occurs, Monero could target the $1,000 psychological mark, while in a bearish scenario, it could see a bearish move below the $500 support. 

In the best altcoins to buy now list, Maxi Doge is one of the leading projects in the meme coin space. In just a few weeks of launch, the project has raised nearly $4.5 million with tokens priced at just $0.000279. Demand in the presale has skyrocketed, as the current stage ends in under 48 hours, and the price will increase automatically thereafter. 

Maxi Doge leans fully into chaos, and it does so on purpose. Instead of playing it safe, the project uses an over-the-top Shiba mascot and a tongue-in-cheek message that openly mocks reckless trading culture. The branding grabs attention fast, but it is not just noise for the sake of memes.



Behind the visuals, the team is pushing for real engagement. MAXI is designed to plug into perpetual trading platforms, and the project runs regular trading contests where users can earn rewards in both MAXI and USDT. These mechanics turn the brand into something people actively interact with, not just scroll past.

On the token side, Maxi Doge keeps things controlled. The total supply is capped at 150.24 billion tokens, removing the risk of endless inflation that often kills meme coins over time. Holders can also stake their tokens and earn up to 73% APY, adding a yield layer to the narrative. Together, these elements position $MAXI as a presale that blends attention-grabbing energy with features that extend beyond pure hype.

As Bitcoin and other altcoins face selling pressure, Tron is one of the blue-chip cryptocurrencies that has defied the wider market correction. In the past seven days, TRON has surged by over 6.5% and is currently trading above $0.31.

The breakout in Tron has been sustained due to high trading volume and the strong performance of its ecosystem. Since its December low, the altcoin has surged nearly 20%, an exceptional performance for a large-cap token amid these conditions. 

However, Tron is still trading 14% below the 2025 high. The tokens need to clear key resistance levels around $0.33 and $0.38 to achieve a new 52-week high. However, its strong performance in weak market conditions positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Solana Labs CEO and co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko issued a defiant strategic directive on January 17, 2026, arguing that the Solana network must “never stop iterating” if it hopes to remain relevant in a rapidly maturing global financial system. Speaking via social media in response to a philosophical post from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Yakovenko challenged the idea that a blockchain should strive for a “self-sustaining” or static state. While Buterin recently advocated for Ethereum to reach a point where it could survive for decades without active developer influence, Yakovenko countered that a hands-off approach is a recipe for technical obsolescence. He emphasized that for Solana to meet the diverse and shifting needs of its millions of users and developers, the network must maintain an aggressive, iterative development cycle, effectively adopting an “adapt or die” mentality that prioritizes real-world utility over theoretical purity.

The debate between the two most prominent figures in the Layer 1 space highlights a fundamental divergence in the technical roadmap for the 2026 bull market. Yakovenko's vision for Solana is one of a “living ecosystem” that introduces new features, optimizes its validator stack, and updates its core codebase to fit the immediate demands of internet-scale financial activity. This stands in stark contrast to the “walkaway test” proposed for Ethereum, which focuses on maximizing decentralization and privacy even if it results in a slower pace of innovation. Supporters of Yakovenko's approach argue that the complexity of modern finance requires a network that can handle thousands of “micro-advancements” in areas like scheduler optimization and compute unit limits. By rejecting the notion that a protocol can ever be “finished,” Solana is positioning itself as the primary venue for consumer-facing applications and high-frequency trading, where speed and reliability are predicated on continuous technical refinement rather than long-term ossification.

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, Yakovenko even suggested a future where the Solana network could leverage artificial intelligence to assist in its own development. He envisioned a model where network fees could be used to fund AI-assisted tools that write and improve the chain's codebase, ensuring a diverse and decentralized pool of contributors rather than a single development team. This forward-thinking approach aligns with Yakovenko's recent prediction that the stablecoin market will surpass 1 trillion dollars by 2026, a milestone he believes will be reached through the constant improvement of high-throughput networks. As Solana continues to integrate institutional real-world assets and tokenized equities, the co-founder's push for “more iterations” serves as a reminder that the chain's long-term success is far from guaranteed and requires a relentless commitment to outcompeting legacy financial systems. By promising that there will “always be a next version” of the protocol, Yakovenko is signaling to developers that Solana is not a static platform to be built upon, but a dynamic partner that will evolve in tandem with the cutting edge of global finance and decentralized technology.

Business Insider Edition 

India has proposed that BRICS nations explore linking their official digital currencies to simplify cross-border trade and tourism payments, a move that could gradually reduce reliance on the US dollar as geopolitical tensions intensify.


        According to two sources familiar with the discussions, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that the proposal be placed on the agenda of the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is set to host later this year.
    


        If accepted, it would mark the first time the bloc formally considers connecting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) across member states.
    


        The BRICS grouping, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded in recent years to include countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Indonesia.
    


        The RBI's proposal is understood to focus on facilitating cross-border trade finance and tourism payments by making national digital currencies interoperable.
    


        Such an initiative could draw criticism from Washington, as US President Donald Trump has previously described BRICS as “anti-American” and warned that efforts to bypass the dollar could trigger retaliatory tariffs.
    


        Central banks in China, Brazil, and Russia did not respond to requests for comment, while South Africa's central bank declined to comment. India's central government also did not respond.
    


        The proposal builds on a declaration made at the 2025 BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, where members called for closer cooperation and interoperability between their payment systems to make cross-border transactions faster and cheaper.
    


        The RBI has publicly stated that it is keen to link the e-rupee with other CBDCs to boost efficiency and expand the currency's international use, while insisting that this is not a de-dollarisation drive.
    


        None of the major BRICS economies has fully launched a retail CBDC, but all are running pilot programmes. India's e-rupee, introduced in December 2022, has attracted about seven million retail users. China has also signalled plans to expand the international use of its digital yuan.
    


        To encourage adoption, the RBI has enabled offline payments, added programmability for government subsidy transfers, and allowed fintech firms to offer digital currency wallets.
    


        However, one of the sources cautioned that making BRICS CBDCs interoperable would require agreement on technology standards, governance rules, and mechanisms to settle trade imbalances.
    


        One option under discussion is bilateral foreign exchange swaps between central banks. These could allow weekly or monthly settlements while managing uneven trade flows.
    


        Previous attempts by India and Russia to increase trade in local currencies faced challenges after Russia accumulated large rupee balances with limited use, prompting India to allow such funds to be invested in local bonds.
    


        The renewed interest in CBDCs comes despite growing global enthusiasm for stablecoins. India has taken a sceptical stance, arguing that stablecoins pose risks to monetary stability.
    


        RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said recently that CBDCs “do not pose many of the risks associated with stablecoins”, citing concerns over monetary control and systemic resilience.
    


        While the road to a linked BRICS digital currency system remains long and politically sensitive, the proposal underscores the bloc's continued search for alternatives in an increasingly fragmented global financial order.

Growing evidence points to a close neurophysiological link between brain and body. Recent rodent studies have shown that the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which underlies expectations of positive outcomes, also modulates immune function. However, it remains unknown whether a similar brain-immune link exists in humans and whether it involves conscious positive expectations. In a preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial, we used fMRI neurofeedback (NF) to train healthy participants to increase reward mesolimbic activity through self-chosen mental strategies, followed by an immune challenge with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and assessments of HBV antibody (HBVab) levels. Eighty-five participants were randomized to (1) reward mesolimbic upregulation (n = 34), (2) non-mesolimbic control upregulation (n = 34) or (3) no-NF control (n = 17). Prespecified primary outcomes were (1) differences in reward mesolimbic activation between NF groups, (2) correlation between reward mesolimbic upregulation and post-vaccination HBVab changes across both NF groups and (3) group differences in post-vaccination HBVab changes. Both NF groups showed significant increases in reward mesolimbic activation. Notably, greater ventral tegmental area (VTA) upregulation—but not nucleus accumbens or control region activation—was associated with larger post-vaccination increases in HBVab levels (r = 0.31, P = 0.018). Sustained VTA upregulation was further linked to mental strategies involving positive expectations. Post-vaccination antibody levels did not differ between groups, and no adverse effects occurred. Together, these findings suggest that consciously generated positive expectations can engage reward circuitry to influence immune function, a process that may be leveraged for non-invasive immune modulation.

Whole-brain results for the high vs neutral reward anticipation contrast during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. The overlaid predefined meta-analytic masks of the mesolimbic system, taken from refs. 57,66, are shown in white. Abbreviations: Nucleus Accumbens (Nac); Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). Statistical threshold was set at a cluster-level p(FWE) < .05. b. ROIs of the reward mesolimbic network. The offline functional localization of the reward mesolimbic regions. For the VTA, the predefined anatomical mask57 was intersected with the high>neutral reward anticipation maps presented in A. For the bilateral Nac, a 5 mm sphere was created around the peak activation voxel within the 8 mm predefined Nac masks (defined based on reward anticipation meta-analysis66).

a. Conceptual scheme. In randomized ROI-NF, each participant is randomly assigned to one of K subgroups of different functionally defined neural targets (colored in pink, orange, and yellow). While in each sub-group, a specific neural target is modulated along with the general task processes (colored in green – control, learning and reward processes), group-level modulations (right panel) include only the averaged (non-specific) general processes common to all subgroups (that is the target process specific to each subgroup is averaged over the whole group). Conversely, in a typical experimental NF group, all participants modulate both the general and target processes (colored in green and blue, respectively). Therefore, group-level modulations include both the general processes and the reoccurring target process modulations. Consequently, differences in outcome effects (such as immune function) between groups can be attributed solely to the target-specific effects (Figure adapted from ref. 10). b. Neural networks of subgroups. Targets of the randomized ROI-NF control condition. All target networks were selected from meta-analyses of fMRI studies on specific functional processes. MNI coordinates: T1. Spatial navigation network76: right medial temporal lobe: 26, -35, -11; left medial temporal lobe: -26, -47, -9; left posterior cingulate: -15, -59, 19; T2. Arithmetic processing network77: right SPL: 29, -66, 49; left dlpfc: -45, 32, 29; left precuneus: -28, -71, 33; T3; Motor imagery network78: right cerebellum: 32, -62, -28; left cerebellum: -32, -56, -30; left precentral gyrus: -26, -2, 58; T4. Auditory imagery network79: right STG:64, -30, 9; left IFG: -48, 24, −5; left precentral gyrus: -52 1 47.

Following practice, participants fill out the MSQ-NF for each strategy applied during the session, based on their logged choices during training. “Other” strategies, as well as those with predefined names, are verbally described, and then each strategy is labeled across the MSQ space.

A tool-using cow is challenging what we know about farm animal intelligence

A pet cow named Veronika uses tools in a surprisingly sophisticated way—possibly because she has been allowed to live her best life

By Kate Wong edited by Andrea Thompson

A pet cow named Veronika, who lives in Austria, has been shown to engage in flexible tool use.

Antonio J. Osuna Mascaró

In news that is sure to delight fans of a certain Gary Larson cartoon turned meme about the limitations of bovine cognition, cow tools are real.

Larson's 1982 comic for his series The Far Side showed a cow standing behind a table bearing an array of oddly shaped objects. The text below the image read simply “cow tools.” Now a pet cow named Veronika has been documented not only using a tool but doing so in a surprisingly sophisticated way. The finding adds a new species to the growing list of creatures that have been found to use external objects to achieve a goal and suggests that society has been underestimating the minds of farm animals.

The story begins more than a decade ago with Witgar Wiegele, an organic farmer and traditional baker in the small Austrian town of Nötsch im Gailtal. Wiegele first observed that his family's pet Swiss Brown cow, Veronika, would sometimes pick up sticks and use them to scratch herself, presumably to alleviate skin irritation from insects. When cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, saw a video recording of Veronika's behavior, “it was immediately clear that this was not accidental,” she said in a statement. “This was a meaningful example of tool use in a species that is rarely considered from a cognitive perspective.”

Auersperg and her colleague Antonio J. Osuna-Mascaró, a postdoctoral researcher, went to meet Veronika and her human family, who welcomed the researchers with freshly baked bread and apple strudel. “Veronika is very friendly,” says Osuna-Mascaró, who spent the summer observing her. “She also has a close bond with Witgar,” he notes. “Not only does Witgar prepare and sell bread, he also distributes it around the area. It was interesting to see Veronika watching every passing car with interest and trying to guess if the driver was Witgar. If she thought it was him, she would moo with all her might.”

The researchers analyzed how Veronika used one particular tool—a deck brush—to scratch herself. Observing Veronika's behavior over dozens of trials, the researchers found that she used the broom exclusively to scratch the rear half of her body, including the rump, loin, udder and belly regions that would otherwise be difficult for her to reach. She precisely manipulated the broom with her mouth, using her tongue to lift it and her teeth to secure it in place. She targeted the thick-skinned upper areas of her body with the bristled end and the more sensitive underparts with the smooth stick end. She also scrubbed more vigorously on tougher parts of her skin and used gentle pushes on her delicate parts.

To the casual observer, using a broom to scratch an itch might not seem like an act of genius. But the way Veronika changed her grip on the broom and her movement of it in anticipation of the outcome calls to mind tool-using behaviors in the famously clever primates and corvids (crows and their kin). Moreover the way she uses the two broom ends differently “"constitutes the use of a multipurpose tool, exploiting distinct properties of a single object for different functions,” Osuna-Mascaró and Auersperg write in their paper on the new findings, published today in Current Biology. Among non-human species, this kind of tool use has only been consistently documented in chimpanzees.

Such abilities may be widespread in cattle. “We don't believe that Veronika is the Einstein of cows,” Osuna-Mascaró says. Together with anecdotal reports of tool use in cattle from South Asia, the results of the new study hint that the capacity for complex problem-solving behaviors, including tool use, might have ancient evolutionary roots but that such behaviors emerge only when conditions are favorable.

As a companion animal, Veronika, now 13 years old, has lived a long life in a stimulating environment. Nötsch im Gailtal is “the most idyllic place imaginable for an Austrian cow, like straight out of The Sound of Music,” Osuna-Mascaró says. He says the family contributed to Veronika's tool use by “providing the special conditions that enabled Veronika to express herself.” Although she learned to use tools by herself, starting with branches that had fallen from trees, Wiegele later furnished her with sticks and rakes that allowed her to perfect her scratching techniques. Most livestock animals, in contrast, live much shorter lives and spend their time in impoverished settings such as factory farms without access to objects that they can manipulate.

Veronika uses different ends of the broom and different techniques when scratching different parts of her body.

“This is fantastic! I applaud the authors, as well as Veronika!” says primatologist Jill Pruetz of Texas State University, who was not involved in the new research. Pruetz studies how environmental factors influence the behavior of tool-using chimpanzees. She also has two companion cows of her own, Claire and Edith. “I am not completely surprised that cattle can use tools—after living in close proximity to my two cows for about seven years now, I have a lot more respect for bovine intelligence!” Pruetz says. “What strikes me about Veronika's tool use is the precision with which she can manipulate the tool as well as switch its ends to target specific areas."

Pruetz adds that the paper illustrates the need for enrichment for the welfare of cattle.

“There are around 1.5 billion heads of cattle in the world, and humans have lived with them for at least 10,000 years. It's shocking that we're only discovering this now,” Osuna-Mascaró says. “We know more about the tool use of exotic animals on remote islands than we do about the cows we live with. However, we are now starting to be sensitive enough to observe them and give, at least to a few of them, the life they deserve, one in which they have the opportunity to play, interact with objects, and discover how to use them on their own.”

The Great Math War: How Three Brilliant Minds Fought for the Foundations of Mathematics Jason Socrates Bardi Basic (2025)

In the weeks leading up to September 1891, mathematician Georg Cantor prepared an ambush. For years he had sparred — philosophically, mathematically and emotionally — with his formidable rival Leopold Kronecker, one of Germany's most influential mathematicians. Kronecker thought that mathematics should deal only with whole numbers and proofs built from them and therefore rejected Cantor's study of infinity. “God made the integers,” Kronecker once said. “All else is the work of man.”

But Cantor had a proof that he hoped would confound his competitor. Armed with an innovative method, now known as Cantor's diagonal argument, he could demonstrate that some infinities are larger than others and he planned to confront Kronecker with it in public at the inaugural meeting of the German Mathematical Society in Halle. But the showdown never came. Weeks before the meeting, Kronecker's wife was fatally injured in a climbing accident, preventing him from going to Halle, and Kronecker himself died that December.

This tragedy — at once poignant, anticlimactic and painfully human — is one of many vivid digressions in journalist Jason Socrates Bardi's The Great Math War. Bardi provides a lively narrative of the intellectual struggle that transformed the field in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. He uses drama to demonstrate how the long arc of modern maths — from the invention of rigorous analysis to the birth of set theory, logic and topology — was neither neat nor inevitable. The intellectual revolution reshaped ideas about the scope of maths, what counts as a valid proof and whether mathematical truth is discovered or invented. And it was driven as much by temperaments, loyalties, neuroses and sheer chance as by fresh theories.

The stakes of this ‘maths war' were immense. Was maths grounded in intuition — the mental constructions that people can build step by step — or in formal symbols and rules that are independent of human insight? Were numbers objective features of reality or useful inventions of the human mind? And could the infinite be incorporated safely into maths, or would it lead to contradiction and collapse? Bardi deftly follows these questions as they ripple across Europe, shaping rival schools, polarizing university departments and fuelling philosophical, professional and, often, personal battles.

The book's central argument — that maths is a human endeavour, shaped by human frailty as much as by formal proof — is made convincingly throughout. Bardi captures the period's ferment with energy and empathy, paying close attention to the psychological states of its protagonists: Cantor's oscillations between visionary triumph and crippling despair; L. E. J. Brouwer's fervent mission to tear down maths and make it all anew; and Bertrand Russell's tortured attempts to reconcile logic, certainty and his own emotional life, confided in anguished letters to his aristocrat lover, Lady Ottoline Morrell.

The feud between Brouwer and David Hilbert in the 1920s was notorious. Hilbert championed formalism: the idea that maths should be reduced to axioms and rules, with meaning set aside in favour of consistency. Brouwer, by contrast, insisted that only proofs that the mind could follow were legitimate. In 1928, Hilbert, who was a chief editor of the leading journal Mathematische Annalen, tried to remove Brouwer from its editorial board. Brouwer refused to resign and was ousted — through dissolution of the entire board. Hilbert then rebuilt it with appointees of his choosing. Albert Einstein, a fellow Annalen chief editor, dismissed the whole affair as an overblown ‘frog and mouse war'.

For many readers who have encountered maths only as a technical tool, the heightened passions behind such debates might be hard to fathom. Yet, when Cantor was being denounced by his contemporaries, including Kronecker, as a charlatan and accused of corrupting the youth with his controversial ideas about infinity, the future of maths truly seemed at stake.

Bardi is at his best when excavating the overlooked corners of history: the petty jealousies of editorial boards, the philosophical fights waged through open letters, the strain on marriages and the toll on mental health. He writes with breathless enthusiasm, occasionally slipping into staccato bursts — “Bereft. Pent-up” — that evoke his characters' emotional turmoil. He brings comic energy to his narrative, for instance, by introducing ancient Greek mathematician Euclid as the “reigning heavyweight champion of math authors” until 1900.

Bardi excels in recounting Russell's life and ideas. An imperialist turned peace activist and advocate of free love, Russell discovered a troubling paradox in maths, similar in its logical form to several others, including the ‘liar paradox': if the sentence ‘this statement is a lie', for instance, is true, then it means the statement is a lie — and therefore not true — leading to a logical inconsistency.

In my fourth year as a postdoctoral researcher, in 2005, I published ten papers. This was an enormous output for one year. At that rate, I reflected, I could publish 100 papers in a decade. Nevertheless, a century still seemed a remote and unattainable score, something that only the most distinguished professors were likely to achieve before they retired.

Fast forward two decades, and ten papers per year now looks pedestrian when you consider the growing number of hyper-prolific authors who publish more than 60 papers annually1 — one or more papers a week.

I have always felt the pressure to publish more. In 2005, my head of department often exalted a professor who published around 40 papers a year; those of us working in public health were all encouraged to do the same. The target was numbers, and quality was mentioned only in terms of a journal's prestige, never the work itself.

I've decided to push back on the pressure to publish by making a rule for myself: I will no longer publish more than seven papers per year. I've published a median of 15 papers a year for the past five years, so that means I will have to halve my output. 

Seven is my own threshold, and will have no relevance to most other researchers, especially those in other fields or at different career stages. The purpose of setting a number is only to aid the goal of prioritizing quality over quantity.

I am not going to spend less time on research, or contribute to 15 papers per year and then select the best 7, so this change will double the amount of time I spend on each paper. I'll use that time to craft better papers, doing more background reading, more consultation with stakeholders and more model testing, and giving more consideration to what the results mean for public health in practice.

I am making this change because I think the current publication system is a runaway train that is headed for disaster. Publication numbers are ballooning, with more than 1.7 million indexed articles appearing on the PubMed database for 2024, compared with around 1.2 million for 2014. This inflation was recently described as “unsustainable” by Cambridge University Press, UK, which called for “radical change”. The boom in numbers is putting the publication system under enormous strain2, and it is now impossible for scientists to thoroughly read and peer review the literature. Without adequate scrutiny, the overall quality of research seems to be degrading, with a recent explosion in the number of low-quality papers passing peer review3.

As a professor with a permanent contract, it's much easier for me to make radical changes than it is for early-career researchers, who are competing to win jobs and funding. Too many career decisions are based on CV length rather than quality, which maintains the pressure on researchers to publish as many papers as possible. Some researchers have reacted to this pressure by using shortcuts to boost their CVs, including using large language models (LLMs) to write low-quality papers and buying ready-made papers from paper mills.

I'm not the first to suggest that less is more in publishing. In Nature in 2017, there was a call for a lifetime word limit for all scientists, and there is a growing ‘slow science' movement. Alas, speed is still more prized than rigour, because those who publish first get more kudos than do those who publish carefully.

The Great Global Transformation: National Market Liberalism in a Multipolar World Branko Milanovic Allen Lane (2025)

In the past decade or so, the realignment of global markets by politicians has transformed patterns of trade and inequality around the world. Economist Branko Milanovic maps out those changes, and what they might herald, in his latest book.

Beyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now

Beyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now

The Great Global Transformation builds on Milanovic's previous work to describe how inequality between countries has declined globally over the past 25 years. Collating data from the World Bank and other sources in innovative ways, he argues that globalization in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century was accompanied by then-unprecedented growth of income in both previously poor populations (notably in China) and people at the top of the world's income distribution (especially those in the West). By contrast, relative shares of world income stagnated or were thought to have declined for wealthy nations' middle and working classes, including in the United States.

This trend captures effectively what has become part of public discourse in the West: globalization has left behind people in the middle and working classes in rich nations, demonstrating that it is “an illusion to believe that what is good for the world must be good for everybody”.

Milanovic's graph revealing this pattern has become highly influential. Plotted in terms of the change in people's real earnings as a function of where those sit in the global income distribution, it is called an elephant curve because of its shape (a broad hill forms the elephant's back, and a sharp fall and subsequent increase form the trunk). But what the graph actually shows is hotly debated. Several critics argue that the curve suggests but does not prove a causal connection between globalization and the decline in people's wealth in some classes in wealthy nations, and that other elements might be driving the patterns.

The book goes on to note that globalization, in the form of increased engagement with markets and trade, did not lead to geopolitical convergence — contrary to expectations in the 1980s and 1990s. Observers at the time hoped that market expansion would lead authoritarian regimes towards democracy and the global governance mechanisms supported by the West.

But in key countries such as China and Russia, authoritarian regimes have proved resilient and have adapted to globalization. Today, the world remains multipolar, with no single superpower dominating globally. As Milanovic notes: “it is not mutual trade interdependence and its stimulation of sweet virtues of accommodation of other people's wishes that makes the world peaceful but the harsh reality of military balance of power”.

At the same time, opportunities for upward social mobility in wealthy nations have been transformed by an increasing overlap of people who are rich in terms of receiving income both from capital (through investments and assets) and from labour (salaries). In the United States and China, “the top class is now more elitist and its position more impregnable because it has … ‘diversified'”. This constitutes “a new moment in the evolution of capitalism”.

The rise of these new elites, according to Milanovic, ultimately explains the direction of the political shifts seen over the past few years in much of the world. In the United States, this shift has taken the form of the populist movement, led by President Donald Trump, that has identified free trade, China and migration as threats to the country. (Milanovic suggests an alternative path, which the United States hasn't followed: increased taxation to redistribute the gains of world trade from elites to the middle class.)

Meanwhile, in China, Milanovic describes President Xi Jinping's policies as a “purposeful change” from those of his predecessors, in “an attempt to reassert the power of the state over the capitalist sector and the rich”. And, in Russia, too, President Vladimir Putin has reasserted control of the state and security apparatus.

Hence, the emergence of what Milanovic calls national market liberalism. In short, all three regimes “should be seen as part of the same ‘counter-revolution' against global neoliberalism and the excesses of elite enrichment during the 1980–2006 era”, he concludes.

Although there are national differences, these countries have in common several of the elements that were previously encapsulated by neoliberalism and globalization. They are also committed to disciplining wealthy people and regulating free trade through various degrees of state control.

EPA's pollution rule change worries experts, cancer survival hits milestone, and astronauts evacuate the ISS

Why the EPA's air pollution rule change could make the air dirtier, how cancer survival hit a record-high, and what we know about the first-ever medical evacuation from the International Space Station

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Andrea Thompson, Sushmita Pathak & Alex Sugiura

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman. You're listening to our weekly science news roundup.

First up, earlier this month the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a new rule signaling a major change to the way it accounts for the impact of certain air pollutants on human health. Many health experts say the shift will likely lead to increased air pollution—and worse health outcomes.

Andrea Thompson, SciAm's senior editor for life sciences, is here to give us a clearer understanding of what the agency is doing and what that means for the air we all breathe.

Hi, Andrea. Thanks for joining us today.

Thompson: Thanks for having me.

Pierre-Louis: So my understanding is that, in general, the EPA uses a type of cost-benefit analysis to understand the impact of an environmental regulation. Can you talk a bit about how, prior to this rule change, the EPA measured these costs and benefits?

Thompson: Yeah, so in general the science for how you sort of calculate how much a regulation will cost, the sort of economic benefit you'll get from it has been pretty well established over several decades.

So for, at least for the benefits part, it starts with health studies that compare areas where, say, a certain pollutant is high and areas where it's low, and look at the differences in hospitalizations and premature deaths and other health indicators, and controlling for other factors that may influence those, and come up with a model that you can use to see, “Okay, if this pollutant goes up or down, how much do those health indicators change?” And then that's married with economic studies that sort of look at what's called the “value of, of a statistical life”—so these aren't a moral judgment of how much a life is worth [Laughs]; it's a statistical one. And that sort of gets married together to figure out, “Okay, here's what the economic benefits will be if we regulate this pollutant.”

And on the cost side that's, you know, what is the cost to industry to implement whatever technological change would be required to, to limit that pollutant? And then you look at the balance.

Pierre-Louis: So how does this change that was finalized earlier this month shift that calculation?

Thompson: So it's a little unclear, as the EPA hasn't been very specific on this point. From the language cited in a New York Times story that came out they're at least not calculating a, you know, a sort of dollar value for the health benefits. And they said that they're not going to calculate that for PM2.5, which are little particles that can penetrate very deeply in the lungs, into the bloodstream; are linked to a bunch of health effects, from asthma to cancers to low-birth-weight babies.

Pierre-Louis: Right, these are the kinds of things that we encounter when we burn gasoline for fuel or during the wildfire smoke events.

Thompson: Right.

Pierre-Louis: So in the old days, let's say, I had a plant, and it was polluting, and it cost me, I don't know, $100 to put a scrubber on my plant so it had less particle pollution, and the government could say, “Well, yeah, it's gonna cost you $100, but it's gonna save $1,000 in human health costs.” But now they're still looking at the $100, but they no longer have that $1,000 to compare it to.

Thompson: Yeah, basically. They said that they're not going to calculate that for PM2.5 and ozone.

Pierre-Louis: And when the news first broke of this change it seemed like many health advocates, their response was, like, “This is likely going to lead to higher levels of these pollutants.” Have you heard something similar?

Thompson: Yeah, so from the experts I've talked to, you know, this would mean that anything that falls under the umbrella of regulations where this is the new policy, you're going to probably have higher levels of air pollutants than you would have otherwise because it's hamstringing this critical tool to figure out, you know, if regulations are going to be worthwhile.

Pierre-Louis: If changing the rules in this way is likely to lead to more air pollution, why do it? Like, who does it benefit?

Thompson: So the, the obvious answer there is the companies that would have to comply with those costs. And this has sort of been the tension behind implementing any kind of environmental regulation: the costs to regulate— if you're the power plant to put a scrubber on, are easier to calculate, whereas the costs to society are diffuse and so much harder to, to calculate. And you're not considering how that pollution is affecting, you know, thousands of people.

Pierre-Louis: I know some people listening at home might be wondering: Is there something their state can do to impose stricter air pollution rules than the EPA can, for example?

Thompson: Right, so states often have particular environmental rules. The problem with something like air pollution is that you could have a polluting plant in, say, Pennsylvania, and those pollutants are going to be blown over into New Jersey and New York. So you—there can be limits to what a state can do. The reason the EPA is there is because this is a problem that doesn't obey these kind of political borders, and you really do need this national regulation.

Pierre-Louis: For more on this go to ScientificAmerican.com to read Andrea's piece.

Turning to some news on cancer, 70 percent of cancer patients now survive at least five years after diagnosis, according to the most recent annual report of the American Cancer Society. The organization says that's a record high.

Rebecca Siegel, the organization's senior scientific director for surveillance research, said in a statement, “This stunning victory is largely the result of decades of cancer research that provided clinicians with the tools to treat the disease more effectively, turning many cancers from a death sentence into a chronic disease.”

The report found that the biggest boosts were among people with high-mortality cancers and advanced diagnoses. The five-year survival rate for myeloma, a kind of blood cancer, jumped from 32 percent in the mid-'90s to 62 percent from 2015 to 2021. Similarly, five-year survival numbers for regional-stage lung cancer, which is typically stage 3, rose from 20 percent to 37 percent over the same time period.

The researchers cited improved screening and cancer treatments, as well as a decline in smoking, for these positive outcomes. But the authors also cautioned that recent shifts in federal policy could undo this progress. The report concluded that “pending federal cuts to health insurance and cancer research will inevitably reduce access to life‐saving drugs and halt progress at a time when incidence is rising for many common cancers.”

Speaking of illnesses, NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, also known as Crew-11, splashed down off the coast of California on Thursday following a medical evacuation. Crew-11 had been expected to stay on the International Space Station through mid-February, but NASA ordered the departure after one of the astronauts developed what the agency's administrator called “a serious medical condition.” Due to medical privacy rules NASA has not revealed which astronaut fell ill or what condition they developed. The agency stressed that it was not an emergency, but the condition was beyond the station's medical capacity.

This is the first time any space agency has ordered a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. Lessons from this evacuation could help prepare for upcoming human spaceflight missions, including Artemis II. That mission, slated for sometime this year, will be the first crewed moon mission since Apollo 17 in 1972.

And now on to some animal news. Researchers have known for a while that same-sex sexual behavior is common in animals. But in a study published last Monday a team of scientists offered more insight into the potential evolutionary underpinnings of this behavior in primates. Imperial College London researchers looked at data on 491 non-human primate species and found same-sex sexual behaviors in 59 of them. The team then looked at connections between those behaviors and 15 environmental, life history and social traits.

The scientists discovered that same-sex sexual interaction was more likely for species with certain characteristics. For example, primates who lived in drier places susceptible to greater food scarcity and predation pressure. Or those with longer lifespans and substantial size differences among the sexes, and groups whose social structures and hierarchies show more complexity.

Vincent Savolainen, senior author of the study, told The Guardian that the results suggest that same-sex sexual behavior seems to, “increase the bonding, decrease tension and aggression, and allow whatever species and their particular environment and society to basically navigate the challenges that they face.”

While the researchers stressed that we cannot extrapolate the sexual behaviors of the primates in the study to humans, fans of the breakout TV show Heated Rivalry may find themselves wondering if those gay hockey players were perhaps engaging in team building.

That's all for today's episode. Tune in on Wednesday, when we'll take a deep dive into the scientific quest to define consciousness.

The rapid growth of Internet of Things applications has substantially increased the number of connected sensors and data volume, yet conventional digital conversion and transmission systems impose high energy and latency costs. Here we develop a neuromorphic sensing system integrating a flexible piezoelectric haptic sensor array, event-triggered preprocessing circuitry and a memristive system on a chip. The circuitry transforms transient voltage spikes from sensor pixels into decaying voltage waveforms, generating a time surface for event-based analogue in-memory computing within the chip. Our system achieves 87%–92% recognition accuracy for patterns written on the sensor array and reduces the energy-delay product during inference compared with conventional digital platforms. These results highlight the potential of the memristive system on a chip for energy-efficient, low-latency edge processing of analogue sensor data, advancing intelligent sensing technologies.

The lack of biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of asthma exacerbations remains a significant limitation to improving patient outcomes. To address this need, we analyze data from three asthma cohorts, combining up to 25 years of electronic medical records with sequential metabolomics studies, to develop and replicate a predictive model for asthma exacerbation risk. We identify asthma-associated biochemical pathways via global circulatory metabolomics and then apply targeted mass spectrometry methods to quantify selected steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites. The sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios robustly associate with 5-year exacerbation risk (discovery p value = 1.63×10⁻26-0.029; replication p value = 1.89×10⁻36-0.033). Based upon these findings, we derive and replicate a simple 5-year predictive model of asthma exacerbations using 21 sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios that outperforms current clinical measures (discovery AUC = 0.90; replication AUC = 0.89). These findings underscore the value of metabolomic profiling to develop a practical, cost-effective clinical assay for asthma exacerbation risk that may improve patient care.

Asthma exacerbations are a major health care burden and cause of disease morbidity, leading to progressive loss of lung function, airway remodeling, and enhanced disease severity1,2. The heterogeneity of asthma complicates identifying individuals at high risk for future exacerbations3,4, and there are no current clinical tests or biomarkers that effectively identify those at risk for asthma exacerbations5,6,7, making this a critical unmet need8,9,10.

Metabolomics studies have been successful in developing clinical biomarkers11,12,13,14 and have the distinct advantage of reflecting both acute and long-term environmental influences in the context of underlying genetic predisposition. To date, asthma metabolomics studies have identified disruptions in several metabolic pathways, including sphingolipids, steroids, and microbial-derived metabolites15,16,17,18,19, that characterize the overall disease state across a spectrum of symptoms. Despite this progress, limitations in current asthma metabolomics studies persist, including small sample size, lack of validation, incomplete capture of metabolites20, and failure to consider the heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, few studies have considered how metabolomics findings may be translated into clinical care. Metabolomics applications that characterize asthma heterogeneity and/or predict exacerbation risk may prove particularly useful for reducing the health burden and improving treatment efficacy.

For metabolomics studies to effectively transition into clinical applications, it is imperative to move beyond discovery metabolomics and perform targeted analyses that delve deeply into the disrupted metabolic pathways and interrogate the clinical applicability of the initial findings. Targeted assays aid in identifying candidate biomarkers by providing robust data with a high level of confidence in metabolite identity and are more appropriate for adaptation into clinical applications in terms of cost, reproducibility and overall feasibility. Despite the logical progression to move beyond discovery metabolomics, targeted studies for multiple diseases, including asthma, remain limited.21,22 Among the targeted assays that did build on discovery metabolomics, there are notable successes in the development of clinical assays, for example, the application of ceramide ratios to assess risk for cardiac events23. Validation of the metabolic pathways implicated to date in asthma, followed by further characterization of their overall impact on the disease—in particular their potential to predict exacerbation risk—is a necessary next step to understand how these findings may have clinical impact. When discovery metabolomics implicates multiple pathways for a disease, identifying the interrelationships between these pathways may bring a more complete understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms for biomarker development24. Evaluating the impact of cross-pathway metabolite ratios for asthma is compelling for several reasons. These measures are straightforward to calculate and have been successfully used to develop predictive disease biomarkers previously25. Metabolite ratios have the advantage of providing biological insights into the interplay between two metabolic processes and are analytically more robust.

The objective of this study was to build on the existing metabolomics literature to enable practical clinical translation in the context of real-life electronic medical records (EMRs). We utilized three well-characterized asthma cohorts, totaling 2513 participants, with up to 25 years of longitudinal data from EMRs and implemented discovery and independent replication across all stages of the study. We first validated the major dysregulated asthma pathways via discovery metabolomics. We then designed targeted assays to quantify the primary metabolites in the implicated pathways. We characterized the relationship between metabolites and multiple clinical traits for asthma and focused on the development and validation of a simple, cost-effective predictive biomarker panel to assess asthma exacerbation risk. In this process, we also used cross-pathway metabolite ratios to reflect the interrelationship of biological processes across metabolic pathways. This process established a framework that leverages global metabolomics followed by targeted assays to create a reliable and clinically relevant biomarker.

This study included three asthma cohorts: the Mass General Brigham Biobank–Karolinska Asthma Study (MGBB-KAS, n = 1040), Mass General Brigham Biobank-Asthma (MGBB-Asthma, n = 610), and Mass General Brigham Biobank-Longitudinal Lung Function (MGBB-LLF, n = 823; formerly Omic Determinants of Longitudinal Lung Function in Asthma [ODOLLFA]), totaling 2513 individuals (Fig. 1). Together, these cohorts represent a broad range of clinical and demographic characteristics common in adult asthma (Table 1.1, 1.2). The asthma cases in MGBB-KAS and MGBB-Asthma had moderate-to-severe disease, as indicated by elevated blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts, reduced pulmonary function, and higher IgE levels. Across both cohorts, patients exhibited varying patterns of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and oral corticosteroid (OCS) over the clinical course of disease, including the 5-year period after metabolomic profiling.

Discovery metabolomic profiling in the MGBB-KAS cohort identified 154 significant metabolite associations with asthma using a False Discovery Rate (FDR ≤ 0.05) correction for multiple testing. Of these metabolites, 46 replicated on a pathway level at nominal significance (p ≤ 0.05) in the MGBB-Asthma study, implicating eight metabolic pathways (Fig. 2, Supplemental Data 1). Significant asthma-associated metabolites included microbial–derived metabolites, involved in four metabolic pathways that have been previously reported: 1) creatine metabolism26,27; 2) glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism28,29,30; 3) methionine, cysteine, taurine metabolism31,32; and 4) tryptophan metabolism33,34,35,36. We observed an inverse relationship between asthma status and steroid metabolites while adjusting for ICS treatment, which was supported by extensive prior literature16,31,37,38. Sphingolipids were strongly associated with asthma in the MGBB-KAS cohort, and their role in asthma has been substantiated in prior studies18,19,39; however, they were not included in the older global metabolomics platforms used for the MGBB-Asthma cohort, which prevented internal validation of these associations. We also observed increases in amino sugar and mannose metabolites with asthma diagnosis; however, these pathways were less substantiated in prior studies26,40. When considering these results in conjunction with the asthma metabolomics literature15,16,18, we identified steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites for follow-up investigation via targeted assays.

The references indicated in the figure are also cited in the main text. This figure summarizes the global profiling associations from the pathways we selected to study further via targeted assays. These pathways were selected based on their significant metabolite associations using MGBB-KAS in the global profiling, further supported by our validation study (MGBB-Asthma) and prior literature.

We quantified 77 sphingolipids, 18 steroids, and 71 microbial-derived metabolites in serum samples from the MGBB-KAS cohort and observed 93 significant metabolite associations with asthma at an FDR ≤ 0.05 across six clinical measures related to asthma, including asthma diagnosis, pulmonary lung function, total serum IgE levels, and asthma exacerbations (Fig. 3, Supplemental Fig. 1.1, Supplemental Data 2). The strongest associations across all targeted assays were observed for asthma exacerbations: 29 sphingolipids and 17 microbial-derived metabolites were positively associated with exacerbations, while 7 steroids were negatively associated with exacerbations. Overall, androgen, glucocorticoid, and progestogen metabolites were inversely associated with asthma diagnosis and exacerbations and positively associated with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). In particular, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisone, and pregnenolone sulfate were associated with both asthma diagnosis (p value = 1.63 × 10−10, 5.33 × 10−9, 1.09 × 10−5, respectively) and decreased asthma exacerbations (p value = 3.11 × 10−8, 9.14 × 10−12, 7.22 × 10−5, respectively). While there were only a few significant microbial-derived metabolites associated with asthma (arginine: p value = 7.3 × 10−5; indol-3-propionate: p value = 3.4 × 10−6) and lung function (FVC: kynurenine, p value = 9.23 × 10−4; FEV1/FVC: betaine, p value = 2.87 × 10−4), 16 microbial-derived metabolites were associated with significant increases in exacerbations, including phenylacetylglycine, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenate, and quinolinate (p values = 6.66 × 10−10, 1.28 × 10−9, 8.67 × 10−9, and 3.69 × 10−8, respectively). Sphinganine-1-phosphate (sphinganine-1P) was positively associated with asthma (p value = 2.1 × 10−4). Many sphingolipid subclasses were associated with both increases in FEV1 and FVC; however, there were no associations with FEV1/FVC. Positive associations were observed with exacerbations across all sphingolipid classes, with Cer(d18:1/20:1), lactosylceramide(d18:1/14:0) (LacCer), and sphingomyelin(d18:1/14:0) (SM) exhibiting the most pronounced associations (p values = 2.48 × 10−6, 3.59 × 10−6, and 2.78 × 10−6, respectively). To further explore whether these associations were influenced by sex, we conducted sex-stratified analyses and present the results in Supplemental Data 3. We observed that males and females often exhibited distinct sets of significant metabolites for the same asthma phenotypes. In cases where overlapping metabolites were identified across sexes, the directions of association (β coefficients) were consistent, suggesting shared biological mechanisms despite potential sex-specific sensitivity. These findings indicate that while metabolite associations may vary by sex, the core directional relationships remain stable.

The black metabolites represent those with p value ≤ 0.05 in the regression model, while the red metabolites indicate those with FDR ≤ 0.05 in the regression model.

We observed a marked elevation in the percentage of significant associations between asthma traits and metabolite ratios compared to individual metabolites (Fig. 3, Supplemental Fig. 1.2, Supplemental Data 4). We assessed the associations with asthma traits and 3898 sphingolipid to microbial-derived metabolite ratios (sphingolipid:microbial), 794 microbial-derived to steroid metabolite ratios (microbial:steroid), and 1248 sphingolipid to steroid ratios (sphingolipid:steroid). The overall association patterns identified consistent relationships between ratios of specific metabolite subclasses and asthma traits, either displaying strong overall significance or no significance at all (Fig. 4A, B). Thousands of associations between ratios and asthma traits were found to be FDR significant. The strongest associations among these were between asthma exacerbations and sphingolipid:steroid ratios, where 59.9% of these ratios tested were FDR significant. Ceramide/sphingomyelin to DHEAS ratios had the strongest associations with asthma exacerbations (p value = 1.63 × 10−26 – 1.63 × 10−22); however, significance with exacerbations was observed across a broad range of sphingolipid and steroid subclasses (Figs. 3 and  4). The ratios of multiple sphingolipids to DHEAS were also associated with asthma diagnosis (p value = 3.86 × 10−16 – 8.56 × 10−14), while ratios between ceramides/sphingomyelins and estrone/deoxycorticosterone were negatively associated with log(IgE). These findings are biologically plausible given that sphingolipids, especially ceramides, are known to modulate steroidogenesis through the regulation of steroidogenic gene expression and intracellular signaling. Alterations in sphingolipid:steroid ratios may reflect imbalances in hormonal regulation and lipid signaling, both of which are critical in the inflammatory and immune processes underlying asthma.

There were 873 FDR-significant associations between microbial:steroid ratios and asthma traits. The strongest microbial:steroid ratios were observed with asthma exacerbations (p values = 1.20 × 10−23 – 1.55 × 10−17), with DHEAS in the denominator, whereas a broader range of metabolite ratios were associated with asthma diagnosis (p values = 2.37 × 10−13 – 1.79 × 10−10), FEV1, FVC, and log(IgE) levels. There were 1603 FDR-significant associations between sphingolipid:microbial ratios and asthma traits. Specific metabolite subclasses were associated with asthma diagnosis (e.g., sphingosines, sphinganines, serotonin, indole-3-propionate), FEV1 (e.g., ceramides, sphingomyelins, kynurenine), FVC (e.g., sphingomyelins, quinolinate), and asthma exacerbations (e.g., ceramides, methylobutyrate, isobutyrate); however, there were no significant associations with FEV1/FVC or log(IgE).

The significant metabolite ratio associations were independently replicated using the MGBB-LLF cohort (Supplemental Data 5). Similar association patterns were observed across both cohorts between clinical measures and pathway-level metabolite ratios. In both cohorts, the largest proportion of significant metabolite ratios was associated with asthma exacerbations, whereas a relatively small proportion of metabolite ratios was associated with lung function and log(IgE). The most significant metabolite ratios in MGBB-KAS replicated in MGBB-LLF, identifying ratios of specific metabolites and/or metabolite subclasses associated with distinct asthma traits: 1) Exacerbations: ceramides, sphingomyelin, DHEAS, isobutyrate; 2) FEV1 and FVC: ceramides, sphingomyelins, kynurenine, quinolinate, and testosterone; and 3) log(IgE): ceramides, deoxycorticosterone, indoles, and estrone.

In both MGBB-KAS and MGBB-LLF, the highest proportion of FDR-significant associations was between 5-year incident and prevalent exacerbations and sphingolipid:steroid ratios. Manhattan plots of the exacerbations to sphingolipid:steroid ratios associations demonstrated that replication was consistent across the same subclasses of sphingolipid:steroid ratios in MGBB-LLF, with stronger overall statistical significance. Association p values in both cohorts ranged between 1.0 × 10−30–1.0 × 10−10 and were as low 1.39 × 10−36 in MGBB-LLF (Fig. 4C). Both cohorts showed the strongest associations for ratios with androgens, followed by glucocorticoids and progestogens. Significant ratios included multiple sphingolipid subclasses and were particularly elevated for those involving DHEAS, pregnenolone sulfate, androstenedione, cortisone, cortisol, and corticosterone in both cohorts. Further interrogation between asthma exacerbations and the sphingolipid:steroid ratios found that overall significance was driven by the combined impact of both the numerator and denominator of the metabolite ratios, rather than being driven by either the denominator or numerator alone (Supplemental Fig. 2). Associations were not driven by outliers in the ratio distributions (Supplemental Fig. 4) and were more correlated with distinct clusters of the sphingolipid:steroid ratios and correlated with specific sphingolipid and/or steroid metabolites (Supplemental Fig. 3). Results were robust to various covariate adjustments.

To assess whether sphingolipid:steroid ratios can improve upon current clinical metrics in predicting exacerbations, we first evaluated the associations between clinical metrics available in the EMR and incident exacerbations. Despite nominal associations between higher neutrophil counts and exacerbators in the MGBB-KAS cohort (p = 0.028) and lower FVC among exacerbators in the MGBB-LLF cohort (p = 0.049), no clinical measures differed significantly between exacerbators and non-exacerbators across both cohorts (Fig. 5A). This suggests that current clinical characteristics alone are insufficient to distinguish which individuals will experience an asthma exacerbation in the next five years. We then assessed the value of including sphingolipid:steroid ratios to predict incident exacerbations alone and when used in combination with clinical measures.

Curves show cumulative incidence = 1−Kaplan–Meier S(t) for strata Q1 and Q4. The center is the estimated cumulative incidence; shaded ribbons denote 95% pointwise confidence intervals.

Using elastic net regression, the feature selection retained 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios in the predictive model for incident exacerbations. Individual Cox models of all 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios were significant and able to differentiate time until the first asthma exacerbation between exacerbation prone (Q1) and non-exacerbation prone (Q4) individuals in MGBB-KAS (Fig. 5C). The difference in mean days to the first exacerbation between the two groups varied across the sphingolipid:steroid ratio, with most differences exceeding 100 days. Ratios with cortisone in the denominator, including Cer(d18:1/20:1):cortisone, HexCer(d18:1/24:1):cortisone, Sphinganine(d18:0):cortisone, and SM(d18:1/20:0):cortisone showed the strongest differentiations, with mean differences ranging from 265 to 366 days in the time until first exacerbation between the two groups (p value range = 2.50 × 10−12 – .02 × 10−9). When the metabolite ratios were available, we evaluated these associations in MGBB-LLF and identified that the biggest differences in the time until exacerbations were with ratios where DHEAS is in the denominator (p value range = 9.98 × 10−12 – 7.3 × 10−7), replicating these findings in MGBB-KAS. Ratios with cortisone did not replicate our findings in MGBB-KAS (Supplemental Fig. 5).

The prediction models that included the 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios had the greatest predictive accuracy when compared with other clinical and baseline variables. The best predictive accuracy for 5-year incident asthma exacerbations, including 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios serum IgE level, and baseline variables (race, ICS medication), achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.901 (Supplemental Data 6). This predictive accuracy was validated in the MGBB-LLF cohort with a similar AUC of 0.893, despite the unavailability of 11-deoxycortisol in the MGBB-LLF cohort, which reduced the number of ratios to 16. In the predictive model, we included only individuals with complete data for selected input variables. Participants with missing values for candidate predictors (such as FEV1, IgE, or eosinophils) were excluded whenever these variables were part of model training (Table 2 summarizes missingness). When serum IgE was excluded from the model, the predictive model remained robust, with AUC values of 0.793 in MGBB-KAS and 0.724 in MGBB-LLF, indicating that the sphingolipid:steroid ratios alone have excellent predictive power. Recognizing the potential for selection bias when restricting the prediction modeling to asthma cases with specific asthma measures (e.g., IgE levels, FEV1, eosinophils, etc.), we conducted additional analyses to evaluate how these patterns of missingness might impact our study conclusions. Specifically, we evaluated how other clinical characteristics of asthma cases may vary when IgE and/or FEV1 measures were missing. We found no significant differences in other asthma-related measures, such as eosinophil and neutrophil counts/percentage, lung function, between cases with and without these data. These findings suggest that missingness in IgE and/or FEV1 in the use of asthma cases is unlikely to introduce systematic bias, and therefore is unlikely to affect the development of the prediction model.

In comparison, the baseline model of race and ICS medication achieved an AUC of 0.498. To further evaluate the predictive contribution of prior exacerbation history and traditional clinical markers, we constructed additional models incorporating OCS prescriptions, FEV1, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Prior exacerbation history (baseline model plus OCS prescriptions history) alone achieved an AUC of 0.726 in MGBB-KAS and 0.781 in MGBB-LLF. Including metabolite ratios alongside prior exacerbation history (Race, ICS, OCS, metabolite ratios) further improved the AUC to 0.845 and 0.844, respectively. Similarly, adding FEV1 to the race and ICS baseline model modestly improved prediction (AUC = 0.610–0.588), and combining FEV1 with metabolite ratios (Race, ICS, FEV1, metabolite ratios) achieved an AUC of 0.809 in MGBB-KAS and 0.733 in MGBB-LLF.

In parallel, we constructed models incorporating eosinophils and neutrophils alongside metabolite ratios. These models resulted in lower AUC values (e.g., 0.795) compared to those that included IgE (AUC = 0.901), as shown in Supplementary Data 7. Models including only clinical markers (eosinophils, neutrophils, FEV1, or IgE without metabolite ratios) performed worse (AUC range: 0.515 to 0.654), all substantially lower than those incorporating metabolite ratios (Fig. 5B). These findings demonstrate that while blood eosinophils, FEV1, and prior exacerbation history are clinically informative, combining sphingolipid:steroid metabolite ratios with selected clinical variables yields the highest predictive accuracy for asthma exacerbations in our cohort.

Using three large asthma cohorts with up to 25 years of EMRs, this study moves beyond global metabolomics profiling by following up primary findings with targeted assays to develop and validate an accurate predictive biomarker for 5-year incident asthma exacerbation. Throughout this process, we validated key metabolic pathways for asthma and characterized the relationship between metabolites and metabolite ratios with a spectrum of asthma traits. Our findings reinforce the important role of steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites in asthma and identify reproducible relationships between distinct metabolite ratios and specific asthma traits. The strongest relationship was between sphingolipid:steroid ratios and exacerbations, where single ratios could differentiate high and low exacerbation proneness by up to one year. Based on these ratios, we constructed a validated predictive model for asthma exacerbations incorporating only 12 sphingolipids and 4 steroids, which outperformed conventional clinical predictors—including prior exacerbation history, FEV₁, eosinophil count, and IgE level—in both discovery and replication cohorts. The simple prediction models for exacerbations developed here offer cost-efficiency, increased accuracy, and straightforward implementation, suggesting a viable option for clinical assay development that may be useful in improving asthma treatment efficacy.

After validating asthma-association metabolic pathways via global metabolomics, we selected steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites for detailed investigation using targeted assays, ultimately focusing on the relationship between steroid and sphingolipid metabolism and 5-year asthma exacerbation risk. Sphingolipids and steroids have independently demonstrated important roles in asthma. Low ceramide levels in utero and early life have been linked to abnormal lung development and asthma41,42. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, evidence suggests that environmental triggers, including allergens and infections, induce sphingolipid signaling and mast cell activation to instigate inflammation during asthma exacerbations43,44. Genetic studies have also shown that ORMDL3 polymorphisms, which inhibit serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and regulate sphingolipid homeostasis, contribute to asthma45. These findings demonstrate that sphingolipids play a complex, multifactorial role in asthma, yet more remains to be explored. The primary mechanisms of steroidogenesis are better understood and form the basis for corticosteroid treatment in asthma. Steroid deficiencies lead to increases in inflammation in the lung and are a risk factor for asthma exacerbations that start in utero and persist over the life course46,47,48. While ICS treatment effectively reduces lung inflammation and is efficacious for asthma control, evidence suggests that prolonged ICS treatment may suppress adrenal function, further exacerbating the underlying physiologic state16. The inherent link between endogenous steroid production and exogenous steroid treatment, therefore, complicates its role in the disease process. Nevertheless, this makes steroid metabolism an ideal candidate for optimizing asthma control.

While we observed associations between asthma exacerbations and both sphingolipids and steroids, the associations and prediction accuracy were vastly improved with sphingolipid:steroid ratios. Importantly, the significant exacerbation associations replicated consistently across subclasses of sphingolipid:steroid ratios, with the most pronounced associations replicating for androgens, followed by glucocorticoid and progestogen species with that respective order across both cohorts.

The use of metabolite ratios enables us to capture relative imbalances between metabolic pathways, offering insights that may not be apparent from individual metabolite levels alone. In asthma, where inflammatory lipid signaling and endocrine function are closely intertwined, sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios may reflect meaningful shifts in these biological processes. The strong associations between sphingolipid:steroid ratios and asthma exacerbations are further supported by the established interrelationship between these metabolite classes. Multiple sphingolipid species act as secondary modulators/regulators of steroidogenesis49,50,51, with distinct cellular functions that include regulating steroidogenic gene transcription52,53,54 and acting as both intracellular second messengers55,56 and extracellular paracrine/autocrine regulators57,58,59. Ceramides—produced through either de novo synthesis or via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin - serve as the precursor to all sphingolipids and, therefore, play a particularly important role in sphingolipid metabolism. Ceramides are powerful in steroidogenesis because they can both directly and indirectly modulate steroid hormone production through their metabolism into other bioactive sphingolipids. Ceramides also act directly to suppress androgens and progestogens, further validating why these ratios may be clinically relevant60. Our findings broadly substantiate these mechanistic studies with particularly strong associations observed between ratios of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and Hex/Lac ceramide species to androgen, glucocorticoid, and progestogen species.

Even single sphingolipid:steroid ratios demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability with direct clinical relevance, with single ratios effectively differentiating high and low exacerbators by as much as one year, highlighting the potential importance of this approach for clinical applications. While steroid regulation is important in asthma, the suppression of steroids is likely both a part of the disease etiology and a consequence of long-term ICS treatment. Yet, there is more to learn about how this pathway may impact asthma and its treatment. The relationship with the sphingolipids provides a new angle for how we might understand their impact. While individuals who have the same levels of specific steroids overall, when examined in combination with sphingolipids, some individuals are at much higher risk of an exacerbation, while others remain at low risk. This phenomenon sheds new light on steroids overall, where we can accurately discriminate between two people with similar cortisone or DHEAS levels into low and high-risk groups. This work suggests that the interaction between sphingolipids and steroids, rather than their isolated effects, may play a pivotal role in more fully understanding the condition and suggests that increased study into the interaction of these pathways is merited. While metabolomics research has primarily focused on the dysregulation of metabolites within a pathway, the interrelation between dysregulated pathways - captured in metabolite ratios—may be a crucial metric to describe disease-specific perturbations.

Much of the progress with metabolite ratios to date has focused on alterations within a given metabolic pathway, while a relatively limited amount of epidemiological research has explored the relationship between metabolites across pathways. The use of within-pathway ratios, such as ceramide ratios for cardiovascular disease (CVD)61, kynurenine:tryptophan ratio for cancers62 and CVD63, and various lipid ratios for CVD64 haas marked some of the substantial advancements toward clinical translation. While between-pathway relationships are less well-studied, the approach we implemented here, by first limiting the metabolite ratios to metabolites from select pathways that are implicated in asthma, offers an initial approach to limiting the total number of ratios. Additional mechanistic work, such as what has been described, the interdependence between sphingolipids, steroids, and specific microbial-derived metabolites provides another approach to identify biologically relevant metabolite ratios65,66,67 that then may be studied further via targeted assays. However, the process of translating these findings into a clinical assay requires that the selected metabolites be vetted as viable candidates for clinical use. Sphingolipid:steroid ratios are not only predictive but would be relatively straightforward to implement into a clinical setting. These molecules are readily amenable to clinical assay development because they are abundant, stable, and the analytical methods for their quantification are relatively straightforward and inexpensive. If these ratios can accurately predict exacerbation risk within the next 6 months, that would enable the implementation of preventative measures to protect against an exacerbation. In addition, these ratios may identify those asthmatics who have poorly controlled asthma as demonstrated by increased numbers/frequency of exacerbation, suggesting that they should receive alternative treatment (e.g., biologics).

In addition to the finding between spinngolipid:steroid ratios and exacerbations, the distinct patterns observed between specific metabolite ratios and other asthma traits offer several viable findings for follow-up. Specific ratios, such as ceramide/sphingomyelin to kynurenine/quinolinate, were strongly associated with lung function measures, but not other asthma traits. The phenotypic specificity between key metabolite ratios and specific clinical outcomes may also be important for understanding the biological mechanisms of asthma. Prior metabolomic studies have identified strong comorbidity across disease phenotypes68; however, there is a lack of specificity between metabolites and specific clinical outcomes. The specificity observed in the ratio associations suggests that these may serve as potential biomarkers for specific clinical outcomes.

The current study has several limitations. First, the discovery metabolomics analyses conducted in the MGBB-KAS and MGBB-Asthma cohorts were performed using different platforms, resulting in discrepancies in metabolite annotations. Consequently, the validation of global association findings was performed at the sub-pathway level rather than at the level of individual metabolites. While targeted assays were applied in the MGBB-KAS cohort, the validation process in the MGBB-LLF cohort relied on global metabolomics data, which meant that not every metabolite or ratio identified in MGBB-KAS could be directly replicated in MGBB-LLF. This limitation underlines the challenges of cross-platform metabolomics analysis and highlights the importance of using targeted assays for validation, because they offer greater reproducibility and comparability across studies and laboratories69. Further follow-up work can focus on additional targeted assays covering other metabolic pathways. Second, while asthma clinical phenotypes used in this study were extracted from the EMR data, it is essential to recognize that real-world data, such as EMRs, might not match the quality of data derived from clinical studies or surveys. This discrepancy arises because EMRs are primarily tailored for clinical care rather than research. To address EMR-related concerns, we enhanced data reliability by calculating median laboratory test values over a five-year period around the data collection date, ensuring a robust dataset for our analysis. Our study utilizes EMR data from adult populations, which captures typical clinical practice. In our cohorts, IgE results were heterogeneously captured, leading to substantial missingness. Despite this, our analyses indicate that such missingness does not introduce meaningful bias into our predictive model. Moreover, the addition of IgE measurements significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of our model, suggesting IgE may reflect key physiological mechanisms underlying exacerbation susceptibility. Pending further validation, our results advocate for the regular assessment of IgE in adults with asthma to improve overall disease management. Additionally, while we used OCS prescriptions as a proxy for asthma exacerbations, we acknowledge that OCS may be prescribed for conditions unrelated to asthma. To assess the validity of this proxy, we conducted a correlation analysis between OCS prescription count and documented asthma exacerbation diagnoses in the EMR, which yielded a moderate-to-strong correlation (r = 0.573). This suggests reasonable specificity in our definition, although we recognize the need for future studies with more granular, temporally linked clinical data to further validate this endpoint. Furthermore, we observed variations in sample characteristics across the three cohorts, with the MGBB-KAS cohort utilizing serum for metabolomics measurements, in contrast to plasma used in the other cohorts. The strong validation suggested that our findings were robust to these cohort and matrix differences. Last, the study considered the impact of ICS treatment on steroid levels by adjusting the analytical model for ICS usage, addressing potential confounding effects and ensuring the validity of our results. Although faced with these constraints, we demonstrated robust replication of our findings. The use of targeted assays provided biochemical insights that were instrumental in refining disease prediction models and enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying asthma and its diverse manifestations. These findings underscore the potential of metabolomics as a pivotal tool in the advancement of precision medicine. Moving forward, the next step will involve further refining these predictive models by incorporating additional asthma-related features, which will be crucial for enhancing the precision and application of metabolomics in precision medicine.

As we move toward precision medicine, there is a need to translate the findings from large-scale omics studies into viable clinical biomarkers. This study focuses on bridging the gap to translation by focusing on asthma exacerbations, which comprise a major portion of the overall disease burden. We used the findings from global metabolomics to develop targeted assays that quantified select steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites. We then developed a 5-year predictive model for asthma exacerbation risk using 21 sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios with high predictive accuracy that outperforms current clinical measures (discovery AUC = 0.90; replication AUC = 0.89). These findings underscore the value of metabolomics profiling and metabolite ratios to develop a practical, cost-effective clinical assay for asthma exacerbation risk that may improve patient care. Metabolite ratios have the potential to add to the predictive space and further inform us about biological mechanisms that contribute to important clinical outcomes.

The overall goal of this study was to develop an accurate predictive model of exacerbations using global metabolomics profiling followed by selected targeted assays across three asthma cohorts (n = 2513) (Fig. 1). The study design includes three stages: 1) Stage 1: Discovery metabolomics to identify asthma metabolic pathways related to asthma; 2) Stage II: Targeted assays for follow-up study and identification of top metabolites and metabolite ratios associated with asthma; 3) Stage III: Predictive model development for 5-year asthma exacerbation risk (Fig. 1). Stage I employed two case-control studies, MGBB-KAS (n = 1080) and MGBB-Asthma, n = 610), with discovery circulatory metabolomics profiling to identify and validate top metabolite pathways associated with asthma. Combining these findings with existing metabolomics literature, top pathways were identified for further study via targeted assays. In Stage II, three targeted assays were developed to quantify 166 selected steroid, sphingolipid, and microbial-derived metabolites across the top pathways. Using asthma cases from two studies, MGBB-KAS and the MGBB-LLF (n = 823), the relationship between targeted metabolites and their ratios with asthma traits was evaluated to identify the strongest candidates for prediction modeling. In Stage III, a 5-year prediction model for asthma exacerbation risk was developed and compared with the performance of current clinical measures.

The MGBB (https://biobank.partners.org) resulted from a project led by MGB (formerly known as Partners HealthCare) in which DNA, plasma, and serum samples were connected to clinical data from the EMR obtained from over 125,000 consented patients as of June 2021. Informed consent was obtained in written form from all participants. Patients involved in the biobank have provided consent through either in-person recruitment or electronic informed consent (eIC). Their involvement in the biobank allowed for blood sample data, EMR data, and survey data, including lifestyle, environmental, and family history information to be collected. The MGBB is linked with the MGB Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR), which stores EMR data on over 4.6 million patients in a SQL Server database, allowing researchers to query the RPDR through the MGBB Portal. The RPDR includes demographic data, diagnoses, procedures, medications, inpatient and outpatient encounter information, provider information, laboratory data, imaging and pathology data, and insurance information. EMR data are available from as early as 1999, and recruitment into the MGBB began in 2011. As such, individual participants may have up to 25 years of longitudinal EMR data, though the actual span varies by individual. For enrolled participants, extensive longitudinal EMR data, including relevant phenotypic information pertaining to asthma, can be extracted.

MGB worked with the Institutional Review Board (IRB: 2014P001109) for approval for this collection of biospecimen data and the use of human participants for research through both the MGBB and the RPDR. The information obtained is approved for use in all types of research on human health, including genomics, biomarker analyses, epidemiology, and cell line creation. In this study, three independent asthma studies selected individuals from the MGBB using distinct study designs. Clinical phenotypes related to asthma, including lung function measures (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC), blood differentials (eosinophil and neutrophil counts), IgE levels, ICS treatment, and asthma exacerbations defined via OCS treatments, were harmonized across all three cohorts. For some clinical phenotypes, such as lung function measures, blood differentials, and IgE levels, multiple values were often available per participant due to repeated clinical visits. To ensure temporal consistency with the metabolomics data, we selected the value closest in time to the serum sample collection date for each individual for analysis.

The MGBB-KAS is a matched case-control study of asthma from the MGBB, consisting of 540 asthma cases and 540 non-asthmatic controls. An individual with asthma was defined by all the following criteria: 1) an asthma diagnosis defined by the asthma prediction algorithm70 in the RPDR (positive predictive value > 85%); 2) at least one oral steroid prescription or one inhaled steroid prescription (ICS of ICS/LABA ≥ 1). Control individuals were identified by the following: 1) no diagnosis of asthma (negative predictive value > 99%); 2) no ICS or OCS medications; 3) matched on age, sex, and self-reported race. All 1140 participants of MGBB-KAS were non-smokers and had serum samples available. Participants with missing serum collection dates and BMI information were excluded from subsequent analyses, along with their matched participants. As a result, 540 pairs of asthma cases and controls were included in the analyses (total n = 1080; Table 1).

The MGBB-Asthma is an independent asthma case-control study in MGBB16 with 287 asthma cases and 323 control cases (total n = 610; Table 1), with no overlap from the MGBB-KAS cohort. A validated phenotyping algorithm70 in the RPDR was used for asthma diagnosis and identified 287 individuals with asthma (positive predictive value > 85%) and 323 controls (negative predictive value > 99%) to generate the MGBB-Asthma population (total n  =  610 individuals; Table 1). Non-fasting plasma samples for the MGBB-Asthma cohort were collected between October 2010 and March 2017 and were stored immediately (within 4 hours) in a −80 °C freezer. Controls were randomly selected from the pool of individuals without asthma with available plasma samples.

The MGBB-LLF is also an independent MGBB cohort of 823 severe asthma cases, with no overlap from the MGBB-KAS and MGBB-Asthma cohorts. An individual with severe asthma was defined by all the following: 1) an asthma diagnosis defined by the asthma prediction algorithm70 based on the RPDR; 2) evidence of persistent disease activity, defined as at least three lung function assessments and/or ICS treatment in conjunction with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) testing. All participants of MGBB-LLF had available plasma samples and were non-smokers (total n = 823, Table 1).

Samples were assayed on three liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms (HILIC-positive, lipidomics-positive, and lipidomics-negative) using an Agilent QToF 6550 interfaced with a Rapid Resolution separation module. For data quality control (QC) and pre-processing, coefficients of variation (CV%) were first computed, and features with CV% ≥ 25% were removed. Missingness was calculated across each feature and each sample. Features missing ≥ 75% were also excluded. Missing values were imputed as half the minimum value across all samples for each feature. The resulting plots of principal component analysis (PCA) were examined, and the interquartile range (IQR) and skewness of each feature were computed. All features were subsequently log-10 transformed and Pareto-scaled, and IQR and skewness were recalculated after transformation. PCA was performed again, and the distribution of PCs according to demographic variables was examined. After QC, 2338 features from the HILIC-positive platform, 2672 features from the lipidomics-positive platform, and 1918 features from the lipidomics-negative platform were retained. Features with less than or equal to 30% missing were included in subsequent analyses (2317 from HILIC-positive, 2650 from lipidomics-positive, and 1885 from lipidomics-negative platforms). Metabolite annotations were assigned to features using the MS-DIAL software, resulting in 1902 metabolite identifications71,72. Unidentified features and xenobiotics were not included in further analysis. A detailed description of the data acquisition and the metabolite annotation workflow is provided in the supplemental material.

Untargeted global plasma metabolomics profiling was generated by Metabolon Inc. (Durham, North Carolina, USA). CV were measured in blinded QC samples randomly distributed among study samples. Batch variation was controlled for in the analysis. Sample preparation and global metabolomics profiling were performed according to methods described previously73,74,75. Metabolomic profiling was performed using four liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods that measure complementary sets of metabolite classes described previously: 1) Amines and polar metabolites that ionize in the positive ion mode; 2) Central metabolites and polar metabolites that ionize in the negative ion mode; 3) Polar and non-polar lipids; 4) Free fatty acids, bile acids, and metabolites of intermediate polarity. All reagents and columns for this project were purchased in bulk from a single lot, and all instruments were calibrated daily for mass resolution and mass accuracy.

Metabolite peaks were quantified using the AUC. Raw area counts for each metabolite in each sample were normalized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences by the median value for each run-day; therefore, the medians were set to 1.0 for each run. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of ~8,000 chemical standard entries that include retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and curated by visual inspection for QC using software developed at Metabolon, Inc.76. Identification of known chemical entities was based on comparison to metabolomic library entries of purified standards. Additional mass spectral entries were created for structurally unnamed biochemicals, which were identified by virtue of their recurrent nature. These compounds have the potential to be identified by future acquisition of a matching purified standard or by classical structural analysis. Missing metabolite values were imputed by replacement with half the minimum value for each metabolite in all samples. Metabolites with an IQRs of 0 were excluded from further analysis, with 904 metabolites remaining for the analysis. The remaining metabolites were subsequently log-10 transformed and Pareto-scaled.

The sphingolipid profiles were quantified in all serum samples of MGBB-KAS participants (N = 1080) using LC-MS/MS. Details of the sphingolipid profiling method can be found in previous studies18,77. A total of 77 sphingolipids were reported, of which 42 were quantified using external calibration curves. The 35 remaining sphingolipids were identified based on the predicted retention time for the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transition. For these 36 compounds, a pseudo-quantitation was performed based on compounds sharing similar structures and internal standards. Concentrations of sphingolipids were reported in nanomolar (nM). Two types of QC samples were included: QC of extraction and QC of injection. CV corresponding to each type of QC samples was calculated. Skewness of each sphingolipid was also calculated. The main sphingolipid subgroups included in this panel were dihydroceramides (dhCer), ceramides (Cer), ceramide-1-phosphates (Cer1P), sphingosines, sphingosine-1-phosphates (S1P), sphingomyelins (SM), hexosylceramides (HexCer), and lactosylceramides (LacCer), in addition to 3-ketosphinganine (3-KS), sphinganine, sphinganine-1-phosphate (Spa1P), and glucosylsphingosine. All sphingolipids had <7% missing values; thus, none were removed based on missing percentages. Sphingolipid concentrations were standardized (original value minus mean, then divided by standard deviation) to obtain effect estimates comparable among different sphingolipids.

A separate batch of serum samples from the same participants was sent to Precion Inc. for quantification of a panel of microbial-derived metabolites that included 71 metabolites in the following pathways: short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolism, dietary aromatic compounds, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, polyamine metabolism, trimethylamine N-oxide biosynthesis, secondary bile acid metabolism, histidine metabolism, and vitamin biosynthesis. The microbial-derived metabolites panel analysis consists of two extractions of serum sample aliquots (50 and 100 μl). The extracts are analyzed with three different LC-MS/MS methods for the 71 analytes of interest. The concentration of microbial-derived metabolites was reported in μg/mL. This targeted panel was developed by Precion Inc., which described it as a “Microbial Metabolite Panel”. While some metabolites are indeed microbially produced, others are of dietary or host origin. To improve clarity, we use the term “microbial-derived metabolites” throughout the manuscript, and a comprehensive list of all 71 profiled metabolites is provided in Supplemental Data 2. Fifty-one metabolites missing≤30% were included in subsequent analyses. Microbial-derived metabolites' concentrations were standardized (original value minus mean, then divided by standard deviation) to obtain effect estimates comparable among different metabolites.

A separate batch of serum samples from the same participants was sent to Precion Inc. for quantification of a steroid hormone panel, including 16 endogenous steroids in the following sub-pathways: androgens, estrogens, progestogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. The Comprehensive Steroid Hormone Panel utilizes 200 µl of serum or plasma, calibrated across analytes and conducted via three LC-MS/MS methods: Method 1 for aldosterone, estrone, and estradiol in ESI negative mode; Method 2 for non-conjugated steroids including prednisone and prednisolone in ESI positive mode; and Method 3 for steroid sulfates in ESI negative mode. Each method employs stable labeled internal standards for quantitation through linear regression analysis, with calibration and QC standards maintaining accuracy within ±15% of the nominal value and precision ≤10%. Steroid concentrations were standardized (original value minus mean, then divided by standard deviation) to obtain effect estimates comparable among different steroids.

We summarized the basic demographic characteristics of participants in MGBB-KAS, MGBB-Asthma, and MGBB-LLF, stratified by asthma status (Table 1). Additionally, Table 2 provides a summary of the clinical measures relevant to asthma cases in MGBB-KAS and MGBB-LLF.

We employed conditional logistic regression models using the clogit function from the survival R package to evaluate the associations between asthma status and individual metabolite features in the MGBB-KAS cohort, which followed a matched case-control framework. Matching was performed on age, race, and sex, and models were additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) values recorded closest to the serum collection date. To account for multiple testing, statistical significance was determined using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.

In the MGBB-Asthma cohort, we applied multivariable logistic regression models using the glm function (family = binomial) from the stats package, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and smoking status, to replicate the significant asthma finding in MGBB-KAS. A finding was deemed to replicate if (1) the observed effect size (odds ratio, OR) aligned in direction with the initial association and (2) the association's p value was < 0.05.

Using the global asthma metabolomics findings of the MGBB-KAS cohort and the scientific literature, we identified sphingolipid metabolism, steroid metabolism, and microbial-derived metabolites as priority pathways for further study. We expanded our study of these pathways through three targeted assays that quantified 77 sphingolipids, 71 microbial-derived metabolites, and 18 steroids. For these quantified metabolites, we used conditional logistic regression models implemented via the survival R package, accounting for the matched study design (matched on age, sex, and race). All participants were non-smokers, and BMI was included as an additional covariate to adjust for residual confounding. Additionally, we investigated the associations between targeted metabolites and asthma clinical measures among individuals with asthma. This investigation utilized multivariable linear (lm function, stats package) and Quasi-Poisson regression models (glm function with family = quasiposson) to evaluate various asthma clinical measures. Linear regression models focused on lung function measures such as FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, in addition to log(IgE). Quasi-Poisson models were employed to analyze the consumption of oral corticosteroids (OCS) over the past five years. The regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and race, ethnicity, BMI from the closest record to the serum collection date and the count of ICS use within the last five years. Specifically, for lung function measures (FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio), we additionally adjusted for height. Given the smaller number and higher reliability of targeted metabolites, we applied a more stringent FDR ≤ 0.05 threshold to correct for multiple testing and ensure higher specificity of the results.

In MGBB-KAS, the metabolite ratios were calculated using targeted metabolites from different panels, where the numerator and denominator originated from separate panels. The ratios were determined by dividing the raw concentration of one metabolite by another. Ratios were computed only when both the numerator and denominator metabolite values were available. Ratios with missing values of less than 30% were considered for further analyses. To ensure comparability and enhance model performance, all metabolite ratios were log₁₀-transformed prior to analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this transformation improved model diagnostics, including residual normality and homoscedasticity, as shown in Supplemental Data 4. In this study, we focused on the ratio generated from three targeted panels (sphingolipids, microbial-derived metabolites, and steroids panels). These ratios consisted of three different varieties: sphingolipid/microbial-derived metabolite ratios (Sph/Microb, number of ratios = 3898), sphingolipid/steroid ratios (Sph/Str, number of ratios = 1248), and microbial-derived metabolites/steroid ratios (Microb/Str, number of ratios = 794). The same multivariable linear/Quasi-Poisson regression models were utilized to assess the association between log-transformed metabolite ratios with asthma and its phenotypes within asthma cases, where the number of participants varied for each metabolite ratio. To correct for multiple testing, we applied a stringent FDR significance threshold (FDR ≤ 0.05).

We extracted 62 sphingolipids, 46 steroids, and 118 microbial-derived metabolites to replicate our findings in the MGBB-LLF cohort. microbial-derived metabolites involved in the following pathways were selected: Phenylalanine Metabolism, Tyrosine Metabolism, Tryptophan Metabolism, Short-Chain Fatty Acid, Polyamine Metabolism, Secondary Bile Acid Metabolism, Carnitine Metabolism, and Histidine Metabolism. We calculated the ratios using raw values of these metabolites, ensuring the numerator and denominator were derived from the same three distinct categories as in MGBB-KAS. To ensure a normal distribution of the ratios, we applied a log10 transformation to all metabolite ratios. This process resulted in the generation of the same three varieties of ratios as identified in MGBB-KAS: Sphingolipid:microbial (number of ratios = 7316), sphingolipid:steroid (number of ratios = 2852), and microbial:steroid (number of ratios = 5428). To replicate the associations between metabolite ratios and asthma clinical measures, we employed regression models similar to those used in MGBB-KAS, adjusting for variables such as age, sex, race, and BMI (based on the closest record to the serum collection date), as well as ICS usage within the past five years. For lung function measures specifically, adjustments were also made for height. Additionally, we applied an FDR threshold of ≤ 0.05 in our statistical analysis.

In our study, the presence of asthma exacerbations was assessed through the utilization of OCS medication. Participants who had not used OCS medication in the past five years were considered not to have experienced prevalent asthma exacerbations. Conversely, those whose OCS medication usage was equal to or exceeded the average (7 OCS prescriptions) within the last five years were classified as having prevalent asthma exacerbations. This same threshold was used to identify cases of incident asthma exacerbation over the next five years.

The elastic net approach was employed to identify biomarkers indicative of asthma exacerbations in MGBB-KAS. In initial modeling, we included all FDR-significant metabolite ratios from both sphingolipid:steroid and microbial-derived metabolite:steroid classes to evaluate their combined predictive performance. After comparison, we subsequently focused on the sphingolipid:steroid ratios, which showed better performance and feasibility for assay development. Utilizing the glmnet R package, we trained binomial regression models for asthma exacerbations within the last 5 years on FDR-significant sphingolipid:steroid ratios alongside confounders such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI (based on the most recent record before serum collection), and ICS usage. To maximize the AUC, we set the alpha parameter to 0.6. Through 10-fold cross-validation, an optimal lambda was selected based on the alpha parameter. Demographic variables like sex, race, and ethnicity were encoded using one-hot encoding. Ultimately, only those features with a non-zero coefficient were chosen as significant for identifying prevalent asthma exacerbation. This model was then tested to predict asthma exacerbations in the next 5 years in MGBB-KAS. The performance of the model was assessed using the AUC value and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The model was subsequently validated in the independent MGBB-LLF cohort using mapped selected features from the logistic regression analysis.

To determine the discriminatory power of the single selected ratios for predicting incident asthma exacerbation, survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan–Meier estimator to compare survival times between incident asthma exacerbation or not based on the single selected ratio through the survfit function from the survival R package. The event of interest was defined as the time gap to the first OCS medication use after the sample collection date. To further investigate the relationship between the single selected ratio and the time to first OCS medication, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted using the coxph function. The model included covariates such as age at collection, BMI, gender, race, ethnicity, and ICS usage in the past five years. The mean time to the first OCS medication after the sample collection date was also calculated for participants with and without asthma exacerbation, based on the single selected ratio.

All analyses are conducted in R version 4.1.278.

Ethical approval was obtained from the IRB (2014P001109) of Brigham and Women's Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. We ensured the inclusion of participants irrespective of gender, race, or socioeconomic status.

Patient-facing large language models (LLMs) hold potential to streamline inefficient transitions from primary to specialist care. We developed the preassessment (PreA), an LLM chatbot co-designed with local stakeholders, to perform the general medical consultations for history-taking, preliminary diagnoses, and test ordering that would normally be performed by primary care providers and to generate referral reports for specialists. PreA was tested in a randomized controlled trial involving 111 specialists from 24 medical disciplines across two health centers, where 2,069 patients (1,141 women; 928 men) were randomly assigned to use PreA independently (PreA-only), use it with staff support (PreA-human), or not use it (No-PreA) before specialist consultation. The trial met its primary end points with the PreA-only group showing significantly reduced physician consultation duration (28.7% reduction; 3.14 ± 2.25 min) compared to the No-PreA group (4.41 ± 2.77 min; P < 0.001), alongside significant improvements in physician-perceived care coordination (mean scores 113.1% increase; 3.69 ± 0.90 versus 1.73 ± 0.95; P < 0.001) and patient-reported communication ease (mean scores 16.0% increase; 3.99 ± 0.62 versus 3.44 ± 0.97; P < 0.001). Equivalent outcomes between the PreA-only and PreA-human groups confirmed the autonomous operation capability. Co-designed PreA outperformed the same model with additional fine-tuning on local dialogues across clinical decision-making domains. Co-design with local stakeholders, compared to passive local data collecting, represents a more effective strategy for deploying LLMs to strengthen health systems and enhance patient-centered care in resource-limited settings. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR2400094159.

The growing burden of multimorbidity and aging populations has exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare delivery worldwide1,2,3. Health systems face increasing strain from fragmented infrastructure, under-resourced primary care and inefficient triage mechanisms4,5, challenges that are particularly acute in regions where self-referral practices bypass primary care for direct tertiary hospital access6,7,8,9,10. China's health system exemplifies this crisis: according to the 2023 Statistical Bulletin on China's Health Sector Development, hospital visits reached 4.26 billion in 2023 (11.5% annual increase), while only 59.2% of public hospitals offered appointment systems, driving inefficient care-seeking pathways that overwhelm outpatient services. This imposes a dual burden: specialists face patient consultations without referrals11, leading to prolonged diagnostic timelines12,13, compromised emotional support14,15 and elevated professional burnout16; concurrently, patients endure protracted waiting times and fragmented care17,18. Although interim solutions like nurse-led triage exist, they often lack the training for comprehensive patient assessment and chronic disease management19. Addressing these systemic inefficiencies in resource-limited settings requires scalable solutions that can transform strained clinical workflows.

Large language models (LLMs) possess transformative potential to re-engineer hospital workflows and address the systemic inefficiencies amplified by escalating demand. However, current applications remain largely confined to support healthcare professionals in controlled settings, for example, responding to patient portal messages20,21, aiding clinical reasoning in experimental environments22,23 or improving medical directions in online pharmacies24, with limited integration into real-time clinical decision-making. Critically, evidence is lacking for LLM chatbots that directly interact with socioeconomically diverse patient populations while supporting both curative and caring aspects of medicine in high-volume clinical environments25.

Bridging this gap requires overcoming two critical barriers: mitigating the systematic biases that arise when training patient-facing LLMs on local medical dialogues from resource-limited settings26,27, and establishing real-world evidence of their clinical utility within time-pressured hospital workflows28,29,30,31. While localized dialogues have enabled specialized applications, from patient-nurse interactions32 and mental health support33 to telemedicine service34, their direct use in resource-limited clinical environments risks replicating existing care deficits. Consequently, a shift toward simulated dialogues curated from standardized medical corpora is underway, moving beyond a reliance on raw local data23,35. Yet, the relative utility of co-design versus passive data collecting for meeting clinical needs remains unknown. This omission begs a central question: should LLMs reflect local practices or help reform them? The answer is critical for global health equity, as passively collected local dialogues may codify and even scale systemic inequities, from diagnostic shortcuts to sociocultural biases26,27.

To bridge the gap between the potential of LLMs and their practical impact in resource-limited settings, we developed PreA (Pre-Assessment), an LLM chatbot (OpenAI; GPT-4.0 mini) for primary-to-specialist care transitions, using a multistakeholder participatory co-design approach36. We engaged diverse community and clinical stakeholders, including patients, care partners, community health workers, physicians, nurses and hospital administrators, to shape a tool that addresses real-world clinical and accessibility needs. The final PreA chatbot integrated a patient-facing chatbot with low-literacy accessibility features and a clinical interface that generates specialist referrals and supports evidence-based decision-making under time constraints (Extended Data Fig. 1).

The decision to deploy this co-designed version of PreA was empirically grounded, informed by a previous simulated experiment that directly compared the co-design approach with additionally fine-tuning the same model with local dialogues. We then evaluated the co-designed PreA in a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess its effectiveness in facilitating primary-to-specialist care transitions.

The trial was conducted across 24 medical disciplines at two academic tertiary medical centers in western China (The First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University and the Affiliated Hospital of Gansu Medical University). A total of 2,332 patients and their care partners were evaluated for eligibility, with 194 either opting out or being excluded for various reasons (Fig. 1). This left 2,138 patients who were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to use PreA independently (PreA-only, n  = 712), use it with staff support (PreA-human, n = 713) or not use it (No-PreA, n  = 713). Subsequently, 69 patients opted out or were removed for various reasons.

Our final analysis included 2,069 participants (PreA-only, n = 691, PreA-human: n = 689, No-PreA, n = 689). Participants had a mean age of 47.6 ± 14.6 years and included 1,141 women (55.1%) and 928 men (44.9%). Most participants (1,620, 78.3%) were patients themselves, with the remainder being care partners. Demographically, fewer than half (881, 42.6%) were unemployed or retired, and 770 (37.2%) reported a monthly income below 2,000 RMB. Educational attainment among them was distributed as follows: below primary school (313, 15.1%), high school (1,073, 51.9%) and college or higher (683, 33.0%). 1,186 (57.3%) participants consulted a medical specialty, 558 (27.0%) a surgical specialty, 194 (9.4%) a combined medical-surgical specialty and the remainder consulted pediatrics (Extended Data Table 1). These baseline covariates were well balanced across the three trial arms, with no significant differences in distribution (Table 1).

Patients and their care partners in the PreA-only group spent approximately 3.51 ±1.50 min interacting with PreA, with no significant differences from those in the PreA-human group (3.48 ± 1.49 min; P = 0.72). They conducted, on average, no more than ten conversation turns, again with no significant differences between the two groups (PreA-only, 9.10 ± 1.37 versus PreA-human, 9.05 ± 1.26; P = 0.51).

In their live clinical workflows, 111 specialist physicians reviewed PreA-generated and control (with age and sex only) referral reports immediately before patient consultations. These physicians spent an average of 0.25 ± 0.08 min reviewing PreA-generated reports (PreA-only and PreA-human), compared to 0.07 ± 0.06 min on control reports from the No-PreA group.

We blindly assessed the effectiveness of the PreA consultation on outpatient workflows across three trial groups using data from the PreA platform and electronic hospital records. The primary outcome was the duration of the medical consultation between patients and physicians, defined as the time elapsed from when patients started conversing with physicians to the end of the consultation. The PreA-only group had a significantly shorter consultation duration compared to the No-PreA group (PreA-only 3.14 ± 2.25 versus No-PreA 4.41 ± 2.77 min; P < 0.001; Fig. 2a), corresponding to a 28.7% (95% CI 22.7–34.8) relative reduction. No significant difference was observed between PreA-only and PreA-human groups (3.17 ± 2.87 min; P = 0.17).

a, Histograms and box plots show the distribution consultation duration across the PreA-only (n = 691 participants), PreA-human (n = 689 participants), and No-PreA (n = 689 participants) groups. The center of the box plot represents the median, with the boundaries representing the first and third quartiles. The whiskers represent the furthest data points from the edge of the box within 1.5 × IQR. b, Box plots show patient throughput per shift for participating physicians and nonparticipating physicians based on 80 matched physician pairs. The center of the box plot represents the median, with the boundaries representing the first and third quartiles. The whiskers represent the furthest data points from the edge of the box within 1.5 × IQR. c, Radar plots show the patient-centeredness and care coordination metrics across the PreA-only (n = 691 participants), PreA-human (n = 689 participants) and No-PreA (n = 689 participants) groups, with five patient-reported metrics (ease of communication, physician attentiveness, interpersonal regard, patient satisfaction, and future acceptability) and one specialist-rated metric (care coordination). d, Bar charts show physician feedback at the end-of-shift questionnaires (n = 111 specialists). The left panel presents ratings of clinical decision support, workload reduction and facilitation of patient–physician communication. The right panel details the most valued features among physicians who rated its usefulness in decision-making as favorable or very favorable. The features include Interpretation (diagnostic report interpretation), Recording (efficient medical history elicitation and documentation), Across-discipline (simultaneous access to multiple specialties), Suggestion (preliminary diagnostic suggestions) and Communication (enhanced patient–physician communication skills).

The secondary outcome is the number of patients per clinical shift and the exploratory outcome is patients' waiting time. To evaluate the impact of PreA on the physician workload, we employed a matched-pairs analysis, comparing patients of participating physicians with those of nonparticipating physicians, matched on medical specialty, physician work shift timing and professional title. Patients of participating physicians cared for significantly more patients (28.54 ± 9.58) per shift compared to matched nonparticipating physicians (24.76 ± 9.42, P = 0.005; relative increase 15.3% (3.4–27.2); Fig. 2b). Given that participating physicians were exposed to PreA-only or PreA-human patients at a maximum frequency of two-thirds, this increase might represent a conservative estimate; on the other hand, physician could strategically control their workflow, thereby the actual impact of PreA on physician workload could be either more pronounced or less pronounced with universal PreA adoption. Despite caring for more patients, patients of participating physicians experienced similar waiting times compared to those of matched nonparticipating physicians (participating 33.54 ± 38.83 min versus nonparticipating 34.65 ± 36.92 min; P = 0.37).

Outcomes here were self-reported by unmasked participants in the RCT (except for physicians masked between PreA-only and PreA-human arms) and measured using the prespecific survey questionnaire based on five-point Likert scales (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Patients and care partners in the PreA-only group reported significantly improved consultation experiences compared to the No-PreA group across the primary outcome, ease of communication: 3.99 ± 0.62 versus 3.44 ± 0.97; P < 0.001; relative increase 16.0%, 95% CI 13.5–18.5) and the four secondary outcomes: perceived physician attentiveness: 3.87 ± 0.85 versus 3.36 ± 1.04; P < 0.001; relative increase 15.1%, 95% CI 12.1–18.1), interpersonal regard (4.02 ± 0.73 versus 3.43 ± 1.05; P < 0.001; relative increase 17.2%, 95% CI 14.4–20.0), patient satisfaction (3.99 ± 0.69 versus 3.41 ± 0.98; P < 0.001; relative increase 17.0%, 95% CI 14.3–19.6) and future acceptability (3.79 ± 1.06 versus 2.81 ± 1.26; P < 0.001; relative increase 34.7%, 95% CI 30.4–39.1; Fig. 3a). No significant differences were found between the masked PreA-only and PreA-human groups across these dimensions (Extended Data Table 2).

a, Agreement analysis between PreA reports and specialist notes. Cases were categorized by level of concordance: agreement (exact match, near-identical content or inclusion of accepted differentials), disagreement or blank (missing physician notes). PreA-assisted group (n = 576) combines PreA-only (n = 291) and PreA-human (n = 285) cases. b, Quality assessment of PreA reports versus specialist notes. The data represent the distribution of expert-evaluated quality across all available cases, including those with blank physician notes. PreA-assisted group (n = 1,152 samples) combines PreA-only (n = 582) and PreA-human (n = 570) samples.

For the primary outcome of referrals in facilitating specialist care, physicians reported a significantly higher value for PreA referral reports compared to the usual one (Care coordination: PreA-only 3.69 ± 0.90 versus No-PreA 1.73 ± 0.95; P < 0.001; Fig. 3b), corresponding to a 113.1% (95% CI 107.4–118.7) relative increase. No significant difference in perceived value was observed between the masked PreA-only and PreA-human groups (P = 0.45). At the end of each working shift, physicians provided feedback on the secondary outcomes, including the usefulness of PreA in their clinical decision-making (Fig. 3c). A majority reported PreA to be useful or very useful (64.9%, 72 of 111); among them, preliminary diagnostic suggestions (87.5%, 63 of 72) and efficient medical history acquisition (77.8%, 56 of 72) were identified as the most valuable features. Furthermore, 77.5% (86 of 111) believed it enhanced patient–physician communication (favorable or very favorable), while 54.1% (60 of 111) of physicians perceived PreA as a tool for reducing workload.

Prespecified subgroup analyses, stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics, demonstrated consistent reductions in consultation duration. Notably, these reductions were observed across age groups, sex, educational attainment, work status, income levels, medical disciplines (medical medicine, surgery, mix of medical medicine and surgery, pediatrics), study sites (Guilin/Gansu) and participant type (patients/care partners), with PreA-only showing significant reductions compared to No-PreA, and no significant differences compared to PreA-human (Extended Data Figs. 2–5).

However, patient experience outcomes exhibited some variability across subgroups. While the PreA-only group generally reported superior consultation experiences compared to No-PreA, this effect was not uniformly observed. Specifically, high-income participants and those attending pediatric departments did not report significant differences in perceived physician attentiveness between the PreA-only and No-PreA groups (Extended Data Figs. 3c and 4).

Concerns regarding automation bias and anchoring, as in experimental contexts21, suggest clinicians may directly adopt LLM-generated assessments, potentially bypassing their clinical reasoning. To investigate this in our real-world trial, we examined whether physicians' clinical notes from the PreA-assisted groups exhibited distinct characteristics from those in the No-PreA group, as per the prespecified analysis.

Classification analysis yielded near-random discriminability (F1 score 0.57; P = 0.81; ΔF1 < 0.02). This absence of systematic separability in the feature space of clinical notes provides compelling evidence against the direct adoption of LLM-generated content in this real-world clinical context. We further investigated this finding across five clinical domains of history-taking, physical examination, diagnosis, test ordering and treatment plans. Consistent with the overall findings, no significant difference was observed between the PreA-only and No-PreA groups (or PreA-only and PreA-human groups) in the five domains (P = 0.10–0.90; Extended Data Table 3). These findings collectively suggest that PreA-assisted medical consultation did not introduce detectable, systematic alterations in physician decision-making, either overall or within specific clinical domains.

We performed a blind post hoc analysis comparing PreA referral reports to the subsequent physician clinical notes among the PreA-assisted groups. PreA-generated reports exhibited substantial agreement (exact match, near-identical content or inclusion of accepted differentials) with physician notes in 65.8% (95% CI 61.8–69.6) of history-taking, 66.7% (95% CI 62.7–70.4) of diagnoses, and 70.7% (95% CI 66.8–74.2) of test ordering recommendations (Fig. 3a). PreA reports show disagreement in only 2.8% to 5.7% of cases, while the remaining physician notes were absent that precluded direct comparison. Among cases exhibiting agreement or where physician notes were blank, PreA reports were rated significantly higher quality than physician notes in terms of completeness, appropriateness and clinical relevance across history-taking (PreA 4.73 ± 0.50 versus physician notes 2.93 ± 1.49), diagnosis (PreA 4.49 ± 0.82 versus physician notes 2.49 ± 1.25), and test ordering (PreA 4.55 ± 0.63 versus physician notes 3.28 ± 1.57; Fig. 3b). Intergroup analysis (PreA-only versus PreA-human) revealed no statistically significant differences in agreement rates and quality scores across all assessed domains.

The choice of a co-designed chatbot for the RCT was informed by a previous simulated experiment that directly compared this approach against fine-tuning with local dialogues. For this experiment, we compiled a de-identified audio corpus of 515 patient–physician scenarios (199,145 Chinese words) collected across rural clinics and urban community health centers within the same 11 provinces as the co-design process. This dataset comprised general medical consultation interactions in geographically and socioeconomically diverse settings, with 51.7% (266 of 515) from rural areas and 77.9% (401 of 515) from the low-income regions. Mean consultation durations ranged from 1.55 to 3.98 min, and interaction lengths spanned 226.90 to 546.00 Chinese words per scenario (Fig. 4a).

The co-designed model achieved significantly higher-quality rating scores than the data-tuned counterpart (the co-designed model further fine-tuned on the primary care dialogues) group across all domains: history-taking (without data-tuned 4.56 ± 0.65 versus data-tuned 3.86 ± 0.81; P < 0.001; Fig. 4b), diagnosis (without data-tuned 4.67 ± 0.55 versus data-tuned 2.47 ± 1.44; P < 0.001) and testing order (without data-tuned 4.23 ± 1.09 versus data-tuned 2.21 ± 1.12; P < 0.001). Notably, the data-tuned model replicated systemic inefficiencies observed in real-world primary care, including omitting guideline-recommended history elements and demographic elements (for example, patient age and sex), and failing to provide appropriate tests and diagnoses (Supplementary Table 3). Mirroring real-world clinician patterns, the data-tuned model exhibited suboptimal adherence to diagnostic guidelines, failing to provide diagnoses (30.0%, 90 of 300) or suggest testing (39.3%, 118 of 300) when needed. Additionally, the data-tuned model mimicked an unfriendly tone similar to that of human clinicians.

We developed and evaluated PreA, a co-designed LLM-based chatbot that streamlines primary-to-specialist care transitions by preparing patients for consultations and generating preconsultation referrals to specialists. In a pragmatic, multicenter RCT in China, PreA improved both operational efficiency and patient-centered care delivery in high-volume hospital settings compared to usual practice. The findings provide preliminary evidence for the clinical utility of co-designed LLMs within time-constrained clinical workflows, suggesting that co-design with local stakeholders is an effective strategy for deploying LLMs into clinical practice.

The trial demonstrated that PreA enhanced both efficiency and patient-centeredness (a dual benefit rarely achieved in previous LLM deployments)20,21,22. Specialist physicians who received PreA-generated referral reports reduced their average consultation time by 28.7%, indicating that the tool enabled faster synthesis of clinical narratives and supported time-intensive decision-making. Indeed, the majority of specialists endorsed PreA's utility for rapid clinical synthesis, particularly valuing its preliminary diagnostic suggestions and medical history acquisition, which aligns with a recent qualitative investigation on physician views37. This efficiency gain, which could expand patient access or improve care quality, is particularly transformative in overloaded health systems where consultation lengths rank among the shortest worldwide38. Notably, this efficiency gain did not compromise (instead enhanced) both the cure-oriented and care-oriented medicine39,40, with physicians reporting improved care coordination and patients perceiving a more patient-centered experience. These efficiency cascades help to address core health system constraints identified in our co-design process, suggesting PreA's potential applicability in other health systems facing similar inefficiencies.

The operational autonomy demonstrated by PreA, as evidenced by the equivalent performance of the PreA-only and PreA-human groups, carries important implications for scalability and cost-effectiveness for resource-constrained health systems41. Our matched-pair analysis revealed increased patient throughput per clinical shift even under partial PreA adoption, suggesting multiplicative system-level benefits when LLMs streamline preconsultation workflows. In resource-limited settings, such efficiency gains may substantially improve healthcare access, enhancing care equity. Additionally, the higher-quality scores of PreA reports position them as patient-specific templates that could alleviate the burden of clinical documentation. Future large-scale studies are needed to validate these potential benefits across diverse health systems.

Our pre-trial ablation studies highlight an essential pathway toward equitable clinical AI: passively training LLMs on simply curated local dialogues risks perpetuating systemic care deficits, whereas participatory co-design could mitigate these risks and better align models with high-quality care objectives. The data-tuned model replication of suboptimal practices mirrors broader concerns that AI models trained on structurally biased clinical data exacerbate inequities in marginalized populations42,43. The co-designed PreA model, refined through input from local stakeholders, including patients, care partners, community health workers, primary care physicians and specialist physicians, outperformed the data-tuned model across all clinical domains. These findings underscore the architectural prioritization of local stakeholder agency through co-design over the passive assimilation of potentially biased natural dialogue data, advancing methodological approaches for equitable AI deployment in healthcare.

Our study, alongside a concurrent trial demonstrating the efficacy of a co-designed chatbot for primary care in low-resource communities36, establishes participatory co-design as a versatile methodology for developing context-specific healthcare chatbots. While both RCTs employed similar co-design approaches, they target distinct clinical needs: while the primary care chatbot prioritized AI health literacy and accessibility for community home use, PreA was optimized for structured referral generation and time-efficient operation within high-volume specialist workflows. The resulting technical architectures and clinical applications consequently diverged, reflecting their distinct co-design processes and stakeholder priorities. These complementary findings demonstrate how co-design principles can be adapted to develop tailored LLM solutions for diverse healthcare contexts, serving various patient populations and clinical objectives.

In contrast to previous research that has often framed LLMs as physician-interaction diagnostic entities22,27,44,45,46, our findings show that a co-design approach, involving the iterative alignment of LLMs with the prioritized needs of local stakeholders, represents the necessary next step, moving beyond technical promise to clinically integrated, equity-focused AI tools28. The streamlined integration of PreA's outputs with specialist cognitive workflows resulted in significant reductions in consultation time and enhanced patient experience across demographic and socioeconomic strata. Critically, these findings challenge the prevailing narrative that medical AI tools inherently depersonalize medicine47, instead positing that co-designed LLM deployments could empower clinicians to prioritize patient-centered care when freed from cognitive burdens. Furthermore, while previous LLM models may have achieved success within narrow, siloed domains22, PreA's demonstrated cross-disciplinary effectiveness, spanning both surgical and medical specialties, underscores its potential to unify currently fragmented care pathways across medical disciplines28.

Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting our findings. The generalizability of our time-reduction findings may be context-dependent, as our study was conducted in high-volume, resource-limited hospital settings. The effectiveness of PreA is intrinsically tied to this environment of high clinical demand and standardized workflows, and validation in diverse healthcare systems is warranted. Furthermore, the single-blinded, pragmatic trial design, while reflecting real-world conditions where patients would naturally know their preconsultation experience, introduces potential performance bias as patients were aware of their group assignment; however, several factors mitigate this concern: the concordance of findings across objective and subjective outcome assessments, the absence of significant differences in clinical documentation across trial arms and the alignment of control group consultation times with established practice patterns.

Although co-design demonstrated advantages over local data fine-tuning for mitigating biases in LLM development, this approach remains constrained by data quality limitations in health resource-limited settings. Future comparative studies should evaluate co-design versus emerging high-quality primary care dialogue datasets to better understand their relative strengths and applications.

The systemic documentation gaps48, evidenced by missing physician notes, represent both a limitation and an important finding. While our analytical methods account for this missingness, future implementations could leverage PreA reports as documentation aids to address this widespread challenge in high-volume settings. Moreover, while PreA demonstrated potential as a primary-to-specialist care transition aid, its transition into home-based use would represent an optimal future direction that requires addressing systemic barriers, including AI health literacy, connectivity limitations and cross-institutional data sharing, as indicated by other work on co-designing LLMs for primary care settings36.

This study provides preliminary evidence for integrating patient-facing LLMs into hospital workflows. While larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up are needed to establish sustained benefits, cost-effectiveness and generalizability, our findings mark a significant step forward. The demonstrated improvements in workflow efficiency and patient–physician experience indicate that co-designed chatbots can reallocate clinician effort from routine data processing toward more nuanced and meaningful patient interactions. This work underscores co-design with local stakeholders as an effective strategy for deploying LLMs to strengthen health systems and enhance patient-centered care in resource-limited settings.

The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College and the local medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University approved the study. The institutional review boards of the Affiliated Hospital of Gansu Medical College approved the study protocol based on their review and the approval from the medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University. The trial followed the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference of Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. We obtained informed consent from all participants in this study. All participants were informed that this was an exploratory experiment, and the results should not be interpreted as direct guidance for clinical interventions at this stage. This study implemented stringent data protection measures, ensuring that all data were anonymized and encrypted to protect privacy. This trial is registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (identifier ChiCTR2400094159).

PreA's architecture, derived from the co-design with local stakeholders, integrates a patient-facing chatbot and a clinician interface (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The patient interface collects medical history via voice or text, while the clinical interface generates structured referral reports. Within the consultation workflow, patients or their designated caregivers interacted with PreA first; it then generated a referral (Supplementary Table 4) for specialists to review before their standard consultation.

Co-design workshops revealed that standard clinical documentation for common conditions often lacks the granularity for personalized care and omits critical patient-specific details like pre-existing comorbidities. As such, PreA referral reports were intentionally designed to bridge this gap by synthesizing comprehensive, patient-specific information to facilitate rapid documentation and diagnostic decision-making. The architecture was also engineered to support both multidisciplinary consultation (prioritized by primary care physicians) and evidence-based diagnostic reasoning (emphasized by specialist physicians).

PreA's consultation logic underwent a two-cycle co-refinement process to achieve broader utility across diverse socioeconomic patient populations and adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for equitable AI deployment (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The first cycle involved adversarial testing with 120 patients and caregivers, 36 community health workers, 15 physicians and 38 nurses from urban and rural areas across 11 provinces (Beijing, Chongqing, Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang). This participatory refinement enhanced real-world contextualization and mitigated potential disparities in health literacy and workflow integration49. The second cycle employed a virtual patient simulation, specifically modeling low-health-literacy interactions to further optimize the model against co-designed evaluation metrics. Subsequent sections provide further methodological details.

The patient-facing chatbot employs a two-stage clinical reasoning model: inquiry and conclusion. During the inquiry stage, the model was trained to conduct active, multiturn dialogues to gather comprehensive health-related information, adhering to standard guidelines on general medical consultation. In the conclusion stage, the model generated 1–3 differential relevant diagnostic possibilities, each with supporting and refuting evidence to enhance diagnostic transparency and mitigate cognitive anchoring risks50,51.

PreA was configured to generate a referral report for primary-to-care transitions. The report included patient demographics, medical history, chief complaints, symptoms, family history, suggested investigations, preliminary diagnoses, treatment recommendations and a brief summary aligned with clinical reasoning documentation assessment tools (Supplementary Table 4).

To ensure accessibility, the platform supports shared access for patients and their caregivers52. An LLM-driven agent performs real-time intention analysis to facilitate empathetic communication and simplify language for low-literacy users, with outputs formatted as JSON for streamlined processing.

To improve clinical utility under time constraints, the model was optimized to balance comprehensive data gathering with clinical time constraints, targeting 8–10 conversational turns based on local stakeholder feedback. Primary care physician input drove the incorporation of high-yield inquiry strategies, which in pilot testing reduced consultation times by approximately half (within 4 min).

In the adversarial stakeholder testing cycle, we employed prompt augmentation and agent techniques to refine the model, aligning the chatbot with WHO guidelines for ethical AI in primary care while preserving clinical validity53. An evaluation panel consisting of community and clinical stakeholders and one AI-ethics-trained graduate student, conducted iterative feedback cycles, focusing on mitigating harmful, biased or noncompliant outputs via adversarial testing.

In the simulation-based refinement cycle, we used bidirectional exchanges between PreA and a synthetic patient agent to enhance consultation quality. We synthesized 600 virtual patient profiles using LLMs grounded in real-world cases; 50% (n = 300) required interdisciplinary consultation to reflect complex care needs. Five board-certified clinicians validated all profiles for medical plausibility and completeness (achieving 5 of 5 consensus).

The patient agent was built on a knowledge graph architecture54, formalizing patient attributes (demographics, medical history and disease states) as interconnected nodes. The agent was further instructed to emulate common consultation challenges identified by community stakeholders in the first cycle. Interactions concluded automatically upon patient acknowledgment or after ten unresolved inquiry cycles. We randomly chose 300 profiles for refinement and reserved the remainder for comparative simulation studies.

The co-design process identified five consultation quality domains for refinement: efficiency (meeting the patient's demanding time lengths), needs identification (accurate recognition of patient concerns), clarity (concise and clear inquiries and responses), comprehensiveness (thoroughness of information) and friendliness (a respectful and empathetic tone).

PreA's performance was rated across these metrics by a panel of five experts (two primary care physicians, two specialists (one in internal medicine and the other in surgical medicine) and one AI-ethics-trained graduate student). Separately, two primary care physicians assessed referral reports for completeness, appropriateness and clinical relevance using a co-designed, five-point Likert scale (Supplementary Table 5). Scores below 3 triggered further iterative refinement.

We collected audio recordings of primary care consultations from rural clinics and urban community health centers across the 11 Chinese provinces. Provinces were categorized as low-income and high-income based on whether per capita disposable income was below or above the national average (National Bureau of Statistics of China). Local co-design team members who live in these areas manually calibrated the transcripts to ensure validity, as the raw data contained noisy, ambiguous language, interruptions, ungrammatical utterances, nonclinical discourse and implicit references to physical examinations. All conversational data collected was rigorously de-identified in compliance with relevant regulatory standards (HIPAA) before data analysis.

We conducted a comparative simulation study to evaluate the incremental utility of integrating these localized dialogues. Two model variants were compared: the co-designed PreA model and a local data-tuned counterpart, created by fine-tuning the PreA model (OpenAI; ChatGPT-4.0 mini) on the processed primary care dialogues. Notably, the data fine-tuning, applied directly to the base LLM, inherently exerted a higher behavioral priority than the agent techniques and prompting strategies co-designed to instruct the model. Consequently, when behavioral cues conflicted, the model would preferentially adhere to patterns learned from the fine-tuning data.

The virtual patient experiment utilized 300 unused patient profiles to evaluate clinical decision impacts (history-taking, diagnosis and test ordering). Referral reports from both variants were blindly evaluated by the same expert panels as in the PreA development, using validated five-point Likert scales for completeness, appropriateness, and clinical relevance (Supplementary Table 5). Inter-rater reliability for these assessments was high (κ > 0.80), and group comparisons were conducted using the two-tailed nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-tests.

In this pragmatic, multicenter RCT, patients were randomized to use PreA independently (PreA-only), with staff support (PreA-human) or not use it (No-PreA) before specialist consultation. The PreA-human arm was included to assess PreA's autonomous capacity. The primary comparison was between the PreA-only and No-PreA arms, with a secondary comparison between PreA-only and PreA-human arms. The trial's primary end points were to evaluate the effectiveness of the PreA in enhancing operational efficiency and patient-centered care delivery in high-volume hospital settings, as measured by consultation duration, care coordination, and ease of communication. The PreA chatbot used in the RCT was frozen before patient enrolment. Examples of patient interaction with PreA are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–8.

Participants must demonstrate a need for health consultation or express a willingness to engage in PreA health consultations. Other inclusion criteria were (1) aged between 20 years and 80 years; (2) visit the participating physicians at the study medical centers; (3) eligible for communicative interaction via mobile phone; (4) eligible to complete the post-consultation questionnaires; and (5) have signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) the presence of psychological disorders; (2) any other medical events that are determined ineligible for LLM-based conversation; and (3) refusal to sign informed consent. No co-design stakeholders participated in the RCT.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: (1) the PreA-only group, independently interacting with the PreA via mobile phone before their physician consultation; (2) the PreA-human group, interacting with the PreA under the guidance of a medical assistant; and (3) the control group, receiving standard physician-only care (No-PreA). In the PreA-human group, participants were informed that PreA's interface was similar to WeChat, which has been used by hospitals for patient portal registries and hospital visit payments, and were offered technical support. Participants in the PreA-only arm used the tool independently without assistance.

For both PreA-assisted arms, a PreA-generated referral report was provided to specialist physicians for review via the patient's mobile phone before any face-to-face interaction. This design was implemented to prevent direct copying of content into clinical notes. Physicians were requested to rate the report's value for facilitating care. In the No-PreA control arm, physicians reviewed routine reports containing only patient sex and age.

Following consultations, patient and care partner experiences were captured via a post-consultation questionnaire (Supplementary Table 1). Physicians provided feedback at the end of their shifts (Supplementary Table 2).

The primary outcomes were consultation duration, physician-rated care coordination, and patient-rated ease of communication. These metrics were selected based on co-design feedback, which identified time efficiency and care coordination as critical for adoption in high-workload settings, and are established proxies for clinical effectiveness and patient-centered care38.

Secondary outcomes included physician workload (measured as patients seen per shift and compared between participating and matched nonparticipating physicians); patient-reported experiences of physician attentiveness, satisfaction, interpersonal regard and future acceptability; physician-reported assessments of PreA's utility, ease of communication, and workload relief; and clinical decision-making patterns, derived from a quantitative analysis of clinical notes.

Consultation duration, patient volume and clinical notes were extracted from the PreA platform and hospital electronic records. Physician-perceived care coordination was measured via a five-point Likert scale rating the helpfulness of the PreA report in facilitating care. Patient-reported and other physician-reported outcomes were collected using prespecified, five-point Likert scale questionnaires (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These instruments demonstrated robust internal consistency (Cronbach's α > 0.80 for all domains) and face validity, established through iterative feedback from 20 laypersons and five clinicians to ensure relevance to outpatient contexts. Clinical notes were extracted from all three trial arms and included five core clinical reasoning domains: history-taking (chief complaint, history of present illness and past medical history), physical examination, diagnosis, test ordering and treatment plans.

The sample size was calculated for the primary comparison between the PreA-only and No-PreA arms. The target minimum sample size of 2,010 participants (670 per study arm) was prespecified based on a power analysis using preliminary data from the pilot study of 90 patients. This minimum target sample size ensured sufficient power (>80%) for the primary outcome at a significance level of 0.05.

The clinical research team approached adult patients from waiting rooms who were scheduled to see the participating physicians. For pediatric patients or adults without a mobile device, their caregivers were contacted. Interested individuals received a comprehensive study description, which emphasized the exploratory nature of the research and clarified that any advice rendered by PreA serves solely as a reference and should not be utilized as a definitive basis for disease therapy. After providing informed consent and having their questions addressed, eligible individuals who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were formally enrolled. Recruitment was conducted from 8 Feb to 30 April 2025.

Participants were allocated to one of the three groups using an individual-level, computer-generated randomization sequence without stratification. Allocation was concealed to prevent selection bias. This trial was single-blinded: while the patients knew their group assignments (PreA-only, PreA-human, or No-PreA), the physicians were uninformed about the PreA-intervention groups (PreA-only or PreA-human). Furthermore, research staff involved in data analysis remained blinded to group assignments throughout the study.

We assessed baseline covariate balance across the three groups using an ANOVA for continuous variables and a chi-squared test for categorical variables. For intergroup comparisons, we evaluated the distribution of scale values; two-sample Student's t-tests with unequal variances were used for approximately normal data, while a nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test was applied to skewed distributions. All tests were two-tailed with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. The relative treatment effect for the primary comparison (PreA-only versus No-PreA) was calculated as the difference in means divided by the mean of the No-PreA group. Secondary analyses evaluated the consistency of findings across demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Python v.3.7 and R v.4.3.0 were used to perform the statistical analyses and present the results.

We conducted a matched-pairs analysis to assess the impact of PreA on physician workload. Matching criteria included medical specialty, working shift, age group (≤45 years and >45 years), sex, and professional title (chief, associate chief and attending). The outcome is the number of patients seen per clinical shift. A second matched-pairs analysis was conducted to assess the effect on patient waiting times. For this analysis, we matched participating physicians to a distinct control group on the same covariates (replacing working shift with working week to accommodate the matching on patient volume) and the number of patients seen per shift. For both analyses, statistical significance between participating physicians and their matched controls was assessed using two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to account for matched data.

We performed a prespecified classification analysis to detect systematic differences between clinical notes from PreA-assisted arms (PreA-only and PreA-human groups) and the No-PreA arm. A randomly selected subset of notes (PreA-only, n = 291; PreA-human, n = 285; No-PreA, n = 300) was retrieved in compliance with hospital data privacy rules. Notes were partitioned into training and test sets (2:1 ratio). A binary classifier was trained to distinguish PreA-assisted from No-PreA notes, with classification performance evaluated using the F1 score, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall F1 Score=TP/(2TP + FP + FN), where TP, FP and FN denote true positives, false positives and false negatives, respectively. Under the null hypothesis of no intergroup differences, classifier performance would be random. A statistically significant F1 score exceeding this baseline (ΔF1 > 0.02) would indicate distinguishable clinical decision-making patterns attributable to PreA-assisted notes.

The classifier was trained in two stages. First, a Med-BERT encoder generated contextualized embeddings of the clinical notes55. Second, a binary classification layer was trained on these embeddings using supervised SimCSE56, a contrastive learning approach that minimized embedding distance within the PreA-assisted group while maximizing the distance to the No-PreA group. Statistical significance was assessed with one-sided bootstrap tests (1,000 samples).

A prespecified domain-specific analysis further compared clinical decision-making across five domains. For unstructured text (history-taking and physical examination), Med-BERT embeddings were generated and projected into a two-dimensional latent space (UMAP1 and UMAP2) via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for comparative distribution analysis. For structured non-normal count data (number of diagnoses, number of tests ordered and number of treatments), documented counts were compared between groups using nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-tests.

A post hoc analysis evaluated the concordance and quality of PreA-generated referral reports versus physician-authored clinical notes. Agreement was defined as substantial alignment (exact match, near-identical content or inclusion of accepted differential diagnoses). The same expert panel from the comparative simulation studies (two board-certified primary care physicians and two senior residents) performed blinded ratings of report and note quality on a five-point Likert scale for completeness, appropriateness and clinical relevance (Supplementary Table 3). They assessed three domains relevant to primary care referrals: history-taking, diagnosis and test ordering; physical examination and treatment plans were excluded. Each case was evaluated by two experts. The analysis used the same subset of patient cases as the classification analysis. Inter-rater reliability was high (κ > 0.80). Group comparisons were performed using a nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test.

a, The co-designed architecture and clinical integration of PreA. The system comprises a patient-facing chatbot and a clinician interface. Patients first interact with the chatbot, which generates a structured referral report for the specialist to review via the clinician interface prior to standard consultation. b, The two-cycle co-refinement process. The first cycle involved adversarial testing with community and clinical stakeholders. The second cycle used GPT-4-powered virtual patient simulations to optimize the model against co-designed evaluation metrics. c, Experimental comparison of the co-designed PreA model against a local data-tuned counterpart, created by fine-tuning the base PreA model on local primary care dialogs. d, Multicenter randomized controlled trial design. Patients were randomized to one of three arms before specialist consultation: PreA-only (independent use of PreA), PreA-human (staff-supported use of PreA), or a No-PreA control (usual care).

a, By age group. b, By sex. Box plots depict patient consultation time across the three trial arms (PreA-only, PreA-human, No-PreA). The center line indicates the median, the box boundaries the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 × IQR. Dot plots show patient-reported experience metrics (ease of communication, perceived physician attentiveness, interpersonal regard, patient satisfaction, and future acceptability) and physician-reported perceived value on care coordination, with error bars representing standard deviation. Sample sizes for each subgroup are provided in Table 1. We assessed the normality of value distributions and used two-sample t-tests with unequal variances for intergroup comparisons. For significantly skewed dimensions, we employed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-tests. All tests were two-tailed. The Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was applied for multiple testing corrections based on the total number of tests.

C-heteroaryl glycosides, predominantly in unprotected forms, are common entities in bioactive molecules and have extensive applications in chemistry and biology. However, the chemical synthesis of these glycosides remains challenging owing to the lack of methods that directly leverage naturally occurring (native) sugars as substrates. Here we show that fully unprotected native sugars, capped as redox-active glycosyl sulfide donors, can be merged with N-heteroarenes in the presence of triethylamine and a photocatalyst under mild visible-light irradiation. The C–C coupling transformation proceeds with control over chemo-, site- and stereoselectivities and is compatible with a diverse range of N-heteroarenes bearing acidic and basic functional groups. The utility of this method is highlighted by the glycosylation of nucleosides, as well as by the direct coupling of d-mannose with pentoxifylline to generate a compound exhibiting glycogen-metabolism-inhibitory properties. In contrast to previously established mechanisms, the photocatalytic species is found to trigger the in situ generation of a thiyl radical that promotes hydrogen atom transfer to afford the target product, with triethylamine serving as a reductant through photoinduced charge-transfer complexation with the glycosyl sulfide.

The Silicon Heartland is coming along nicely.

Back in 2022, Intel announced its Ohio One project, originally pitched as America's biggest fab complex at one point. Since then, plans have been scaled back, and the project has faced multiple delays amidst internal shakeups — but it was never abandoned. A few months ago, Intel confirmed that Ohio One is still alive and kicking after the company was probed by a U.S. Senator. Today, new job listings posted by the site's contractor hint toward the project finally picking up steam.

Intel Ohio One is back! Bechtel posts loads of new jobs over the last few days looking for managers, welders and electricians to work on the New Albany project. 14A is GO!https://t.co/IgjV07lfDK$INTC pic.twitter.com/UbAZZThbpsJanuary 18, 2026

Bechtel Group's Manufacturing and Technology unit, the construction firm responsible for building the Ohio One, has put up new recruitment offers on its website. At least eight of them directly mention New Albany, the city in Licking County serving as the location for Intel's "Silicon Heartland." Clicking on some of these listings reveals a project overview which says Bechtel is designing and building the first phase of Ohio One, spread across 2.5 million square feet, housing "as much steel as eight Eiffel Towers".

 




Ohio One will start with two fabs, Mod 1 and Mod 2, but the space can accommodate up to eight in the future. The current timeline indicates that these factories will be up and running by at least 2030-2031, which marks a significant delay from the admittedly generous 2025 estimates set at the time of the original announcement. Mod 1 will be ready for production first, with Mod 2 likely follow in a year. By that point, Intel might've already moved past even its next-gen 14A process.

Intel's latest Panther Lake lineup of mobile CPUs is built in the U.S. at its Arizona and Oregon facilities using the company's new 18A node, a major breakthrough for domestic chip manufacturing. But 18A doesn't have big external clients beyond the Blue Team's own needs, something that it desperately wants to change with 14A. Ever since his appointment, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been rather bearish about the node, but just a few days ago, the executive made a sharp reversal in his sentiments.

Ohio One had been long prophesied as the birthplace of 14A, but as things stand right now, that window has likely slipped since 14A is tipped to be production-ready by 2027. Its derivatives, like 14A-E, will have already become a large part of Intel's portfolio before Ohio One even opens its doors. That being said, the project was always intended as a leading-edge logic campus, so any new processes can be taped out in the future. We don't need to speculate that far ahead; let's stick with the present.

The White House released $8.9 billion worth of the remaining CHIPS Act funding to Intel in exchange for a 10% stake in the company last year. Add to that a budding Nvidia partnership worth $5 billion, and we see a revitalized Intel that finally seems competitive again (especially in its Foundry business), accelerating work on Ohio One after years of stagnation. Now, only time will tell exactly who will cut the ribbon at Mod 1 in a few years from now.

Sites used to have banner ads. Now they show posts that look exactly like the organic posts in your feed, just with a small "sponsored", "promoted", or "ad" mark somewhere. Half the time the post is large enough that it takes up my entire screen and the "sponsored" mark is below and off-screen.If you go on Amazon, the "sponsored" text is much smaller and light gray rgb(87,89,89) while the product text is near-black rgb(15,17,17). They want to make the sponsored text less visible. Sometimes it's even unclear if the sponsored tag applies to a single product or a group of products.It's shocking that Apple hasn't done this trick yet when everyone else started doing it years ago.

It's not that shocking — them not doing that is part of why I keep buying their products. I believed their leadership understood that.Looking at the article, the kind interpretation is that this is the same wrong-headed shift towards uniformity at all costs we've seen elsewhere in their products. The less kind interpretation is that they're deliberately blurring the lines with ads. Either way, it erodes away some of the trust that has been their lifeblood for the better part of maybe two decades.

This makes me a bit uncomfortable because of how close it comes to infringing on freedom of speech, and how specific a rule it would for search engines (and chat bots) - i.e. there's no real analogy of "can't target trademarked terms" for any ad format other than search engines.I think my preference would be to simply enforce laws around fraud. If you're a business and you intentionally mislead people, that's fraud, pure and simple. Bring the enforcement hammer down so that companies don't dare make an ad that granny might mistake for not being an ad. Make them err far on the side of making ads look unmistakably like ads for fear of ruinous fines.

That's fine, ads should be downright forbidden and get no "freedom of speech".

reply

It would require conflicts of interest to be disclosed clearly. I.e. labelling speech incentivized by someone else (ad buyer) clearly, as not organic speech (the search engine results).That is pro-transparency and ethics, not anti-speech.

That's specifically what I'm proposing in the post you replied to?



Googling a trademark should activate a "no bids" mode.If Google wants to defend this action, then they should explain why they turned the URL bar into a search product and bought up 90% of the real estate. They've been incredibly heavy handed in search, web, and ads.

From moment on, Google search tanked: from a userexperience perspective and a useracquisition-vehicle perspective. Lots of companies could have been built only Google worked 15years ago the way that Google did work. Lots of companies today do not have the same lane anymore, so spending more and more on advertising....

reply

Fadell might also be a good choice. Either way it should be someone currently outside Apple. The company needs an external eye to review its processes and cruft that built up under Cook (nothing negative against the guy, but what worked 5-10 years ago won't necessarily work 5-10 years down the road).

From 2008-12 it was genuinely exciting to see what new apps were being released every day. Mobile games from that era had cultural impact. I bought $2 apps without a thought.But Apple incentivized monetization above all else and killed that excitement. Now you can't find a tip calculator that doesn't charge a monthly subscription. A popular flight tracker is $60/year (or a $300 purchase). A flash card app costs the same. Apple's curated list of “essential utilities” includes a birthday countdown that costs $5/wk.I know every app will cost me hundreds over the span of just a few years for marginal utility so I simply stopped buying them. And I wonder if Apple's push for more ad revenue is a symptom of that trend.

If you've made a game, it doesn't matter how high quality it is, how many awards it has won, etc.The only thing that matters is that it's live service, that it doesn't "have an end", that it can drive engagement and perpetual revenue.Quite a few testimonies from game devs: according to them, Google representatives pretty much told them this.See also: the requirements to constantly update your app/game even if it's a "finished product" that does not inherently require any updates.

Now, what is left? iPads are great, MacBook with Apple silicon are unmatched in refinement, iPhones are awesome but getting a bit stale. Apple Watch is awesome, but for sports Garmin are better.

You can't tell family to search for things in the app store anymore, I always provide direct links. It's just to dangerous otherwise.

Music.app is simply an ad for Apple Music, Books.app is like reading in a Barnes and Noble while someone from marketing looks over your shoulder and their TV app features their own shows to an overbearing degree — everything else is becoming more of an afterthought.

reply

If you use iTunes Match or load your own MP3s every time you open the app the search field is set to “Apple Music” and the search fails until you toggle it, every time.Been like that for 2+ years

a bigger older problem is the number of copycat applications allowed in the app store.  for example the listing for the official microsoft authenticator app (free and used in many corporate environments) is surrounded by results with similar looking icons and titles.  these look a likes also work for MFA but charge a monthly subscription.  not exactly a scam since they do work, but its obvious they are only there to confuse users into paying for something thats free.

If they haven't switched yet, its not going to happen. Apple knows this. Late users are always punished like my parents who still have a landline and cable tv.

Apple's App Store ad initiatives have always been woeful, and doubt it makes enough revenue to warrant a separate line item on their public accounting reports.  Some executive has seen yet another overfunded company potentially making bank with an ad-based business model (OpenAI, et al.), and has thought they could extract Google-level ad revenue due to the App Store's exclusivity.  It could also be a response to potentially competing App Stores given their rocky relationship with the EU.It will have little effect, on revenue or user experience.  The greater tragedy is the organisational decay that led to this being greenlit in the first place.

Agree. Even GrapheneOS is hell to use. I tried both PixelOS and GrapheneOS on a Pixel 9 and ended up returning it. If I was not homeless I would switch to a flip phone and just use a Linux desktop.

Is it? I feel like that would only be tragic if you expected the App Store monopoly company to care about users instead of profits.For most of us on the sidelines this is a real "told you so" moment.

I think the situation is a lot more stark than this. Unless they're desperate, the board of directors of corporations will install an MBA as CEO. In most cases, the only time this doesn't happen is at the founding of the company, when a founder is CEO. But if the founder doesn't maintain controlling interest, the founder can be replaced.The promotion of Steve Jobs to interim CEO of Apple in 1997 was a rare exception. Apple fired its CEO, and the company was in danger of bankruptcy. They were running out of options and feeling the aforemention desperation. Note how the situation was very different in 1985, when the board of directors chose John Sculley over Steve Jobs in a power struggle. At the time, they weren't financially desperate.

Frankly, Apple could have probably just totally replaced the App Store a long time ago if they were not slaves to financial reports by simply integrating app search into spotlight more closely or prominently… pull down, search “ai app” (or whatever) and you're provided with a list of app results that includes an install button.App updating could and should have been integrated into the settings app.These kinds of things will only increasingly start biting the Apple as Google has been forced to face the abyss of the death of the common search they've dominated for decades now. I don't think Apple has faced that existential Grim-reaper yet… what do you do when the app ecosystem, OS UI/UX advantages, and even hardware quality has vanished through the cascading integration of AI? I don't know that Apple has faced that yet or at least has been left blindsided, considering what I've been seeing from them.

When Preeti Suri reached the summit of Mount Rainier, she wasn't just celebrating a mountaineering milestone; she was completing a transformation from burned out investment banker to founder on a mission.

Suri is co-founder and CEO of Bellevue, Wash.-based AdventureTripr, a travel marketplace leveraging technology and AI to help facilitate multi-day outdoor excursions.

Launched just one month before the 2020 pandemic lockdown, the company has scaled today to a profitable platform offering 500 trips across 50 countries, fueled by a lean team and a “tech-first” approach to travel curation.

AdventureTripr has found success in dismantling the economic and social-cultural barriers that often keep people of color and first-time hikers away from the world's most iconic trails and peaks.

The discovery enjoyed by customers started with Puri's own realization about the benefits of the outdoors, which was paved by her exhaustion with the corporate grind. A former CPA and investment banker in London, Suri found herself at a breaking point.

“I was like, ‘This is not what I want to do the rest of my life. I'm just making rich people richer. It's not fulfilling,'” Suri said.

Moving to Seattle as a new mom brought a different challenge: postpartum depression and a loss of physical stamina. She began hiking Washington's trails as a form of therapy, carrying her baby on her back. As her son grew, so did her ambition. She eventually climbed every major Washington volcano, a journey she describes as “absolutely transformational” for her mental health.

She thought to herself: “I want to enable that for others.”

With multi-day adventure trips from major U.S. operators such as Backroads and REI priced as high as $7,000 per person, Suri recognized a gap in the market. And she knew costs could be lowered by working directly with local guides. 

She also understood that many South Asian travelers felt a sense of “intimidation and hesitation” because they hadn't grown up in a hiking culture.

“A lot of the U.S. companies assumed a lot of the people of color either didn't know how to do this stuff or didn't want to do this stuff, whereas my insight was it was a lot of aspiration,” Suri said. “They need a bit more hand-holding.”

While the company's clientele has balanced out over time, roughly 40% of its business still comes from a high-net-worth South Asian demographic — a “sweet spot” of customers who value the personalized training plans and gear guidance AdventureTripr provides.

Alongside co-founder Marat Khabibullin, a longtime software engineer at Microsoft, Suri integrated AI into AdventureTripr's workflow long before it became a mainstream buzzword, scaling more rapidly than legacy adventure companies. 

“It takes us 15 minutes to upload a new trip because we have AI tools built for that and to create our content,” Suri said.

The company is also currently developing AI agents to handle tasks such as answering traveler questions about gear or local tipping customs. But Suri remains skeptical of the “AI travel planner” trend that is popular among many startups.

“People who like to piece things together will continue piecing things together,” she said. “Curation and customization is where the expert knowledge comes into play. … There is so much significance to the human element of human connection.”

AdventureTripr employs about 20 full-time and freelance employees. The company, which generates revenue from bookings, raised approximately $500,000 in pre-seed funding in 2021 from advisors and clients.

Looking back at her banking days, Suri says she works just as hard now but without the looming threat of burnout. Fulfillment comes from seeing clients — ranging from cancer survivors to groups of 40 Indian moms — conquer treks like Machu Picchu or the Tour du Mont Blanc.

“It doesn't feel like work anymore,” Suri said. “It is changing lifestyles, changing people's lives. I wouldn't trade it for anything.”

What happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you? 

That's not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user's inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors. 

“In the agent's mind, it's doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week's episode of Equity. “It's trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”

Meftah's example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom's AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. 

Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic's portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. 

Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI's fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.

“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren't going rogue, aren't deleting files, aren't doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. 

Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.

“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said. 

As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there's room for many approaches.

Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.

Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.

“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn't easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat them?”

For his part, Caccia doesn't want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider. 

“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.

It's a bad day for both PlayStation Network trophy hunters and fans of inanimate objects with an inexplicable penchant for jumping. Sony appears to have removed the entire catalog of games published by ThiGames, a German company whose output was known primarily for its popularity with gamers looking to flaunt their 100% completion of as many titles as possible.

Nuking ThiGames' catalog meant removing a lot of games. The sudden disappearance of the company from Sony's online store was first noted by Twitch streamer Rob Thanatos, who accompanied his report with a screenshot, apparently from the site TrueTrophies.com, that suggested the publisher had a scarcely believable 1194 PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 for sale. The next day, the site Delisted Games—which catalogs games that are, for whatever reason, no longer available to purchase—goes into more detail about this number, noting that it counts various translations and regional variations as individual titles; when this multiple counting is removed, the number shrinks to a more sensible 150 or so.

In any case, the games in ThiGames' catalog seem to have shared one thing in common: they're what's referred to as “shovelware,” the metaphor being that they are shoveled out the studio's door with no regard for quality. (And in 2026, the advent of vibe coding and AI-generated assets no doubt makes wielding the shovel easier than ever.)

While games like The Jumping Bonbon, The Jumping Strawberry, and The Jumping Onion Ring have a certain outsider-y charm to them, any popularity they enjoyed with PSN subscribers appears to have been largely because they make it easy to earn Platinum Trophies, which are awarded for obtaining all of a game's individual trophies. (For those without a PlayStation, trophies are similar to achievements on other platforms—you obtain them for completing certain objectives within a given game.)

The obvious conclusion here is that Sony decided that it didn't want its store filled with… well, let's say “games of low quality.” Some commentators are describing the removal of these games as a long-overdue exercise in house cleaning and celebrating the fact that their visits to the PlayStation store will involve less time slogging through titles about jumping thingamajigs in search of real games to play.

But ThiGames aren't the only company to cash in on gamers' thirst for trophies; there are many others whose entire output is predicated on the desire for bragging rights. In addition, several users on Twitter have pointed out that it's not clear whether Sony would have the right to just unilaterally ban a publisher's entire catalog based on a decision that those games kinda sucked. This has led to speculation that the publisher must have done something more egregious than just flooding the PlayStation store with unabashed slop.

Neither party immediately responded to a request for comment. We'll update this post when we receive a reply.

          And it's making us even more excited for the rumored PlayStation 6 handheld.

HBO's newest George R.R. Martin adaptation takes place in the same world as House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones, but in a different time period—we're long past the Dance of the Dragons, but also long before Daenerys Targaryen returned to Westeros and started clawing her power back.

But don't let the lack of familiar characters turn you away: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms introduces new faces you'll quickly grow to love, loathe, or feel both ways about depending on their unpredictable actions. It also explores Westeros from the point of view of a hedge knight as tall as he is humble.



We open on a grim scene: on a hillside in the driving rain, a very tall man—alone aside from his three horses—digs a grave and lowers the body of a much older man into it. This is Dunk (Peter Claffey) tending to his master, Ser Arlen of Pennytree (Danny Webb), whose passing sets the events of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms in motion.

After many years as a squire, Dunk is ready to figure out the rest of his life; he's not sure what lies ahead. All he knows is what he's been taught by Ser Arlen—the rough life of a hedge knight—mixed with the grit and tenacity baked into him during his early childhood in Flea Bottom, the most perilous part of King's Landing.

First, though, there's a makeshift funeral that must happen. Not knowing what to say, Dunk must improvise: “You were a true knight. You never beat me when I didn't deserve it… except that time in Maidenpool.”

This odd assessment of Ser Arlen's good judgment is accompanied by rapid-fire flashbacks of Dunk at various ages being smacked on many occasions. It's a quick sequence, but it shows us Dunk's resilience and commitment to honesty and truth. It also begins to give us an idea of his relationship with Ser Arlen, a mentor he misses despite all the knocks. “I wish you didn't die, Ser,” he says tearfully, and promises to look after the horses.

He also keeps Ser Arlen's sword, and that's what helps him decide his next move. “There is a tourney at Ashford Meadow,” he says wistfully.

Here, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms does what you'd expect a Game of Thrones show to do: it starts playing that unmistakable Game of Thrones theme music. Dunk looks purposeful. Determined. His hero's journey is taking shape. But then, just as the music begins to swell louder, we cut to Dunk… pooping behind a tree. Like, projectile pooping. Thinking about the life-or-death stakes involved in entering a tournament has, unsurprisingly, made his stomach lurch. But it doesn't deter him: next stop, Ashford.

The title appears onscreen without an opening credits sequence. This isn't the Westeros you're used to seeing on HBO; A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is far more simple and stripped-down. But as we'll come to see, despite its (sometimes crass) sense of humor, it can also be just as brutal as Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon.

It's now dark, and Dunk and his horses approach a country inn. A small boy with a gleaming bald head appears. We know, of course, that this is Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell)—and if you know who Egg is beyond that, HBO would like you to keep that to yourself for now. Ahem. Anyway, the first meeting of this soon-to-be duo is a case of mistaken identity on many levels. Dunk assumes the kid is a stableboy, albeit one with an attitude problem. (For those who've read Martin's source novella, here's where we get our first of many “clout in the ear” threats Dunk makes, but never carries out, across the series.)

Dunk heads into the inn to deal with his hunger. The proprietor explains most folks in the area have headed to Ashford to watch the tourney. She doesn't get it, she says: “Knights are built the same as other men, and I never knew a joust to change the price of eggs.”

The only other customer in the inn is a man passed out drunk—at least, until he pops his head up, blearily stares at Dunk, brandishes a knife, and blurts out, “I dreamed of you. Stay the fuck away from me, you hear?”

A perplexed Dunk watches as the man slaps down a coin bearing a three-headed dragon sigil (hmm, looks familiar) and stumbles out. It's an unsettling encounter and the weirdness increases when Dunk heads back to the stable and finds the bald kid goofing around with his armor and his best horse.

Initially apologetic, the little boy soon turns saucy, sniffing that Dunk sure doesn't look like a knight. Then he has the temerity to beg Dunk to take him to the tourney. A knight needs a squire, after all! Dunk's annoyance softens when he finds out the kid is motherless. This is familiar to Dunk, who grew up an orphan. But he still turns down the offer to take on a pint-sized assistant.

The next morning, we see Dunk riding into Ashford Meadow. A bustling camp has sprung up around the tourney grounds—Dunk pauses to take in the jousting ring—with a modest-sized castle perched on the hill above. Intent on entering the lists, he's directed to the games master, thwacking his head on the door frame as he enters.

The awkwardness continues. The steward of Ashford (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor)—an oily-looking man who pauses to dramatically hock up phlegm while they're talking—gives him a hard time about not looking like a knight, even after Dunk tells him the very earnest story about Ser Arlen knighting him just before he died.

The steward doubts his story—as do we, to be honest—but he pulls the gullible Dunk's leg by describing how Ashford town will torture anyone who pretends to be a knight.

Dunk grows weary of this humiliation. But the games master shows a shred of kindness as Dunk turns to leave. If Dunk can find “a true knight” to vouch for Ser Arlen, and by extension speak to Dunk's good honor, he'll allow him to enter—though he reminds Dunk that anyone who loses in the tourney forfeits their arms, armor, and horse to the victor, and must ransom them back. It's a reality check for Dunk, who has no money for ransom, and he bashes his head again on the same doorframe as he leaves the room.

Intent on finding a knight to support his entry, he heads to the pavilion of Ser Manfred Dondarrian (Daniel Monks), hoping he'll remember Ser Arlen. But Ser Manfred is napping, and Dunk draws some snarky attention from the ladies of the night who're hanging around the tent. “It's a hedge knight, aint it?” one says to the other, and explains, “It's like a knight, but sadder.”

As he walks away, vowing to track down Ser Manfred later, he mutters to his horse about being called “sad.” And anyway, “Ser Arlen always said a hedge knight was the truest kind of knight.” As we'll continue to see, Dunk's chats with his horses—and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' fondness for flashbacks—helps get around the fact that Martin's stories are written as Dunk's internal monologues, without resorting to voiceover.

Dunk's grumbling is interrupted when he sees two men practicing their combat skills in the practice ring. This is Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) and his younger cousin, Raymun (Shaun Thomas), who's his squire and recreational punching bag. Ser Steffon is very blustery and aggressive, challenging Dunk to fight him next, but Dunk turns him down.

What he really needs is some peace and quiet. He finds it in the nearby forest, where Dunk gets a chance to clean up a bit (you can check “bare butt” off your Game of Thrones bingo card) before venturing back for another crack at Ser Manfred. No dice: he's still asleep, and the snarky ladies take another crack at Dunk.

“Must you mock me? I was only asking for a bit of help,” he complains.

They're sorry, sort of, but there'll be no talking to Ser Marfred tonight. Dunk wanders off into the camp, finding a puppet show in progress.

“Fate has set his lonely path through corridors of chance,” we hear from the stage. “A boy from nothing risks it all, ignoring looks askance.”

The story—which certainly has a double meaning in this context—continues as Dunk draws closer, as an actor playing a knight faces a wonderfully elaborate dragon puppet onstage. It breathes fire and the crowd gasps, but Dunk is more taken with the pretty young woman narrating the performance. As he's walking away, he hears someone call out “Half-man!”

A little Tyrion Lannister callback for Game of Thrones fans, but in this case it's the scrappy Raymun Fossosay making a joke, because Dunk is obviously “half-man, half-giant.” Raymun asks Dunk if he's hungry. “Always,” he admits. He follows Raymun into a tent decorated with antlers: this is Baratheon territory. Here's where we first spy Ser Lyonel Baratheon, “the Laughing Storm,” a charismatic, drunken maniac wearing a crown festooned with more of those giant antlers. It's a colorful, bawdy gathering, and at some point, the Laughing Storm takes notice of the giant stranger in his midst.

Dunk is motioned over, and Ser Lyonel's opening line is an all-timer: “You ever been punched in the face before?” The encounter starts off light (Ser Lyonel chastizes him for slouching and tells him “Be tall”), but it gets more prickly—and Dunk is rightfully intimidated as hell by this wealthy, powerful, eccentric lord who gives him a hard time for crashing his party. But then, the mood lightens again. “Do you like dancing?” Ser Lyonel asks.

Cut to the ridiculous sight of Dunk tearing up the dance floor with Ser Lyonel, who gets more wild-eyed and wasted as the night progresses. Eventually, they're huddled up at Lyonel's table, and Dunk earnestly confides his fears. Sure, he's big and strong, but he hasn't had the training most knights at this tourney have had. “What chance do I have?” he wonders.

“You have no chance,” Ser Lyonel chuckles. “But it's a great honor to test oneself against a worthy foe.”

Dunk points out that it's easy for a rich lord to say that. If Dunk loses, he'll be left with nothing. “What should I do?” he asks. Lyonel has no answer, and stumbles off, leaving Dunk to ponder his choices.

Just then, he spies the elusive Ser Manfred swanning out of the tent. Dunk seizes the moment, earnestly pleading his case. But it's all for nothing. Ser Manfred doesn't remember Ser Arlen and he doesn't care about Dunk entering the tournament. All that effort was for nothing, and Dunk is snootily dismissed.

Defeated, Dunk heads back to his camp to find… that pesky bald kid roasting fish over a cozy fire. He puts up a blustery front, but after the day he's had, the boy just about passes for a friendly face.

“What's your name?” the kid asks.

“Ser Duncan the Tall,” Dunk says, pulling himself up to his full height.

The kid sniffs that he's never heard of Ser Duncan the Tall, then reveals his own name is Egg. After a moment, Dunk reluctantly agrees he can serve him for the tourney.

The smile on Egg's face is everything as Dunk explains he doesn't have much, but he will always share. Plus: “I promise not to beat you, except when you deserve it.” When Egg calls him “M'lord,” he corrects him. “Ser. I'm only a hedge knight.” And there's a small smile on Dunk's face at that.

Lying on their bedrolls, the duo spots a shooting star. Egg says it's good luck, and also points out that they're probably the only ones to have seen it, since all the fancy knights are in their pavilions.

Dunk is still grumpy, and this takes a minute to sink in.

“So the luck is ours alone?” Dunk says, his voice full of genuine wonder, and we see that same smile on Egg's face.

The stage is set. The band of two is together. Will Dunk find someone to vouch for him so he can enter the lists?

TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images. 

The product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.  

After learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.

The technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch. 

He hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,  

Bustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis. 

Bustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome. 

“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.  

The CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.  

Now with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies' next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health. 

“We're positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.  

This piece was updated to correct the spelling of the co-founder's name.

Grab this awesomely cheap OLED monitor before it sells out


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


You don't need to pay an obscene amount to enjoy the benefits of a new OLED monitor, thanks to this awesome gaming monitor deal. The 26.5-inch Acer Predator X27U is on sale right now at Amazon, bringing the price down by 22% to a new record low.

That means you'll be paying just $429.99 for the Acer Predator X27U – if you're quick enough to buy it, that is. Our Acer Predator X27U review confirms just what a good option for gamers this is, grabbing a near-perfect 4.5-star score due to its stunning, impossible-to-resist picture quality.

First things first, if you're coming from an older LCD display, you'll be seeing (quite literally) a serious upgrade with a move to a QD-OLED panel like this one. Compared to LCD, OLED panels offer much higher peak brightness levels and much more vibrant color output. The end result is that big cinematic games, along with movies, will be great to watch on the X27U, especially HDR content, with this monitor offering HDR10 support. QD-OLED is the better of the two main OLED panel types, too, thanks to superior color volume and better power efficiency.

All-time low price 

This Acer Predator X27U display features a 26.5-inch QD-OLED panel with a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. A 240Hz refresh rate makes it a great option for fast-paced gaming, with AMD FreeSync support to deal with any screen tearing.

The Acer Predator X27U offers a max resolution of up to 2,560 x 1,440. 1440p gaming on an OLED is a serious step up over 1080p, while also remaining much less demanding for a mid-tier GPU to match. It has a fast 240Hz refresh rate to avoid messy motion blurring in any fast-paced games you play, with AMD FreeSync Premium support to eliminate screen tearing completely.

With two HDMI 2.1 and two DisplayPort 1.4 connections apiece, you're free to hook up your full kit to this monitor: PC, laptop, consoles, and handhelds will also work here. This is a budget-friendly OLED gaming monitor, but you're not seeing too many compromises on build quality, with a fully ergonomic stand that includes tilt, swivel, pivot, and height adjustments. You've also got two 3W speakers included, which, in a pinch, will help you get gaming without a suitable headset.

A $429.99 sale price makes this Acer Predator X27U gaming monitor one of the most approachable options for an OLED upgrade to your gaming setup. This price is a new record low, but don't expect it to stick around for too long.

Modders have already showcased some stunning achievements in Hytale, the hot new sandbox RPG that hit Early Access last Tuesday. Our headline singles out engineer Sadat Sahib (AKA iamcxv7), who has managed to get Windows 95 to run inside the new game. The Hytale experience and extensive creator toolset have led to some pundits describing it as Minecraft 2.0.

The above video shows Windows 95 seemingly running without any major hiccups. Interaction seems laborious, but we feel that's because of a joypad being used as a controller. If a PC mouse and keyboard could be used instead, we'd see greater potential.

Sahib's social media feed reveals that he's been busy doing more than just shoehorning Microsoft's legendary OS into this sandbox RPG. Earlier today, this pioneering Hytale modder managed the inception-worthy feat of running Hytale in Hytale…

The same modder has also managed to get Minecraft running in Hytale, delivering a fatal wound to its spiritual predecessor, perhaps.

What about Doom, we hear you ask? It seems like emulating Doom is such a pushover nowadays that a modder managed to get it to run inside this sandbox RPG even before it was released.

With all of these amazing modding achievements under its belt, within one week of Early Access launch, there are surely many great things to come.

Hytale is one of the hottest games of 2026, with obvious parallels between the sandbox RPG experience and Minecraft. It came about from efforts of the Hypixel Minecraft team, with roots stretching back to 2015. The development has been through some peaks and troughs, with the project even being cancelled in June 2025, but its subsequent revival by the original creator was clearly a canny move.

There is already a thriving Hytale modding community, and this is not by accident. Hytale has been built from the ground up for modding, with “creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.” That's in addition to the more traditional fun of “exploration, responsive combat, and robust building.” The game developer's modding strategy was outlined last November.

Hytale made an almighty splash when it entered Early Access last week. Reports say there were 2.8 million Hytale players on launch day, and 420,000+ Twitch viewers made it the global No.1 watched game, too. The aforementioned cancellation/revival drama helped kindle the hype on the way.

If you haven't checked your Facebook account in a while, fear not, the spam accounts are still doing very well. Now with eerie and ever-advancing AI slop in their arsenal—and, lately, football fans to prey on.

There's a group of accounts on Facebook that claims to be a bunch of fan accounts for various National Football League teams. But a quick scroll through these pages, each sporting a couple thousand followers, reveals misinformation paired with a series of seemingly AI-generated photos. Based on the comment sections of these photos and the amount of likes some of them get, people are fully believing what they post.

“After His Desire To Return To The Steelers Was Not Fulfilled, Instead Of Reacting With Anger Or Resentment, The Former Player Chose To Retire And Join The Pittsburgh Police Department To “Wear Pittsburgh Colors Once Again.” a Pittsburgh Steelers fan account with 11,000 followers claimed in a post earlier this week. The post does not mention the name of the so-called player but is accompanied by a seemingly AI-generated image of former football wide receiver Adam Thielen in police uniform. Thielen recently announced his retirement, and briefly played for the Steelers late last year. He has not shared any plans to join Pittsburgh law enforcement.

Another such account, a Denver Broncos fan account with more than 6,000 followers called “Wild Horse Warriors,” found a victim not in a player, but in Broncos reporter Cody Roark. A post with an AI-generated image of Roark holding a child claimed that he had passed away following a domestic violence incident and left behind a 5-year-old child. Not only was Roark alive and well, he doesn't even have kids to begin with.

“Usually you see that happen to, like, high-profile celebrities,” Roark told The Denver Post. “For that to happen to me was just really weird.”

The account was just created in November and has now been shut down by Meta after The Denver Post reached out for comment. In its two-month existence, the account reportedly disseminated a slew of misinformation posts about Broncos players as well, including a false claim that wide receiver Courtland Sutton refused to wear an LGBTQ+ solidarity armband during a game. But even though “Wild Horse Warriors” is now a thing of the past, similar accounts continue to proliferate on Facebook. One such account, called “Broncos Stampede Crew,” made the same LGBTQ+ armband claim about Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. The phone number attached to that account appears to be based in Vietnam.

What do these accounts have to gain from fake AI-generated news about football players? While it's not certain how these specific accounts operate, the pattern seems to fit what has long been utilized by Facebook spam accounts. Each post by these fake fan accounts links out to an article from a website that pretends to be a reputable news organization like “ESPNS” or “NCC News.”

“Spam Pages largely leveraged the attention they obtained from viewers to drive them to off-Facebook domains, likely in an effort to garner ad revenue,” Harvard researchers wrote in a study from 2024. These websites are usually “heavily ad-laden content farm domains—some of which themselves appeared to consist of primarily AI-composed text.”

Other pages could be trying to accumulate an audience and good standing with the algorithm by using these fake shock-value clickbait news stories first, before completely changing the purpose of the page.

“It could be that these were nefarious pages that were trying to build an audience and would later pivot to trying to sell goods or link to ad-laden websites or maybe even change their topics to something political altogether,” Georgetown researcher Josh Goldstein told NPR in a 2024 interview about AI spam accounts on Facebook.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged a Venezuelan national, 59-year old Jorge Figueira, with laundering around $1 billion of illicit funds on behalf of criminals. Figueira is alleged to have used multiple bank accounts, crypto exchange accounts, crypto wallets, and shell companies to conduct his money laundering operation.

“The FBI has identified approximately a billion dollars' worth of cryptocurrency that was passed through crypto wallets utilized by Figueira and his laundering operation to individuals and businesses throughout the world,” said FBI Special Agent Reid Davis according to a DOJ press release.

Court documents say Figueira mainly conducted his crypto activities in the stablecoin issued by Tether, known as USDT, on the Tron blockchain. A recent report released by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis found that stablecoins are becoming increasingly used in illicit crypto transactions, now accounting for 84% of such transactions after only amounting to roughly 12% of that activity in 2020. The report also indicated last year's record year of $154 billion in illicit crypto transfers was mostly due to use by nation states, such as Iran and Venezuela, to avoid sanctions.

According to a report in DL News, Figueira is quoted touting the benefits of using USDT for money laundering on a phone call cited in court documents. “Let me be clear with you, [USDT] is used a lot for laundering money,” Figueira is quoted as saying.

Notably, Tron is also the crypto network founded by Justin Sun, who is at the heart of pay-to-play allegations made by House Democrats against the SEC due to Sun's involvement with multiple crypto projects linked to President Trump. Tron is generally viewed as a more centralized little brother to Ethereum; however, it is widely used for USDT transfers due to offering faster and cheaper transactions.

In addition to the $1 billion in illicit crypto processing identified by the DOJ, court documents indicate Figueira was also bragging about processing up to $700 million worth of illicit funds on a monthly basis. The Venezuelan man faces a maximum of 20 years in prison related to the charges.

The heavy use of crypto in Venezuela by both the regime and its citizens is well-documented. Roughly a week ago, Tether froze $182 million worth of USDT around the same time a detailed report on Venezuela's use of the stablecoin to avoid economic sanctions was released in The Wall Street Journal.

Crypto can be a double-edged sword for authoritarian regimes, as another recent report pointed to the massive increase in withdrawals from centralized crypto exchanges to the non-custodial Bitcoin network in Iran are a sign people are opting out of the traditional financial system in an effort to avoid the devaluation of the Iranian rial and potential capital controls amid nationwide protests. In other words, authoritarian regimes use crypto to avoid restrictions imposed by other nations (namely the United States), and the people living under those regimes use crypto to avoid restrictions imposed locally on them.

The crypto industry has become increasingly centralized around stablecoins like USDT, despite their growing use for illicit purposes. The GENIUS Act created a regulatory structure for these dollar-pegged tokens in the United States last year, and the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial has its own stablecoin, USD1, which is at the center of another pay-for-play allegation associated with the pardon of the former CEO of crypto exchange Binance.

Everyone from large tech giants to traditional banks are now interested in launching stablecoins, but whether they'll be allowed to move around freely despite continued criminal use remains to be seen. Then again, legal action like that taken against Figueira indicates there are plenty of eyes tracking the movement of stablecoins on the blockchain anyway, and Tether has made it clear that it's actively working with many law enforcement agencies around the world on a regular basis to guard against criminal activity.

As people age, structural brain changes influence their ability to adapt to the environment. New from eNeuro, Tatiana Wolfe and colleagues at the University of Arkansas characterized changes in the brain across two periods of adulthood that may correspond to changes in adaptive behavior. 

The researchers identified brain areas associated with the ability to adapt to the environment by analyzing previous neuroimaging studies. They then used a publicly accessible database-the Human Connectome Project-to identify different structures that enable these brain areas to communicate and work together to promote adaptive behavior. Structures related to shifting between tasks or updating information about the environment were more strongly linked to adaptive behaviors in older adults compared to younger adults. A separate imaging dataset from the UK Biobank revealed that biological features of these structures that older individuals rely more heavily upon deteriorated over time in a way that may be linked to deficits in behavioral adaptability that arise later in adulthood. 

According to the researchers, this work supports the idea that brain structures linked to the brain's ability to adapt to the environment undergo age-related changes and point to potential measures for identifying these changes.

A new study examines the potential impact of the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan (M3P) - an opt-in policy implemented in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act that allows beneficiaries to spread out of pocket (OOP) costs over the calendar year - on Medicare Part D beneficiaries with cancer who face high out-of-pocket (OOP) prescription drug costs. Many cancer patients enrolled in Part D incur thousands of dollars in OOP expenses at the start of the year to quickly reach the catastrophic coverage threshold, after which cost-sharing drops to zero. For patients living on fixed or limited incomes, these large upfront payments can be unmanageable, contributing to delayed treatment initiation, medication nonadherence, financial distress and poorer health outcomes.

Using Medicare 2022 claims data from a national sample of beneficiaries with cancer, the researchers analyzed when patients typically reach the catastrophic cap and modeled how M3P could alter payment patterns. The analysis found that nearly half of Medicare Part D beneficiaries with cancer are projected to reach the annual OOP cap, with about one-third doing so as early as January 2025. Under current structures, this results in highly front-loaded costs. Enrollment in M3P - which allows beneficiaries to spread OOP payments evenly across the year - substantially reduced monthly payment volatility, particularly for those who reach catastrophic coverage early, and could help mitigate cost-related nonadherence.

Importantly, the study highlights that awareness and uptake of M3P remain extremely low, limiting its potential benefits. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that 2.4 million (6 %) of Part D beneficiaries could benefit from enrolling in M3P. Aryana Sepassi, PharmD, MAS, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of California San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and colleagues conclude that making the program automatic, rather than opt-in, could significantly expand its impact, reduce financial burden for vulnerable patients, and support more consistent adherence to life-sustaining cancer therapies.

The study was published Jan. 15, 2026, in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a widely used and prominent class of targeted therapeutics, especially in cancer treatment.

These complex biomolecules are specifically engineered to selectively deliver therapeutic agents to target cells by linking them to monoclonal antibodies. The safety profile and effectiveness of ADCs are impacted by the selection of their components, such as the antibody, therapeutic agent, and linker. They are also significantly affected by the chemical method used for their conjugation.

ADC development currently utilizes two primary strategies for the attachment of therapeutic agents to antibodies: site-specific conjugation and random (stochastic) conjugation.

The selected method considerably affects the resulting ADC's stability, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, homogeneity, and overall therapeutic index.

The random conjugation method uses naturally occurring reactive residues on the antibody to streamline ADC preparation and reduce technical barriers to a considerable degree.

Its key features of rapid reaction kinetics, native compatibility, and controllable efficiency are in close alignment with the core demands of early-stage ADC development, including fast iteration, the availability of multiple batches, and low cost.

Random conjugation methods have been widely adopted in commercial ADCs like Adcetris and Kadcyla as a result of their robustness for manufacturing. These methods generally target naturally occurring amino acid residues.

Lysine conjugation uses the epsilon-amine groups of lysine residues. There is an abundance of these residues on the antibody surface. Amide bonds are formed via this approach, but the large number of potential conjugation sites can lead to a heterogeneous mixture with variability in the Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR).

Cysteine conjugation targets free thiol groups (-SH) produced by reducing the antibody's interchain disulfide bonds. This approach offers more control over the DAR versus lysine conjugation, but conjugates formed using maleimide chemistry at these sites may be susceptible to deconjugation in plasma as a result of thiol exchange reactions with albumin. This can limit the ADC's stability.

Site-specific conjugation strategies, on the other hand, produce a more homogeneous ADC population with a defined attachment point and a precise DAR. This approach is typically anticipated and expected to result in more predictable PK profiles, enhanced stability, and potentially a wider therapeutic window.

Engineered Cysteine (THIOMABs) involves the use of genetic engineering to introduce defined cysteine mutations at carefully selected sites on the antibody. This approach allows precise control over the location and number of conjugation points.

Enzymatic methods utilize enzymes, such as microbial transglutaminase (mTGase), which can recognize specific engineered peptide sequences on the antibody to catalyze conjugation at defined residues.

Non-Natural Amino Acid (nnAA) incorporation is a sophisticated technique that uses genetic code expansion to incorporate distinct chemical handles (for instance, azides) into the antibody structure. These handles can then be used for extremely efficient, bioorthogonal "click chemistry" conjugation.

Site-specific conjugation boasts reduced off-target toxicity and high homogeneity, making it ideally suited to large-scale manufacturing and late-stage development.

Non-site-specific conjugation, on the other hand, emphasizes flexibility, speed, and broad applicability, addressing the key need for scenario adaptability and efficiency in early-phase research.

Each of these methodologies offers specific benefits that make them better suited to distinct stages of ADC research and development.

Employing the most appropriate conjugation technology is key to ensuring successful ADC design and development, whether this involves initial high-throughput screening or later-stage clinical optimization.

ACROBiosystems has introduced its ADC Conjugation Kit, which delivers a precise, rapid, and robust ADC preparation process. These kits, based on interchain cysteine conjugation technology, are designed to accelerate the research cycle within this evolving landscape.

The ADC Conjugation Kit reduces antibody disulfide bonds to generate reactive cysteine residues for non-site-specific maleimide conjugation. This classic approach facilitates rapid, controlled ADC preparation, requiring just three hours to acquire ADC conjugates with homogeneous DAR.

Conjugates created via this approach exhibit significant cytotoxicity, making them a robust tool for mechanistic studies and ADC screening.

Autoimmune drug development increasingly recognizes that the Fc-FcR axis is more than an effector mechanism; it is a controllable immunological node that bridges humoral and cellular responses.

This axis is responsible for two complementary regulatory tasks: Fc gamma receptors mediate effector functions by maintaining a dynamic balance of intracellular "activation" and "inhibition" signals.

The Fc-FcR axis activates Fc gamma receptors (most notably, FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa) via ITAMs to signal through the Src/Syk pathways. It also drives phagosome formation, actin remodeling, oxidative burst, and transcriptional programs that underpin ADCC, ADCP, and pro‑inflammatory cytokine release.

The inhibitory FcγRIIb also transmits ITIM‑dependent brake signals able to limit B‑cell activation and the responsiveness of effector cells. The functional or genetic loss of FcγRIIb shifts this balance toward pathogenic activation.

At the same time, the Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) binds to IgG in endosomes' acidic environment, protecting it from lysosomal degradation and recycling it back into the bloodstream. This function effectively extends the half-life of IgG.

The excessive retention of pathogenic IgG is a key driver of pathology in many antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, meaning that blocking the FcRn-IgG interaction accelerates pathogenic antibody clearance, creating an efficient and rapid path toward the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Therapeutic approaches tend to be centered around three complementary aims: the rapid reduction of pathogenic IgG, the recalibration of FcγR‑mediated effector function, and the induction of antigen‑specific tolerance.

FcRn inhibitors exemplify the first of these aims, accelerating IgG catabolism and quickly reducing the number of circulating pathogenic antibodies. Clinical validation in antibody-mediated disorders has shown that IgG depletion has the potential to translate into rapid symptomatic benefit when disease activity correlates with antibody burden.

Fc engineering addresses the second of these aims by tuning both pharmacokinetics and effector function. This results in half-life-extending mutations (for instance, YTE or LS) that improve FcRn affinity to prolong exposure.

Engineered Fc variants able to preferentially engage the inhibitory FcγRIIb can potentially blunt B‑cell activation and downstream autoantibody production without significantly impairing host defenses.

Antigen–Fc fusion constructs and glycoengineering are targeted strategies able to induce tolerance or bias effector phenotypes. For example, MOG Fc-style constructs have the capacity to direct antigen delivery to tolerogenic pathways, while sialylation or galactosylation patterns on Fc glycans can shift antibodies toward anti- or pro-inflammatory outcomes, respectively.

The ideal strategy from a translational standpoint depends on successfully mapping dominant disease mechanisms to the simplest effective intervention.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG), Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), and other conditions characterized by acute, antibody-mediated tissue injury can often be effectively addressed by FcRn antagonism. This sees the rapid reduction in circulating IgG (validated via regulatory approval from Efgartigimod for MG), translating directly into clinical improvement.

Diseases like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), which exhibit more complex immunopathology, generally require combination approaches that can both restore inhibitory signaling and reduce pathogenic IgG load.

SLE's pathology is driven by ICs activating TLR7/9 (typically exacerbated by defects in the inhibitory Fc gamma RIIb), which means that engineered Fc constructs able to improve Fc gamma RIIb engagement are a sensible part of ensuring immune "signal reset," working alongside FcRn inhibitors.

The early incorporation of mechanism-relevant biomarkers (for example, circulating pathogenic IgG levels, Fc gamma R expression or genotype, Fc glycoform profiles, and downstream signatures such as type I interferon) is key to enabling patient stratification across all indications, as well as delivering early evidence of target engagement.

The Fc–FcR axis offers a range of complementary levers, such as rapid IgG depletion, antigen-specific modulation, and selective signaling recalibration, that can be applied selectively or combined to match disease biology.

Programs beginning with a mechanism-to-indication map before embedding clear biomarker and PD plans, and employing functional assays and validated Fc/FcR reagents are best positioned to efficiently translate these approaches while sufficiently managing immunocompetence and safety risks.

ACROBiosystems offers an integrated Fc receptor toolbox designed to directly support the rapid advancement of a pipeline while supporting discovery via translational research.

Autistic and non-autistic people express emotions differently through their facial movements, according to a new study, which may help to explain why emotional expressions are sometimes misinterpreted between the two groups.

In a landmark study mapping facial expressions among autistic and non-autistic individuals, researchers at the University of Birmingham used detailed facial motion tracking to create an extensive library of facial expressions linked to major emotions such as anger, happiness and sadness, with more than 265 million data points.

The study, published in Autism Research, involved 25 autistic and 26 non-autistic adults, who produced nearly 5000 expressions in total. Each participant produced angry, happy and sad facial expressions in two ways – in synchrony with some sounds, and while speaking. The team found differences in angry, happy, and sad facial expressions between the groups, with autistic participants also producing more unique expressions:

The team also found that alexithymia – a 'sub-clinical' condition commonly found in autism that involves difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions – also shaped facial expressions. Alexithymia was linked to less clearly distinct angry and happy expressions, making them more likely to appear ambiguous.

Dr Connor Keating, who conducted the research at the University of Birmingham and is now based in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford said: "Our findings suggest autistic and non-autistic people differ not only in the appearance of facial expressions, but also in how smoothly these expressions are formed. These mismatches in facial expressions may help to explain why autistic people struggle to recognize non-autistic expressions and vice versa."

Autistic and non-autistic people may express emotions in ways that are different but equally meaningful - almost like speaking different languages. What has sometimes been interpreted as difficulties for autistic people might instead reflect a two-way challenge in understanding each other's expressions. We are currently investigating this idea, so watch this space for updates."

Professor Jennifer Cook, senior author of the paper, University of Birmingham

The project was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC, United Kingdom) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.

With another Congressional deadline looming this month for most telehealth coverage under Medicare, a new University of Michigan study adds more data to the debate.

It shows that the total number of patient visits hasn't gone up since most patients gained the ability to see doctors and other health care providers virtually.

In fact, among non-surgical medical specialties and mental health providers, the total number of visits stabilized and even declined slightly through June 2024, the most recent period available to analyze. The data come from more than 60 million people who had nearly 539 million appointments during a five-year period.

The findings could help inform policymakers who must vote by January 30 to either temporarily renew or permanently extend Medicare telehealth coverage standards that have been in effect since March 2020.

If they don't meet that deadline, older and disabled Americans with traditional Medicare coverage could find themselves receiving messages like they did last fall, when there was a lapse in telehealth coverage during the government shutdown that began October 1.

Such letters told them that if they had a telehealth visit during that time, they may be responsible for paying the entire cost, or that their appointment was being converted to in-person or being canceled or rescheduled.

Just before Thanksgiving, Congress authorized retroactive payment for telehealth visits that patients with traditional Medicare had decided to keep during the shutdown.

But the budget agreement only provided for coverage of future care under current standards through the end of January 2026.

The new findings, published in the peer-reviewed publication Health Affairs Scholar by a team from the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, build on findings that the researchers published as a preprint nearly a year ago during a prior period of uncertainty about Medicare coverage of telehealth.

The new analysis includes data from January 2019 through June 2024 and breaks down telehealth and in-person visit trends for surgical, non-surgical and behavioral (mental) health care.

Telehealth was possible only under very limited circumstances in Medicare before March 2020. That month, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid emergency pivot to virtual care. Since then, such care has become routine for most people. In fact, the study shows that telehealth now accounts for 44% of all behavioral health visits and 9% of primary care visits among beneficiaries in traditional Medicare.

However, despite this sustained adoption, the study finds that overall healthcare visits have remained stable or declined over time. The researchers used a special type of statistical analysis to look at visit patterns among specialties with high, medium and low telehealth use.

They found that even in fields where telehealth was widely adopted, the total number of visits, including in-person and virtual visits, stayed steady or even declined over time. Contrary to some predictions, overall visits didn't climb higher as telehealth became more popular.

Lead author James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., said that it's important to look at the overall trajectory of both telehealth and in-person visits in order to inform policymakers who want to balance care access and flexibility with budgetary responsibility.

One of the things that is paralyzing the policy debate is uncertainty and concern about whether covering telehealth in parity with in-person care would be associated with runaway utilization. But we don't see that here."

James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., National Clinician Scholar at IHPI and Clinical Instructor in the U-M Medical School's Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Medicine

Lee and senior author Chad Ellimoottil, M.D., M.S., led the analysis. They did not include asynchronous patient portal messages, which providers can bill Medicare for under a separate code if they spend a substantial amount of time addressing the patient's concern.

They also cannot include any visits that patients had with providers who did not bill traditional fee-for-service Medicare, such as mental health providers who patients may have paid for out of their own pocket.

Because half of Medicare beneficiaries have chosen Medicare Advantage plans, which bill Medicare differently, their data aren't included either.

The fact that the new analysis shows a declining trend for total visits for behavioral health and primary care is also of interest, Lee said. This may reflect the well-known shortage of primary care and behavioral health providers in the United States, including reduction in capacity as burned-out providers reduce the number of appointments they offer. 

In addition to Lee and Ellimoottil, the authors are Elena Chun, M.S., Chiang-Hua Chang, Ph.D., Hechuan Michelle Hou, M.S., former NCSP scholar Terrence Liu, M.D., M.S., Rodney Dunn, Ph.D., Jeffrey McCullough, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D.

The study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the support that Lee receives for his National Clinician Scholars Program fellowship from IHPI and the VA Office of Academic Affiliations.

With another Congressional deadline looming this month for most telehealth coverage under Medicare, a new University of Michigan study adds more data to the debate.

It shows that the total number of patient visits hasn't gone up since most patients gained the ability to see doctors and other health care providers virtually.

In fact, among non-surgical medical specialties and mental health providers, the total number of visits stabilized and even declined slightly through June 2024, the most recent period available to analyze. The data come from more than 60 million people who had nearly 539 million appointments during a five-year period.

The findings could help inform policymakers who must vote by January 30 to either temporarily renew or permanently extend Medicare telehealth coverage standards that have been in effect since March 2020.

If they don't meet that deadline, older and disabled Americans with traditional Medicare coverage could find themselves receiving messages like they did last fall, when there was a lapse in telehealth coverage during the government shutdown that began October 1.

Such letters told them that if they had a telehealth visit during that time, they may be responsible for paying the entire cost, or that their appointment was being converted to in-person or being canceled or rescheduled.

Just before Thanksgiving, Congress authorized retroactive payment for telehealth visits that patients with traditional Medicare had decided to keep during the shutdown.

But the budget agreement only provided for coverage of future care under current standards through the end of January 2026.

The new findings, published in the peer-reviewed publication Health Affairs Scholar by a team from the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, build on findings that the researchers published as a preprint nearly a year ago during a prior period of uncertainty about Medicare coverage of telehealth.

The new analysis includes data from January 2019 through June 2024 and breaks down telehealth and in-person visit trends for surgical, non-surgical and behavioral (mental) health care.

Telehealth was possible only under very limited circumstances in Medicare before March 2020. That month, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid emergency pivot to virtual care. Since then, such care has become routine for most people. In fact, the study shows that telehealth now accounts for 44% of all behavioral health visits and 9% of primary care visits among beneficiaries in traditional Medicare.

However, despite this sustained adoption, the study finds that overall healthcare visits have remained stable or declined over time. The researchers used a special type of statistical analysis to look at visit patterns among specialties with high, medium and low telehealth use.

They found that even in fields where telehealth was widely adopted, the total number of visits, including in-person and virtual visits, stayed steady or even declined over time. Contrary to some predictions, overall visits didn't climb higher as telehealth became more popular.

Lead author James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., said that it's important to look at the overall trajectory of both telehealth and in-person visits in order to inform policymakers who want to balance care access and flexibility with budgetary responsibility.

One of the things that is paralyzing the policy debate is uncertainty and concern about whether covering telehealth in parity with in-person care would be associated with runaway utilization. But we don't see that here."

James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., National Clinician Scholar at IHPI and Clinical Instructor in the U-M Medical School's Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Medicine

Lee and senior author Chad Ellimoottil, M.D., M.S., led the analysis. They did not include asynchronous patient portal messages, which providers can bill Medicare for under a separate code if they spend a substantial amount of time addressing the patient's concern.

They also cannot include any visits that patients had with providers who did not bill traditional fee-for-service Medicare, such as mental health providers who patients may have paid for out of their own pocket.

Because half of Medicare beneficiaries have chosen Medicare Advantage plans, which bill Medicare differently, their data aren't included either.

The fact that the new analysis shows a declining trend for total visits for behavioral health and primary care is also of interest, Lee said. This may reflect the well-known shortage of primary care and behavioral health providers in the United States, including reduction in capacity as burned-out providers reduce the number of appointments they offer. 

In addition to Lee and Ellimoottil, the authors are Elena Chun, M.S., Chiang-Hua Chang, Ph.D., Hechuan Michelle Hou, M.S., former NCSP scholar Terrence Liu, M.D., M.S., Rodney Dunn, Ph.D., Jeffrey McCullough, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D.

The study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the support that Lee receives for his National Clinician Scholars Program fellowship from IHPI and the VA Office of Academic Affiliations.

Psychiatrists and neuroscientists are taking a major step toward objective mental health diagnosis by launching a central reference database for the classification and communication of mental health biomarker research.

Psychiatry is almost unique in the medical sciences in not relying on biomarkers (measurable physiological tests) to diagnose psychiatric disorders, instead using patient-reported symptoms, behavioral observations, and standardized diagnostic manuals. Research on biomarkers is ongoing, but fragmented. Now psychiatrists and neuroscientists are setting up a structure to create a central resource to categorize and coordinate biomarker research. This work, to be launched today, 16th January, is initiated by the ECNP, and funded by Wellcome.Heading the initiative on behalf of the ECNP, Professor Martien Kas (University of Groningen, The Netherlands) said:"Precision psychiatry is an approach to mental health care that integrates biological, behavioural, and clinical data. It moves us beyond the current symptom-based diagnosis of mental illness towards a more comprehensive approach, which incorporates more quantitative data, more based on the underlying mechanisms. In short, diagnosis based on the cause of the illness, not just the symptoms. It aims to continuously refine diagnosis and personalize treatment by identifying biologically meaningful subgroups and targeting the underlying mechanisms of illness, and is perhaps the hottest topic in mental health today.There's a lot of research, but we need to build a structure which enables researchers to understand how their work fits into the broader picture, who is doing related work, and what the findings (or problems) have been. So we are building a database to systematically review and communicate all the biomarker work in the field of anxiety disorders, depression, and psychosis. All this will become freely available online".As part of the process the ECNP will organise a series of stakeholder meetings and workshops, to bring together the researchers in the field. The ECNP has already staged several workshops, with representatives from most of the major bodies in the field, such as the GAMIAN-Europe patient organisation, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the European Psychiatric Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry.Professor Kas continued, "Wellcome has recognised the importance of the initiative by funding mapping and consensus-building around biomarkers in mental health in a 30-month project. We see this as the start of the process to put precision psychiatry on a firm footing. Ultimately, we believe this will change the way we look at mental health, and make diagnosis psychiatric diagnosis and treatment really testable".Niall Boyce, Head of Knowledge and Measurement in Mental Health at Wellcome, said "This exciting new project is an important step towards providing people experiencing mental health problems with the right treatment at the right time. ECNP's biomarker map will not only help researchers to orientate themselves in an increasingly complex and fast-moving field, but will chart the way towards much-needed transformation in the precision and quality of mental health care."

A study of 227 individuals who experienced neuro cognitive difficulties post COVID-19 infection – such as headaches, vertigo, balance dysregulation, changes in taste/smell, and brain fog – displayed a significant increase in their blood plasma of a crucial protein called tau, which is found in nerves and especially in the brain. Excess levels of tau are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and found in many Alzheimer's patients.

Published this month in eBioMedicine, the study suggests that people who experience Long COVID neurocognitive symptoms could be at further risk for neurodegenerative diseases.

The research involves ongoing blood biomarker studies of 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) responders who are monitored by clinicians and researchers at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program. The research team analyzed plasma samples taken prior to the participants' COVID-19 infections and many months to years after having COVID-19. They measured a specific tau protein, pTau-181, which stands for phosphorylated tau, an abnormal type associated with dementia patients.

Overall, the cohort showed a 59 percent increase of tau (pTau-181) in their plasma post COVID-19 infection while or after experiencing neurocognitive symptoms, compared to their plasma tau levels pre-COVID-19.

All the participants are individuals with some form of Long COVID, or specifically for this study those with Neurological Post-Acute Sequelae COVID (N-PASC).

The presence of tau at higher levels in the blood is a known biomarker of lasting brain damage. Therefore, these study results imply that Long COVID could worsen with time and cause changes in neurological symptoms or lead to cognitive difficulties that become worse. Yet, we do not know if this increase in tau in our sample represents a biological course that could be similar to individuals who develop Alzheimer's or related diseases."

Sean Clouston, PhD, Corresponding Author and Professor in the Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine in the Renaissance School of Medicine (RSOM) and Program in Public Health, Stony Brook University

The 227 individuals with N-PASC were compared to 227 other WTC responders who either 1) did not contract COVID between their pre- and post-pandemic blood sample collection dates, or 2) developed COVID but did not develop any Long COVID symptoms, including neurological ones. This cohort served as the control group for the study.

Unlike those with N-PASC, any increased plasma tau levels in the control group from their pre-COVID tau levels was not evident based on testing.

For those with N-PASC who had neurocognitive symptoms for more than 1.5 years, the tau level increases were worse. This finding, the authors write, "might portend worsened cognitive functioning as individuals age."

"We measured tau at an average of 2.2 years after COVID-19 infection, and our measurements taken ranged from six months to four years," adds Xiaohua Yang, First Author and Senior Research Program Manager at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program. "This sampling timeframe represents a true long-term post-acute sequela of COVID-19."

Clouston and colleagues stress that other research steps need to be taken to determine if increased plasma levels of tau in those with N-PASC have any association with cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases.

"One important step is to validate our study results using neuroimaging tools to see if tau plasma level increases also represent increased levels in the participants' brains," explains Clouston.

Additionally, the authors also point out that the cohort for this study – WTC responders – also have had more environmental exposures than the general population. Therefore, findings in N-PASC individuals who are WTC responders could be much different from the general patient population.

"The long-term impact of COVID-19 may be consequential years after the infection and give rise to long-term illnesses including neurocognitive problems similar to what is seen in Alzheimer's disease," says Senior Author Benjamin J. Luft, MD, Director of the WTC Health and Wellness Program, an infectious diseases specialist, and the Edmund D. Pelligrino Professor of Medicine in the RSOM.

"This is one of the first studies to show that a virus may contribute to the development of abnormal tau production over time," he adds. "This has important implications for our understanding of the biological factors involved in the development of neurodegenerative disease. On a practical level, it has important implications for the development of effective vaccines and therapies to prevent an acute infection before it can embed itself in people and cause long-term disease."

The study was supported in part by funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CDC/NIOSH CDC-75D30122c12222) and the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Aging (NIH/NIA Ago49953).

The gene variant posing the greatest genetic risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is called APOE-ε4. A different variant of the same gene, APOE-ε2, is thought to confer protection against AD.

A comparatively large study reported Jan. 16 in Alzheimer's & Dementia, The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, led by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, measures the frequency of APOE-ε4 and APOE-ε2 in so-called super agers - people ages 80 or older whose cognitive function is comparable to people 20 or 30 years younger.

Super agers were 68% less likely to harbor the gene nobody wants, APOE-ε4, compared to individuals with AD dementia in the same 80+ age group.

Most notably, super agers were 19% less likely to harbor APOE-ε4 than were cognitively normal participants in the same age group. 

"This was our most striking finding - although all adults who reach the age of 80 without receiving a diagnosis of clinical dementia exhibit exceptional aging, our study suggests that the super-ager phenotype can be used to identify a particularly exceptional group of oldest-old adults with a reduced genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease," said Leslie Gaynor, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine, who led the study with Alaina Durant, BS, statistical genetic analyst in the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center. 

Super agers were also found for the first time to have higher frequency of the variant you'd want, APOE-ε2: They were 28% more likely to carry APOE-ε2 than were cognitively normal controls ages 80+, and 103% more likely to carry the variant than were participants with AD dementia aged 80 or older. 

The observational study, which includes the largest sample of super agers to date, uses data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC), led by another member of the study team, Timothy Hohman, PhD, professor of Neurology. The study included 18,080 participants from eight national aging cohorts.

Super-ager status was defined in part as people ages 80+ whose memory performance was above the average scored among cognitively normal participants ages 50 to 64. The study included multiple race/ethnicity groups, including 1,412 non-Hispanic white super agers, 211 non-Hispanic Black super agers, 8,829 participants with AD dementia, and 7,628 cognitively normal controls. APOE-ε4 frequency worldwide is 13.7%; in the study it was 43.9%. 

"With interest in super agers growing," Gaynor said, "our findings notably encourage the view that the super-ager phenotype will prove useful in the continued search for mechanisms conferring resilience to AD.

"This is by far the largest study to date to identify differences in APOE-ε4 allele frequency based on super-ager status, and the first study to find a relationship between APOE-ε2 allele frequency and super-ager status. We would expect these findings to lend continued interest to questions of how these variants may influence development of clinical dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the super-ager phenotype more generally."

Others from VUMC on the study include Angela Jefferson, PhD, Logan Dumitrescu, MS, PhD, and Derek Archer, PhD. They were joined by 32 researchers from 15 universities. The study was funded in part by National Institutes of Health awards U24 AG074855, U01 AG068057, and R01 AG059716.

New research co-led by Indiana University School of Medicine scientists has exposed a vulnerability in acute myeloid leukemia by identifying the blood cancer's reliance on a specific signaling pathway involved in the body's inflammation response. Their preclinical evidence suggests that blocking this pathway with a new drug compound can weaken acute myeloid leukemia during critical stages, paving the way for more effective and targeted treatments for this hard-to-treat disease.

According to the National Cancer Institute, the five-year survival rate for AML is only 32.9%, and about 22,000 new cases were reported in 2025. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is known for being treatment-resistant and having a high relapse rate. 

AML is a challenging blood cancer because a small population of cells, known as leukemia stem cells, can survive chemotherapy and later regenerate the disease. Our research goal was to understand the critical mechanisms these leukemia stem cells rely on at both diagnosis and relapse, and to identify potential therapeutic targets."

Tzu-Chieh (Kate) Ho, PhD, assistant research professor of pediatrics at the IU School of Medicine and a lead author of the study

In the study published in Leukemia, the researchers examined leukemia stem cells from AML patients during their diagnosis and relapse. They discovered that an inflammatory signaling pathway involved in the body's immune system response - known as Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling - is significantly elevated at both stages. When the team used genetic approaches to reduce this signal in human AML cells, the cells formed fewer colonies and showed a diminished ability to reestablish leukemia.

The researchers also developed a new drug-like compound, UR241-2, designed to block the key proteins found in the IL-1 signaling pathway. In preclinical models, the compound impaired leukemia stem cells while largely sparing healthy blood-forming cells and significantly reduced leukemia levels in the mice. Their findings suggest that targeting this pathway could strengthen current AML treatments like chemotherapy and reduce the risk of relapse. 

"Our studies indicate that IL-1 signaling is not a random feature, but rather a fundamental survival mechanism that persists across different stages of AML and can be targeted," said Reuben Kapur, PhD, director of the IU School of Medicine Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research and co-author of the study. "This opens up exciting possibilities for developing therapies that are more effective and more precise."

UR241-2 is still in early preclinical development, but similar drugs are already being tested in clinical trials for other cancers and immune-related diseases, suggesting a promising path toward eventually evaluating this compound for AML.

"Future AML treatments may incorporate our strategy alongside standard chemotherapy as an approach to reduce relapse risk," Ho said. "We hope these approaches will ultimately help improve treatment outcomes and long-term prognosis for patients with AML."

Ho and Kapur are also researchers in the Wells Center's Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Biology Program and the IU Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. 

IU School of Medicine's Baskar Ramdas, PhD, is a co-author on the study. Other authors include Mark W. LaMere, Hiroki Kawano, Daniel K. Byun, Elizabeth A. LaMere, Chunmo Chen, Laura M. Calvi, Jane L.

Caregiving in the modern era is challenging for even the most prepared adults. So, what happens when this burden falls on children?

As Japan's population ages, the number of children and young people responsible for caregiving is increasing. However, the impact of this on their health and daily lives remains not well understood.

To gain better insight, Professor Bing Niu and Dr. Ziyan Wang from Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Economics conducted two rounds of surveys, one in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic and another in 2024 after the pandemic. The surveys targeted 1,581 young carers aged 15 to 19 across Japan to clarify how caregiving burdens affect the psychology and emotions of young carers.

The survey incorporated the Kessler 6-Item Psychological Distress Scale and the Positive and Negative Outcomes of Caring questionnaire as indicators to measure the degree of psychological stress and subjective responses, such as feelings and thoughts, toward caregiving. It then analyzed the actual state of the caregiving burden and its impact on carers' psychological and emotional well-being.

Results revealed that young carers with greater care responsibilities tend to experience higher stress levels, with approximately 20% of young carers in our surveys falling into the high-risk group. However, they also possesspositive emotions, such as a sense of accomplishment and pride. In particular, the 2024 survey revealed that both positive and negative emotions stemming from caregiving experience were more pronounced than in 2021.

Both positive and negative emotions were strongly expressed in the 2024 survey, which suggests that even as the burden of care persists, societal understanding and support for young carers have grown, and they themselves have begun to embrace their roles more positively."

Dr. Ziyan Wang, Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Economics

Professor Niu concluded, "It is suggested that while both positive and negative aspects exist in the caregiving experiences of young caregivers, it is crucial to develop support tailored to each individual's specific circumstances."

The findings were published in Scientific Reports.

A national study of Australian undergraduates suggests that spending more than 10 hours a week gaming is associated with poorer diet quality, higher body weight, and disrupted sleep, highlighting the need for healthier gaming habits rather than less gaming altogether.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition, researchers conducted a cross-sectional study to examine associations between video gaming and health-related behaviors among university students (n = 317) in Australia. Study findings revealed that students who game >10 hours per week demonstrated poorer diet quality, higher Body Mass Index (BMI), and worse sleep than their peers.

These findings suggest that high-frequency (high-intensity) gaming may displace health-promoting behaviors, highlighting a potential need for targeted public health interventions designed specifically for the university gaming community.

Video gaming is a ubiquitous pastime, particularly amongst students, yet its physiological and behavioral correlates in young adults remain understudied. In parallel, studies suggest that the university years represent a critical developmental window during which young adults establish lifelong lifestyle habits.

In Australia, 92% of households reportedly play video games. While gaming offers established cognitive benefits and stress relief (e.g., catharsis), the relatively novel "displacement hypothesis" suggests that time spent gaming may crowd out health-promoting activities (e.g., cooking, sleeping, and exercising).

Previous research has suggested that high-frequency gaming is linked to suboptimal health behaviors, such as mindless eating, sedentary behavior, and disrupted circadian rhythms, due in part to exposure to blue light. However, the specific interplay between gaming frequency and diet quality remains complex and not fully established.

The present study aimed to address this knowledge gap by conducting a cross-sectional observational study to explore relationships between gaming frequency and multiple health indicators. The study involved 317 Australian undergraduate participants (median age = 20.0 years) recruited through social media platforms and university systems.

The study required enrolled participants to complete a comprehensive online survey using validated tools to assess various health domains:

Gaming Habits: Students were categorized into three groups based on weekly, self-reported gaming hours: Low (0–5 hours), Moderate (6–10 hours), and High (>10 hours).

Diet Quality: The Diet Quality Tool (DQT) was used to assess adherence to prescribed nutritional guidelines, scoring participants on their intake of key food groups, including vegetables, fruits, and high-fat snacks.

Physical Activity: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to calculate Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) minutes per week to gauge participants' exercise levels.

Sleep and Stress: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep disturbances, while the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was employed to measure subjective stress.

Eating Behaviors: The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18) was leveraged to evaluate cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating.

Statistical analyses comprised multiple linear regression models to isolate the independent associations between gaming and health outcomes. These models controlled for sociodemographic variables, including gender, ethnicity, and smoking status.

Study analyses revealed several contrasts between high-frequency gamers and their low-frequency gaming counterparts, the most significant being deterioration in nutritional habits among the former. High-frequency gamers (>10 hours/week) had significantly lower diet quality scores (median 45.0) compared to low-frequency gamers (median 50.0) (p < 0.001).

Regression analysis further quantified these observations, revealing that for every additional hour of gaming per week, diet quality scores dropped by 0.16 points (p = 0.02), after adjustment for multiple lifestyle and demographic factors, representing a modest but statistically significant association.

Anthropometric and sleep-related outcomes showed similar patterns:

BMI and Weight: High-frequency gamers were found to have a significantly higher median Body Mass Index (BMI) of 26.3 kg/m² compared to 22.2 kg/m² in the low-frequency group (p < 0.001). Notably, the prevalence of obesity was nearly five times higher in the high-frequency group (24%) compared to the low-frequency group (4.9%).

Sleep Quality: High-frequency gamers scored a median of 7.0 on the PSQI, compared to 6.0 for low-frequency gamers (p < 0.001). Notably, a PSQI score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep, suggesting that, while high-frequency gamers reported poorer sleep, the Australian student population as a whole struggles to maintain optimal sleep quality.

Physical Activity: The study identified a weak but statistically significant inverse correlation (r = -0.13, p = 0.03) between gaming frequency and physical activity. However, total physical activity levels did not differ significantly between gaming groups.

The study also found that high-frequency gamers were more likely to be male and prefer PC gaming. Surprisingly, this cohort reported consuming less alcohol than the low-frequency group (p = 0.02). Additionally, high-frequency gamers reported a preference for video games with higher violence ratings, a characteristic discussed in relation to existing literature on stress and arousal, rather than as a direct finding of elevated stress levels.

The present study elucidates important associations between frequent video gaming and several health-related behaviors among university students, providing evidence that higher gaming exposure is independently associated with poorer diet quality and higher BMI.

While the study is limited by its cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported data, its findings suggest that universities should consider integrating "healthy gaming" education into their wellness programs. As digital entertainment continues to dominate student life, balancing time spent gaming with positive health behaviors may represent a pragmatic public health goal rather than an indication of causality.

A comprehensive review weighs the promise of bamboo shoots as a nutrient-rich, sustainable food against limited human evidence and unresolved safety concerns, underscoring why preparation methods and better trials matter.



Study: Bamboo consumption and health outcomes: A systematic review and call to action. Image Credit: Hanasaki / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the journal Advances in Bamboo Science, researchers assessed human consumption studies and in vitro investigations using human cell models, alongside laboratory studies relevant to food processing, to evaluate the health effects of consuming bamboo shoots and derived products.

Based on available evidence, they concluded that, while human data remain limited, properly prepared bamboo products may offer several health benefits, including improved digestive, antioxidant, and metabolic outcomes. However, each reported benefit is supported by a small number of individual studies rather than a broad clinical evidence base.

Bamboo is a fast-growing, highly versatile plant belonging to the grass family, with more than 1,250 species worldwide. Although found across most continents, bamboo is most abundant in Asia, accounting for around 80% of global coverage.

Its rapid growth, high biomass yield, and adaptability have made it valuable not only for construction and environmental applications but also as a food source. Bamboo leaves and shoots are commonly consumed, particularly in Asian cuisines. They are nutritionally attractive due to their high protein content, moderate fiber levels, low fat content, and presence of essential amino acids and minerals such as potassium and selenium.

Previous research suggests that compounds derived from bamboo may have several health benefits. However, bamboo consumption also carries risks, as some species release cyanide from cyanogenic glucosides if not properly processed, posing serious health hazards. Appropriate preparation, such as boiling, is therefore essential to reduce potential toxicity.

Despite growing interest in bamboo as a functional food, it had not previously been systematically evaluated. Researchers searched Medline (via PubMed) and Web of Science, assessing study quality using standardized risk-of-bias tools. The systematic search identified 1,052 potentially relevant records. After title and abstract screening, 19 full-text articles were evaluated; 16 met the inclusion criteria.

These comprised four human studies, four in vitro studies using human cell lines, and eight laboratory-based studies examining bamboo components with relevance to nutrition and food processing. All but one were set in Asia. The overall methodological quality of the in vivo human studies, assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, was moderate.

The four human studies involved a total of 4,934 participants and examined diverse health outcomes. One large cross-sectional study in schoolchildren reported a high prevalence of goiter (31%) despite adequate iodine intake, suggesting a possible association with frequent consumption of bamboo shoots rather than established causality.

Supportive evidence from an experimental rat component within the same study showed altered thyroid structure and reduced thyroid hormone levels following bamboo shoot intake, reinforcing concerns about potential goitrogenic effects.

In contrast, other human studies reported beneficial effects. A randomized trial found that flavonoid-rich antioxidants from bamboo leaves reduced internal exposure to glycidamide and acrylamide by altering toxicokinetics and increasing urinary excretion of related biomarkers, with sex-specific differences observed.

A study in people with diabetes showed that cookies fortified with bamboo shoots significantly lowered postprandial blood glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner.

Another small dietary intervention in healthy women demonstrated improvements in lipid profiles, including reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, along with increased bowel movement frequency and increased stool volume, indicating improved bowel function.

Four studies investigated bamboo extracts using human cell models. These consistently showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, including reduced reactive oxygen species production, inhibition of inflammatory markers, improved cell viability, and low cellular toxicity.

Bamboo leaf and shoot extracts also reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis under high-glucose conditions, supporting a potential but not yet clinically established protective role against metabolic and inflammatory damage.

One study assessing heavy metal content found elevated lead levels in some bamboo shoots; however, simulated intestinal digestion did not induce toxicity in intestinal cells, suggesting that conventional risk assessments may overestimate health risks when bioaccessibility is not considered.

Eight studies explored bamboo-derived ingredients for nutritional and technological applications. These demonstrated potent antioxidant activity and prebiotic-like effects in laboratory-based studies, through stimulation of beneficial gut bacteria and the production of short-chain fatty acids, but lacked direct evidence from human gut studies.

Bamboo extracts reduced harmful compounds such as acrylamide and furan during food processing without compromising sensory quality. Other studies highlighted the high nutritional value of bamboo shoots, including fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals, and showed that processing methods and harvest stage influence nutrient composition and functional properties.

Overall, the findings suggest that properly prepared bamboo products may offer multiple health benefits, including improved glycemic control, lipid profiles, bowel function, antioxidant capacity, and reduced exposure to food-processing toxins. Importantly, these outcomes are derived from distinct, mostly small studies, and should be interpreted individually rather than as a unified body of clinical evidence. These effects are likely linked to bamboo's rich content of dietary fiber, bioactive compounds, and micronutrients.

However, concerns remain regarding potential goitrogenic effects, particularly with frequent consumption of inadequately processed bamboo shoots. Importantly, appropriate preparation methods such as boiling are thought to substantially reduce cyanogenic compounds, although human evidence remains limited.

The main limitations include the limited number of human studies, substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and study designs, and a lack of high-quality trials, which precluded meta-analysis. Despite these constraints, the evidence supports bamboo's promise as a sustainable, nutrient-rich food. Further well-designed human intervention studies are needed before firm dietary recommendations can be made.

A major UK study shows that commonly used home pulse oximeters can overestimate oxygen levels in people with darker skin, increasing the risk of undetected hypoxemia and raising urgent questions about device standards, regulation, and clinical interpretation.

Oxygen in blood is primarily transported by the red cell pigment hemoglobin. The fraction of total hemoglobin that is oxygenated hemoglobin in arterial blood is the arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2), which is measured directly from an arterial blood gas sample and used to detect and assess hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen concentration. Pulse oximetry is often used to noninvasively estimate saturation by measuring light absorbance in the tissue vascular bed. However, its accuracy is far from uniform, especially in darker skin tones.

A recent study in The British Medical Journal examined how skin color affects the accuracy of hypoxemia diagnosis by pulse oximetry.

Pulse oximeters began to be commercially sold in the 1980s, with subsequent striking advances in design, convenience, and portability. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a significant increase in the use of fingertip pulse oximeters at home. These are inexpensive, battery-powered, and suitable for home use.

Pulse oximeters can enable remote monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and detection of early hypoxemia. The NHS England exploited this with the rollout of the COVID Oximetry @home scheme. However, some cheap pulse oximeters produce inaccurate readings, emphasizing the need for regulation.

Darker skin is also associated with an increased risk of a false negative, leading to delayed or missed diagnosis of hypoxemia. Earlier studies used race or ethnicity to stand in for skin tone. Others used the Fitzpatrick skin tone or other color comparison charts to determine skin tone.

Both methods lack the objectivity of spectrophotometry, leading to major flaws in these studies. Spectrophotometry measures light reflection over different wavelengths and calculates the skin color accordingly. The results are used to calculate the individual typology angle (ITA), derived from objective lightness and colour measurements.

The ISO, which certifies pulse oximeters and other devices for safety and basic performance, does not require accounting for skin tone variations. The performance metric for measurement accuracy is the accuracy root-mean-square (ARMS), which combines bias (systematic error) with precision (random error or noise).

The FDA has published a draft to improve oximeter accuracy evaluation by increasing both the number of participants and the range of skin tones. It considers not only ARMS but variation in bias over a 100° range of ITA.

In response to NHS concerns, the NIHR launched the EXAKT study to assess how skin tone affects measurements and diagnostic accuracy of five fingertip pulse oximeters used in the home oximetry scheme.

The study used data from patients recruited or screened for the UK-ROX trial, designed to assess various approaches to oxygen therapy. This included 903 critically ill patients in 24 intensive care units in England between June 2022 and August 2024, a setting chosen to enable paired arterial blood gas sampling and to capture a wider range of oxygen saturations, including lower SaO2 values.

The five oximeters were used to measure SpO2, and the readings were compared with the SaO2 measured simultaneously by co-oximetry, the gold standard. Skin tone was objectively measured using a handheld spectrophotometer.

The researchers aimed to evaluate pulse oximeter performance in terms of its overall accuracy, precision, and bias. Both false positive and false negative rates for SpO2 ≤92% and ≤94% were evaluated against a reference SaO2 threshold of ≤92% to examine how often SpO2 fails to identify hypoxemia. They used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to measure overall testing performance across different cutoffs.

In particular, they looked for occult hypoxemia (SaO2 below 88% but SpO2 >92%).

The study included 11,018 pairs of SpO2–SaO2 measurements. All five pulse oximeter types in the study showed reduced precision across all SaO2 levels. Overall accuracy was also reduced, largely due to substantial imprecision rather than systematic bias alone. At lower saturations, SpO2 measurements were too high, and at higher saturations, too low.

All five pulse oximeters overestimated the saturation with darker skin tones. Median dark skin was associated with an average increase of 0.6–1.5 percentage points in mean SpO2 values compared to lighter tones.

At lower saturations, darker skin tones exacerbated the bias towards falsely high SpO2 readings, thereby increasing the risk of missing hypoxemia. At higher saturations, the underestimation error tended to partially offset the higher SpO2 associated with darker skin tone, reducing the bias.

As a result, the accuracy of pulse oximeters varied with skin tone, though the direction and magnitude of the bias depended on saturation levels and the oximeter model. The devices showed a reduced ability to distinguish true hypoxemia in darker-skinned individuals.

The ARMS predominantly varied with measurement precision rather than skin tone-associated error. However, despite their small size, their effect on diagnostic accuracy was significant.

At both SpO2 thresholds, false negatives increased in darker-skinned individuals, while false positives decreased. False negatives increased by 5–35 percentage points at higher SpO2 thresholds in darker-skinned individuals.

While cases of occult hypoxemia were rare and estimates imprecise, they occurred more often in individuals with darker skin tones. Overall, hypoxemia was more frequently missed in this group.

These findings align with prior research but are limited to low-cost pulse oximeters supplied under the COVID Oximetry @home scheme. Results may not apply to critical care oximeters used in hospital settings.

A smaller American study of critical care oximeters using the same spectrophotometry approach also found significant overestimation of saturation in darker-skinned patients.

This large prospective study used objective skin-tone measurements and advanced statistical modeling, thereby strengthening its conclusions. However, unmeasured confounders such as reduced peripheral perfusion in critical illness may limit generalisability to home use.

SpO2 values tended to be higher in people with darker skin, potentially resulting in clinically significant differences in diagnostic accuracy.

Clinicians should interpret pulse oximetry cautiously, especially in darker-skinned individuals. Manufacturers should ensure robust pre- and post-market testing across skin tones.

Current standards do not adequately address these issues. SpO2 trends are more clinically informative than isolated values and must be interpreted in context. Updated guidelines are needed to support optimal hypoxemia care where confirmatory testing is unavailable.

Further research should incorporate objective skin tone measurement and explore alternatives to spectrophotometry to improve accessibility.

Zohran Mamdani and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House Yuri Gripas / Abaca / Bloomberg via Getty Images

The New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said he intends to raise the impact of travel bans on this summer's FIFA World Cup with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying it is “something (he) hopes will change” ahead of the tournament.

On Sunday, Mamdani hosted a Manhattan watch party for the Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal, taking over New York City Surrogate's Court for fans to congregate and watch the game, which was eventually won in controversial circumstances by Senegal.

Since Trump returned to power last January, the U.S. has imposed a string of travel bans on nationals from designated countries, including four countries (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Iran, and Haiti) that have qualified for the 48-team World Cup. The tournament will take place across the U.S., Canada and Mexico this summer.

A December proclamation by Trump suspended entry into the U.S. for nationals of Ivory Coast and Senegal, both as immigrants and non-immigrants, including in the visitor category for business and tourism, with the administration citing overstay rates from nationals from the two countries. Exemptions are carved out for players, coaching teams, federation officials, and immediate relatives of players, but not for fans.

In June, Trump signed off on another travel ban in which Haiti and Iran were among 12 countries impacted, a step Trump described as essential to “protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.”

In November, the Trump administration took a step towards facilitating global access for fans when it announced the creation of the FIFA PASS. However, the FIFA PASS is not a visa in itself; it merely provides a prioritized visa appointment system for those who have purchased tickets to attend the tournament. Applicants will still face the same rigorous security and screening processes, and there has been no indication that nationals of countries facing travel bans will be able to enter by buying a FIFA ticket.

On Sunday, members of New York City's Senegalese diaspora were brought together by Mamdani in one of the city's most iconic courthouses, which was built 119 years ago.

In an interview with The Athletic, Mamdani said: “For a long time, a love of this game, of these countries, of this tournament, is one that New Yorkers only got to experience in their own homes or in specific neighborhoods. It hasn't been one that's been recognized by the city at large. And this is a chance to not only look at the incredible Senegalese community, the Moroccan community, and the larger African community we have in the city, but also as a chance to say that this is the city of the world and this is the world's game.

“It's time for those two things to be linked. And just five months away from bringing the World Cup to New York City, this is a chance for us to show what it can look like to repurpose the spaces of the city into ones where we celebrate the game.”

Eight World Cup matches will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final, but FIFA's host-city agreement is with both New York City and New Jersey, lending Mamdani a seat at the table.

While the Senegalese diaspora brought the noise to a Manhattan courthouse, those in their home country may be unable to travel to the tournament.

“It's something that I hope will change,” Mamdani told The Athletic, in an interview which took place just as the final began. “And I will always make the case not only for our city as the world's city, but also a city that the world can visit.

“I think that for this tournament to be the experience that we want it to be for so many, we have to think about the previous World Cups that came before it. One of them, I was lucky enough to go to (in 2010), South Africa. We have to allow the world to be here in order to fully experience the world. We also appreciate the fact that we have such incredibly strong diaspora communities in the city as well.”

Asked if it is something he can raise with Trump, Mamdani said: “I think it's part of a number of things that I will make clear about what the city is hopeful for.”

Mamdani, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, came under significant fire from Trump during his campaign to win the New York City mayoralty, but the pair had an unexpectedly warm first public meeting in the Oval Office in November, in which Trump described Mamdani as a “rational person” and added that he would be “cheering” for him.

During his campaign to become mayor, Mamdani also turned his ire on the World Cup organizers, FIFA, over its ticketing strategy. Mamdani launched a “Game Over Greed” petition that called on FIFA to abandon its plan to use dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, impose a cap on ticket resales, and set aside 15 percent of tickets for local residents at a discount.

Mamdani previously told The Athletic he had received complaints from New Yorkers over the cost of World Cup tickets and the “mess” of a ticketing system, as well as “absurd” resale prices. Since then, FIFA has rolled out prices for the World Cup that brought condemnation from supporter groups and some federations, but the governing body also claims it has received 500 million ticket requests for the competition.

On Sunday afternoon, Mamdani reiterated his concerns about FIFA's approach, saying: “I continue to think that the right approach here is to end dynamic pricing, cap resale prices, and to have 15 per cent of tickets set aside at a discount for local residents. This is in keeping with prior World Cups. We are only asking for what we have seen (before), and I will continue to make that case now as the mayor of New York City, as opposed to just a candidate.”

Mamdani said he has started to hold conversations on the matter with the New York/New Jersey host committee, but he has not yet met directly with the FIFA officials who are overseeing the ticketing process.

Mamdani is also in the process of hiring a World Cup czar to streamline local services ahead of the competition, with a focus on promoting tourism, encouraging access and affordability, and ensuring that public services scale capacity to accommodate the games and the arrival of tourists.

Mamdani said: “There are a number of different factors that would make the person who holds that position successful. They need to obviously have a passion for the game, a fluency in the different government agencies that you have to engage with and interact with to make events like this possible. What we want to do is to ensure that this is a seamless experience that is sensational, and that requires logistics, passion, ambition, imagination, all in equal parts.”

 Pape Thiaw could be bannned from the 2026 World Cup

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has officially opened disciplinary proceedings against Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw following his actions during the dramatic 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final.

The decision places Thiaw under threat of a lengthy suspension, with reports suggesting he could potentially miss the 2026 FIFA World Cup, scheduled to be co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The proceedings stem from a controversial moment late in the AFCON final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on Sunday, January 18, 2026. 

A penalty was awarded to Morocco in stoppage time after a VAR review, sparking protests from the Senegal players.

Thiaw urged his squad to leave the pitch and return to the dressing room in protest of the decision, temporarily halting play and escalating tensions in the stadium.

While Senegal ultimately went on to win 1–0 in extra time, the incident has drawn the attention of CAF, who are investigating whether Thiaw's actions violated disciplinary codes regarding player conduct, match integrity, and engagement with match officials.

The outcome of the proceedings could have wide-ranging consequences for Senegalese football on the global stage. 

Reports indicate Thiaw could face a maximum suspension that could go as long as the 2026 World Cup. 

A suspension for Thiaw could affect the team's preparation and leadership ahead of the 2026 World Cup, placing the country's national squad under scrutiny at a critical time.

CAF has not yet announced a timeline for its investigation or potential sanctions.

Fulham have made a $35 million (€30 million) offer for U.S. men's national team star Ricardo Pepi, GOAL can confirm, and, despite seeing that bid rejected, several English clubs remain interested in the forward. The offer comes despite Pepi's recent arm injury, which hasn't prevented Premier League clubs from making a push to sign the striker this January.

GOAL can confirm that Fulham are among the teams looking to sign Pepi this January. The Premier League club is among several sides in England interested in Pepi, who commanded similar interest last summer before suffering a knee injury. 

This January, the American striker is dealing with a broken arm suffered in a recent match for his current club, PSV. The injury occurred as Pepi slid to fire home a goal in a 5-1 win over Excelsior. PSV has since confirmed that Pepi has undergone surgery and that he is expected to miss two months of matches.

Prior to the injury, Premier League clubs were already monitoring Pepi closely during the January window, and that interest has continued despite the expectation that he would not be available until March. Fabrizio Romano first reported that clubs remain interested despite the setback, while The Athletic previously reported that PSV rejected an initial $35 million bid from Fulham.

The Premier League interest comes after Pepi was the subject of similar discussions last January after a breakout at PSV. Sources confirmed to GOAL last year that Pepi was the subject of a $20.7M (€20M) bid from a Premier League club, although his knee injury and PSV's reluctance to sell ended any possibility of a move. Sources also confirmed that PSV rejected a loan-to-buy offer from West Ham last year.

After initially earning his Eredivisie stripes during a 13-goal loan spell at Groningen, Pepi joined PSV in 2023 in a $9.8 million transfer. He largely came off the bench for his first season-and-a-half, scoring nine goals during his first campaign with the club. However, he broke into the XI in the final months of 2024 by scoring 17 goals in all competitions before a knee injury sidelined him in January. 

After building fitness to start this season, Pepi has once again earned his place in the XI and has 11 goals in 22 appearances this season. That includes eight goals in just 716 Eredivisie minutes as well as goals against Napoli, Olympiacos, and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, all off the bench.

With Pepi out of action, PSV will look to maintain the club's stranglehold on the Eredivisie, which they currently lead by 16 points. Pepi, meanwhile, will face a race to recover in time for the next USMNT camp, which comes in March.

Tottenham have confirmed that defender Ben Davies is set to undergo surgery after fracturing his ankle in his side's 2-1 loss to West Ham. Pressure is mounting on Spurs boss Thomas Frank after a damaging home defeat to the relegation-threatened Hammers at the weekend. To make matters worse, Wales international Davies picked up the injury in the derby defeat and now he faces a lengthy lay-off.

Callum Wilson's late winner at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday condemned Tottenham to a Premier League home record of played 11, lost six, and won just two. Two days on, Spurs manager Frank is walking a tightrope to stay in his role, although the north London team are sticking with the ex-Brentford boss for now. The result means Tottenham are 14th in the table and have failed to win any of their last four matches. And going by the boos at full time, Spurs fans are far from happy with what they are seeing.

On those boos, Frank said after the match: "It's not a nice feeling, but I understand the frustration. We are losing to a big London rival, there is nothing worse. We couldn't win at home, which we worked very hard to try to do that. Hopefully they [the fans] can see the effort from the boys, they are working very hard. We did everything in the second half."

On Monday, Tottenham revealed that Davies will go under the knife later today for a left ankle fracture he suffered early in the West Ham clash. It remains to be seen how long the experienced defender will be out for but the club have wished him a speedy recovery.



When Tottenham sacked Ange Postecoglou after he guided them to Europa League glory last May, they turned to Frank for a more pragmatic approach. But Spurs, who finished 17th last term, are in a similar position to where they were under the Australian at this point last season but instead of swashbuckling, and often kamikaze, football, the north London team are utilising a style that has flattered to deceive. Despite that, Frank still feels he has the backing of the club's board. 

He said on Saturday: "I am feeling the backing from everyone, everyone wants the same thing - long term success. We are doing a lot of things right behind the scenes, but we are not getting the results which is crucial."

Despite that, he was well aware that the defeat to West Ham was not good enough and even admitted his side's ability to deal with set pieces is at an all-time low. 

"It feels like we've seen this before, like at Bournemouth when we do very well second half, get the equaliser and push for the winner, having chances and opportunities, but not getting over the line. Then we are stretched in the last moments of the game and lose 2-1," he said. "We started well in the first 15, then went 1-0 down. Then we rushed too much, gave the ball away too much, half-time helped, the boys pushed and did everything right. We scored the equaliser and created chances. It's super disappointing that we conceded in the last minute. If we can't win then we need to get the draw.

Tottenham have a chance to bounce back quickly from this West Ham setback when they host Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. Then, at the weekend, they travel to lowly Burnley in the Premier League. If he fails to win any of those matches, Frank could be out the job by next week.

Conservative and Labour MPs have become the first voices to call for a boycott of the World Cup this summer after Trump announced new tariffs on the UK.

Simon Hoare and Kate Osborne said the government needed to ‘push every button and pull every lever' to show its objection to the US president's threats towards Greenland.

Mr Hoare, a senior Conservative MP, told Metro that could include not going to the World Cup, a day after he called for the King's state visit to the US to be cancelled.

Labour MP Ms Osborne agreed that the tournament should be boycotted because Trump was ‘threatening Greenland and attacking our own government'.

The Republican president has become the face of the 2026 World Cup, which the United States are hosting this summer along with Canada and Mexico.

He was also awarded FIFA's inaugural peace prize in December.

America will host 78 of the 104 fixtures in the expanded 48-team men's World Cup.

England and Scotland have both qualified for the tournament in June, while Wales or Northern Ireland could also book their places through the play-offs.

Questions have been raised about whether European countries should go to the tournament after Trump announced he would place 10% tariffs on the eight countries over their refusal to let Trump take over Greenland.

German politician Jurgen Hardt said on Friday that boycotting the World Cup could be a ‘last resort' to ‘to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue'.

Mr Hoare, who represents North Dorset, has joined those calls, telling Metro that dropping out of the spectacle would ‘refocus Trump's mind'.

He told Metro: ‘We should send as many messages as possible to the Trump administration and the American people that there are certain red lines in regards to upholding sovereignty and international affairs.

‘If that means not going to the World Cup then we shouldn't go to the World Cup.

‘If it means cancelling a state visit, then we should cancel the state visit.

‘Trump is looking forward to America hosting the World Cup and all the benefits that accords to America.

‘We need to send a message to the White House that leadership has responsibilities.

‘It doesn't allow you to behave like some modern-day pirate, gangster, bully.'

On Sunday, Mr Hoare called for King Charles' spring visit to Washington to be scrapped – a suggestion endorsed by the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey.

Now a boycott of the World Cup has also found agreement across the political spectrum.

Labour's Kate Osborne MP, who is chair of the Women's Football All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), said she ‘supports those calling for a boycott.'

The Jarrow and Gateshead East representative told Metro: ‘Trump's appalling record on human rights, climate change, his flagrant contempt for the rule of law, his attacks on democracy, and an illegal war in Venezuela is not enough for him.

‘Now he is threatening Greenland and attacking our own government & politicians.

‘Last year there was huge public support for the successful campaign to refuse to legitimise Trump by allowing him the honour of addressing Parliament.

‘We need to see the same now in relation to the World Cup.

‘The USA should not be able to participate in the World Cup, let alone be part of hosting it, so yes I support those calling for a boycott.'

Three Lions Pride, England's official LGBTQ+ fan group, also announced last week they would not have a ‘visible presence' at the 2026 Men's World Cup due to what they called a ‘dangerous rollback of human rights' in the US.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to take place from June 11 to July 19, with 16 cities hosting the tournament – 11 in the US, three in Mexico, and two in Canada.

Labour MP Richard Burgon stopped short of endorsing a boycott, but called for the US to be barred from hosting the tournament.

He told Metro: ‘With Trump ripping up the international rulebook, letting the US host the World Cup would be a political gift to him and a complete own goal.

‘You don't reward bullies — you have to stand up to them. The World Cup should be moved to another country to send a clear message that international law still matters.'

The US president announced over the weekend that he would be imposing 10% tariffs on the UK, increased to 25% from June 1, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.

He said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.

The move sparked outrage across Europe, with Sir Keir Starmer telling an emergency press conference today that tariffs were ‘completely wrong'.

He added: ‘It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland security as a justification for economic pressure.'

In a joint statement warning about the potential impact of such a move, the eight affected NATO countries warned Trump's actions could create a ‘dangerous downward spiral'.

They said: ‘We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.

‘Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind.

‘Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.'

Metro has approached the Football Association and the Government for comment.

Marc Guehi has officially signed for Manchester City after completing a £20m ($27m) move from Crystal Palace. The England defender has penned a contract with City until 2031 and immediately boosts the team's injury-ravaged defence, with Pep Guardiola's side having lost Josko Gvardiol for the rest of the season while also missing Ruben Dias and John Stones.

City said in a statement: 'Manchester City is delighted to announce the signing of Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace. The 25-year-old has signed a five-and-a-half-year deal that will keep him at the Etihad Stadium until the summer of 2031. An England international with 26 caps to his name, Guéhi began his career at Chelsea. After an impressive loan spell with Swansea City in the 2020-21 campaign - where he helped them reach the Championship play-off final - he signed for Crystal Palace.  

'Following an exceptional summer at EURO 2024, where he was a stand-out player for England on their route to the final, he was named club captain for Oliver Glasner's side ahead of the 2024-25 campaign. Guéhi's first season as Palace captain saw him lead them to a major trophy and European football for the first time in their history after lifting the FA Cup against City last May. This success was followed by winning the FA Community Shield in August, beating Liverpool at Wembley Stadium. The defender has played 188 games and scored 11 goals for The Eagles.'

Guehi told City's official website: "I am really happy and incredibly proud to be a Manchester City player. This move feels like the culmination of all the hard work I have put into my career. I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad of players. It feels good to be able to say that. I want to grow as a player and a person, and I know at this club that's going to happen. I love football – it has given me so much for so long – and to be able to continue my development at Manchester City is a really special moment for me and my family.

"I absolutely cannot wait to get started now. I want to meet my teammates, train hard, understand what the manager expects of me and then show the City fans what I can do."

City's director of football Hugo Viana added: "It is clear Marc has been one of the best defenders in English football for quite some time now, so we are absolutely delighted to bring him to Manchester City. I feel we have signed a huge talent who will help us improve. He is only 25, but he has shown already he is a leader, a brilliant professional and someone desperate to improve. He is strong, has exceptional defensive qualities, is an intelligent reader of the game, and brings passion and energy every time he steps onto the pitch. I am so pleased it was us he chose to join. Marc is entering the prime years of his career. I am sure every City fan is excited to see how good he can be in a sky blue shirt."

Guehi came very close to joining Liverpool in the summer but now joins a City side who are still in the Premier League title race, trailing Arsenal by seven points.

In years past, the U.S. men's national team coaching staff would have the chance to assess players during a January camp, often with friendlies for North American-based players. In 2026, though, manager Mauricio Pochettino and U.S. Soccer opted otherwise, prioritizing European club form and focused MLS preseasons. 

While some of the top USMNT players like Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun struggled to produce over the weekend, several fringe players stood out as they sought more significant opportunities in the national team picture. 

As the European focus remains, the week also saw MLS teams begin preseason, and several will play preseason matches of varying intensity over the next several weeks before the league opens on Feb. 21. 

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top four performances of the week from American players across the globe. 

Aidan Morris has started to round into form with Middlesbrough and kept his consistency with a 90-minute effort in a 3–2 win over West Bromwich Albion on Friday.A former Columbus Crew academy player, Morris stood out in the American-heavy matchup, which saw him take on George Campbell and Darryl Dike, who both played in West Brom's first match under former Minnesota United manager Eric Ramsay.Continuing his blossoming partnership in a 4-4-2 midfield pivot with Hayden Hackney, Morris created two chances and made 20 passes into the final third, while also making six recoveries.Not likely a World Cup starter, his form through 2025–26 could put him in contention to play a key depth role this summer.

Another product of an MLS academy, former New York City FC midfielder James Sands netted his first Bundesliga goal in FC St. Pauli's 3–2 loss to Borussia Dortmund.Saturday's loss marked the 16th start in 16 appearances for Sands with St. Pauli this season, but his first goal or assist in a season that sees his side sitting last in the table after 17 matches.Outside of the goal, the 25-year-old created a pair of chances and made six defensive contributions in a comeback effort that fell short.While not likely a contender for the 2026 World Cup squad, given his 14 previous caps, any sustained production would certainly have him on Pochettino's radar.

The striker battle for the USMNT continues to heat up, and 2025 Gold Cup starter Patrick Agyemang is ensuring he stays in contention as a backup to presumed top choice, Folarin Balogun.The former Charlotte FC attacker found the back of the net for Derby County in a 1–0 win over Preston North End on Saturday, pushing his side up to 12th in the English Championship.With seven goals and four assists in 23 appearances this season, he has been one of the more consistent American players in the attack, outshining a player like Norwich City's Josh Sargent, who was demoted from the Canaries' first team as he looks for a transfer to Toronto FC.While not included among his 89-minute effort, Agyemang led the post-match celebrations between Derby's players and fans, showcasing just how quickly he has embedded himself in the club after joining in the summer. 

Tim Weah was central to Marseille's dominant 5–2 win over Angers in Ligue 1 action on Sunday, finding the back of the net for the second time in 2025–26.His goal came as Marseille's fourth before half time as he made a late run into the box, before rising for an aerial cutback from Hamed Traore, which he headed past the goalkeeper to cap off an outstanding first half for the squad from southern France. The 25-year-old played a key transitional role, providing vital linkups to Mason Greenwood, playing slightly inside and in front of him in the 3-4-2-1. Greenwood's goal to make it 2–0 came from Weah's skillful delay on the right side, before he lay off to the former Manchester United striker, who played a quick give-and-go with Emerson before finishing. With three goal contributions in 1,067 Ligue 1 minutes, Weah will look to maintain his form as a likely lock for the World Cup roster, vying for valuable minutes to showcase his skills in the USMNT's final four friendlies.

It's an eye-catching idea, says Simon Walters, but any European leader thinking about pulling out of the summer sporting showpiece would have to contend with a backlash from fans at home

Removed from bookmarks

As a well known football fan, and one who at 63, still plays the game, Keir Starmer is among the many Britons eagerly anticipating the football World Cup in America which starts in June. With England and Scotland already having qualified, possibly to be joined by Wales and Northern Ireland, he is far from alone in this country.

Nor is Starmer the only political leader looking forward to the event. Golf fanatic Donald Trump has never expressed much interest in football – until now. As a master self-publicist he was quick to spot the huge opportunity presented to him by the fact that his presidency coincides with the World Cup taking place in America.

He has cultivated a close, some would say unhealthily so, friendship with the head of Fifa Gianni Infantino, ensuring Trump will be centre stage when the tournament kicks off.

So imagine how embarrassing it would be to Trump if some countries pulled out in protest at his threats over Greenland. How much more damaging would such a boycott be if, for example, the nation involved was one of the World Cup giants? That is the notion that has been raised by German politician Jürgen Hardt of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's ruling CDU party.

Noting the close interest Trump had taken in the event, Hardt suggested Germany, four times World Cup winners, could consider boycotting it to pressure the White House regarding its threats to annex Greenland. Such a ploy could be used “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense”, said Hardt.

Clearly, the idea of a mass World Cup boycott is far-fetched, yet there is nothing new about such sporting boycotts – or of them being supported by Britain.

There have been five boycotts of Olympic Games, including Hitler's Berlin in 1936. Widespread global support for the sporting boycott of South Africa from the 1960s to 1990s was seen as a significant factor in the demise of apartheid.

The American government itself led one of the biggest sporting boycotts of all time when it refused to take part in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. The reason? The Soviet Union had illegally invaded another country: Afghanistan.

Margaret Thatcher, then British prime minister, supported the Moscow 1980 boycott, though left it to individual sports and athletes to decide whether to take part.

Yet never mind Keir Starmer's own love of football: with his poll ratings in the equivalent of the relegation zone, it seems unlikely that he would wish to make additional enemies of millions of British football fans by joining a World Cup boycott.

Would it even work as Herr Hardt seems to think? It is true that it a 2026 World Cup without the 16 European teams due to take part, including England, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Scotland, is almost unimaginable. The winners would be world champions in name only.

Equally, Trump's supporters would doubtless argue that if Europe withdrew from the World Cup it would merely add sport to the continent's increasing economic, cultural, diplomatic and military irrelevance.

Starmer and his fellow European leaders are currently in a desperate search for some means of applying pressure to the US over Greenland. A variety of means, mainly trade reprisals have been proposed.

It will not stop calls for other ways of hitting Trump where it hurts. If the president matches his chilling threats to Denmark and Europe over Greenland with deeds, by the time he attends America's first match in the competition, against Paraguay on June 12 in Los Angeles, US troops may have taken over Greenland.

Little Denmark could still qualify for the World Cup if they win in the forthcoming play-offs.

Could they, or any other self respecting nation, take part if Trump has raised the Stars and Stripes over Greenland by then?

Patrick Agyemang and Haji Wright celebrate their winning goals in the Championship this weekend Barrington Coombs/PA Images via Getty Images; Jacob King/PA Images via Getty Images

Big tournaments can often hinge on late drama. Success can depend upon having the players who can find that vital edge when everyone else is gassing. The remarkable finale to AFCON over the weekend proves as much.

So when Mauricio Pochettino is considering his striking options for this summer's World Cup, he may keep in mind two forwards who are regularly proving capable of providing that critical cutting edge in England's Championship.

Both, in different ways, have had to show resilience this season. And both have been rewarded.

First there is Haji Wright who, in coming off the bench to grab table-topping Coventry's late winner against Leicester City, ended a run of 17 league games without a goal stretching back to October.

Frank Lampard's side had trailed against their Midlands rivals, but made it 1-1 just after half-time on Saturday before Wright's 85th-minute strike kept their title hopes well on track.

Afterwards Lampard was full of praise for the 27-year-old's determination to end his dry streak through sheer hard work.

“In my job, there are times to talk to players and times to leave them be a little bit,” he told the BBC. “I played as a goalscoring player and I had (dry) periods, and there's only one way out of it. That's to work really hard.

“The problem for Haji and the team was that we haven't had training time so this week was a competitive training week, and when you train and things aren't dropping for you on the pitch, my only belief is that you work, work, work and stay positive and things will happen for you.

‘The thing that happened for him today is a tap-in and I'm not belittling it because that's the way it goes.

— Coventry City (@Coventry_City) January 18, 2026



“Now it's for him to continue in that vein. He was such a problem for Leicester when he came on: running in behind, holding it up, tracking back, giving fouls away because he's trying to make tackles on the halfway line to see out the game for us. That's what we needed from everyone, but when Haji can do it, he's a special player for us.”

On that note, Patrick Agyemang said ‘hold my beer' — and in Derby's game went one better by scoring the only goal of a nail-biting victory at promotion hopefuls Preston North End.

The 25-year-old from East Hartford, Conn., scored his seventh of the season in the league in the 82nd minute, after earlier missing two good chances. He celebrated like it meant an awful lot to him, too, soaking up the acclaim from a jubilant away end at Preston's Deepdale stadium.

Later, he told his club website about how he was winning his striker's mental battle. “I had a chance I would normally put away and I didn't, but I had to regroup and think: ‘We're on the front foot still and the boys need me to score. I can't let it dwindle my game,'” he said.

“It's tough because, as a striker, you want to score every chance you get. We're all human, so nobody is always going to score every chance, but for me it's most important when I hear the fans backing me and my boys on the team cheering me saying: ‘Pat go again, next one.' You keep going.

“On a personal note, I've been working on this mental battle in terms of being a striker and those opportunities and knowing things won't go well all the time, but it's always about the next one and I was able to show that today.”

The goals come as an obvious contrast to the situation currently facing Josh Sargent, the Norwich City striker banished to train with the U-21s after taking himself out of contention for an FA Cup match over a transfer wish. Time is ticking until the U.S.'s last window before the World Cup squad is chosen, and as the jockeying for a place behind the more-entrenched Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi intensifies, Sargent's out of commission while his chief competition has found success.

It wasn't quite so upbeat for Chris Richards and Crystal Palace.

This time last year, things were going so well for the USMNT defender and his Premier League team as they embarked on what would be a historically successful FA Cup campaign, and qualification for UEFA competition.

Richards was loving playing as part of an ultra-dependable, three-man band of brothers at the back, alongside captain Marc Guehi and Maxime Lacroix.

But fast-forward to the present day and things are starting to unravel.

Holders Palace were dumped out of the cup at the third-round stage by a non-League team — sixth-tier Macclesfield beat them 2-1 — Guehi is joining Manchester City, and manager Oliver Glasner is off in the summer, too.

Then on Saturday, perhaps predictably given the turmoil and uncertainty surrounding the Londoners, they lost 2-1 to Sunderland. Richards, who was voted 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year last week, came back down to earth with a hefty bump and would be forgiven wondering what can go wrong next.

In Serie A, it was a low-key weekend for USMNT stars Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie.

The former was at least part of a key victory for Milan on Sunday evening, as they edged past Lecce with a 1-0 win that kept them in the title race and three points behind rivals Inter at the top.

Pulisic had a quiet game by his standards, and has now gone five games without a goal after an otherwise blustering individual start to the campaign.

At least his team won. McKennie, who conversely has been in fine personal form, started but could not prevent Juventus dropping points on Saturday as they lost 1-0 to 15th-placed Cagliari.

In the Italian second tier, though, it was a thoroughly positive weekend for American Gianluca Busio.

The Venezia midfielder scored his fourth goal of the Serie B season to start the ball rolling on a 3-1 win over Catanzaro on Saturday. The victory means Venezia are now second in the table and only a point behind Frosinone at the top.

Busio's former midfield team-mate in Venice, Tanner Tessmann, may have departed last year for bigger things at Lyon in France's Ligue 1 — he started as they won on Sunday — but the 23-year-old still in Italy is still playing an integral part in Venezia's hopes of getting back into the top flight.

In Tessmann's current league, Tim Weah was on the scoresheet with Marseille's fourth in a 5-2 rout of Angers, ending a nine-match goalless run with his third score in all competitions this season.

Last but not least, also in Ligue 1 and on the still-U.S.-eligible front, Connecticut-born Luca Koleosho made a winning impression on loan with Paris FC. The 21-year-old joined Paris earlier this month after briefly spending time on loan from Burnley with Espanyol, and made it a fairytale start by netting the winner in their 2-1 victory at Nantes. (Koleosho is currently an Italy youth international with eligibility for the U.S., Canada and Nigeria)

One shot, one goal — he will hope for more like this.

It's Champions League time again, so all eyes are on the USMNT contingent in action this week.

Balogun will be hoping for better fortune with Monaco. The USMNT striker missed two chances and was taken off injured in their 3-1 home defeat by Lorient on Friday.

See if he recovers in time to face Real Madrid (Tuesday, 3pm, Paramount +).

Manchester United have dealt a blow to Roma's hopes of signing Joshua Zirkzee, with the Italian club's director confirming Old Trafford chiefs have issued a firm "no" to any deal. Despite the injured Dutch forward's desire to leave in search of regular game time to boost his international prospects, United are refusing to sanction an exit, leaving caretaker boss Michael Carrick with an unhappy player as he prepares for a crucial trip to Arsenal.

United's hierarchy appears to have drawn a definitive line in the sand regarding the future of Zirkzee, leaving Roma frustrated in their pursuit of the Dutch forward. The Serie A giants have made no secret of their admiration for Zirkzee, identifying him as a key target to bolster their attacking options for the second half of the season. However, speaking to the Italian media ahead of his side's recent 2-0 victory over Torino, Roma director of football Frederic Massara conceded that a deal is now highly unlikely due to United's stubborn stance.

Massara revealed that the dialogue between the two clubs had essentially reached a dead end weeks ago. "Manchester United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago and they have not changed their minds," Massara stated, painting a bleak picture for any deadline-day drama. The clarity of the rejection suggests that United are unwilling to weaken their squad depth mid-season, even for a player who is currently on the fringes of the starting 11.

For Roma, the public admission serves as a signal that they may need to move on to alternative targets. For United, it is a statement of intent that players will only leave on the club's terms, regardless of interest from elite European rivals. The decision locks Zirkzee into the squad at Old Trafford for the remainder of the campaign, forcing him to fight for his place once he returns to full fitness.

The forward is currently sidelined with an injury, a setback that saw him watching United's emphatic derby victory over Manchester City from the directors' box rather than contributing on the pitch. While his teammates celebrated a morale-boosting win, Zirkzee's personal focus has reportedly been on securing a pathway to regular first-team football.

The Dutchman is reportedly desperate to leave Old Trafford to further his international ambitions. With the Netherlands national team selection remaining highly competitive, Zirkzee knows that bench-warming duties at United will do little to impress coach Ronald Koeman ahead of the World Cup. A move to Roma, where he would likely have been offered a more prominent role, was seen as the ideal solution to reignite his season and stake a claim for an international spot.

Instead, he faces the prospect of reintegrating into a squad where competition is fierce and the manager's position is in a state of flux. Carrick, in charge until the end of the season, will now be tasked with managing the morale of a player who has been explicitly told he cannot leave, despite making his desire to exit clear.

While the door remains shut for Zirkzee, speculation continues to swirl regarding potential arrivals at Old Trafford. Reports have intensified over the weekend suggesting that a deal for former Wolves skipper Ruben Neves could be edging closer, adding fuel to the fire that United are looking to add experience to their midfield engine room. Neves, a player long admired by the Old Trafford faithful, would bring a proven Premier League pedigree to Carrick's squad.

However, club sources have repeatedly sought to dampen expectations of a busy January window. The official line from the red half of Manchester is that signings will only be sanctioned if they align with a "long-term plan". This cautious approach has already seen them miss out on other targets, most notably Antoine Semenyo.

The Semenyo situation serves as a painful reminder of United's current transfer market struggles. The forward turned down a move to Old Trafford in favour of joining rivals Manchester City, a decision that stung even more when he featured against United in Saturday's derby.

Amidst the transfer noise and boardroom posturing, Carrick must keep the squad focused on matters on the pitch. United fans have enjoyed an excellent weekend following the victory over City, a result that has injected a much-needed dose of optimism into the fanbase. The win at Old Trafford was a tactical triumph for Carrick, proving that this squad still possesses the quality to compete with the very best when properly motivated.

However, the challenges for Carrick do not get any easier as he prepares his side for a daunting trip to face Arsenal on Sunday. The Gunners are a formidable prospect on their home turf, and United will need to replicate the intensity and discipline shown in the derby to take anything from the game.

Carrick's ability to insulate his players from the transfer speculation surrounding Zirkzee and Neves will be vital. With the squad settled for now, the interim manager can now demand total focus. The "No" given to Roma regarding Zirkzee may have been a headache for the player, but for Carrick, it ensures he retains his depth as he attempts to navigate a defining run of fixtures for the club.

Chelsea have received a major boost regarding Levi Colwill's recovery from a devastating knee injury, with optimism growing that the defender will return before the season ends. However, the Blues are refusing to stand still, accelerating plans to sign a £60m-rated replacement this month to address the defensive crisis that contributed to Enzo Maresca's mid-season exit.

The England international, who has been sidelined since sustaining a serious knee injury during pre-season, is making impressive strides in his rehabilitation. According to BBC Sport, Colwill's recovery is "progressing well," leading to a growing sense of optimism within the medical department that he will feature for the first team later in the current campaign.

The loss of Colwill was a hammer blow to Chelsea's preparations for the 2025-26 season. Viewed as the cornerstone of the club's long-term defensive project, his absence left a void in the backline that the squad has struggled to fill. His ability to break lines with his passing and his composure in possession were seen as vital to the tactical setup, and his unavailability was a primary factor in the team's defensive instability during the first half of the season.

However, the club remain adamant that Colwill's long-term future is secure. He remains central to the hierarchy's vision for the next decade, and there is no desire to rush him back unnecessarily. Yet, the prospect of having him available for the crucial run-in fixtures could provide a psychological and tactical lift as Chelsea look to salvage their season. While a precise return date remains fluid, the fact that a return this season is being discussed as a realistic possibility is a testament to the player's dedication to his recovery.

Despite the positive news on Colwill, the Chelsea board has taken an internal decision to stop waiting for the summer and address their centre-back issues immediately. The club have brought forward their recruitment plans by six months and opened talks to sign Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet during the current winter transfer window.

The Blues have reportedly held discussions with both the French club and the 20-year-old's representatives. Jacquet, a France Under-21 international, is understood to be keen on the switch to Stamford Bridge. However, the deal is far from straightforward. Rennes are determined to keep hold of their prized asset mid-season and are currently quoting a fee in excess of £60 million to sanction a sale this month.

Chelsea are aware that there is "substantial rival interest" in Jacquet, which may be forcing their hand to move now rather than risk a bidding war in the summer. The desire to recruit a ball-playing centre-back specifically mirrors the profile of Colwill, suggesting the club wants to ensure they are never left this short of distribution quality from the back again.

If the valuation for Jacquet proves prohibitive, Chelsea have identified alternative targets to bolster their ranks. The club are monitoring Como defender Jacobo Ramon, a rising star in Serie A following his move from Real Madrid. Closer to home, Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi has emerged as a potential cut-price solution. The Argentine defender is out of contract at the end of the season, meaning he could be available for a reduced fee in January. Senesi brings Premier League experience and the ball-playing ability Chelsea crave, though they face stiff competition from Juventus for his signature. As of now, Chelsea have yet to make formal contact with the South Coast club, but Senesi remains a viable contingency plan should negotiations with Rennes hit a dead end.

The urgency of Chelsea's January activity is heavily influenced by the ghost of the summer transfer window. Former manager Enzo Maresca, who was sacked this month, had identified the centre-back position as a priority area for reinforcement. His key target, Dean Huijsen, eventually opted to join Real Madrid, leaving Maresca short of options when Colwill suffered his injury. The club's failure to secure a suitable alternative was a source of major frustration for the Italian coach and played a contributory role in the friction that led to his exit.

Looking ahead, the summer promises further upheaval. There is a growing expectation that both Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo will reach a "crossroads" in their Chelsea careers. With both players entering the final two years of their contracts, the club will likely force a decision: sign an extension or face being sold to preserve transfer value. This looming uncertainty makes the successful recruitment of a centre-back in January all the more critical, ensuring the squad is not left exposed again as they attempt to transition into a new era

It has been revealed that Tottenham midfielder Pape Matar Sarr was rushed to hospital after falling ill during the Africa Cup of Nations final. The 23-year-old had been named among Senegal's substitutes for a meeting with hosts Morocco. He never made it onto the field and missed post-match celebrations, following a chaotic contest, after requiring medical assistance.

It is claimed that Sarr complained of feeling unwell during the half-time interval. Just minutes prior to that, he had been sent out to warm up on the touchline, with Senegal's coaching team considering changes after Monaco star Lamine Camara picked up a knock.

He was eventually cleared to continue and Sarr never made his way back to the bench. Senegal lost Krepin Diatta and Ousseynou Niang prior to a ball being kicked, with head coach Pape Thiaw seeing his pre-game plans disrupted.

Video footage has emerged of Diatta hunched over the advertising hoardings at the side of the field, while Niang had to be physically carried and escorted back to the dressing room by his international colleagues after taking a turn for the worse.

The wellbeing of their close friends and team-mates provided an unwelcome distraction for Senegal as they sought to capture a continental crown. Camara did, however, tell reporters when asked for an update on Sarr, Diatta and Niang: “They're in the hospital, but I hope they're doing well.”

Senegalese news outlet Taggat went on to report that: “The three players are doing well, according to the doctor, at Mohammed VI Hospital in Rabat. Ousseynou Niang will return to the hotel. Krepin Diatta and Pape Matar Sarr are still being kept at the hospital for further observations.”

Belgian outfit Royale Union Saint-Gilloise, who are competing in the Champions League this season, confirmed that Niang - who is contracted to them - had been well enough to join in with wild celebrations. They posted online: “Ousseynou Niang is an AFCON winner! After extra time, the Lions of Teranga defeated Morocco 1-0 in the final. Niang felt unwell before the game and was taken to hospital along with two team-mates. It has since been confirmed he is doing well and has rejoined the Senegalese squad.”

Senegal defender Ismail Jakobs said during his discussions with members of the assembled press in the mixed zone: “A lot happened before the match. I think a lot will come out afterwards. It wasn't just this situation. Plenty happened before the match too. But you'll find out. A lot happened to Krepin, Ousseynou, and Pape Matar Sarr at half-time.”

Everton star Idrissa Gana Gueye paid tribute to those that missed out on the chance to savour a joyous occasion for their nation: “This victory is for them; we had that in mind.”

Senegal prevailed 1-0 on the night, with Villarreal midfielder Pape Gueye netting what proved to be the decisive goal in the 94th minute - with extra-time required in order to determine a winner.

A controversial contest saw Crystal Palace forward Ismaila Sarr have a late goal chalked off for Senegal following a supposed foul on Paris Saint-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi. Morocco were then awarded a penalty deep into stoppage-time.

Another soft call there led to some Senegal players storming off the field in protest, led by head coach Thiaw. They were, however, beckoned back by Sadio Mane - with the former Liverpool star, who is now with Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, displaying commendable leadership skills as captain of his country.

He eventually got his hands on the trophy as Brahim Diaz fluffed his lines from the spot. The Real Madrid winger bizarrely chose to clip a Panenka effort straight down the middle, and saw ex-Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy catch his shot with ease.

Senegal are said to be planning a trophy parade when returning to their homeland on Tuesday, with it yet to be determined whether Sarr will form part of those celebrations in Dakar before he heads back to north London.

A FIFA spokesperson has issued a strong statement after calls for Donald Trump to be stripped of the 2025 FIFA Peace Prize, which the US President was awarded before the FIFA World Cup draw in December 2025.

Trump was presented with the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize before the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on December 5.

The 79-year-old was given a golden trophy, medal, and certificate by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who stood alongside Trump as he made a speech to the crowd in Washington D.C.

During his speech, the US President claimed that he had saved “tens of millions of lives” through interventions and that he had “stopped wars happening just before they started”.

Advert

FIFA has described the award as something that rewards “individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world”.

However, since receiving the medal, the Trump administration has been heavily criticised for taking military action in Venezuela.

On January 2, Trump announced that US forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro along with his wife, Cilia Flores, after a covert operation.

Advert

Trump has also issued threats that the US will take military action against Iran, Mexico, Colombia, and Greenland.

The 79-year-old claims that the US “needs Greenland” for security purposes and has urged the Danish government, which rules the country, to hand the territory over to the US.

European allies have since pushed back against Trump before the US President announced plans to impose tariffs on the UK and the allies until a deal is struck for the US to take over Greenland.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the plans as “completely wrong”.

Advert

Meanwhile, in a statement to The Guardian, FIFA has doubled down on its stance to give Trump the peace prize despite the threats to take over Greenland and take military action in several other nations.

A spokesperson said: “FIFA strongly supports its annual peace prize, an award to recognise exceptional actions for peace and unity. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado] has given her medal to President Trump.

“FIFA has strong relations with President Trump, along with leaders from fellow co-hosts Canada and Mexico. This has resulted in good working relationships leading to, for example, in the US, the formation of the White House Task Force for the FIFA World Cup.”

But the Guardian also reports that there is a growing sense of embarrassment among officials within FIFA about the awarding of the peace prize to Trump.

SPORTbible has contacted FIFA for comment.

As Toronto and Vancouver gear up to co-host FIFA World Cup games this summer, an emergency doctor worries that Canada's overburdened health-care system won't be able to handle any extra demand that could result.

In an editorial published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) Dr. Catherine Varner points out that Canada's health-care system is already in a "constant state of surge capacity." Add in hundreds of thousands of visitors, she wrote, and it could be a recipe for disaster. 

"Speaking from working right now in the middle of our flu season, where we haven't been able to handle a surge in acute care need anywhere in Canada it seems, I would be concerned going forward about having a surge in need for hospital resources," said Varner, CMAJ's deputy editor and an emergency doctor in downtown Toronto, in an interview with CBC News.

Her concern is supported by years of research showing that health issues — like infectious disease outbreaks, food-borne illnesses and alcohol overconsumption — can strain emergency rooms during or after mass gatherings. 

For example, researchers found that a strain of measles was introduced to Vancouver during the 2010 Olympic Winter Games and resulted in an outbreak of 82 cases three months after the event. 

Researchers have also noted that during the Calgary Stampede, there is an increase in emergency department visits related to trauma, substance-abuse and minor injuries. And research has also found that World Cup matches could trigger an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies.  

There's also the possibility of large-scale attacks that can send many to hospital, like the one that took place early last year at Vancouver's Lapu-Lapu festival. 

Varner started looking into these sorts of examples after working at a Toronto hospital during the Toronto Blue Jays' World Series run this past fall.

"We had one ICU bed available and I could not imagine what we would do if we faced an event downtown where we needed to see a lot of patients quickly," she said of the hospital she works at.

And while Varner says she knows that in extreme cases there's a process in place to quickly move patients and free up the emergency department, she questions how that would work given the current state of health care in Canada. 

"The challenge is execution of those plans in a health-care system that does not have enough hospital beds on any given day," she said. 

Canada is co-hosting this year's FIFA World Cup along with the United States and Mexico. And with six games scheduled in Toronto and seven in Vancouver, the country could see hundreds of thousands of visitors over the course of four weeks. 

Crowds of fans interacting with each other before, during and after matches is the perfect breeding ground for various infectious diseases, specifically respiratory or food and water-borne ones, according to a report from Public Health Ontario. 

Following a months-long risk assessment, the provincial health agency determined that measles, COVID-19 and food and water-borne outbreaks like food poisoning or hepatitis A, are "likely" during the World Cup games.  

Dr. Brian Conway, the medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, says he's most concerned about measles, given the recent outbreaks across Canada that have caused the country to lose its elimination status.

"Measles is so contagious," he said. "It will spread potentially like wildfire. And that'll put a strain not only on the health-care system … but the public health system will be doing contact tracing amongst a lot of people." 

Conway, who is not part of any health-care planning for the World Cup, said people should make sure they're up to date with their vaccinations. 

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),  some of which are on the rise in Canada, are another key concern for Conway, who says condoms and treatment for STIs should be easily available. 

He says he hopes existing disaster and surge plans will "be enough to deal with anything that comes forward." 

Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, the deputy chief medical officer of health with Vancouver Coastal Health, is also confident that the city will be able to handle any sort of public health emergency. 

"The health system does respond to issues like this with some regularity and does have mechanisms in place," said Lysyshyn, who is part of public health planning for Vancouver's FIFA games. 

"Although the health-care system operates at pretty much capacity, it does have a lot of mechanisms to get extra capacity." 

And while Lysyshyn acknowledged that it's not ideal to have to cancel surgeries or move people around, he says that's how the system here works.

"We have to prioritize the system to deal with the problems that are most urgent." 

St. Michael's Hospital trauma surgeon Dr. Andrew Beckett says all hospitals have robust plans to accept a large number of people in need of immediate medical attention. 

"The Taylor Swift concert, we had plans in place," said Beckett, who is also the medical director of the hospital's trauma program.

When it comes to the World Cup, Beckett says he's part of a planning group alongside leadership from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and Sick Kids. 

"We're looking at ways of being able to surge capacity within the hospitals by shutting down some elective surgeries if needed. Also recalling [staff] that may be in the area and available to help out in a crisis," said Beckett. 

He also said they would triage patients to hospitals depending on the severity of their injuries and the level of care needed. 

Beckett says the province has provided additional funding to support emergency resources during the World Cup games, though he couldn't say how much.

Ontario's Ministry of Health didn't respond to questions about extra staffing or resources available to support an increase in demand, nor did it confirm whether additional funding is available for hospitals. 

In an email last week, a spokesperson said the government will work with all health-care partners to "ensure they have the tools they need to deliver high-quality care." 

In a report to city council, Toronto Public Health (TPH) listed several ways it's preparing for various health emergencies, including launching a food safety portal to keep track of inspections and more easily share information about possible illnesses with the public. 

As for extreme heat or wildfire smoke, the health unit says it will amp up its communication to visitors and will have misting stations and water trucks available.

The city is also launching a wastewater testing program for the stadium and fan zone areas, which can be an early indicator of circulating infections.

Carlos Alcaraz's new-look serve has been the hot topic around the tennis world this past week and the Spaniard himself admitted in Melbourne that there might be a familiar influence behind it.

That influence? Novak Djokovic.

On Monday night at the Australian Open, Djokovic was finally asked about the resemblance and he didn't miss the chance to have some fun with it.

“As soon as I saw it, I sent him a message. I said, we have to speak about the copyrights,” Djokovic said with a smile. “Then when I saw him here, I told him we have to talk about percentage of his winnings. Every ace I expect, you know, a tribute to me. Every ace that he makes here. Let's see if he's going to stick to the agreement.”



Djokovic, who could only meet Alcaraz in the final in Melbourne, was doing plenty of damage on his own serve in his first-round win at the Australian Open on Monday.

The record 10-time champion won 93 per cent of his first-serve points and did not face a break point en route to victory against Pedro Martinez. Djokovic has now won 100 matches at the hard-court major, moving to within two wins of Roger Federer's all-time mark of 102.

The 38-year-old Serbian was pleased with how he started.

“It felt good tonight. Let's see how it's going to feel in a few days' time,” Djokovic said on how his body and mind are feeling. “Performance-wise, the feeling on the court, it was great. I couldn't ask for more. Obviously a great serving performance. Just overall felt really good on the court that has made me feel good on it for so many times throughout my career.”

The No. 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic will next face Italian Francesco Maestrelli in what will be a first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting between the two.

The 40-year-old delivered on his wild card opportunity by overcoming Laslo Djere from a set down Monday.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jan 19, 2026 copy_link

Throughout the season-opening United Cup, Stan Wawrinka showed he could still go toe-to-toe with the ATP's Top 50—and a returning-from-injury Hubert Hurkacz—over a five-match stretch to kick off his farewell season.During Switzerland's runner-up finish to Poland, the 40-year-old was awarded the final men's wild card into the Australian Open main draw. On Monday, the 2014 champion made good on Tennis Australia granting him the opportunity to play at Melbourne Park one last time.

During Switzerland's runner-up finish to Poland, the 40-year-old was awarded the final men's wild card into the Australian Open main draw. On Monday, the 2014 champion made good on Tennis Australia granting him the opportunity to play at Melbourne Park one last time.

In all five of his United Cup contests, Wawrinka found himself playing from behind—winning once over 27th-ranked Arthur Rinderknech. Taking a spirited Kia Arena, a prepared Wawrinka rallied past Laslo Djere for a 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory after three hours and 23 minutes.“I've been working really hard to stay in shape, to push myself. I think also the week in United Cup helped me a lot because I played over three hours back-to-back, plus a lot of tennis on the court, high level,” Wawrinka reflected in his press conference.“It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.”

“It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.”

The three-time major winner celebrated his first win at the Happy Slam in five years, and first overall on the Grand Slam stage since 2024 Wimbledon. Wawrinka shared while he still feels the nerves on the match court, those butterflies—more than anything—are a driving force behind his passion.“That's always been positive for me. That means I really care. That means I really want to do well. I'm really pushing myself,” he commented.“That's when you need to be really disciplined with yourself, with your brain, with what you have to do during the match.”​

Against Djere, Wawrinka produced 14 aces and won 75 percent of his total points on serve. The former world No. 3 isn't trying to turn back the clock with what he brings to the court, but rather, unleash the best 2026 version of Stanimal.“I know I'm not as good as I was before. I know I'm not physical and tennis-wise as I was before. That's normal,” he said. “I'm getting old. But I'm still happy with what I'm doing, always trying to push my own limit, always trying to be better.”Wawrinka, ranked No. 139 coming into this event, now holds 159 major match wins. His next opponent? One.Qualifier Arthur Gea made sure his debut in a Grand Slam main draw was one to commemorate, knocking out No. 17 seed Jiri Lehecka. The 21-year-old French qualifier advanced, 7-5, 7-6 (1), 7-5, in his first tour-level appearance.

Novak Djokovic marked a triumphant return to his most successful event on Monday at the Australian Open, where he added another historic milestone at the hard-court major.

The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings delivered a near-flawless display to defeat Pedro Martinez 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, sealing his 100th career victory at Melbourne Park. The record 10-time Australian Open champion, Djokovic will now set his sights on surpassing Roger Federer's all-time mark of 102 match wins at the tournament.

“What can I say? I like the sound of it… Centurion is pretty nice,” Djokovic said. “It's nice to be a centurion in these numbers. History making is a great motivation, particularly in the last five, 10 years of my career. Once I got myself in a position to create history, I was even more inspired to play the best tennis.

“I was very fortunate early on to encounter some people that taught me and guided me to play the long shot with my career: not to burn out too quickly, and try to have the longest career possible. I'm blessed to still be playing at this level.”

Djokovic has now recorded 100 or more victories at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and is the only player to achieve that feat at three different major tournaments. 

Djokovic's record at Grand Slam tournaments (prior to AO R2)



Advancing to the second round in his 19th consecutive Australian Open appearance, Djokovic will next face 23-year-old Italian qualifier Francesco Maestrelli. The debutant fought past Terence Atmane 6-4, 3-6, 6-7(4), 6-1, 6-1 to earn his first main-draw victory at a major. 

Amid lingering questions surrounding his fitness, particularly during last year's run to the semi-finals in New York, Djokovic looked extremely sharp and mobile. In his first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Martinez — and first match since winning the Athens title in November — Djokovic controlled play from the baseline and struck more than three times as many winners as the Spaniard (49-14).

The 38-year-old Serbian reached the semi-finals at all four Grand Slams last season, and his pursuit of an 11th Melbourne crown could hinge on a potential semi-final showdown with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner.





Casper Ruud also safely advanced to the second round by defeating Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 for his 50th major win. The 27-year-old, who is expecting a daughter alongside his wife, Maria, will next meet Jaume Munar after the Spaniard battled past Dalibor Svrcina 3-6, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5, 6-3.

“It was a perfect start to this tournament and this court is probably one of my favourites in the world,” 12th seed Ruud said of Margaret Court Arena. “It's a really good atmosphere and a great way to kick off. I'm excited to be back here in a couple of days. I have to thank Maria for letting me [come] in the first place. I know she's back home resting, getting ready.”

Suffering no fools, she never shies to give unvarnished opinions on her favorite pop star—and when Taylor Swift's latest album dropped in October, she gave it an enthusiastic review."I think it's just consistent and really great and really exciting," Swiatek said at the time, later receiving a merch package from Ms. Swift herself.But in the wake of a more middling critical reception, has LOAS held up for Swiatek on repeat listens?

But in the wake of a more middling critical reception, has LOAS held up for Swiatek on repeat listens?

“Yeah, I like it,” Swiatek said, holding firm after a straight-sets victory at the 2026 Australian Open. “Honestly, people are going to criticize everything, so... I think it was great. I mean, it's kind of short. It's not like you're going to find some surprising things on it after you listened to it couple of times.“The songs are catchy. That's what she wanted. That's what she said from the beginning. She achieved the goal she wanted. Every song is a hit on this album. But yeah, I guess you can find different stuff in art and music. If some people have different expectations and they look at an album like that, they will always find something to criticize.”Asked to name her favorite track, the six-time Grand Slam champion unsurprisingly picked a song from the album's stronger first half.“Honestly, it's hard to pick because she keeps the level high. The whole album is kind of consistent. I like ‘Elizabeth Taylor,' but I wouldn't say it's much higher in my rank than other in terms of the likability.”Swiatek was consistent enough Monday night to outsteady an inspired Yuan Yue, outlasting the Chinese star to advance into the second round Down Under; her next opponent is Marie Bouzkova.But the question remains: can Swiatek avoid the fate of Ophelia in Melbourne?

Djokovic had never played Martinez before, but it looked like he knew exactly what to do from start to finish on Monday night, breaking the No. 71-ranked Spaniard in his opening service game and riding that break to the first set. He then stepped on the gas, breaking twice in each of the next two sets to cruise to victory after exactly two hours on court.The numbers told the story—Djokovic had more than twice as many winners as errors, 49 to 21, including 14 aces to no double faults.And not only did he never face a break point in 13 service games, he never even lost more than one point in any of his service games—he held eight times at love and five times at 15, and that was it.It's now been 20 years since Djokovic last lost in the first round of a major, to American Paul Goldstein at the 2006 Australian Open.

No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek came in the clutch winning three of the final four games and the tiebreak in the first set to spearhead a 7-6 (5). 6-3 win over Yuan Yue. The six-time Grand Slam champion defeated the qualifier behind 24 winners and taking 72% of the points on her first-serve.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Iga Swiatek advanced to the second round of the Australian Open on Sunday, defeating Yuan Yue 7-6(5), 6-3 after being pushed to a first-set tiebreak.

Swiatek had been far more comfortable in their previous meeting, dropping only three games, but Yuan raised her level this time by extending rallies and holding serve, pushing the first set to a tiebreak before Swiatek closed out the match in two hours.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Swiatek's composure showed late in the opening set. Yuan served for the set at 5-4 and stayed level through the tiebreak, but Swiatek began to take control of the exchanges, finishing the night with 24 winners. Several landed so close to the lines that Yuan hesitated, a reflection of Swiatek's precision under pressure.

"There were some moments where I felt great, but the start of the match wasn't that perfect," Swiatek said in press afterward. "I'm happy that I worked through this and could, yeah, finish in two sets as you said. Also during tiebreak play more aggressively and more precise."

Swiatek carried that momentum into the second set, winning the first three games. She won 72% of points on her first serve and took advantage of Yuan's second serve, capturing 21 of 34 points (62%).

At 4-3 in the second set, Swiatek took the final two games with one more break -- she won nearly half (40-of-82) of receiving points, compared to Yuan's 36% -- and earned her 25th straight Grand Slam first-round win on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. 

Yuan, who won three qualifying matches to enter the first round, jumped out to an early lead with a break of Swiatek and a hold in the first set. She often matched Swiatek's power in their rallies, and Swiatek racked up 21 unforced errors to Yuan's 13 in the first set. Compared to their first meeting where Yuan had just one break point opportunity, she converted 3-of-7.

Though Swiatek tied the first set at 3-3, Yuan's next two games followed a similar pattern with a break and hold, setting herself up with two games to close the first set. Swiatek bounced back winning three of the next four games to force the tiebreak, which Yuan managed to win five points. 

In the second set, after falling 3-0 and taking a medical timeout for a lower back issue, Yuan won three of the next four, including a 16-point, 10-minute game to cut the deficit to 4-3. 

"I think she played well," Swiatek said of her opponent. "She used the opportunities that I gave her a bit. Yeah, was kind of playing pretty strong from the forehand side. She was for sure going for her shots, playing fast. Yeah, she played good."

In the first set tiebreak, Yuan and Swiatek alternated points up until Swiatek led 5-4. During the the 10th point of the tiebreak, Yuan kept traded strong shots back-and-forth, but an incidental net cord forced Swiatek to come to the net. 

The World No. 2 had several backhand winners, but none more momentous than this one. Despite the net cord, Swiatek's quick adjustment allowed her to smash home a backhand winner -- she had 15 winners in the first alone -- and create a double set point opportunity. Though Yuan saved one with an ace, another Swiatek backhand winner ended the set.

No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek came in the clutch winning three of the final four games and the tiebreak in the first set to spearhead a 7-6 (5). 6-3 win over Yuan Yue. The six-time Grand Slam champion defeated the qualifier behind 24 winners and taking 72% of the points on her first-serve.

The American admitted the standing-room only Court 6 crowd of Filipino fans took some getting used to before winning in three sets.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 19, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Alexandra Eala made a high-wattage debut at the 2026 Australian Open on Monday but was unable to channel the energy of a jam-packed Court 6 crowd and ultimately bowed out, 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.“That's one of the things that makes a loss like today a little bit harder is I know a lot of people were rooting for me,” the 20-year-old Filipina No. 1 said in her post-match press conference.Eala became the breakout star of the 2025 season when she stunned world No. 2 Iga Swiatek en route to the Miami Open semifinals, and became the first from her country to win a Grand Slam main draw match at the US Open last summer.Playing on an outer court that belied her growing star power, Eala appeared poised to score another win when she blanked Parks in the opening set but the big-serving American eventually steadied to secure the win.“It was very difficult,” a smiling Parks said after the match. “It was like, I was expecting it, but I wasn't. She definitely has a good crowd. I was just telling myself to stay in the zone and that I got to do what I got to do.”

Parks made her own major breakthrough at this tournament back in 2024 when she reached the third round against Coco Gauff, but has struggled with consistency since. The crowd left Parks visibly rattled early on as she netted two overheads in her opening serve game to get broken.“It definitely wasn't the worst,” she said of the crowd's general decorum, “but in between first and second serves and the clapping when you miss, that's just something I had to ignore and get used to the whole match.”Having played in similarly partisan environments at Roland Garros, Parks credited that experience with what ultimately got her over the finish line.“I don't know what my record is with crowds that are against me, but it definitely puts a fire under me!” she laughed. “I would say I'm good when crowds are against me.”

For Eala, the match was the culmination of an at-times overwhelming week playing the at the Asia-Pacific Grand Slam event, describing large crowds even for her practices.“I didn't expect that many people to be there,” said Eala. “So it's a learning process, like anything.Her online presence is even greater; a video of her pre-tournament press conference boasts views in the six figures, dwarfing those of even the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.“I like to think that I have a following for a reason. I like to think that the impact that I've had and the platform that I've built has a positive effect on a certain demographic and my demographic.“Yeah so, I mean, I guess this is one of the moments that I can reflect on what this means for Philippine tennis. I'm the only Filipina in the draw this year. I'm the only Filipina that's ever been in the draw, I think. So there are positives to take away.”While Parks booked a second-round singles clash with No. 19 seed Karolina Muchova, Eala will be back on court on Tuesday for her first round of women's doubles with Brazilian partner Ingrid Martins. The match has been assigned to Court 12, another non-stadium court, making it easy to imagine it will be hottest ticket on the grounds.

Seventh seed Felix Auger-Aliassime retired due to cramp during his first-round match at the Australian Open on Monday. Portugal's Nuno Borges led 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 when the Canadian could not continue.

Auger-Aliassime, 25, reached the semi-finals of last year's US Open and was seeking to begin the 2026 major season in similar form. But struggling with his upper left leg, Auger-Aliassime called a medical time out late in the third set and again received treatment before the start of the fourth set. After playing two points in the fourth set, Auger-Aliassime retired.

"I'm okay, but I just started cramping at the start of the third set," Auger-Aliassime said. "It became very difficult to be competitive at this level.
I tried for a set, but yeah, wasn't possible today."

“I feel for him,” Borges said of Auger-Aliassime. “I know how he feels to struggle physically and it is part of tennis. I hope he gets better quickly and back to his best level.


“It's a great win for me either way. I thought I competed well. Maybe if he was 100 per cent, it would've been a different score, but I'm really happy to push through this one and get another opportunity on Wednesday.”





Borges, who reached the fourth round in Melbourne in 2024, will next meet Juan Manuel Cerundolo or Aussie wild card Jordan Thompson. The 28-year-old Borges made the third round last year before falling to Carlos Alcaraz in four sets.

Auger-Aliassime believes he began cramping in the third set, but admitted it is tough to recall. 

"Obviously you don't panic. You think, 'Oh, maybe it was just one bad movement or one jump that didn't feel right'," Auger-Aliassime said. "But then as I started moving left and right, having to sprint, and every time I cramped, you know what's happening."

It is not the first time Auger-Aliassime has cramped, so he was aware of what was happening. But that did not make it any less disappointing.

"I want to be on the court winning. I want to be on the court competing with my opponent," Auger-Aliassime said. "I don't want to be just standing there like a punching bag. So there's no point, and you know to move on."

Back on track in Melbourne, the former world No. 1 isn't over-analyzing his 2025 slump after a strong start to the season.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 19, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 19, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Between the tennis court and the press room, tennis fans typically see two sides of Daniil Medvedev. One side openly battles through emotional upheaval, the other, more calm and circumspect.For all his struggles in 2025, the former No. 1 never appeared particularly worried about the long-term state of his game. While some mused that his days competing at the top of men's tennis were over, Medvedev was eager to look at tomorrow as another day.Tomorrow finally came for the 2021 US Open champion at the end of last season, and the day has only gotten longer in 2026 as Medvedev remains unbeaten through six matches Down Under. Already a champion at the Brisbane International, the No. 11 seed overcame Jesper de Jong in three sets to reach the second round of a Grand Slam tournament for the only the second time in his last five outings.Asked the secret to his ability to leave his frustrations on the court, the endlessly quotable Medvedev opined in classic style:

Asked the secret to his ability to leave his frustrations on the court, the endlessly quotable Medvedev opined in classic style:

Q. Going back to last year, I feel like when things are maybe not going as well for you, you would maybe be frustrated on the court, but you would come to press and maybe not seem as concerned with where things were going. I feel like now, looking back, things are going well, were you more concerned than you were letting on? How do you find that sort of optimism?DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's a tough question, for sure. In general, outside of the court, I try to be more optimistic than when I am on the court. That's just the way I am, the way a lot of tennis players are.It's just that they show their frustrations differently. A lot of tennis players are negative on the court. Like you miss a forehand, Oh, my God, my forehand is not going well. Yeah, man, but you're up 6-3, 5-3.That's me, as well. Again, I had a long preseason. Last year was tough. I'm feeling great with my new team, so I don't really go too much into the past. What happened last year happened, and it's okay. It's part of career, part of life. I managed to finish the year like 12 or 13, which is, to be honest, it's great for many players.Of course I was not happy. It was first year I was not in Turin maybe after 7 or 8 years. It was still not that bad, and end of the year was better than the year itself.I made a big push to try to be more positive on the court. So far I'm doing it well, but I'm never the guy to say, okay, now, not anymore. We don't know what's coming, but just trying to be positive on the court as I am in life, actually.It might be tough for someone to come from a Daniil Medvedev match and imagine him seeing the glass as half full, but playing the long game has appeared to pay off for the three-time Australian Open finalist. He'll next face Quentin Halys for the chance to reach his first Grand Slam third round since the 2024 US Open.

Alycia Parks overcame a 0-6 first set and an energetic Court 6 crowd to defeat Alexandra Eala in three sets to advance to the second round of the Australian Open. Behind 12 aces, Parks regrouped and stayed 'in the zone' to pull off the win.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- From the first-set bagel to the pro-Alexandra Eala crowd, Alycia Parks had her back against the wall.

All signs initially pointed to a straight-sets victory for Eala, but Parks came back and pulled off a stunning 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 win in the Australian Open first round. Parks said she finally started hitting her spots, converted more first serves and became more aggressive in the final two sets, and that was the key to overcoming the rowdy audience.

"It was very difficult," Parks said to reporters. "I was expecting it, but I (also) wasn't. She definitely has a good crowd. I just kept telling myself to stay in the zone."

To set the scene, the queue to watch Alexandra Eala's match on Court 6 at Melbourne Park on Monday afternoon was unbelievable. Hundreds of people organizing in a line that extended all the way back, adjacent to Rod Laver Arena, waiting for a spot to watch the 20-year-old's main draw debut at the Australian Open. It was also Parks' second time in main draw in Melbourne.

"It was so heart-warming," Eala said. "That's one of the things that makes a loss like today a little bit harder is I know a lot of people were rooting for me. Then again Alycia played really well. And you know I just hope that the support continues with the losses along with the wins."

Philippine flags decorated the stands in all directions, ‘Let's go Alex' chants transcended every few games and roars -- even in what might be considered an inconsequential point -- overpowered the Melbourne Park grounds initially.

The fanbase the rising star -- who stayed to sign autographs even in defeat -- has developed over the last year on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz was in full force.

From the court's designated fan seating to the bar that overlooks the sideline and the ledge that faces the baseline, Eala had essentially brought in a maximum capacity crowd, and, frankly, there were no empty seats. Yet, Parks found a way to conquer that barrier, one that she said she was too focused on in the first set.

"I was starting to think I wasn't focused on the game plan, which is why I played better in the second and third set," Parks said. "I was just so focused on the crowd in the first set, which is why it went the way it went."

Eala delivered to begin the match. An opening game that lasted 20 points and ended with consecutive missed smash volleys by Parks foreshadowed how the afternoon would turn out. Eala got the early break. She was off and running, winning eight of the next nine points to take a 3-0 lead and ultimately closed the 34-minute first-set with a bagel.

Parks regrouped and settled into the match in the second set. Sprinting out to a 3-0 lead with the early break, the American seemed to find her groove. Though Eala leveled at 3-3, Parks remained calm and collected, taking the final three games – a pivotal break to go up 5-3 allowed Parks, who relied on 12 aces in the match, to serve for the set.

"I was starting to think I wasn't focused on the game plan, which is why I played better in the second and third set.

It was now a new match. One set to decide who would advance to the second round to face Karolina Muchova or Jaqueline Cristian, and pendulum had shifted into Parks' favor and the crowd had slowly started to simmer down.

Parks struck first with the early break and hold to jump to a 2-0 advantage. That break proved crucial as Eala and Parks traded holds up until Parks led 4-2 in the set.

The American had grasped control of the match fully, and once Eala's backhand down the line went out, Parks' second break of the set gave her a comfortable three-game lead with a chance to serve for the match.

Eala saved two match points, but Parks serve proved too strong for an exhausted Eala, as the American successfully rallied to advance to the second round and did receive an ovation and applause.

"I don't know what my record is with crowds against me," Parks said laughing. "It definitely puts a fire on me. I would say I'm good when the crowds are against me."

Alycia Parks overcame a 0-6 first set and an energetic Court 6 crowd to defeat Alexandra Eala in three sets to advance to the second round of the Australian Open. Behind 12 aces, Parks regrouped and stayed 'in the zone' to pull off the win.

 The rejuvenation of Daniil Medvedev showed little sign of slowing down on Monday at the Australian Open. 

 The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings eased past Jesper de Jong 7-5, 6-2, 7-6(2) to book his second-round spot at the hard-court major and improve to 6-0 for the 2026 season. Medvedev, who began his year by lifting the trophy at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ, converted seven of 13 break points he earned against De Jong, according to Infosys Stats.

 Medvedev twice let slip a break lead in the opening set but still claimed it, and he carried that momentum into the second to take complete control in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with World No. 73 De Jong.  Medvedev then twice failed to serve out for the match in the third set, at 5-4 and 6-5, but he dominated the subsequent tie-break to seal his two-hour, 53-minute victory. 

 After a largely difficult 2025 season in which he won just one Grand Slam match (at the Australian Open), Medvedev finished the year well and lifted an ATP 250 title in Almaty. He will hope to continue his success under coaches Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke when he takes on Quentin Halys in the second round in Melbourne. Frenchman Halys defeated Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-2, 7-6(2) to advance. 

 “Today was not easy. First match, different tournament, a Grand Slam," said Medvedev in his on-court interview. "Last year, I lost almost [each major] in the first round, except here actually, so I'm happy to win in straight sets, even if some of them were up and down. The conditions felt slow, so we were both breaking each other's serve a lot. The most important [thing] is to win and hopefully I can play better next round.” 

 Home favourite Alex de Minaur wasted little time joining Medvedev in the second round. The World No. 6 raced to a 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 triumph against Mackenzie McDonald inside Rod Laver Arena to improve to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP  Head2Head series. 

 "It feels great to get started here at the Australian Open," said De Minaur in his post-match press conference. "Happy with the performance. It's never easy first match coming in. It was a tricky opponent, and I navigated my way through and did what I needed to do. Yeah, overall happy with the performance and ready for the next challenge." 

 De Minaur reached the Australian Open quarter-finals for the first time in 2025. His next opponent at this year's edition of his home major will be Hamad Medjedovic, who held off Mariano Navone for a 6-2, 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 first-round win. 

 Tommy Paul, Andrey Rublev and Reilly Opelka were among the other players to advance early on Monday. The 19th-seeded Paul downed his fellow American Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, while 13th seed Rublev overcame Matteo Arnaldi 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Opelka fired 23 aces in his 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory against #NextGenATP star Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.

Kostyuk had started the year on a high note, finishing runner-up to top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka at the Brisbane International in her season-opening event. But the loss continued a concerning recent trend. She has now lost in the first round in three of the last five majors."Despite the setback, Brisbane was a great way to start the year, and I'm thankful for that momentum," Kostyuk said. "Now it's time to focus on recovery, and I'm excited to be back on court as soon as possible."

On Saturday, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles presented the world premiere of a new 4K restoration of George Stevens‘ “The Greatest Story Ever Told” (1965), one of the most ambitious and experimental of all Hollywood epics. Director Martin Scorsese, whose Film Foundation was instrumental in restoring the film (and whose “The Last Temptation of Christ” is the only biblical epic that rivals “The Greatest Story” in its audacity and complexity), provided a video introduction in which he celebrated Stevens' masterpiece as the summation of his work.

 










“ The film was shot in Ultra Panavision 70 with lenses that yielded an aspect ratio of 2.76 to 1, and it was breathtaking,” Scorsese said. “But it wasn't just the size of the image, it was the imprint of the man behind the camera who knew how to fill that frame, how to compose it. And composer seems like the right word to describe George Stevens and the extraordinary level of artistry he reached at that point in his life and career.”

Scorsese explained that when Stevens came back from World War II, his work took on a new sense of purpose and urgency in powerful works like “A Place in the Sun,” “Shane,” “Giant,” and “The Diary of Anne Frank.” “He began to pay very close attention to evil, to the greed and the hatred and the raw murderous violence that can overtake us all if we don't all pay attention,” Scorsese said. “Those pictures are grand cinematic canvases, but they're also urgent warnings to take care of our goodness and our love.”

Although Stevens was not a particularly religious man, he saw in Jesus Christ a way to explore those themes on their grandest scale. “‘The Greatest Story Ever Told' is the summation,” Scorsese said. “It's the final movement of Stevens' multi-picture symphony. Stevens chose to enact the story on a scale of mythic grandeur and timeless immensity. This picture was years in the making at a cast of thousands.” It also felt of a piece with Stevens' Westerns thanks to the unusual choices the director made when it came to locations.

“It was set against the backdrop of the American West in locations that we normally associate with Westerns,” Scorsese said. “Death Valley, Moab, Utah, Pyramid Lake in Nevada. It's an extraordinary idea and it was really controversial because most biblical epics up to that time been shot somewhere near the Middle East or in the Middle East.” Scorsese noted that the film was part of a trend that included Nicolas Ray's “King of Kings” and Pier Paolo Pasolini's “The Gospel According to St. Matthew” that brought a new immediacy to the story of Jesus Christ. “They turned away from the conventions of the period.”

 










Scorsese added that the production encountered “one calamity after another” and ultimately didn't fully realize Stevens' vision. “ Nevertheless, Stevens put everything he had into the telling of the story of Jesus and you could feel it from the first frame to the last,” Scorsese said. “He wanted to embody the tragedy and the redemption of humanity on every level. In a way, his ambitions were so grand that it wasn't possible to realize them fully, but the sheer intensity and artistry of the picture is moving all on its own. There's nothing else quite like it.”

Stevens' son, filmmaker George Stevens Jr., supervised the Film Foundation's restoration and appeared in person at the Academy Museum to introduce Guillermo del Toro, a lifelong Stevens enthusiast and Film Foundation board member who was present to deliver a 20-minute lecture on “The Greatest Story Ever Told” before the film. As a Catholic raised in Mexico, del Toro estimated that he had seen “The Greatest Story” over 20 times — and he sat with the audience in the Academy Museum to watch it again in its exquisite new restoration.

Del Toro provided rich historical context for the film, describing Stevens' path through several epochs of filmmaking. “He lived through every era of cinema,” del Toro said before exploring Stevens' innovations during the silent period, his wartime documentary work, his seminal post-war American epics, and the influence he had on the New Hollywood. This last topic was where del Toro's lecture was most revelatory, as he explained why the perception of Stevens as a staid classical filmmaker is dead wrong, and that in fact Stevens was a modernist who influenced one of the most groundbreaking films of the 1960s, “Bonnie and Clyde.”

 










“I want to make the case today that this man influenced the New American Cinema,” del Toro said. “He influenced Martin Ritt, Warren Beatty, Terrence Malick and many more.” Del Toro gave the example of Warren Beatty studying the sound mix of “Shane” and applying its principles to the climactic shoot-out in “Bonnie and Clyde.” “Beatty was the first man that noticed ‘Shane' was a modern film by a modern master. Stevens insisted that the percussion, the brutality of a gunshot overpowers with its violence, and Beatty understands that this is a bold decision, a bold technique.”

In discussing “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” del Toro insightfully drew parallels between Stevens' age and our own, both in terms of world politics and upheaval in the film industry. “ His canvas became Ultra Panavision 70, with a spherical system that gave him extra space,” del Toro said. “When he shot this movie, there was a battle between TV and cinema — we're there again — and the battle was how to get people into theaters. One of the things was spectacle. The larger formats were getting people into theaters, but very few directors really knew how to use it and how to use it expressively.”

Del Toro added that Stevens used the vast potential of the Ultra Panavision 70 frame as a tool to examine his themes with sweep and intensity. “You can find out more about an artist by their art than by sharing space and time with them,” del Toro said when explaining that “The Greatest Story Ever Told” expressed Stevens' profoundly humanistic point of view. “This is a time and a generation that didn't signal virtue, they practiced it. They didn't tell you who they were, they demonstrated who they were.”

 










“The Greatest Story Ever Told” represented a demonstration of all that Stevens had learned and felt about good and evil since liberating Dachau concentration camp during his time in the service, an experience that informed the film he made right before “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” “The Diary of Anne Frank.” “One of the questions he was trying to grapple with was that no one group crucified Jesus,” del Toro said. “We all crucified Jesus. Stevens said there was no them, it was us.”

Yet for del Toro, what stands out about “The Greatest Story Ever Told” and the rest of Stevens' body of work is its hopefulness and faith. “He realized that art and narrative have such a high calling to tell us what we are and who we are, and that compassion and decency are our superpowers,” del Toro said. “Don't let them lie to you that hatred is our superpower. It diminishes us, and Stevens understood this.”

Stevens only made one film after “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” the Warren Beatty vehicle “The Only Game in Town,” which got made due to Beatty's reverence for the master director. “What would George Stevens have done after this film if given another chance at the canvas he was grappling with?” del Toro asked before closing his lecture with the memory of watching “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” “If you grow up Mexican, every Easter you saw this movie. It's Saturday, but let's have Easter together.”

 










“The Greatest Story Ever Told” premiered at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, where Guillermo del Toro presented this year's “George Stevens Lecture on Directing”— the museum's ongoing lecture series about the art of filmmaking. For information on future museum events, visit their website.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


Sentimental Value filmmaker Joachim Trier, fresh from the film's triumph at the European Film Awards, told Deadline that a “European coalition of the willing” had ensured the picture got made.


	The Norwegian director said that he was “very proud to see also a lot of local European support for the film.” Echoing themes similar to those reported over the weekend from Germany by Melanie Goodfellow, my Deadline colleague, Trier realized when he was at the awards ceremony that “this is a Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, French, German, British co-production. Who would have thought Europe united in the movies?”

	Following the film's wild reception at the Cannes Film Festival last May, where it received a 19-minute ovation, I remember queuing up for the after-party with Eva Yates, director of BBC Film, who seemed thrilled that she and her team had backed the film.

	“They were very supportive,” Trier said of BBC Film's involvement. “Very, very smart people when it comes to script and editing and creative input, and really also very generous and respectful. So I found that collaboration very valuable and it made it possible for us to have more money and work more with the actors and have more on the screen.”


	Trier said that Sentimental Value has done tremendously well “beyond what we had dreamt of and we're so grateful for that,” marking a lot of that down to “local distribution, that each country has someone that says, ‘We'll fight for this one.'”

	











	He continued: “Yesterday, I felt this embrace from a community outside of Norway. And my joke is that Norway is the suburbs of Europe. So for me, I've learned from this.”


	We were chatting at London's Soho Hotel following an awards Q&A session attended by Trier and Stellan Skarsgård, moderated by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, who described himself as the “fan of fans” of Trier's sublime film.


	Trier and Skarsgård had been in Berlin, where Sentimental Value won European Film Awards for Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenwriter for Trier and Eskil Vogt, Best European Actor and Best European Actress for Skarsgard and Renate Reinsve respectively, and Best Score for Hania Rani.


	 With aplomb, Cranston cited scenes from the movie and it was clear that he was indeed the “fan of fans” in a big way, and how struck he was by the film's story about Gustav Borg, a once storied Norwegian filmmaker played by Skarsgård, a proud Swede, who attempts to re engage with his two adult daughters; Nora an actor, payed by Reinsve; and Agnes, an academic historian played by Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, following the death of their mother, from whom he was divorced.


	The film delves deep into the generational trauma that troubles the wounded father and his psychologically injured offspring. The family drama is underpinned by the vicissitudes inherent in moviemaking. 


	Trier has suggested that perhaps a background of trauma is a requirement for making movies.


	Addressing the audience, Cranston likened Sentimental Value to “one of those Russian dolls that you open it up, and there's another thing inside another. It's like a film of a film of a film. And there's so many personal and intimate items to it that I related to being in this business and my father being in this business and my daughter being in this business. So it was multi-generational,” he said. Cranston was referring to his late father, actor Joe Cranston and to daughter Taylor Dearden, who plays Dr. Melissa King on The Pitt.


	Cranston was eager to know how Trier and Vogt had come up with the storyline.


	Trier told Cranston that he'd had an idea about two grown-up sisters negotiating narratives. Trier's fond of quoting Joan Didion's famous observation that  “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” He explained: ”I think there's something fundamental about having a story to try to understand yourself. The sense of identity is a story. It's a narrative. Who am I because of this and that? 


	“And it changes and grows and changes again. And now I've become a father, I have two daughters that are very young. And so I feel responsible…I've been a child in a film family and I know how much it takes out of your parents to make movies. And I'm asking that question, why did I have children quite late in life and my anxiety of kind of being Gustav Borg?


	“And then I start by thinking he's kind of like a difficult asshole, but then I thought I actually also love something. [“He's a lovable asshole,” Cranston chimed]…And how do I make that work? Then I knew I had one man in the world,” he said pointing to Skarsgård seated on his left. “So I flew to Sweden,” to visit with him.


	The'd never met or spoken before, although Trier had seen the actor at a party but was too shy to approach him. Skarsgård said that he'd been waiting a long time for Trier to call him. ”It took some time,” Skarsgård said, mocking at being affronted.

	











	“Finally, he called,” but the actor said he was a little coy in responding. “'Oh yeah, so what do you want?' But eventually we sort of … We have two versions of this, but my version is that we were sort of like dogs sniffing each other,“ he said as his nose drifted upwards.


	Trier did a double-take and exclaimed, “That's Stellan's version!”


	Skarsgård revealed that he didn't have to read Trier's script in the same way that he would never read a screenplay by Lars von Trier or Martin Scorsese, his reason being that “good directors, they're really rare…even if the role isn't that good, I mean, you get a good experience from it.”


	Cranston asked Skarsgård if he'd needed to research the role or was it just like slipping on “a pair of comfortable shoes?”


	Not necessarily, Skarsgård said. ”I knew things about the [movie] business and stuff, but he could be a painter, he could be a musician. The problem is that he's an artist and he's trying to combine art with a private life. It didn't take much imagination to do him, but the hard thing is always to find the life in him, to find the nuances, and to find the irrational moments that you can't plan that bring him to life.”


	Cranston's currently starring in a critically acclaimed revival of Arthur Miller's drama All My Sons at Wyndham's Theatre with an ensemble that features Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Glynn-Carney, and Hayley Squires, all on top form.


	On the topic of live theater, Cranston had “a bone to pick” with Trier about Gustav Borg's disdain for the stage. He wanted to know if that was Trier's “own personal feeling?”


	Trier admitted that “I'm a film guy 100%,” but said that he attended theater shows regularly with his wife, who is an architect who sometimes works as a stage production designer. “So I know that world quite well and adore it. I wouldn't know how to direct anything without a camera being present. So I'm very restricted. Forgive me. But I'm also the person that weeps at the end even of a bad play because I love actors getting on stage,” Trier told Cranston in mitigation.


	A bemused Skarsgård said that he “loves” theater but admits that it can “be difficult.” Then he added: “Theater…when it's good, it's the best thing in the world. It's amazing, and it so rarely is. It's very hard to do.”


	During a conversation I had with the actor after the Q&A, he clarified that he's a supporter of the stage, having spent 18 years early on in his career playing all the classics from “Shakespeare to Strindberg and all the plays in between.”


	Back on stage at the Soho Hotel, Cranston asked whether Skarsgård's own personal life, as the father of eight children, had shaped his performance as Gustav Borg in any way?


	Skarsgård said it had no bearing on how he played Borg. In fact, he noted that since 1989, he has cut down the number of months he works in a year to spend time helping to raise his children. “So I've been changing diapers and wiping asses,” he said. 


	“But the thing is, I also brought my family on locations, if I could, and I took the kids and somebody to teach them school or whatever, put them in school when I was traveling. So they saw a lot of places and missed a lot of school,” Skarsgård added.

	











	Cranston asked Skarsgard for his thoughts about awards season and what it has meant for Sentimental Value and himself.


	Skarsgård said: “It has two sides of it. I mean, on one hand you appreciate the love of your peers and of the audiences and everything, and especially when you're with a film like this, because it gets very warm response and it gets interesting discussions. But on one side, as an actor, you're a whore. You sell yourself to a director and you go all the way in and you go, ‘Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm down. I'm that guy.' But you're more whore than ever when you're doing publicity and that is a little painful.”


	There was much nodding of agreement onstage and off with at least one of Skarsgård's sentiments.


	The three men on stage then engaged in a conversation about the film's “beautifully delicate ending,” as Cranston put it, that offers a sense of reconciliation. No spoilers from me because the film's still out there in theaters – Neon released it in the U.S., while MUBI, who hosted the screening with DDA Global, has the film in UK cinemas.


	  Wrapping up the Q&A, Cranston borrowed a line that Elle Fanning's character, a Hollywood star, utters. “After she saw Gustav's film she says, ‘Oh, they just don't make movies like this anymore.' And the same could be said for Sentimental Value. They don't make movies like this anymore, but yet they do.”

She put the bob back in Millie Bobby Brown.

The actress looked like she's entering a new era on the Joy Awards 2026 red carpet Saturday.

Attending the event in Saudi Arabia, Brown, 21, showed off a brand new chin-grazing bob haircut. She also went back to her roots, dyeing her previously red-tinged locks a more natural brown shade.

The “Stranger Things” actress went all-out for the red carpet, too, shimmering in a Tamara Ralph Couture fall 2025 gown covered in sequins and floral appliqués. She added even more sparkle with enormous Chopard diamond drop earrings.

The Netflix show, which premiered in 2016, concluded with the fifth and final season last month. Over the course of a decade, Brown has tried out many different looks, including shaving her head for the first season as her supernatural character, Eleven.

After trying out a platinum blond bombshell color, she went back to brunette in March 2025.

Accepting the Joy award for personality of the year, she slipped into a second gown from the same designer's spring 2024 couture collection, this one featuring voluminous feather-covered sleeves, a sequined corset waist and a thigh-high slit.

“Ever since I was a little girl, I knew I wanted to be in the creative world,” she began her emotional acceptance speech. “Pursuing creativity and becoming an actor at eight years old wasn't a dream I chased on my own. It was encouraged and supported by my parents who never doubted me for a second.”

She concluded with a special shoutout to her loved ones, including her daughter, whom she and husband Jake Bongiovi welcomed via adoption last summer.

“I'm so honored to have my own unit in my life. My family are my anchor, my husband is my sail, my team are my engine, and my daughter is my North Star,” she said. “I wouldn't be able to do any of this without them.”

'Avatar' wasn't the only Disney winner at the holiday box office. 'Zootopia 2' is now the top-grossing animated film of all time globally, and the ninth-biggest of any film.



		By Aaron Couch, Pamela McClintock 

	January 19, 2026 9:06am	




	Despite all the hype, Nia Costa's elevated horror-sequel 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple came in behind expectations at the long Martin Luther King Jr. holiday box office as Avatar: Fire and Ash won the four-day session with an estimated $17.8 million, including $14.5 million for the three-day weekend proper.


	Sony's The Bone Temple is estimating a four-day debut of $15 million, including $13 million for the three days. That's far behind the first 28 Years, which posted a three-day opening of $30 million in June, as well as behind the $20 million projection for Bone Temple headed into this weekend.

	James Cameron's Avatar wasn't the only Disney release making headlines. Thanksgiving  juggernaut Zootopia 2 became the top-animated film of all time globally of the MLK weekend after passing up Disney and Pixar's Inside Out 2. It is also the ninth-highest film among  all times with global receipts north of $1.313 billion.




			Popular on THR		







Avatar 3, now in its fifth weekend, easily stayed iin first place as it races toward the $400 million mark domestically. So far, the film has collected an estimated $358 million domestically and north of $1.23 billion globally.


	The 28 Years Later franchise hails from director Boyle and writer Alex Garland, who brought the film series to Sony after a heated bidding war. Filmmaker Nia DaCosta is in the director's chair for Bone Temple, the second part in a planned trilogy, with Sony saying last month that it will make a third installment with Cillian Murphy — star of the original 28 Days Later — with Boyle returning to direct. It is not known how this opening weekend could change that calculus.

	











	Sony insiders remain hopeful that word of mouth could give Bone Temple legs. The feature earned strong reviews (94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), an A- CinemaScore (a rare high grade for a horror film) and a 4.5 PostTrak rating. Bone Temple stars Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams, Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry.


Zootopia came in third with an estimated $12 million fo the four days and an estimated $9.2 million for the four-day frame.


	 Lionsgate's The Housemaid continued to clean up for Lionsgate, falling just 21 percent in its fifth weekend to an estimated $8 million for the three days and roughly $10 million-plus for the four-day frame as it jumped the $100 million mark domestically.


	Filmmaker Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme landed in fifth place after winning several top Golden Globe wins last weekend. From A24, the specialty pic has been an overperformer since its Christmas release, and observers were correct in predicting it  would get a bump following Timothée Chalamet's best actor win at the Globes. It looks to bring in around $6.4 million to $6.8 for the four-day frame, which would bring its d domestic total to a winning $80 million.


	Focus Features' Chloé Zhao's Hamnet, produced by Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes, expanded after it took home best drama at the Golden Globes Jan. 11, with Oscar contender Jesse Buckley winning the actress prize. The film, which opened in limited release over Thanksgiving, upped its count to 718 theaters this weekend and is expected to bring in $1.6 million or more for the four-day frame, bringing its domestic total to $15 million. Focus plans further expansion after Oscar nominations are announced.

'Avatar' wasn't the only Disney winner at the holiday box office. 'Zootopia 2' is now the top-grossing animated film of all time globally and the ninth-highest-grossing film of any genre.



		By Aaron Couch, Pamela McClintock 

	January 19, 2026 9:06am	




	Despite all the hype, Nia DaCosta's elevated horror-zombie sequel 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple came in behind expectations at the long Martin Luther King Jr. holiday box office as Avatar: Fire and Ash won the four-day session with an estimated $17.8 million, including $14.5 million for the three-day weekend proper.


	Sony's The Bone Temple is estimating a four-day debut of $15 million, including $13 million for the three days. (Tuesday actuals will determine the final numbers for all films.) That's well behind the opening of the last film, 28 Years Later, which posted a three-day debut of $30 million in June 2025, on its way to topping out at $151 million globally. It also came in behind tracking, which showed Bone Temple launching to $20 million domestically.

	The 28 Years Later franchise hails from director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, who brought the film series to Sony after a heated bidding war. Filmmaker Nia DaCosta is in the director's chair for Bone Temple, the second part in a planned trilogy, with Sony saying last month that it will make a third installment with Cillian Murphy — star of the original 28 Days Later — with Boyle returning to direct. It is not known how this opening weekend could change that calculus. In 2002, 28 Days Later opened to just $10 million before transforming into a water-cooler sensation and pushing the boundaries of the zombie genre.

	Sony insiders remain hopeful that word of mouth could give Bone Temple legs. The feature earned strong reviews (94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), an A- CinemaScore (a rare high grade for a horror film) and a 4.5 PostTrak rating. Bone Temple stars Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams, Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry.


Avatar 3, now in its fifth weekend, easily stayed in first place as it races toward the $400 million mark domestically. So far, the film has collected an estimated $358 million domestically and north of $1.2 billion globally.


	James Cameron's threequel wasn't the only Disney release making headlines. Thanksgiving juggernaut Zootopia 2 became the top-animated film of all time globally over the MLK weekend after passing up Disney/Pixar's Inside Out 2, not adjusted for inflation. It is also the No. 9 film of all time of any genre with receipts north of $1.7 billion, including a domestic cume of $390 million and $1.3 billion internationally.


Zootopia 2 came in third with an estimated $12 million for the four days, including $9.2 million for the three.


	The Sydney Sweeney-Amanda Seyfried vehicle The Housemaid continued to clean up for Lionsgate, falling just 21 percent in its fifth weekend to an estimated $8.6 million for the three days and an estimated $10.2 million for the four days as it jumps the $100 million mark domestically and suits up to jump the $250 million mark sometime this week, an eye-popping feat.


	Filmmaker Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme landed in fifth place. From A24, the specialty pic has been an overperformer since its Christmas release, and observers were correct in predicting it would get a bump following star Timothée Chalamet's best actor win at the Golden Globes last weekend. It earned an estimated $6.7 for the four-day frame, including $5.5 million for the three days. With a domestic tally of $80 million through Sunday, it has now passed up Oscar best-picture winner Everything Everywhere All at Once to rank as A24's top-performing title of all time.

	











	Elsewhere at the specialty and awards box office, Chloé Zhao's Hamnet — another awards frontrunner — expanded after it took home best drama at the Golden Globes Jan. 11, with Oscar hopeful Jesse Buckley winning the actress prize. The film, which started off playing in select runs in November, added more runs over Christmas and again this weekend. Playing in 718 theaters this weekend, it earned an estimated $1.6 million for the four days, bringing its domestic total to $15 million. Focus plans further expansion after Oscar nominations are announced. Hamnet producers Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes are hitting the awards campaign trail hard for Zhao.

Every year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day reminds us of the incredible legacy of its namesake. As one of the most recognizable faces of the Civil Rights Movement, King made connections across the country. He even counted some of Hollywood's elite among his list of supporters, including Marlon Brando. In 1964, Brando sent King a telegram regarding this support, which has since become an important piece of Americana.

In the telegram, Brando expressed his regret at not being able to join King in what he called “activities of liberation” due to recent health issues. However, he made his feelings on King's cause very clear. “I feel that those who take active part in demonstrations for equality and freedom are the heroes of our time,” the actor wrote. “I regard it as an honorable duty to participate.” Despite not being able to stand beside King and other leaders in this instance, Brando was a major supporter of the Civil Rights Movement.

The 1964 telegram to King wasn't the beginning of Brando's participation in the Civil Rights Movement. Several 1963 photographs show the actor walking in solidarity with CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) protestors in Torrance, California, one of the many times he lent his time and money to the cause throughout the 1960s. He also famously participated in the pivotal March on Washington that same year.

In 1968, Brando addressed King's heartbreaking death in an interview with Johnny Carson. “King got shot, and I sat in front of the television set, and I wondered what it meant to me [that] he's dead,” Brando began. He eloquently recalled King's last words from the night before his death. ” I thought somehow this has got to matter somewhere,” Brando said. “And if we don't — all the citizens — do something that is a person-to-person contribution, I don't think that we're really gonna have any place to come home to if we do get a job.”

The actor then expressed how he planned to continue the fight. “I couldn't think of any other alternative rather than to make my time, my energies, and my money fully available to do what I can as an individual.” As I Love Ancestry reported, Brando donated thousands of dollars and even decided to forgo a movie role so he could devote more time to participating in the movement.

Although King died long before he could personally see his vision for peace and equality realized, his tragic passing lit a new fire. Like Brando, many came to see King's death as a renewed call to action. Sixty years later, Martin's legacy lives on through what the movement accomplished. The beloved leader is also remembered for his public speaking talents, including the last words he ever said to his followers. 

“Like anybody, I would like to live a long life,” King said in what would be his final speech. “Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now.” He went on to say that God had allowed him to climb the proverbial mountain. “And I've looked over,” King said. “And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we as a people, will get to the promised land.” That journey is still ongoing, thanks to King and other Civil Rights Movement leaders being brave enough to take the first steps.

Even as Gov. Gavin Newsom adds tax incentives to keep Hollywood in Hollywood, more projects are heading to other U.S. states, where studios are building new bases.


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	When Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in to law a doubling of California's tax incentives for film and TV projects from $330 million to $750 million annually in July, the move sent a signal that the state was finally taking runaway production seriously. Yet that piece of legislation may just be the first step needed to keep more of Hollywood in Hollywood, if the latest U.S. production figures are any indication.


	In the fourth quarter of 2025, California saw a 20 percent decrease in movie and TV projects filming in the state year-over-year, with production spend from those projects similarly down 22 percent, according to the Q4 report from industry tracker ProdPro released Jan. 16. Total production spend in the quarter amounted to $1.35 billion.

	The Golden State, where all the major studios still have HQ lots, still claims bragging rights as the top destination overall for film and TV shoots, but double digit declines even after the state's latest incentives took effect are another cautionary sign. One slight silver lining: In Los Angeles, overall filming days in the fourth quarter were up about 6 percent from the prior quarter, permitting office FilmLA disclosed on Jan. 15. But L.A. shoot days overall throughout the year were down 16 percent from 2024.

	The message from FilmLA vp Philip Sokoloski: hold tight, “although our overall numbers remain low, there are dozens of incentivized projects that have yet to begin filming,” the exec said in unveiling the latest figures. To that point, the California Film Commission revealed a slate of 28 titles on Dec. 17, including projects from NBCUniversal, Sony, Amazon, 20th Century and Apple, to receive tax credits to shoot in California, with the state forecasting $562 million in total economic activity from the shoots.

	











	While California is losing ground, its biggest rival, New York, saw a 31 percent increase in filming count and 23 percent increase in production spend year-over-year. With $1.07 billion in total spend in Q4, New York is not too far off from eclipsing California's total production spending.


	Two other states are emerging as notable production players as projects increasingly seek incentives outside of California. One of the major beneficiaries has been New Jersey, where filming count in the fourth quarter was up 75 percent year-over-year and production spend grew 12 percent, per ProdPro. (New Jersey's annual tax incentive for film and TV projects is $430 million, lower than New York at $800 million and California's bulked up $750 million program.)


	Notably, that healthy growth for the Garden State arrives before key studio lots are completed in the state. Netflix is investing $1 billion to build its East coast base with 12 soundstages at the former site of Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The David Ellison-owned Paramount inked a 10-year lease in October to occupy 85,000 square feet of the in-construction 1888 Studios in Bayonne, while Lionsgate is set as the anchor tenant of Great Point Studios in Newark.


	Meanwhile Illinois, home to Dick Wolf procedurals on NBC (Chicago Fire, P.D. and Med) along with FX's The Bear, saw film count in the fourth quarter increase 70 percent year-over-year while production spend increased 46 percent. Prior indicators — namely major year-over-year growth in background actors' jobs booked, per one payroll firm's estimate — had suggested that Illinois was poised to be a bigger production hub, and in the latest quarter it appears to be closing the gap with a more established state, Georgia, that saw year-over-year declines in projects shooting and in spend.

	











	Overall production in the U.S. fell across all states by 4 percent in the fourth quarter and production spend overall fell 8 percent to $4.2 billion, a sign that film and TV shoots are increasingly a global hunt by producers to seek out the best incentives and locations. Both the United Kingdom and Canada, per ProdPro's tally, saw double digit filming count and production spend growth in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Christian Wallace answers The Hollywood Reporter's burning questions after that surprising season two ending.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from the Landman season two finale, “Tragedy and Flies.”]


Landman is headed for a reset in season three.




	In the season two finale of co-creators Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace‘s mega-hit Paramount+ series, Billy Bob Thornton‘s Tommy Norris decides to go out on his own after he's fired by Cami (Demi Moore) from the company, M-Tex Oil, that Tommy was appointed president of after the death of his friend, Monty (Jon Hamm). But in order to launch his family-run company — titled CTT Oil after the Norris men of son Cooper (Jacob Lofland), grandfather T.L. (Sam Elliott) and Tommy (Thornton) — Tommy makes a deal with the devil: cartel boss Gallino (Andy Garcia). Gallino warns Tommy that if their partnership goes south, he will take what he loves most in this world.

	Below, Wallace says they are in wait-and-see mode as Sheridan sets out to write season three. “There's a great level of trust there that whatever Taylor decides will be the right move,” he tells The Hollywood Reporter. But what he is sure of is that season three will be a reset for the West Texas-set oil drama, as the Paramount+ series will follow Tommy and co. as they get CTT Oil up and running. Read his season two finale explanation and predictions for next season, below.


	***


I'm nervous about what a happy ending means for season three, because I don't think we get consecutive happy endings in the Sheridan-verse.












	I think you've watched enough TV to have pretty good instincts.


This season does seem to set up what we spoke about at the start of the season, around your long-term, multi-season Landman plan.


	It's kind of a reset [for season three]. We have these characters entering into different dynamics with one another, and now we have T.L., Tommy and Cooper all working at the same company, but not under the auspices of this larger corporation. It's now family-run, very small, starting from almost scratch. That's a whole new dynamic for them. Along with these other characters from M-Tex who are taking a pretty big gamble. 


	Gambling is kind of a motif this season. You have Angela in the casino, but you have Cami gambling on this as well, and now Tommy is kind of gambling on himself, which he has been reluctant to do. When we meet him in the pilot, he's talking about how things didn't work out for him, so he ended up with nothing and working for M-Tex for his buddy Monty. A lot has changed in his life. We've seen him grow a lot over the course of season two, and with his family dynamics. Now he's kind of going back to the roulette wheel and betting on himself. So, it's exciting and also a little nerve-racking.


What excites you about a reset? Do you feel like you will reinvent the wheel for season three, or do you already have a clear picture of where you guys are going?


	At the end of the day, it is Taylor's plan and we're all just waiting on what he decides to do. There's a great level of trust there that whatever Taylor decides will be the right move. There are a lot of possibilities, but I'm not sure myself exactly how it's going to play out. So, we'll see.

	











From what I understand, you are sticking with the timeline — you go back into production in May and season three will release at a similar time next year. Do you feel like you're in a groove now?


	Oh, definitely. We're in a groove. We are a little bit later than we were the last two seasons, but that only matter for us because of the heat in Texas. When we get back into production this year, it's going to be pretty full on, and just getting hotter. That's the big struggle from a production standpoint for us being on set every day. We have so many exteriors, and that's a good thing because this show thrives in the dust and the heat and the reality of that gritty, hot world. But it is hard on the crew and cast, and on everybody. Twelve-hour days in 100-plus degree weather is no joke. But that is our cross to bear, not the audiences'. I'm excited about the schedule and I think the rhythm we're in right now works really well.


You don't know what Taylor has in store, but when you think about filming that final season two scene — both Tommy and Angela's conversation and Tommy's face off with the coyote — how worried should Tommy be about this threat from Gallno that if he messes up this deal, the cartel boss is coming after everyone Tommy loves?


	We ended season one with the reality of how violent and real that threat can be. Tommy knows it better than anybody. He's the one who had a nail in his thigh; that level of reality was being doused in gasoline [in the season one finale]. So he knows that these are not idle threats. But also, Tommy is a survivor and also a predator himself. The symbolism of that coyote can mean so many different things, but I do think it is great that we get to have a couple of those moments where Tommy is present and has absorbed the lessons from T.L. throughout this season.

	











	“Look, man, your life is going to pass you by; this is your life, and your life doesn't suck as bad as you make it out to be. You have all these people around you who are insane, but they love you, and they love each other. Enjoy that. Don't forget that is also as real as the blowouts you're dealing with in the patch.” We see Tommy in a few of those moments actually take that in, and those, to me, are some of the really nice moments in this season.


Is there a role for Cami in season three? Do you think Demi Moore will return?


	I think there are so many different opportunities and ways this can play out. At the end of the day, I'm putting my trust in Taylor and his decisions for all of these characters' storylines. That one is above my pay grade.


This season, viewers went wild for Billy Bob Thornton's full-frontal nudity scene.


	To clarify, it wasn't an actual full frontal. We had an on-set intimacy coordinator, and the original prosthetic she brought in made everyone laugh. We were like, “No.” So we went with a more humble alternative. (Laughs.) That was a hilarious day on set. But it is surprising to me that people think that was actually Billy doing full-frontal nudity. So I should say props to our intimacy coordinator for making it extremely realistic, and to the props team. They had a whole rig, as Billy called it: “Got my rig on.”


Another storyline that sparked a reaction was with Ainsley's nonbinary roommate, Paigyn (Bobbi Salvör Menuez). Some viewers say this is Taylor speaking to the conservative audience. Did this feel like a hot-button storyline when you were filming, and would you say Taylor likes to make some noise and push some of those buttons?












	I think there are moments in both seasons of Landman that do press some buttons, and they start interesting conversations. A lot of the time, they're portrayed as more one dimensional than they actually are. A lot of times, these hot-button issues that are pressed, those little pokes, are more nuanced than they're portrayed. I think we all kind of knew it would elicit some reaction, but if you follow the storyline, it's not as one dimensional as it's made out to be by a lot of outlets.


These two seasons have taken place across 10 to 15 days, with some time in between seasons. So the entire Landman story is only over a couple of months. Do you anticipate season three would be similar, and that you would pick up not long after and it would play out in a condensed time period?


	Yeah, I don't think we're going to depart too far from the storytelling template we've put forth so far. It feels right for this story, and we'll continue to operate within that format we've established.


Now with CTT Oil, will season three spend more time in the oil fields? Will there be more action; will the show still spend time with Ainsley in college? Does Angela have a role in CTT?


	You can definitely expect that we'll continue to see the range of dynamics that is embedded in this show. The show is Ainsley and Dale [James Jordan[ and Cooper and Ariana [Paulina Chávez]. It really is this conglomerate of crazy, diverse storylines. But that's a modern family. They're all over the place, and I think we can expect more of that. As a West Texas guy myself, I'm always going to want to push more storylines in the Permian Basin and that kind of gritty oil and gas. I love those characters. I love that setting. So anytime we can get more of that into the show, I'm all for it. This definitely presents more opportunities for that, with them starting the small independent company. It's really exciting for me to see what we can do and play with there.

	











And this confirms Sam Elliott will return for season three?


	I think Sam has said it on the record that he's coming back!

Dolly Parton turns 80 years old today, but somehow she continues to possess all the vitality she had when she first arrived in Nashville from her native Sevierville, Tennessee, back in the Sixties. In honor of her milestone birthday, we publish — for the very first time — this interview about the making of her 1971 album Coat of Many Colors, which gave the Country Music Hall of Fame member her signature autobiographical song. This story was originally presented as part of Rolling Stone‘s “500 Greatest Albums” podcast series.


	Dolly Parton has a number of songs that could be considered her signature: the warning “Jolene,” the tireless “9 to 5,” and the royal ballad “I Will Always Love You.” But none come close to “Coat of Many Colors,” her 1971 autobiographical tale about growing up in Appalachian poverty and the hand-sewn clothes that Parton and her siblings would wear to school. To this day, it summons visceral emotion, both in the woman who sang it and in the country music fans who hear it.

	











	But the song also represents Parton's emergence as an all-around star: not just as a singer, but as a songwriter.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I was always trying to progress and try to do more, try to grow, and try to express myself musically as much as I could in every album that we did, but still stay true to myself,” Parton tells Rolling Stone. “I always take myself more seriously as a songwriter than I even do as a singer.”


	By the time Parton walked into RCA Studio B in 1971 to record Coat of Many Colors, she had already been living in Music City for seven years. She moved to the city intending to be a songwriter, not a singer, but it would take a while for Nashville to recognize Parton as a great writer.

	











	Once in Music City, Parton met a figure who'd play a pivotal role in her life, Porter Wagoner, a veteran country hitmaker who had his own TV variety show. Wagoner gave Parton her big break by casting her on his show, and the pair became frequent duet partners. They released 13 duet albums and won the Country Music Association Award for Vocal Duo of the Year three times. Wagoner even helped Parton pick which songs to record and was a looming presence in the studio.

	“Porter was always involved in the production and working with the engineers and working with the musicians, making sure that they got it the way that that he wanted,” she says.


	Parton ended her musical partnership with Wagoner in 1974, writing him a heartfelt goodbye with “I Will Always Love You.” But when Parton recorded Coat of Many Colors in 1971, she was already starting to break away. To fully come into her own as a solo artist and songwriter, Parton knew she had to write the bulk of the album, and it all started with the title track, a clear-cut origin story about her childhood in East Tennessee.


	Parton grew up poor in Sevierville, Tennessee, near the Great Smoky Mountains. The memory of her one-bedroom cabin was still fresh in Parton's mind when she moved to Nashville in 1964 after graduating high school. “We didn't have anything,” she says. “Mama used to sew all of our quilts and curtains for the windows, remake our clothes, and make clothes out of feed sacks or scraps.”


	In “Coat of Many Colors,” Parton sang in plainspoken language about her poverty. The song draws on the biblical tale of Joseph and his treasured garment, the coat of many colors.


	“I went to school thinking I looked like Joseph,” she says, unaware that she was about to be laughed at. “I was upset with my mom, and I was crying because I felt she had told me a fib. Mama said, ‘I don't want to ever hear you say that we're poor. We are rich in kindness and love and understanding.'”

	Grammy-winning songwriter Brandy Clark says “Coat of Many Colors” succeeds because it's so universal. “You've got family, you've got religion, you've got honesty, and you've got poverty, and also being made fun of,” she says. “I think if you haven't had one of those five things go on, you probably haven't lived.”


	Parton first wrote the lyrics to “Coat of Many Colors” on a tour bus with Wagoner. The flashy country singer had his suits with him in a dry cleaner's bag and, when inspiration struck, Parton snatched the receipt from the bag and began scribbling. “I just grabbed the tag … and I started writing ‘Coat of Many Colors' on it. I finished the song pretty much on that,” she recalls.

	











	Despite honoring Wagoner's request to cut some of his songs, Coat of Many Colors is distinctly Parton's album, and you can hear her take agency of her story. Rolling Stone writer Chet Flippo described it as “the first true flowering of Dolly Parton's faltering steps to emerge as a free musical soul and a major songwriter.”


	Along with the title track, she wrote “Traveling Man,” about a young woman who makes plans to run off with a salesman, only to have her mother steal him first. Clark recognizes clues in the song, as well as in another Coat track, “She Never Met a Man She Didn't Like.”


	“She was working her way to ‘Jolene,'” Clark says of the songs.


	The spirit of Parton's native Smoky Mountains is woven throughout the album. It's in the lyrics of the title track, in the song “Early Morning Breeze,” and in the actual music of “My Blue Tears,” a bluegrassy song that uses nature as a metaphor for heartbreak.


	“Those kind of songs are like a tribute to my Tennessee mountain home,” Parton says. “I wanted to get that old world sound with it.”


	“It is mountain music,” Clark echoes. “And that's another theme that runs through Dolly's catalog. I always want to listen to Dolly in the fall, because I love to go to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge when the leaves are turning. Dolly has figured out a way to make her music feel like that part of the country.”


	Sonically, there's one outlier on the mostly acoustic album: “Here I Am” is more funk-rock than country music. It's also the most aggressive example of Parton owning her art.


	“I wanted to do something a little more bluesy or little more rock, and I remember kind of having to fight a little bit: ‘That's not really country enough,'” she recalls of the recording session. “And I thought, ‘Yeah, but it's soulful.'”


	Country singer Carly Pearce, who considers herself a Dolly Parton superfan, says that Parton's most open secret is in the simplicity of her lyrics. “She just has a way of writing that is really to the point,” Pearce says. “I'm reminded when I try to overcomplicate things, that these songs really have stood the test of time, and they were quite simple.”


	In the end, the same can be said of Coat of Many Colors. It remains an essential album because it represents country music's mission statement: simple storytelling that anyone can relate to.

Coat of Many Colors peaked at Number Seven on Billboard‘s Country Albums chart. It also scored Parton her first Album of the Year CMA Award nomination. Looking back, Parton says the album accomplished exactly what she came to Nashville to do — be a songwriter. She's a global superstar now too, but the title track will always be a part of her story, a glimpse at who she was and who she was about to become. It's even been adopted as an anthem of gay pride, thanks to its themes of acceptance and love.

	











	“I think people just loved the song, and then there's a lot of fun, good little songs in the album,” Parton says. “And it's my early days. A lot of my newfound fans like to go back and see who I am, who I was. And that little coat, people relate to it for many different reasons.”

Robert Buckley just celebrated his rom-com ratings slamdunk in the most Robert Buckley way possible — by cracking up his fans and colleagues. 

On January 16, 2026, the Hallmark star posted a hilarious photo of himself in a tight tank top, loud 80s-style shorts, house slippers, and a mustache to boot, striking a sarcastically sexy pose. On the screen behind him was a still shot of himself in the 2025 Hallmark movie “An Unexpected Valentine,” which was just added to Netflix. 

“Unexpected Valentine is the #3 movie on Netflix today,” Buckley captioned his pic. “Jenny told me to stop wearing her tank tops, but you can't tell someone this famous what to do.”

The success of “An Unexpected Valentine” on Netflix is just the latest ratings win for the movie, which stars Buckley and Lacey Chabert. Even after Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas movie lineup, the rom-com was the network's most-watched movie of the year and the highest-rated movie across all of cable TV in 2025. 

Buckley's post was flooded with comments from fans, famous friends, and even his wife — actress Jenny Wade, who amusingly wrote of his tank top, “I didn't say to stop wearing it, I said to take it off. 😈🔥”

Hallmark screenwriter Russell Hainline — one of the writers behind Buckley's “Merry Christmas Ted Cooper,” also weighed in on the skin-tight top. Approving of Buckley repping Carpinteria, a popular California surf town, he wrote, “Carpinteria tanks and mustaches are IN” 

Buckley's “Christmas House” co-star Jonathan Bennett called him a “legend” and their mom in the movies, Sharon Lawrence, cutely commented, “As your TV Mom, I feel a bit responsible and I don't know how to process this…”

Hallmark's Andrew Walker chimed in with, “Unleashed star power,” and tons of fans commented too, including one who wrote of the movie's Netflix popularity, “I'm just waiting for what happens when it hits #1.”

When “An Unexpected Valentine” premiered in early February 2025, Buckley said on the “Deck the Halls” podcast that it was an easy yes for him when he learned Chabert was involved. 

He recalled, “When they said Lacey Chabert, I threw my elbows up, I was just like ‘this is so great!' and ‘I've made the big leagues! I've made the big leagues!' So I opened up my trunk of wigs and I pulled out my best wigs and I flew up to Canada and I gave them 15 days of my best.” 

Hallmark's synopsis of the movie says, “A chance encounter on Valentine's Day brings Hannah and Finn together as they race through New York City to return a lost engagement ring and save one couple's special day.” 

In addition to being available to stream on Netflix and on Hallmark+, the movie will re-air on Hallmark Channel on January 20 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, February 2 at 6 p.m. Eastern time, and on Valentine's Day at 6 p.m. Eastern time.

Mara Wilson, the star of Danny DeVito's 1996 movie Matilda, has revealed how she worried about the cast of Stranger Things getting caught in the “deepfake apocalypse” after she herself was a victim of child sexual abuse material.


	In an op-ed for The Guardian newspaper, the actress and writer wrote that, if unchecked by safeguards and regulation, artificial intelligence will lead to child stars and other young people being exploited on the internet. She said her own experience of being “used for child sexual abuse material” led to anxiety about other actors, including the stars of Disney films and Stranger Things.

	“Before I was even in high school, my image had been used for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). I'd been featured on fetish websites and Photoshopped into pornography,” Wilson wrote. “Grown men sent me creepy letters. I wasn't a beautiful girl – my awkward age lasted from about age 10 to about 25 – and I acted almost exclusively in family-friendly movies. But I was a public figure, so I was accessible. That's what child sexual predators look for: access. And nothing made me more accessible than the internet.”

	She continued: “It was a painful, violating experience; a living nightmare I hoped no other child would have to go through. Once I was an adult, I worried about the other kids who had followed after me. Were similar things happening to the Disney stars, the Strangers Things cast, the preteens making TikTok dances and smiling in family vlogger YouTube channels?”

	











	Wilson's fears became a reality when X/Twitter users asked AI tool Grok to remove the clothing from images of 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher, who played Holly Wheeler in Stranger Things. Elon Musk‘s company later said it would stop the Grok account from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”


	“Generative AI has reinvented stranger danger,” Wilson said. “And this time, the fear is justified. It is now infinitely easier for any child whose face has been posted on the internet to be sexually exploited. Millions of children could be forced to live my same nightmare.”


	The Miracle on 34th Street star added: “Boycotts aren't enough. We need to be the ones demanding companies that allow the creation of CSAM be held accountable. We need to be demanding legislation and technological safeguards. We also need to examine our own actions: nobody wants to think that if they share photos of their child, those images could end up in CSAM. But it is a risk, one that parents need to protect their young children from, and warn their older children about.”

The Duke of Sussex arrived at the British capital's High Court on Monday, where he alleges "grave breaches" of his privacy.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Prince Harry‘s legal war with the British tabloids continues.


	The Duke of Sussex's case against the Daily Mail formally kicked off on Monday with a legion of stars by his side at London's High Court — among those also suing the outlet's publisher are Elton John and husband David Furnish, actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, as well as U.K. political figures Doreen Lawrence and Simon Hughes.




	They allege “grave breaches of privacy” and more illegalities, including the interception of voicemails, tapping of landlines, paying off police officers “with corrupt links to private investigators,” faking medical records, and bugging celebrity homes by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.

	Publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has repeatedly denied the “lurid” and “preposterous” allegations, maintaining that the lawsuit is an affront to the hard work of their journalists. Key figures connected to the country's bestselling newspaper, such as long-serving editor-in-chief Paul Dacre, are expected to give evidence.


	Things kicked off at the High Court with Harry's lawyer, a media barrister popular with the stars named David Sherborne, claiming ANL “knew they had skeletons in their closet” and therefore instigated “mass destruction” of thousands of documents related to the case. The trial is expected to last several weeks here in London.

	











	It's been a long time coming, and is indicative of Prince Harry's anger at the British press. The royal family member, son of King Charles and brother to William, has been vocal about wanting to wrangle an apology out of the tabloids for the way he, his wife, Meghan Markle, and his mother, the late Princess Diana, have been treated.


	“The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,” Prince Harry told a press event in 2024. Such is the strength of his conviction, the prince wrote in his 2023 memoir Spare, that his public rift with other members of the royal family derives from their unwillingness to stand up to the tabloids.


	In January 2025, Harry settled his case against the publisher of the Rupert Murdoch-owned The Sun newspaper, who offered the Duke a “full and unequivocal” apology. Harry had brought the case to publisher NGN, claiming his privacy had been violated by alleged phone hacking and unlawful information gathering carried out by journalists and private investigators working for The Sun and the defunct News of the World between 1996 and 2011.


	The tabloids aren't the only ones facing royal legal action. In May last year, Harry lost a legal challenge over the level of security he is permitted while in the U.K.


	He'd appeared in court the month before to appeal the decision to downgrade his taxpayer-funded security arrangements while in Britain, describing the country as “central to the heritage” of his children with Markle, Archie and Lilibet.

	











	The arrangement means that the Sussexes would instead receive a cheaper, “bespoke” security service, necessitating that they give 30 days' notice of any plans to come to the U.K. and that each visit be assessed for threat levels.

	A member of the crowd at the Memphis Grizzlies and Orlando Magic NBA game in London heckled Vanessa Williams as she performed the Star-Spangled Banner, shouting, “Leave Greenland alone.” 


	A video of the interruption was widely circulated on social media sites on Sunday night.

	President Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland hit a new point last week as he threatened a 25% tariff on multiple European countries, including the United Kingdom, if the U.S. isn't allowed to purchase Greenland. Trump said in a Truth Social post this week that the tariff would begin on February 1.

	“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump posted. “The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years.”

	UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pushed back, posting a statement about Greenland this weekend on X. 


	“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” Starmer posted. 


	“We have also made clear that Arctic Security matters for the whole of NATO and allies should all do more together to address the threat from Russia across different parts of the Arctic. Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”

I want to puy that person a drink.

The NBA is the ultimate Karen organization

A society that, because of the weaknesses of its laws and the stupidity of its citizens, allowed this character to reappear and make the lives of all the world's inhabitants miserable again… deserves to be ostracized.

The Trump authoritarian regime is threatening to take over other countries and threatening our greatest allies with punitive tariffs if they don't go along with it. Meanwhile at home, he's sending in masked thugs who are terrorizing communities (primarily in blue state cities he doesn't like) and protest is breaking out. He's threatening to use military force against Americans who don't agree with his barbarism.

Do people just think it's going to be business as usual? Do they think people aren't going to speak up about it both domestically and abroad?

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Emmy-nominated The Last of Us director Peter Hoar has launched a production outfit and is working on a reboot of cult British sci-fi classic Blake's 7.


	Hoar has opened “genre-based” indie Multitude Productions with A Good Girl's Guide To Murder exec Matthew Bouch and West End producer Jason Haigh-Ellery. The trio have snapped up a wealth of IP including Blake's 7, which last aired on the BBC 45 years ago. 


	Hoar, who directed the critically-acclaimed “Long, Long Time” ep of HBO's The Last of Us, plans to direct the Blake's 7 reboot, which will go out to buyers soon. Bouch would “love it to go to the BBC” and will likely seek co-pro funding from the American streamers and European players like RTL.

					Why Disney Ditched 'Doctor Who': Sources Say Ratings, Big-Ticket Budget & MAGA Politics Were Factors In BBC Deal Failing To Regenerate		
			








	Created by Terry Nation, the man credited with inventing the Daleks, Blake's 7 aired for four seasons on the BBC from 1978 to 1981. The show, which exhibited numerous tropes of the traditional space opera, followed the exploits of political dissident Roj Blake (Gareth Thomas), who leads a small group of rebels against the forces of the totalitarian Terran Federation that rules the Earth and many colonized planets. There have been several reboot attempts down the decades but none have caught fire. Multitude struck the deal with Nation's estate and casting and writing conversations will commence in due course.




			Watch on Deadline		







	With genre shows like Doctor Who stuck in something of a rut and less money around in high-end scripted, Hoar and Bouch believe that now is the time to set up shop. They have been joined at Multitude by exec producer Lizzie Worsdell, whose credits include Amrita Acharia's indie pic The Carer.


	“The Blake's 7 story is legendary because they were given the [British police show] Softly, Softly slot that was intended for police drama with a budget intended for one big set and a few location shoots,” said double-BAFTA winner Hoar, whose credits include It's a Sin and Umbrella Academy. “At the time it felt like it meant something. Those shows got into my veins. I could tell they didn't have money but I was able to compartmentalize and enjoy the ride knowing that the sets wobbled.”

	











	Hoar compares Blake's 7 to Disney+ hit Andor, which he thinks is a success not because of its circa-$25M per hour budget but “because of the integrity, wit and sophistication.”


	He said Doctor Who, which Disney+ has just exited after only two seasons of one of the biggest co-pro deals of the decade, is a cautionary tale.


	“I don't think anybody would doubt the skills at the front line of that show but something went wrong,” he added. “I think there were lots of areas you could point fingers at but ultimately it wasn't a better show with more money. And that's a good thing, because we haven't got the money anymore, nobody has.”


Multitude Productions: genre-based British IP


	This, according to Bouch, will be Multitude Productions' raison d'être.


	Bouch said: “We're driven by our passions but also seeing that there is a gap in the market in the UK – particularly with the well-publicized dropping off of Doctor Who – for genre-based British IP.


	“We look back at when we were young with a degree of nostalgia but also thinking about the 70s and 80s as we were growing up and the amount of genre material that was available, whether it was Blake's 7 or the Narnia adaptation. We are looking to the international market and seeing if there is a way of dovetailing that British low-budget sensibility with international markets. We know in the U.S. there's a big contraction and we all need to think about finding ways to make things more economical.”


	With this in mind, Multitude is working on a TV series version of Luke Rhinehart's The Search for the Dice Man, the sequel to the cult classic Dice Man novel for which Paramount owns the rights. An A-list star is attached, Bouch said, with Danny Wallace (Yes Man) aboard to write and Tim Kirkby (Fleabag) directing. 


	The indie has also optioned Patrick Carman's Skeleton Creek book series, which is being adapted by Phillip Morgan and was described by Hoar as a “British Stranger Things crossed with Skins.” 


	The team is also working on an adaptation of a well-known video game and a sci-fi series, the latter in development with UK broadcaster ITV, although no more details were disclosed on those. Hoar and Bouch are keen to find new sources of funding and are developing a version of Rikako Akiyoshi's The Dark Maidens Japanese novel, which is seeking external funders, along with a crime series, Scammers, made with fraudster-turned-content-maker Tony Sales and his Underworld TV outfit.


	Hoar and Bouch, who have worked with Britain's biggest showrunners including Russell T. Davies and Jack Thorne, are championing a multi-writer model to get scribes back to work.


	“We've never really had a showrunner model in the UK and I think it is full of problems because it doesn't necessarily speak to that collaborative nature,” added Bouch. “Russell [T. Davies] is Russell but I think those people are relatively few and far between.” 


	Taking this “collaborative” approach, Bouch is confident that Multitude's model is the right one to create success in a tricky market that has seen lots of traditional drama companies shut up shop.


	“We're very aware that it feels counterintuitive to launch something at this point but equally we feel there is a gap in the market in terms of what we are doing,” he added. “Our expertise straddles both international and British lower budget material. Obviously the proof will be in the pudding.”

Shouldn't need a huge budget, just great writers and cast. Hopefully involving as many as the surviving cast from the original in cameos. 

Also I like to put myself up for role of Vilia; I'm just enjoying a quick Adrenalin and Soma as I write

Unknowns only, please. No stunt casting. No Cavill, Hiddlestone or Fillion. And keep it British otherwise it'll just turn into a crass Firefly. And I wasn't keen on Firefly.

Blake's 7 was the anti-Star Trek and the anti-Star Wars of its time, a singular dark vision that may be impossible to replicate in the modern media environment.

Nathan Fillion for the main role

Let me guess… you want Gina Torres to play Cally…

This week's Industry plays like a funhouse mirror of the events in the third-season finale. Another birthday is the centerpiece at Sir Henry Muck's (Kit Harington) ancestral home. But instead of a celebratory dinner announcing an engagement, relative newlyweds Henry and Yasmin (Marisa Abela) are already coming apart at the seams. It doesn't help that Yas isn't even allowed to open the drapes in her husband's bedroom as he staves off another hangover. “You have to let her fulfill her function,” is Henry's directive about letting the housemaid attend to said curtains. Everyone in this stately home lacks purpose, so what better time to throw a decadent, Versailles-themed costume party for Henry's fortieth? 

Similar to how the premiere jumped in as Harper's (Myha'la) fund fell apart, Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay waste no time building to the Mucks breaking point. There is zero drag in the storytelling, and this breakneck pacing is part of what makes Industry a deliriously compelling option amid wheel-spinning streaming slogs. And like the premiere, Kay and Down wrote and directed the excellent “The Commander And The Grey Lady,” and the time jump here isn't a cheat code to circumvent plotting for fireworks. 

Instead, all the groundwork was laid last season, first in an intimate swimming pool in Switzerland, where Henry first confided in Yasmin about his father's suicide and his own suicidal ideation. In this week's episode, we learn that Henry didn't share how the events actually unfolded on the morning of his father's 40th birthday. The rewritten version speaks to how this trauma is reshaped to be more palatable without factoring in the permanent damage to Henry's psyche. There's nothing quite like the British stiff upper lip and its unique ability to brush the worst moment under an heirloom carpet. 

It would be easy to cast Yas in the Lady Macbeth role, whispering in her husband's ear to benefit her own ambitions. While this archetype isn't entirely off the mark, her scheme to get Henry a position within Whitney Halberstram's (Max Minghella) “bank killer” Tender is as much about dragging Henry out of his debilitating funk as it is getting Yas back into the game. 

Yas has tried myriad approaches, including leaning into the Tory-wife cosplay in the opening flashback. Abela and Harington are both on top form, capturing desperation and loathing (in Henry's case, self-loathing). First, there's the saddest handjob perhaps ever committed to television, where we hear rhythmic splashing before Henry cuts it short. He has already stood to attention in his proverbial birthday suit for his wife when she asked him to stand in the bath. Yasmin just wants them to look at each other again properly, but Henry struggles to meet her eye and maintain an erection. She's trying to give him a confidence boost before his pre-party meeting with Whitney. However, this only makes Henry feel like more of a “fraud touched by success.”

Whitney is eager to find a partner who can open doors that money can't buy. “Longevity in Britain is about access,” he tells Henry. What Whitney needs is connections that come from centuries of titles. Given that Yasmin told Whitney he could put his silver tongue to work on Labour MP Jennifer Bevan (Amy James-Kelly) in the last episode, he turns his attention to Henry, with Yasmin providing that particular entry point. It is this meeting that Henry views with suspicion, and the drugs in his system add to this notion.

A subtle callback to “happier” times for the couple comes in the shade of blue sash worn by Henry that matches his bow tie when he announced his engagement to Yas at his uncle's birthday dinner. Of course, that color links to King Louis XVI, but this visual tether to the past doesn't read like a coincidence. Costume designer Laura K. Smith decks Yas out in a chartreuse and peach Marie Antoinette-inspired frock with an elevated, contemporary twist: stacked Vivienne Westwood platforms that cause Yas to tower over Henry. That doesn't go unnoticed, with Henry clocking her altered height in sweet bemusement that will soon sour. 

The appearance of Yasmin's aunt, Cordelia (Claire Forlani), also underscores Yasmin's urgency to shed her current role as a spectator and caregiver. The pointed juxtaposition of Cordelia telling Yas to get off her knees and Yas later witnessing Cordelia on her knees giving Otto a blowjob is a reminder that Yasmin's family tree is equally thorny. Daddy issues course through Yas and Henry's veins. But Henry has to battle his demons alone rather than turn to his wife, who knows a thing or two about this topic. 

Henry leans hard into his “poor little rich boy” mythologizing when it comes to a head. Shooting this on a handheld camera makes the fight feel more fluid and intimate, giving us a front-row seat. Yas cuts to the core of the romanticizing with precision and cruelty, suggesting it would be procedural, boring, and small if he died by suicide. She knows that Henry lied about the circumstances of his father's death, and later, we learn why Henry's construction involves his dad walking out onto the moor alone. It is far more disturbing that Henry witnessed it all. Even more alarming is the suggestion that his father orchestrated his son's spectating.  

Henry is no match for Yasmin, who has been in numerous screaming bouts before, whether with her father or Harper (who is on the receiving end of Yasmin's spiky mood in this episode). He tries to use her family's tainted reputation to bring his wife to heel, but Yas holds all the cards due to the clause in their pre-nup about his drug use. Earlier, Henry told Yas she could sleep with other people, which she now reads as a clumsy, calculated move due to an adultery clause. He cowers in the corner of the room, looking even smaller than he did earlier when Yas threatens to hit him. Instead, she grabs him by the balls to emphasize her point about drugs castrating him.

Paranoia is another side effect, and the camera's often unsteady journey throughout the opulent setting adds to the fracturing of reality whenever Henry is onscreen. Candlelight and twinkling Christmas decorations add to the otherworldly visuals, amplifying the stately homes' grandiose patina. Kay and Down turn the sprawling location into a Kubrickian nightmare, throwing in technical and thematic nods to Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining. One of these is Henry playing Purcell's “Funeral Of Queen Mary” on the harpsichord, which Kubrick used in Orange. (The moog version was in the credits last week.) This piece of music also accompanies Henry's solo walk home across the fields as he prepares to take his own life. 

Cutting from Henry in the same position at the harpsichord in his robe to dressed for his meeting with Whitney, as if someone clicked their fingers, is as destabilizing for us as it is for Henry. Industry excels at distorting or compressing time. It is something that comes up later when Henry's memories overlap with the present, as he watches his father's suicide, standing alongside his childhood self. Like Jack Torrance in The Shining, Henry is haunted by ghosts. 

While I didn't catch it on first viewing, watching any of the scenes back when Henry is interacting with the Commander (Jack Farthing) makes it clear that no one else can see this hallucinated version of Henry's father. But Henry is so wasted that no one questions his chatting to thin air. Tight close-ups ensure we are as focused on the Commander as Henry is. The coincidental encounter with the parish priest (played by Roy Sampson), who not only married Henry's parents but also buried Henry's father, leads to one of the most haunting and poignant sequences in the series so far. Rather than the Bible, the priest recites a passage from Cormac McCarthy's All The Pretty Horses. His Scottish accent adds an extra emotional punch to what looks like a self-fulfilling prophecy: “The first person the coward deserts is himself. Courage ceases to be courage if it wavers. We choose to be ruined rather than change.” 

But Henry doesn't die by suicide, and those words are to offer comfort in the dark. Hearing Yasmin's voice saying his name is his savior, and Henry has a renewed sense of purpose and libido. He will take Whitney's job offer, and everything is looking up for the Mucks. Henry's bloody hands from the pub brawl are not a turnoff for Yasmin; she kissed the broken knuckles and left the blood on her lips. Rather than a Lady Macbeth “out damned spot” moment, Yas keeps this unorthodox lipstick until a gleeful Henry says they should have a baby. Only then does she subtly lick it clean. Motherhood is not the purpose she seeks.

Sharna Burgess is opening up about her fraught relationship with food.

“I struggled with binging and restricting mostly,” the “Dancing With the Stars” alum admitted during a candid Instagram “Ask Me Anything” on Sunday, after a fan asked, “Have you ever struggled with eating disorders?”

Burgess, 40, added that she “had a super complicated relationship with food” as a teen and into her 20s, but that habits “changed” once she hit her 30s.

The Australian-born performer previously spoke about the added pressures she's faced with her weight as a professional dancer.

“I had a real struggle with my body because of dance,” she told Australia's Good Health & Wellbeing magazine in a 2021 interview.

“I remember being 15 and put on the scale every two days by my teachers and we were told whether we needed to lose weight or not. Every week I was told that I needed to lose more weight — and I certainly wasn't overweight.”

Burgess said that dance “instilled a negative body image,” which carried on to the way she ate.

“It also started a negative pattern of eating whereby I'd binge one day, and then starve the next. I struggled with that throughout the years,” she explained. “Even in my 20s, I'd look in the mirror and see the 15-year-old that was told every week she needed to lose more weight.”

However, things began to change when she joined the cast of “DWTS” in 2011.

“It was seeing just how much the celebrities on the show transformed and ended up loving their bodies through being able to move and dance that really shook my perspective,” she explained. “I thought, ‘Wow, I've been doing this my whole life.' 

“I started to see something else in the mirror, I started to see a body that had gotten me through some incredibly difficult times, that had created some beautiful moments, that had won championships, that had landed me a life I never ever thought possible.”

Burgess' last season as a “DWTS” pro was in 2021, when she was partnered with her now-fiancé, Brian Austin Green. She left the following year after welcoming their son, Zane. 

However, that's not to say the dancing pro has ruled out returning to the long-running show in the future.

“It's never a no,” she said during her Instagram Q&A on Sunday. “I was supposed to do something with them last season, but I was already working on a play in NYC and couldn't commit. I love [the cast and crew], the show and am always going to want to be there.”

If there are two things the internet loves talking about, it's conspiracy theories, and who may or may not be a narcissist.

Misinformation and conspiratorial thinking are long-running concerns, while narcissism has become TikTok's favourite armchair diagnosis.

Research shows the two concepts, though seemingly separate, may actually be closely linked.

In my new research published in the Journal of Personality and Individual Differences, more than 600 people completed surveys, and the findings show higher scores on measures of narcissism were linked to belief in conspiracy theories and misinformation.

Importantly, this result held true regardless of how educated the participants were.

Scholarly evidence shows people with lower levels of education are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. But that's only part of the story.

We also know that historically, conspiracy theories have done well in times of uncertainty, including during war, economic downturn and widespread hardship (such as the COVID pandemic).

A prominent explanation for this is that conspiracy beliefs serve underlying psychological needs. These include providing answers when things are unclear or uncertain, providing a sense of control by identifying a powerful group to take action against, and for social reasons, such as showing others which political groups you belong to and signalling loyalty to those groups.

I wanted to find out when educated people might also “fall down the rabbit hole”, and learn more about which psychological needs lead them to do so.

Over two studies, 660 adults were asked to complete a series of questionnaires to measure narcissistic traits. These included:

The participants then answered how much they believed in certain conspiracy theories. One example put to them was: “the assassination of John F. Kennedy was not committed by the lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, but was rather a detailed, organised conspiracy to kill the President”.

They also attempted to distinguish true statements from misinformation, including “Ebola Virus Caused by US Nuclear Weapons Testing, New Study Says”.

The participants had varying levels of education, ranging from high school or less through to having a masters or doctorate. They also had a variety of political beliefs.

People who scored higher in narcissistic traits were more accepting of conspiracy theories and misinformation.

Importantly, this was true regardless of how educated the person was.

The results showed these traits might offset the differences linked to education. When these traits were above average, highly educated people were just as likely to endorse these beliefs as those without any formal education.

Education often provides people with skills in evaluating evidence, critical thinking and a shared understanding of how we can find truth.

However, humans are quite good at “motivated reasoning”: using reasoning skills to come to pleasing conclusions because we want to believe something.

This type of reasoning is often linked to unfounded beliefs – those without evidence. When people feel superior to experts, want to feel special, or need a concrete answer during uncertain times, they might use their reasoning to hold certain beliefs despite a lack of evidence.

My research suggests educated people are not immune to this.

It's important to recognise there's a variety of factors that determine people's beliefs and which ones they hold most dear. These include the above personality traits and thinking styles, as well as factors like identity, how people view themselves and show support for the groups they belong to.

These findings suggest even highly educated people can be resistant to changing their mind if underlying psychological needs are threatened. It's important to keep these in mind when discussing controversial topics. This is true whether talking with friends, family, or those with opposing political views to our own.

We should also take into consideration our own motivations and needs, and how these might influence our points of view. Doing so might help in finding common ground and improve social discourse on a larger scale.

A Vermont lawmaker is setting his sights on the skies with a new bill poised to create a UFO panel within the state. 

Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, has introduced legislation looking to set up the Vermont Airspace Safety and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force, according to the Vermont Digger. 

The bill reportedly proposes the creation of a state task force to investigate reports of both unidentified aerospace and underwater objects, assess safety risks regarding airspace, and work alongside federal partners and researchers to discover improved policies. 

The task force would be composed of officials from Vermont's departments of transportation and public safety, while also opening up seats for lawmakers and experts on the topic.

"I am not a subject matter expert at all," Headrick said, the Vermont Digger reported. "As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging trends [in public safety]." 

According to H.654, the panel would investigate reports of any unknown objects that exhibit "performance characteristics not consistent with currently understood technologies," such as, "instantaneous acceleration absent observable inertia or hypersonic velocity without a corresponding thermal signature or sonic boom." 

Headrick initially introduced the legislation at the request of a constituent, lobbyist Maggie Lenz, according to Seven Days Vermont.

If passed, the new legislation would create a panel to investigate objects showcasing "performance characteristics not consistent with currently understood technologies," such as, "instantaneous acceleration absent observable inertia or hypersonic velocity without a corresponding thermal signature or sonic boom."

Lenz, owner of Atlas Government Affairs, reportedly became interested in the issue after a string of UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, made headlines throughout New Jersey in 2024, sparking nationwide panic regarding countless mysterious flying objects. 

"I'm certainly not saying that it's aliens," Lenz said, according to Seven Days Vermont. "But I do think just having the conversation here in Vermont will begin to allow for it to be taken a little bit more seriously."

The proposed legislation replicates the federal government's response to UAPs in recent years, following Congress passing the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act in 2023 and the U.S. Department of War's creation of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

Rep. Headrick reportedly offered a more practical use for the proposed committee – including investigating drone sightings as use of the technology continues to grow within the state. (iStock)

The draft bill indicates that Vermonters have reported UAP sightings to police in various instances, signaling a need for a coordinated response between state and federal officials. 

While speaking before Vermont's House Government Operations Committee last week, Headrick offered a more down-to-earth reason behind the proposed bill – pointing to the surge of drones throughout the state. 

"The proliferation of drone use — this is where I see the need for data," Headrick told the committee, the Vermont Digger reported.

Headrick did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While the proposed bill has yet to be voted on by the committee, Headrick reportedly tried to sweeten the deal by promising to look into Vermont's famed sea monster if the legislation is passed. 

"For the cryptids fans in the room, there's an underwater provision to this as well," Headrick said, according to the Vermont Digger. "So if we want to investigate Champ, we can do that."

Supernatural continues to rank at or near number one on the Meta Quest charts in  the wake of Meta's decision to pause content updates and lay off much of the team behind one of VR's most effective fitness apps.

Many in the VR fitness community have been looking into their options. 

Supernatural has always been positioned as a premium experience. Access as of this writing is subscription-only, with users paying either $9.99 per month or $99 per year. That recurring revenue, combined with strong engagement and brand recognition, made Supernatural feel like a rare success story in consumer VR fitness.

Meta says the existing library, which spans thousands of workouts, will stay accessible. Current subscribers can continue paying for full access and new users are still able to sign up. In the short term, that keeps Supernatural viable, especially for users already invested in its structure and coaching. What happens to the mainstream music used in the project if licenses expire? 

What makes Supernatural's situation so disruptive is not just the pause in new content, but the loss of certainty. VR fitness depends on habit, trust, and long-term commitment. When a chart-topping, subscription-only app can be upended overnight, the entire health journey some people are may see potential disruption down the line.

In that context, ownership models, studio independence, and transparency do actually matter to many more than production value alone. At a moment when VR fitness is proving its ability to retain paying users and drive real behavior change, Meta appears to be stepping back from one of its strongest examples.

For users navigating this moment, the good news is that the ecosystem is deeper than it once was. The harder question is which platforms feel stable enough to earn long-term trust.

I've tried a number of VR fitness options besides Supernatural to check out what the latest options offer.

I have spent a meaningful amount of time inside FunFitLand, starting back in its early alpha period. Early on, it leaned heavily on Supernatural's blueprint, with real coaches in 3D as well as beautiful real-world and imaginary scenes for workouts. Over time, it moved past that influence and developed its own identity.

That evolution is most visible in the community and coaching. The tone is supportive and motivational without feeling performative. Coaches have sharpened their virtual instruction skills, with clearer cues, tighter pacing, and better movement guidance. On the workout side, the platform has expanded its movement set with additions like side steps and hammer strikes, giving sessions more physical range.

DanceFit has since evolved into GrooveFit, favoring looser, more expressive routines. The addition of FlowFit has been especially meaningful. It introduces a meditative, tai chi-inspired experience focused on balance, breath, and intentional movement. It reinforces the idea that VR fitness does not need to be all intensity to be effective.

FunFitLand also improved its music selection. The library now spans a wider range of genres, including cinematic tracks and some heavy metal. That added variety helps reduce repetition and gives different workout modes a clearer identity.

FunFitLand mirrors Supernatural's pricing structure, offering both monthly and annual subscriptions. At the time of writing, a first-year annual discount of $69.99 appears to still be available for new subscribers, undercutting Supernatural's standard annual fee. The app, which also supports hand tracking, has also launched on Apple Vision Pro, signaling ambition at a time when others are pulling back.

FitXR began life as BoxVR in 2017 and has since grown into one of the most feature-rich VR fitness platforms available. It operates on a subscription model priced at $12.99 per month or $108.99 per year.

The platform, which also supports hand tracking, currently offers seven workout types: Box, Combat, HIIT, Sculpt, Dance, Zumba, and the newer mixed-reality SLAM mode. Workouts span multiple intensity levels and are supported by a progression and rewards system designed to encourage consistency. Regular content updates and monthly themed challenges keep the experience from feeling static.

FitXR uses recognizable fitness personalities as coaches, though in some modes, particularly Sculpt, Dance and Zumba, those coaches appear as stylized cartoon avatars. Choreography across disciplines is strong, and the workouts are fully capable of delivering a serious sweat.

Where FitXR falls slightly behind Supernatural and FunFitLand is in environmental range and polish. There are fewer workout environments, and those that do exist are not as breathtakingly beautiful - think functional rather than awe-inspiring. Hit feedback in the boxing and combat modes also lacks the satisfying auditory impact found in FunFitLand, which remains best in class in this area. Even so, FitXR's breadth, progression systems, and consistent update cadence make it a strong long-term subscription for users who value variety and structure.

FitXR is also expanding beyond Meta's ecosystem. The app is now available on Samsung's Galaxy XR headset, running Android XR, marking an early move to support next-generation mixed reality hardware outside the Quest platform.

Les Mills XR Bodycombat takes a fundamentally different approach. It is sold as a one-time purchase priced at $29.99, with optional DLC packs typically around $9.99. For users wary of subscriptions, that alone makes it appealing.

The workouts are demanding and efficient. Sessions are designed to escalate intensity quickly, and it does not take long to work up a sweat. Real-life Les Mills coaches Dan Cohen and Rachael Newsham appear briefly at the start of sessions as holograms, then transition to voice-only guidance for the remainder of the workout.

The workouts share a familiar structure, and for people who train often, that repetition becomes noticeable over time. Even so, the effectiveness is hard to argue with. The sessions move quickly, the combinations stay demanding, and by the end you feel the work you put in. This is not a gentle program, and that intensity is what many users seek.

PowerBeats VR has been a fixture in VR fitness since launching on SteamVR in 2019 and arriving on Meta Quest in 2021. On Quest, it retails for $22.99, with DLC packs typically priced between $2.99 and $5.99.

Its defining feature is customizability. PowerBeats VR allows users to upload their own music and fully customize workouts, sidestepping licensing concerns entirely. That level of control is uncommon and will appeal to users with established playlists or specific training goals.

The experience itself is less refined than many competitors. Visuals are straightforward, presentation is functional, and there is less emphasis on coaching personality or community. Even so, it remains enjoyable and effective at getting users moving when workouts are tuned to personal preferences.

The one-time purchase model combined with deep customization makes PowerBeats VR compelling for a specific audience. It does not sit in my personal top tier, but it fills a niche for many users.

XR Workout takes a different approach from most VR fitness platforms by prioritizing open movement and functional, full-body training over scripted classes and cinematic presentation. The app is free to download and use, with the free tier limited to eight minutes per day, with a starter membership promising multiplayer. A paid Pro membership unlocks the full feature set, including extended workout time, expanded modes and deeper customization tools.

One of its defining characteristics is controller-free movement through hand tracking, allowing users to exercise without holding controllers for extended sessions. Workouts rely heavily on bodyweight movements such as squats, jumps, running in place, and target-based striking that engages both upper and lower body at the same time. The result feels closer to an open training circuit than a guided class.

XR Workout also supports mixed reality, blending the user's physical space into the workout environment so surroundings remain visible during sessions. Multiplayer workouts, playlist selection, and the ability to build or customize routines give the app a level of flexibility that most top platforms do not attempt.

XR Workout feels very different from most VR fitness apps. There is little hand-holding, and very little emphasis on presentation. You load in, start moving, and manage your own pace. If you are looking for coaching, structure, or personality, it will likely feel bare. If you are comfortable setting your own rhythm and just want a space to move hard for a few minutes, it does exactly that.

Starwave

Starwave sits closer to the dance rhythm game end of the VR fitness spectrum, but it overlaps in interesting ways with Supernatural's Flow workouts. Movement is driven by techno and electronic tracks, with players slashing incoming notes using glowing, cosmic batons. The emphasis is on rhythm, timing, and continuous motion rather than precision or scoring.

There are no coaches, no guided programs, and no overt fitness framing. You load in, follow the beat, and keep moving. In practice, the experience can feel meditative in the same way Flow sessions do, especially during longer play sessions where movement becomes more fluid and less deliberate.

I have found Starwave to be an enjoyable and consistent addition to my weekly fitness rotation. It is not a replacement for structured workouts, but it works well as a lighter, movement-focused session that still gets the heart rate up.

Starwave is a one-time purchase, priced at $19.99 on the Meta Quest store (on sale as of this writing). Additional content is offered through an optional DLC pack at $4.99. There is no subscription model.

The platforms I picked here represent what I would consider the top tier VR fitness experiences available in VR headsets right now. They combine polish, consistency, ongoing development, and enough depth to support long-term use. There are plenty of other VR fitness apps on the Quest platform, but many are less refined or narrower in scope, but they are still fun and fully capable of working up a sweat. For users experimenting with VR fitness for the first time, those options can still be worthwhile.

I certainly haven't covered everything, so please share your favorite ways to get fit in VR in the comments below too. If you're the developer behind an app building something new in this space, you can also email UploadVR via tips@uploadVR.com.

Created in partnership with Nebula 

Nebula, available as both a website and app, is a spiritual guidance space that offers clarity and insight into one's values, potential, purpose, and place in the universe. With over 60 million users worldwide, Nebula supports anyone who wants to understand themselves better and build a stronger relationship with others.

When you invite Nebula into your world, it immediately becomes your personal guide to navigating life's journey. Not just on a daily basis, but in the months and years to come, too. It removes any doubt about the question “is Nebula legit?” because after using it for some time, you know: it is.

What struck me first was how easy the Nebula app is to use. Once you set up your account, you're offered over 1,000 psychics and advisors who are available 24/7. Each one specializes in specific topics, ranging from Western and Vedic astrology, Tarot, numerology, aura scanning, palmistry, birth charts, and more.

Each advisor has their experience listed, whether or not they're currently online and available, as well as the option to chat via text or give them a call. No matter which means of communication you're most comfortable with, both can be done through the Nebula website and the app, making it incredibly easy to access.

  

Another aspect I really appreciated was that I was greeted with a welcome text from one psychic, as well as follow-ups from a few others, offering their spiritual guidance. So, if you're not sure what you're looking for, these brief interactions, which are sort of like prompts, can help you narrow down the best psychic for you, and what your concerns and interests happen to be.

The short answer: absolutely. Of all the Nebula psychics — and again, there are many — I had the pleasure of chatting with Zendaya. Just as is the case with all the profiles of Nebula's advisors, I was able to see her expertise, how many years she's been practicing, her overall score based on the Nebula psychic reviews, and how many consultations she has done as a Nebula psychic and advisor.

I was also able to see her star ratings, which range from one to five, along with positive comments about her energy and skills among ask Nebula reviews. Between all the five-star ratings Zendaya has received and the feedback from clients, both new and regulars, I was impressed with what I saw and knew she was a fit for me.

Although my session with Zendaya, which included a Tarot reading, was done via text, I felt a genuine warmth from her and she was able to establish trust with me almost immediately, creating a connection between us that put me at ease. I knew I could be completely open and candid with her, and I could also tell just how much she loved being part of Nebula's team of advisors and psychics.

  

We discussed everything from my personal relationships to my career to my emotional state as of late. Zendaya was 100 percent there for me, explaining each card she pulled in detail and how it impacted my presence and future. Zendaya not only saw and heard me, but with the information she gave me, she provided me with the tools that will set me up for success in the coming months, a time that looks to be a bit turbulent and rife with changes for me, some more challenging than others.

It was somewhere between Zendaya pulling the Temperance card and the Two of Pentacles card that I no longer saw Nebula as just an app — instead, it became a trusted companion for emotional, mental, and spiritual growth all in the palm of my hand.

The parts of my life that had felt foggy and filled with confusion, became clear thanks to her.

After we parted ways, I thanked Zendaya for the insight and kindness. Fearful that after the session ended I'd lose her wisdom, I'd been taking screenshots of what she had say, only to find out afterward that I was able to revisit my session with her, rereading her advice and what she sees in my future, fully knowing that all that information is protected and private.

While a complete overhaul of personal transformation may be months away for me, or longer, with Nebula as my guide and trusted companion, I'll never be alone in my quest for understanding myself and those around me again.

Nebula takes the age-old practice of spirituality, in all its realms, and modernizes it. It's available on iOS, Android, and the web, making Nebula a leading brand in the spiritual niche in the U.S. and globally.

With the Nebula app, you have access to:

  

And if you prefer the Nebula website, you can expect:

Depending on what your budget for such an important tool might be, Nebula has a subscription that will work for you.

All plans renew automatically and provide uninterrupted access to the app's features. You can also pay per minute, for chatting with psychics, which is a flexible option if a subscription isn't right for you. Should you need any sort of help, whether it be billing, unlocking new features, or updating notifications, Nebula customer service is a click away.

While nothing in life is a guarantee and curveballs being thrown our way is inevitable, knowing I can turn to Nebula when things start to become too much is a huge relief.

A financial crisis could be triggered by an announcement that aliens exist, according to Helen McCaw, a former policy expert of the Bank of England.

McCaw told The Times of London that politicians and bankers can't afford to dismiss alien life, and wrote to the governor of the Bank of England, urging him to organize a contingency plan in case the White House confirms alien existence.

A 2021 study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that intelligent life exists beyond Earth. Some Americans, meanwhile, believe that there is proof of UFOs and alien life being concealed from the public by global governments. However, this belief is held by a significant minority.

President Donald Trump has previously indicated that his administration may declassify some information on the nature of extraterrestrial life. In 2025, the UFO documentary The Age of Disclosure made headlines, and its director Dan Farah said that Trump could reveal the existence of aliens.

McCaw was a senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England for ten years, until 2012.

She told The Times, "The United States government appears to be partway through a multiyear process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs)."

"If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions. It is entirely possible that government leadership and their central banks have not been properly briefed on the topic. UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences," she said.

McCaw said there could be price volatility in the financial markets, and a collapse in confidence, in addition to a potential rush to safe assets such as gold.

She also told the outlet that the authorities should be prepared for unrest.

The report has quickly made an impact online.

Mario Nawfal, a podcast host, said in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times, "WAIT…WHAT?! A former Bank of England policy analyst is warning the UK's central bank to prepare for a financial crisis…caused by aliens."

Holly Wood, a researcher and public speaker sharing The Times piece, in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times: "And at the centre of it is my friend, Helen McCaw. A former Bank of England senior analyst in financial security. A Cambridge graduate. Someone whose actual job was to think about state-level risk, stability, and what breaks systems. I'm incredibly proud of her. She inspires me regularly. The question is no longer "is it real?" It's "what happens when it's confirmed?"

The YouTuber Hustle B****, in a post on X sharing The Times report, viewed over 100,000 times, which read in part: "READ THIS TWICE - THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS PREPARING FOR ALIENS. This is not a meme. This is not a fringe blog. This is an actual newspaper article reporting that the Bank of England has been urged to prepare for financial collapse if aliens are officially confirmed."

There is a continued interest in the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth. The documentary The Age of Disclosure made a significant impact online, with the trailer amassing millions of views and the documentary prompting a discourse about aliens.

The upcoming fictional film Disclosure Day, directed by Steven Spielberg, has also prompted significant interest, with the trailer fast amassing more than a million views on X. Disclosure Day is set for release in the U.S. on June 12, 2026.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX)  — In 1977, Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope detected a mysterious signal from space, sparking decades of intrigue and research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life.



Volunteer astronomer Jerry Ehman discovered the signal, dubbed the Wow! Signal, which originated from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and lasted 72 seconds.

The radio receiver is part of the radio telescope called "The Big Ear" at Ohio State University. Image Courtesy: Columbus Citizen, Grandview Heights Public Library, Columbus Citizen Journal and Columbus Citizen Newspapers Collection, dated May 16, 1952.

Despite numerous attempts, the signal was never detected again.

The Wow! Signal fueled interest in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), inspiring advancements in telescope technology and research methodologies. 

Although the Big Ear is no longer operational, the enigma of the Wow! Signal continues to captivate scientists and enthusiasts alike, as they ponder the age-old question: "Is anyone out there?"

Children as young as four are being trained how to shoot rifles at a school in Sussex run by conspiracy theorists. 

Hope Sussex, which has barred Ofsted from inspecting, offers reception aged-children lessons in shooting and martial arts alongside maths, English and science. 

Images published by Hope's founder Matthew Single - who opened the establishment with his wife Sadie - show youngsters clutching air rifles and aiming at targets near Netherfield village in East Sussex.

Another photo shows Mr Single, 54, wearing a T-shirt embellished with the words, 'I identify as a conspiracy theorist - my pronouns are told/you/so'. 

More than 40 families attend Hope each week, according to recent company filings. 

Pupils have been tasked with making necklaces out of bullet casings and creating their own nunchuks. 

Hope Sussex was reportedly founded by a group of anti-vaccine activists and former members of the far Right in 2021. 

It denies that it is a school, instead referring to itself as an 'autonomous community' that helps home-educating parents.

Ofsted believes it is running as a school, but was forced to close its investigation into the establishment due to current legislation. 

The inspectorate currently does not have the legal right to force its way onto the grounds of what it suspects is an illegal school. 

It last visited Hope Sussex in 2022, when inspectors were stopped from entering by Mr Single and a second member of staff, The Times first reported. 

A new bill, titled the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, is going through parliament and proposes to hand the inspectorate more authority. 

Mr Single and his wife are former members of the British National Party. 

They urge parents to remove their children from state education and send them to their site for education. However, they reportedly tell the council that the youngsters are being homeschooled. 

Mrs Single, a former state primary teacher, previously said that her history lessons include 'some of the fallacies and lies that have taken place', including conspiracy theories that have been widely disproven by historians. 

Meanwhile Mr Single is an admirer of president Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. 

He said he believes the 'awake community' is 'at war' with the state - reportedly encouraging people to 'take the fight to them'.

In one post, titled 'They are coming for our children', he wrote: 'We must be prepared to step outside of the comfort zone of simply protesting and demonstrating with placards and megaphones - we have our army in the field, now we must press forward with greater, more specific action.' 

He told The Times that the comments were made with the intention of 'applying political pressure on the Government'. 

He also claimed that the archery and air-weapon shooting lessons prioritised 'safety at all times'. 

Ofsted declined to comment when approached by the Daily Mail and Hope Sussex has been contacted for comment.

In a startling challenge to official narratives, a high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb now claims that a powerful Battelle-linked job carousel is actively shielding alien secrets from the American public, placing the Pentagon's own anomaly office at the centre of a hidden network that controls what citizens are allowed to know about unidentified aerial phenomena.

In 2024 a peculiar metallic object recovered from private land in Ohio was handed to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for analysis after witnesses said its properties did not match any known earthly alloy. The case quickly landed on the desk of AARO, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which is meant to investigate precisely this kind of material.

Gerb argues the sample was never treated as neutral evidence but instead channelled into a closed scientific system designed to downplay anything uncomfortable. Within months AARO issued a brief statement suggesting the object was likely ordinary, a conclusion Gerb describes as rushed, politically convenient and scientifically shallow.

He insists Oak Ridge was selected not for its independence but for its deep ties to defence contractors and the Battelle corporation, which operates the lab through its subsidiary UT-Battelle. To Gerb, this creates a perfect loop in which the same corporate ecosystem both examines potential non-human technology and decides what the public hears about it.

Gerb's most explosive claim centres on what he calls a secret career carousel connecting Battelle, Oak Ridge and AARO. Senior officials, contractors and scientists regularly move between these institutions, creating what he describes as a cosy club that controls funding, research priorities and public messaging.

He points to former Undersecretary of Defence Ronald Moultrie, who quietly removed his past role on Battelle's board from his official biography. For Gerb, this deletion symbolises a deeper effort to obscure conflicts of interest.

Supporters say this is classic regulatory capture, comparable to Wall Street officials moving between Goldman Sachs and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Critics counter that such job mobility is normal in science and defence, noting that researchers frequently rotate between PNNL, LANL, Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore, all Battelle-run facilities.

Gerb accepts the pattern exists across government but argues that in the UAP realm it becomes dangerous because evidence of possible non-human technology is at stake.

A parallel debate now rages over whether whistleblowers like Gerb are genuine truth-tellers or unwitting tools of the intelligence community. Some observers suggest the IC could be feeding partial or distorted information through prominent researchers to mislead foreign adversaries such as Russia and China.

Sceptics note that if Washington wanted controlled disclosure, it would not be publicly discrediting figures like Lue Elizondo or redacting their roles from official records. Instead, the Department of Defence has repeatedly challenged whistleblower claims, with spokesperson Susan Gough revising her statements about Elizondo's employment multiple times.

Journalist Steven Greenstreet has argued that many whistleblowers are part of a slow-drip disclosure strategy, a view echoed by debunker Mick West, who admits being paid to analyse UAP claims but refuses to reveal by whom.

Gerb's supporters reject this, saying the pushback from officials proves he is not being guided by them but is instead exposing them.

The controversy now stretches far beyond one metal fragment. It touches on the credibility of AARO, the role of defence contractors, and whether America's intelligence apparatus is suppressing a trillion-dollar secret programme behind Special Access Protocol barriers.

Former AATIP figures such as Sara Gamm, Jay Stratton and Travis Taylor have backed elements of whistleblower accounts, complicating the narrative that this is mere conspiracy. Meanwhile, critics argue that extraordinary claims still require extraordinary evidence.

For now, Gerb's central allegation remains simple and stark. He says the Battelle-linked job carousel is not accidental, it is structural, and it keeps real UAP knowledge locked inside a closed elite circle.

Conspiracy theories are practically a side dish to the NFL main course. Every postseason brings a new claim that the league is “scripted,” the refs are nudging outcomes, or some graphic designer in New York secretly knows the Super Bowl matchup months in advance. Most of the time, it's harmless internet fun. But every so often, something pops up that makes even the skeptics pause.

That “something” this season arrived in the form of an NFL social-media poster published on January 16 to promote the road to Super Bowl LX. The graphic showed a cluster of star quarterbacks surrounding the Lombardi Trophy. Nothing unusual there, until fans noticed who was standing closest to the hardware: Drake Maye, Bo Nix, Matthew Stafford, and Sam Darnold.

Fast-forward two days and, unbelievably, these are the exact four quarterbacks left standing in the conference championship games. Fans, of course, couldn't help but once again jump on the “NFL is scripted” train.

“Quite literally means the NFL is scripted,” one fan immediately commented.

“It means that these games are scripted,” another fan helpfully pointed out.

“The fix…is in!,” was another comment.

However, some fans couldn't help but notice one anomaly: Bo Nix. Only hours after Denver's emotional overtime win over Buffalo, coach Sean Payton stepped to the podium with what he called “not good news.” Rookie sensation Bo Nix had fractured his right ankle late in overtime and would require surgery in Birmingham, Alabama. Jarrett Stidham will be taking over as the starting quarterback for the rest of the Broncos' postseason run.

It seems the NFL “script-writers” didn't see this particular plot twist coming.

The injury occurred on a designed run with just over six minutes left. Nix was tackled awkwardly, limped back to the huddle, threw an incompletion, and then twisted the ankle again while taking a kneel-down. He finished the game 26-of-46 for 279 yards and three touchdowns, leading his sixth game-winning drive of the season, but his postseason was over.

Oddsmakers reacted instantly. New England opened as 4.5-point road favorites, a number that jumped to 5.5 as the reality of life without Nix set in. Denver's defense has carried them all year, but asking Stidham to outduel Maye is a tall order.

While the AFC drama centers on Nix's absence, the NFC matchup will deliver its own intrigue. Sam Darnold's Seahawks have won eight straight behind a dominant defense and a surging run game, while Matthew Stafford's Rams continue to survive on late-game magic.

The two West rivals split the regular-season series, including Seattle's unforgettable 38-37 overtime win in Week 16. Now the same four names from that January graphic, minus the injured Nix, sit one victory away from Santa Clara and Super Bowl LX. The seasoned conspiracy theorists can perhaps now look for more hidden clues that will tell us the conclusion ahead of time.

The UK and Bank of England are preparing for a potential financial crisis if the US government says we are not alone, and that UFOs, UAPs, USOs, and alien life are disclosed.

Former BoE analyst, Helen McCaw, has previously worked in financial security at the Bank of England, helping develop plans for theoretical economic crises, including the one now that she sees as a possibility in a full UFO and aliens disclosure scenario.

She wrote to Andrew Bailey, who is the Bank of England's governor, urging him to set out contingencies in case the Trump administration and the White House confirms the existence of alien life, reports The Times.

McCaw wrote: "There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods. If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability".

McCaw has penned out a few different potential future scenarios that would happen if disclosure on alien life happened, with one of them being a jump to Bitcoin as a "safe haven asset" due to the possible obliteration of trust in traditional, government-based power structures.

She added: "There might be a rush to digital currencies such as bitcoin, which may prove appealing if people question the legitimacy of government and lose trust in government-backed assets".

"The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions".
