A popular music and entertainment arena in Las Vegas is expanding and opening another venue outside of Washington, D.C. James Dolan, Sphere Entertainment's chair and CEO, said in a press release the organization is looking forward to bringing an immersive experience to a new area. "Our focus has always been on creating a global network of Spheres across forward-looking cities," he said. "This will be one of the largest economic development projects in Prince George's County history — proving once again our state is the best place in the country to bring dreams to life," said Gov. "We're excited for what this means for our people, and how it will showcase the best of what Maryland has to offer to everyone who visits." It's expected to generate 4,750 jobs once completed. While the Las Vegas venue has a seating capacity of 18,600, the new Sphere will seat 6,000 people. "Smaller-scale Spheres would feature an Exosphere — the exterior LED display of Sphere that showcases both artistic and branded content and reaches audiences globally," said the press release. "All of Sphere's advanced technologies would be incorporated, including Sphere Immersive Sound, as well as haptic seating and 4D environmental effects." Haptic seating refers to chairs equipped with vibration motors, motion elements and other features. The Sphere in Las Vegas was ranked No. 1 on Billboard's and Pollstar's 2025 lists for the top-grossing venue worldwide. "All of Sphere's advanced technologies would be incorporated, including Sphere Immersive Sound, as well as haptic seating and 4D environmental effects," according to a news release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump said he no longer feels bound “to think purely of Peace.” • European countries are weighing using their so-called “trade bazooka” after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies, including the UK, until a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland. • UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies, and that the future status of Greenland belongs to its people and Denmark. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin also received an invitation. “We discussed how important the Arctic – including Greenland – is to our collective security and how (Denmark) is stepping up investments in key capabilities,” he posted on X. “We'll continue to work together as allies on these important issues.” The NATO secretary general has also taken note of this, and I believe we can now hopefully establish a framework for how this can be achieved,” Reuters quoted Poulsen as saying. President Donald Trump linked his interest in acquiring Greenland to his unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in a stunning message to Norway's prime minister. Meanwhile, stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold reached a new high after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until they agree to a deal for the US purchase of Greenland. In response to Trump's threats, António Costa, the president of the European Council (EUCO), called for an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders on “transatlantic relations,” which is scheduled to be held in Brussels on Thursday at 1 p.m. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments: President Trump has told the Norwegian prime minister that he is 'no longer obliged to think purely of peace' after he was snubbed of the Nobel Peace Prize. CNN's Kevin Liptak, Olesya Dmitracova, Auzinea Bacon, James Frater, Catherine Nicholls, Inke Kappeler, Rebekah Riess, Benjamin Brown, Amy Croffey, Billy Stockwell and Henrik Pettersson contributed to this report. Europe is not interested in picking a “fight” with the US over President Donald Trump's ambitions to annex Greenland, but the bloc will “hold our ground,” according to the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. Trump's threat to hit his allies with tariffs unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland is “not the way to go about this,” Kallas said. “Arctic security is a shared transatlantic interest, and one we can discuss with our US allies.” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said there are “red lines which can't be crossed,” referencing US President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland. Starmer said earlier Monday that it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies and reaffirmed that any decision about the future status of Greenland “belongs to the people of Greenland.” Asked if he felt betrayed by the US, Rasmussen said Monday: “I use the word surprised… I have no intention to escalate things.” “It's so important that all our allies in the NATO alliance, European Union, stand up for these principles to show the American president you have a desire, you have a vision, you have a request, but you will never be able to achieve that by putting pressure on us,” Rasmussen said. Greenland's Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen said today that dialogue should prevail as US and Europe clash over President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland and subsequent threat of tariffs on European allies. Nielsen said support for Greenland from other countries and state leaders “means something,” calling it a “clear recognition that Greenland is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions.” Three US cardinals have issued a rare joint statement calling for a “genuinely moral foreign policy” for America, citing recent events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland. “We renounce war as an instrument for narrow national interests and proclaim that military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations,” the cardinals said. Their unusual joint declaration comes after both the pope and US bishops have criticized the Trump administration's policy on immigration. McElroy, whose doctoral thesis was published as a book titled “Morality and American Foreign Policy: The Role of Ethics in International Affairs” in 1992, last year described immigration deportations as “morally repugnant.” Meanwhile, the US archbishop who has responsibility for the military expressed concern that “service personnel could be put in a situation where they're being ordered to do something that's morally questionable” when it came to any US action against Greenland. Archbishop Timothy Broglio told the BBC yesterday that “he cannot see any circumstances” that a US operation in Greenland could be a just war, describing Denmark as “an ally.” The tool — adopted in 2023 with countries like China in mind — can be applied if a third country tries to pressure the European Union or one of its member states “into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment.” It could block some of America's access to EU markets or impose export controls, among a broader list of potential countermeasures. Trump announced Saturday that he would impose 10% tariffs on February 1 on goods from eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland. It would increase to 25% if an agreement is not reached by June 1. The types of measures the European Commission can take using this anti-coercion instrument include restricting “foreign direct investment, financial markets, public procurement, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, export controls, and more,” according to the policy. Efforts would then be made to consult with the coercing third country to resolve the issue, but “if those efforts do not bear fruit,” the EU would then implement its anti-coercion instrument. CNN has obtained the full message exchange between Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, writing on behalf of himself and President Alexander Stubb of Finland, and US President Donald Trump. Text message from Prime Minister Støre to President Trump [January 18 at 3:48 p.m.]: «Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine - and your tariff announcement yesterday. We are proposing a call with you later today - with both of us or separately - give us a hint of what you prefer! Text message from President Trump to Prime Minister Støre [January 18 at 4:15 p.m.]: «Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States.The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. When US President Donald Trump began his second term last year, he immediately started threatening steep tariffs on goods imported from countries around the globe. On Saturday, he announced that he would impose 10% tariffs on goods from eight European countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany. Those eight nations had sent troops to Greenland Friday to take part in a joint military exercise on the island over the weekend. Trump did not specify whether the announced levies would be enacted on top of other tariffs already in existence. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods or services. In some countries, exports can also be subject to tariffs. They may choose to absorb those extra costs or pass them on in part or in full to their customers. Tariff transactions occur at hundreds of points of entry into the United States, designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports. “We urge the US to stop using the so-called ‘China threat' as a pretext for seeking selfish gains,” China's foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a news briefing in Beijing, according to CNN affiliate CCTV. The rebuke comes as US President Donald Trump, in a lengthy social media post Saturday, said the United States needed possession of Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian threats in the Arctic and develop what he has called the Golden Dome to protect North America from ballistic missiles. There will be a “substantial increase” in the number of Danish troops in Greenland after today, a Danish military spokesperson told CNN, with soldiers being deployed to the Arctic island this evening. US President Donald Trump has invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” a senior Israeli official told CNN. Israel hasn't officially replied yet to be a founding member state, the official said. For more context: Netanyahu is facing internal political pressure following the advancement of the Gaza ceasefire deal to phase two. On Saturday, he harshly criticized the inclusion of Turkey and Qatar in key roles on the executive board after trying to prevent their involvement in Gaza. We're getting more updates on the special European Council meeting being convened regarding US-Europe tensions over Greenland. Costa has said that after consulting with member states, European leaders are in agreement that US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations. “We do not want a trade dispute with the United States of America,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today in Berlin. Amid threats from US President Donald Trump that he will impose tariffs on several European countries in his pursuit of acquiring Greenland, a spokesperson for the European Commission has said that the priority among EU leaders is to “engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs.” Because this will ultimately harm consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” Olof Gill said today. If tariffs are imposed, however, the EU “has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond, because we will do everything necessary to protect EU economic interests,” he said. European leaders are “consulting intensively,” while “engagement with the US is continuing at all levels,” Gill said. “Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint and responsible leadership is what President von der Leyen and indeed the European Union as a whole are all about,” he added. President Donald Trump's niece has urged Europe to “fight back” following the US leader's threat to impose tariffs on eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland. Quoting a New York Times headline that reads “European Officials Lean Toward Negotiating, Not Retaliating, Over Trump Threat,” Mary Trump said that she was “so f**king tired” of people trying to negotiate with her uncle. Stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold – a safe-haven asset – reached a new peak after US President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until a deal was reached for the US purchase of Greenland. In the United States, where markets are closed Monday, Dow futures were 0.9% down, while S&P 500 futures dropped by a steeper 1.2%. Trump didn't specify whether the tariff would be on top of what they're already paying. Colloquially known as a “trade bazooka,” the instrument could block some of America's access to EU markets or result in export controls, among other potential measures. “Given their deep economic and financial ties, both the US and Europe have the ability to impose significant pain on each other, but only at great cost to themselves,” Jonas Goltermann, a senior markets economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said in a note Monday. That would be in line with the pattern around most previous Trump-driven diplomatic dramas.” “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the message, which was addressed to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre. “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership' anyway? “I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. Russian President Vladimir Putin's top economic envoy will travel to the Swiss resort town of Davos to hold meetings with members of the US delegation, sources with knowledge tell CNN. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to join US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza, his spokesman said on Monday. “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent requires it to have good relations with the United States. “It is in our national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defense, security and to intelligence,” Starmer said Monday, fielding questions from reporters about whether US President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland might cause a fundamental rupture in relations between the US and the UK, along with other NATO allies. “That requires us to have a good relationship with the United States,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board of Governors member, reacts during an event at the Brookings Institution, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will attend the Supreme Court's oral argument Wednesday in a case involving the attempted firing of Fed governor Lisa Cook, an unusual show of support by the central bank chair. The high court is considering whether President Donald Trump can fire Cook, as he said he would do in late August, in an unprecedented attempt to remove one of the seven members of the Fed's governing board. Powell plans to attend the high court's Wednesday session, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It's a much more public show of support than the Fed chair has previously shown Cook. But it follows Powell's announcement last week that the Trump administration has sent subpoenas to the Fed, threatening an unprecedented criminal indictment of the Fed Chair. Powell — appointed to the position by Trump in 2018 — appears to be casting off last year's more subdued reponse to Trump's repeated attacks on the central bank in favor of a more public confrontation. Powell issued a video statement Jan. 11 condemning the subpoenas as “pretexts” for Trump's efforts to force him to sharply cut the Fed's key interest rate. Powell oversaw three rate cuts late last year, lowering the rate to about 3.6%, but Trump has argued it should be as low as 1%, a position few economists support. No charges have been made against Cook. She sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court Oct. 1 issued a brief order allowing her to stay on the board while they consider her case. If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, he could appoint another person to fill her slot, which would give his appointees a majority on the Fed's board and greater influence over the central bank's decisions on interest rates and bank regulation.</p>

Part of a wrecked train is photographed at the site of a train collision in Adamuz, southern Spain, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters (feet) from the crash site, Andalusia regional president Juanma Moreno said, describing the wreckage a “mass of twisted metal” with bodies likely still to be found inside. Authorities are also focusing on attending hundreds of distraught family members and have asked for them to provide DNA samples to help identify victims. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif. Broken windows of a crashed train are photographed at the site of a train collision in Adamuz, southern Spain, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track. The accident shook a nation which leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash. “Today is a day of pain for all of Spain,” Sánchez said on a visit to Adamuz, a village near the accident site, where many locals helped emergency services handle the influx of distraught and hurt passengers overnight. Moreno, the regional leader, said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching for bodies. “Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact,” Moreno said. “The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away.” Pieces of a crashed train are photographed at the site of a train collision in Adamuz, southern Spain, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. One carriage lay on its side, bent around a large concrete pillar, with debris scattered around the area. Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the glass. Andalusia's regional emergency services said 43 people remained hospitalized, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 79 passengers were discharged by Monday afternoon, authorities said. Train services Monday between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled, causing large disruptions. Some bus companies also reinforced their services in the south. He called it “a truly strange” incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. An investigation into the cause could take a month, he said. Part of a wrecked train is photographed at the site of a train collision in Adamuz, southern Spain, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers told the AP that in in August, it sent a letter asking Spain's national railway operator to investigate flaws on train lines across the country and to reduce speeds at certain points until the tracks were fully repaired. Those recommendations were made for high-speed train lines, including the one where Sunday's accident took place, the union said. Álvaro Fernández, the president of Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph); one was going 205 kph (127 mph), the other 210 kph (130 mph). He also said that “human error could be ruled out.” Iryo issued a statement on Monday saying that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15. Various Spaniards who had loved ones on the trains posted messages on social media saying they were unaccounted for and pleading for any information. The Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. It was terrible,” Adamuz mayor Rafael Moreno told The Associated Press and other reporters. Images that will always stay in my mind.” One passenger had been treated in a local hospital along with her sister before she returned to Adamuz with hopes of finding her lost dog. She was limping and had a small bandage on her cheek, as seen by an AP reporter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said she was following the “terrible news.” Spanish King Felipe VI expressed his condolences Monday, adding that the royal house was looking into a visit to Adamuz. The Spanish flag was flown at half-staff in front of Parliament in Madrid for the victims on Monday. Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains and currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains moving over 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways. The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024. Sunday's accident was the first with deaths on a high-speed train since Spain's high-speed rail network opened its first line in 1992. Spain's worst train accident this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country's northwest. An investigation concluded the train was traveling 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks. That stretch of track was not high speed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this film still provided by Sundance Institute, Skyler Bible, Lucy Boynton, Oliver Diego Silva, David Duchovny, Hope Davis, Ariela Barer and Cooper Raiff appear in the film “See You When I See You” by Jay Duplass, an official selection of the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. The Sundance Film Festival may be a little bittersweet this year. There will be stars, from Natalie Portman to Charli XCX, and breakout discoveries, tearjerkers, comedies, thrillers, oddities that defy categorization and maybe even a few future Oscar nominees. The pop ups and sponsors will be out in full force on Main Street. Next year, it must find its footing in another mountain town, Boulder, Colorado. It's no surprise that legacy will be a through-line at this year's final edition in Park City. There will be screenings of restored Sundance gems like “Little Miss Sunshine,” “Mysterious Skin,” “House Party” and “Humpday” as well as Redford's first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama “Downhill Racer.” Many will also pay tribute to Redford at the institute's fundraising event, where honorees include Chloé Zhao, Ed Harris and Nia DaCosta. “Sundance has always been about showcasing and fostering independent movies in America. He first attended the festival in 1992 and has been back many times, including at the labs where Zhao was one of his students. Quite a few festival veterans are planning to make the trip, including “Navalny” filmmaker Daniel Roher. His first Sundance in 2022 might have been a bit unconventional (made fully remote at the last minute due to the pandemic) but ended on a high note with an Oscar. This year he's back with two films, his narrative debut “Tuner,” and the world premiere of “The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,” which he co-directed with Charlie Tyrell. “We're going through a weird moment in the world … There's something that strikes me about an institution that has been evergreen, that seems so entrenched going through its own transition and rebirth,” Roher told The Associated Press. Three of this year's presumed Oscar nominees — Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryan Coogler and Zhao — are among those the Institute supported early in their careers. Jay Duplass, who first came to Sundance in 2003 with his brother, Mark, with what he calls a “$3 film” said it was the place where his career was made. “I'd probably be a psychologist right now if it wasn't for Sundance,” Duplass said. While he's been to “probably 15 Sundances” since, it hasn't lost its luster. In fact, when a programmer called him to tell him that his new film “See You When I See You” was selected, he cried. The film is based on a memoir in which a young comedy writer (Cooper Raiff) attempts to process the death of his sister (Kaitlyn Dever). It's one of many films that finds humor amid grim subjects. As always, the lineup is full of starry films as well, including Cathy Yan's art world satire, “The Gallerist,” starring Portman, Jenna Ortega, Sterling K. Brown, Zach Galifianakis and Da'Vine Joy Randolph. The romantic drama “Carousel,” from Rachel Lambert, features Chris Pine and Jenny Slate as high school exes who rekindle their romance later in life. Araki is also bringing a new film, “I Want Your Sex,” in which Olivia Wilde plays a provocative artist (Araki described as a cross between Madonna and Robert Mapplethorpe) who takes on Cooper Hoffman as her younger muse. “It's kind of a sex-positive love letter to Gen Z,” Araki said. Olivia Colman is a fisherwoman looking to make the perfect husband in “Wicker,” co-starring Alexander Skarsgård. There are a handful of films about famous faces, including basketball star Brittney Griner, Courtney Love, Salman Rushdie, Billie Jean King, Nelson Mandela and comedian Maria Bamford. “American Doctor” follows three professionals trying to help in Gaza. “Who Killed Alex Odeh” examines the 1985 assassination of a Palestinian American activist in Southern California. And “Silenced” tracks international human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson in her fight against the weaponization of defamation laws against victims of gender violence. And some don't fit into any easy category, like “The History of Concrete” in which filmmaker John Wilson takes what he learned at a “how to sell a Hallmark movie” seminar and tries to apply it to a documentary on concrete. There might be a bit of wistfulness in the air too, as everyone takes stock of the last Sundance in Park City and tries to imagine what Boulder might hold. “It feels very special to be part of the last one in Park City,” Duplass said. Araki, like Redford, knew long ago that the festival had outgrown Park City. It will be strange to no longer have its iconic locations like Egyptian Theatre and Eccles and The Ray anymore, but it's also just a place.

Buffalo Bills defensive lineman Jordan Phillips appeared to be upset with the organization's decision to fire head coach Sean McDermott on Monday following a tough playoff exit. Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Jordan Phillips (97) against the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Jan. 26, 2025. Phillips made his feelings known on Instagram. "This s--- here is so stupid honestly sickening," Phillips wrote in a post on his Instagram Stories. "The best coach I've ever been around." He played for the Dallas Cowboys for two games before he was released and re-signed with the Bills. Phillips played in 11 games this season but his year was cut short due to an ankle injury. Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Jordan Phillips (97) during the first half against the New York Giants at Highmark Stadium on Oct. 15, 2023. Buffalo will embark on its first head-coaching search since the 2017 offseason. "Sean has done an admirable job of leading our football team for the past 9 seasons," team owner Terry Pegula said in a statement. "But I feel we are in need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level. "Sean helped change the mindset of this organization and was instrumental in the Bills becoming a perennial playoff team. I respect all the work, loyalty and attention to detail he showed for this team and the community. I wish Sean, Jamie and his family all the best." Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott looks on before the game against the New York Jets at Highmark Stadium on Jan. 4, 2026. McDermott had one losing season at the helm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A visitor pauses as she visits the memorial “Landmark for Peace” commemorating the site where Robert Kennedy delivered his immortal words on the night of Martin Luther King Jr's assassination in Indianapolis, Wednesday, April 4, 2018. The park where Kennedy called for peace and unity just hours after the assassination of King is being designated a National Historic Site. As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon's legacy. In the year since Donald Trump's second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump's birthday. The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city's Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for. Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon's plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump's comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community. “I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven't always been perfect, but we've always strived to be this more perfect union, and that's what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland's first Black governor and only the nation's third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press. “From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago. But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King's ambition for the country, Hafera argued. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don't judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.” The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn't, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy. “As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said. “This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK's radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported. Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether. In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. “This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to two European officials, Trump's message to Gahr Støre read in part: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” It concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” Starmer's comments came after Trump has argued repeatedly that the U.S. needs control of Greenland for its national security. He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. The Danish navy's inspection ship HDMS Vaedderen sails off Nuuk, Greenland, on Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026. Danish soldiers disembark at the harbor in Nuuk, Greenland, on Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026. Danish soldiers disembark at the harbor in Nuuk, Greenland, on Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year's decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, telling Norway's prime minister that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” in a text message released on Monday. Asked whether Trump could invade Greenland, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said on Monday that “you can't leave anything out until the president himself has decided to leave anything out.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also sought to de-escalate tensions on Monday. “I think this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion,” he said, adding that he did not believe military action would occur. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Monday that the tariff threats would not change their stance. Meanwhile, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business, minerals, energy, justice and equality, told The Associated Press that she was moved by the quick response of allies to the tariff threat and said it showed that countries realize “this is about more than Greenland.” “I think a lot of countries are afraid that if they let Greenland go, what would be next?” Trump's Sunday message to Gahr Støre, released by the Norwegian government, read in part: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” It concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the president's approach in Greenland during a brief Q&A with reporters in Davos, Switzerland, which is hosting the World Economic Forum meeting this week. Bessent insisted Trump “is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States,” adding that “we are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.” Last week, Machado presented her Nobel medal to Trump, who said he planned to keep it, though the committee said the prize can't be revoked, transferred or shared with others. In his latest threat of tariffs, Trump indicated they would be retaliation for last week's deployment of symbolic numbers of troops from the European countries to Greenland — though he also suggested that he was using the tariffs as leverage to negotiate with Denmark. Starmer on Monday called Trump's threat of tariffs “completely wrong” and said that a trade war is in no one's interest. European Council President Antonio Costa said Sunday that the bloc's leaders expressed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion.” He announced a summit for Thursday evening. “My focus is on making sure we don't get to that stage,” he said. Denmark's defense minister and Greenland's foreign minister are expected to meet NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Monday, a meeting that was planned before the latest escalation.</p>

A hiker was found dead in the remote mountains of Southern California over the weekend after searching for friends who had gotten lost on a trail, according to authorities. Deputies responded just before 8:30 p.m. Saturday to a call about a missing hiker near State Route 74 in Anza, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said. The caller said four members of their group had set out on a hike early that morning and failed to return. Concerned they were in distress, another member of the group went searching for them. The fifth hiker, who had set out to find the missing members of their group, was later found dead near the base of a 150-foot rock face. A helicopter crew found the initial four missing hikers and hoisted them to safety. The group was taken to the Lake Hemet Mountain Station, where they were medically evaluated.

Tom Brady and Colin Cowherd discuss Drake Maye's first playoff appearance and ask if he can continue his winning streak in the playoffs against a stout Texans Defense. Aikman, who is a color commentator for ESPN, summarized C.J. New England Patriots linebacker K'Lavon Chaisson hits Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud during the divisional playoff game, Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026, in Foxborough, Massachusetts. "DeMeco Ryans and Nick Caserio, they've got some tough decisions they gotta make about this team on the offensive side of the ball," Aikman said. "They replaced Bobby Slowick last year after his two years as the offensive coordinator. Stroud has been chasing his rookie success for the last two years. We've not seen the development from him. There's a reason for that, and it has to be addressed." He was 20-of-47 with 212 passing yards and one touchdown pass. While the defense gave Houston plenty of chances to score points and make it a close game, Stroud was never able to elevate the offense. ESPN commentator Troy Aikman walks the field prior to the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Commanders at Arrowhead Stadium on Oct. 27, 2025 in Kansas City, Missouri. "Seven turnovers in the two playoff games," Aikman added. "Your most important games of the year, you can't just overcome that kind of quarterback play." Ryans backed Stroud after the loss to New England. "I believed that he could come back out in the second half and flip it." Stroud speaks at a news conference after the divisional playoff game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026, in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Stroud will enter an offseason with the possibility of getting a major contract extension. He's 3-3 in playoff starts but has never made it out of the divisional round.

NFL rules analyst Walt Anderson weighed in on the controversial interception ruling in overtime of the Denver Broncos' victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday night. Broncos defensive back Ja'Quan McMillian took the ball away from Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks on a deep pass from Josh Allen. It appeared that Cooks had come down with the ball and that McMillian had taken it away after Cooks completed the catch. Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian reacts after intercepting a pass intended for Buffalo Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks during the divisional round playoff game, Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026, in Denver. He also addressed the issue of why there was no proper explanation of the play. Anderson said replay assistant and officials in New York reviewed the play quickly and made the call. "If you can confirm that the ruling on the field is correct, they really want to move the game along, and they don't want to have unnecessary stoppages." Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian after intercepting a pass, Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026, in Denver. Bills head coach Sean McDermott was irate over the process of how the call was confirmed. "It would seem logical to me… that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it, just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium to there are on the same page. That's too big of a play, in my estimation, and a play that decided the game potentially as well, to not even slow it down," McDermott said. If it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down just to make sure that we have this right? That would have made a lot of sense to me, to make sure that we have this thing right. Because that's a pivotal play in the game. So I'll just leave it at that." But he did not leave it at that. Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott reacts during the playoff game against the Broncos, Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026, in Denver. "That play is not even close," he told the outlet. I sat in my locker and I looked at it probably 20 times, and nobody can convince me that that ball is not caught and in possession of Buffalo." Fox News' Ryan Morik contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? How public opinion on crowdfunding soured, explained in one chart. Today, no American tragedy is complete without a GoFundMe. It took less than a week to raise over $1.5 million for the family of Renee Nicole Good, the woman fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. And last year saw GoFundMe campaigns for people rebuilding their homes after the Los Angeles wildfires, therapy for the Camp Mystic flood survivors in Texas, struggling families affected by the SNAP shutdown, and far more. But even as one in five Americans donate directly to those in need through crowdfunding, many feel uneasy about the rise of platforms like GoFundMe, which has raised over $40 billion since 2010, according to a recent survey by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey found that less than 10 percent of Americans — including both donors and non-donors — felt very confident in the effectiveness of crowdfunding campaigns, and many harbored serious doubts about who really stands to profit from them. More than half of those surveyed said they had very little confidence that crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe charge reasonable service fees. And nearly as many doubted that crowdfunders themselves use the money they raise responsibly or raise enough to meet their goals at all. As I previously reported in October, the evidence shows that some of their fears are justified. Start with those service fees, which the highest share of survey participants had qualms about. Another point of doubt was the idea that many who crowdfund don't actually need the money and, even if they do, might not use it responsibly. The data on such fraud is difficult to come by, and while GoFundMe claims it affects only about one in 1,000 campaigns on its platform, the disperse nature of crowdfunding makes it virtually impossible to verify whether most fundraisers ultimately use their funds “wisely” or even for their intended purpose at all. What's more, Americans' hunch that few crowdfunds ultimately reach their initial goals is also right on target. A week before Good's shooting, another American citizen, Keith Porter Jr. — a Black father from Los Angeles — was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE officer on New Year's Eve. Amid some outcry over the disparity, a GoFundMe for Porter's daughters has managed to raise nearly $260,000 out of a goal of $300,000. Still, even though crowdfunding can be a flawed way to give, it's one of the only venues we have for directly helping individual people in need quickly during times of crisis. According to the AP-NORC survey, medical expenses and health care causes are the most common kind of crowdfunds people donate to, followed by memorials and funeral expenses. Oftentimes, these fundraisers act as a lifeline for people in intense distress who have no other options. For beneficiaries, even a mildly successful campaign can be transformative. Sure, there are probably more efficient, more equitable ways to handle medical bankruptcies and funeral costs than an endless string of crowdfunds. But until those solutions materialize, giving to one another — however imperfectly — might be the best we've got.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the time, “no public acknowledgment was made of there being a bomb shelter under construction, only the East Wing,” according to White House Historical Association historian Bill Seale. More than 80 years later, the East Wing is again under construction in preparation for President Donald Trump's sprawling new ballroom, and the historic, if dated, underground facilities have been dismantled. And once again, there's a lot of secrecy around plans to rebuild the bunker. Little is publicly known about the construction taking place in what was once a secret submarine-like bunker, which included the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, and the underground infrastructure around it. The space has been used for everything from watching a parody film the Nixon administration deemed pornographic and wanted killed, to planning former President Joe Biden's clandestine trip to Ukraine. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney was evacuated to the space moments before an attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The space is now likely being reimagined and replaced with new technology to counter evolving threats, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. But there has been very little acknowledgment that the project even exists. During a recent meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission where the ballroom was discussed, White House director of management and administration Joshua Fisher said broadly that the overall ballroom project will “(enhance) mission critical functionality,” “make necessary security enhancements” and “(deliver) resilient, adaptive infrastructure aligned with future mission needs.” That does not preclude us from changing the above-grade structure, but that work needed to be considered when doing this project, which was not part of the NCPC process,” he said. The White House declined CNN's request for comment. Though Roosevelt's construction was initially envisioned as a bomb shelter, underground facilities beneath the East Wing evolved over time to serve multiple functions. Those who enter through the East Wing would go down a few levels and then walk through a massive, protected vault-style door to enter a self-contained bunker with low ceilings that included beds, shelf-stable foods, water, and other supplies, plus secure communications to the outside world, according to a source who has been inside the space and was not authorized to speak on the record. The underground space also included the PEOC, a centralized command and control facility for the president and his staff that was fortified to withstand a potential nuclear explosion or other major attack. The PEOC works in tandem with the Situation Room, said Jonathan Wackrow, a former US Secret Service agent and CNN contributor. “The Situation Room is a much more focused watch center that will feed information over to the PEOC, but because it is a complex that's in the West Wing, it is secure to a point, but it's not a hardened facility,” he said. It's not something that everybody goes to,” he added. The PEOC has been depicted on the silver screen with varying degrees of accuracy — most recently in the 2025 thriller “A House of Dynamite,” along with 2013's “Olympus Has Fallen,” which depicted a terror attack on the White House. A second source familiar with the space granted anonymity to speak freely described the underground complex as “a very complicated submarine that was built in the 1940s — a self-contained unit, [with] separate power backups, separate water backups, separate air filtration.” “With a high degree of confidence, I would say that all of the subterranean structures,” including the PEOC, heating and air utilities, and underground facilities for the White House Military Office and US Secret Service Uniformed Division, “all of that seems to be gone,” the second source said. While it's unlikely that plans will emerge in public anytime soon, details could come with time: The PEOC played a significant role on September 11, 2001, and select images from inside the center that day were released via a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015. Wackrow, now a risk management executive, predicted that whatever replaces the underground space will be able to anticipate and respond to emerging threats, including kinetic threats like a nuclear explosion or plane crash; chemical or biological instruments; or electromagnetic pulses, among other potential concerns, and do so without telegraphing details to potential adversaries. “You have to think about a facility that can be built in secret, highly classified, that can sustain the current and future state threat environment,” he said. What will be virtually impossible: learning how much this aspect of construction costs. Trump has offered an ever-growing price tag on the ballroom aspect of the project, which started at $200 million and is now up to $400 million, but that doesn't account for what will happen underground. Trump has made clear that the ballroom will be paid for by private donors, but any subterranean security infrastructure will ultimately be paid for by American taxpayers. “If you think about trying to mitigate the threats today and the threats for tomorrow, you're really talking about emerging technologies, emerging infrastructure — stuff that may not be commercially available. We're never going to get the line of sight on how much that costs,” Wackrow said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has pitched NATO into what could become its worst-ever crisis by threatening new tariffs against US allies that oppose his grab for Greenland against the will of its people. Whether the world's relative peace is endangered by the fracturing of its most powerful military alliance will partly depend on whether Republicans in Congress show rare resolve in challenging their incorrigible president. Another key factor is whether European leaders, who responded to the latest escalation with steely unity, will threaten consequences for Trump and the US. The European Union is a huge trade bloc, and retaliation could hammer US stock markets that Trump touts as a barometer of economic well-being. But trade reprisals or limiting military cooperation could end up damaging America's allies more than their protector. European Union ambassadors held emergency consultations in Brussels on Sunday, and several leaders of NATO allies who are friendly with Trump called to express resolve over Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. There is palpable alarm on both sides of the Atlantic that NATO could collapse. Such a previously unthinkable scenario would represent a historic win for Russia and China and represent perhaps the most destabilizing outcome of Trump's two White House terms. But are there sufficient senior Republicans so protective of NATO, a bedrock of US global power, that they'd gamble on an exceedingly rare breach with him? Cracks have emerged in Trump's power base in Congress — notably over the Jeffrey Epstein files — but he remains feared by many GOP lawmakers. Ultimately, however, the parlous fate of the alliance rests on a president who sees US military power as his to wield without legal or constitutional constraints and who disdains NATO as a protection racket. Acquiring Greenland would be a legacy item greater than putting his name on the Kennedy Center or building a new White House ballroom; it would place him alongside Thomas Jefferson and William McKinley as presidents who expanded the territory of the United States. Trump sent shockwaves across the Atlantic on Saturday by intensifying his aggressive demands for Greenland as he pushes his “Art of the Deal” foreign policy to extremes. He said Saturday he'd impose a 10% tariff on “any and all goods” from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland starting February 1, increasing to 25% on June 1, until an agreement is reached. Trump has correctly pointed out that many NATO nations took the US security umbrella for granted by running down their armed forces in recent decades. His anger, as well as the threat highlighted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has prompted many member states to promise to substantially increase defense spending. But by failing to rule out military force to take Greenland, he risks destroying NATO and its Article 5 mutual defense clause over a personal obsession. They're more worried about high prices a year into Trump's second presidency. So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that's one thing. But for him to militarily invade would turn Article 5 of NATO on its very head, and in essence, put us at war with NATO itself,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees, told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. Trump's first-term vice president, Mike Pence, told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that while the US has an interest in controlling and ultimately owning Greenland, Trump's methods were counterproductive. “I do think that the current posture, which I hope will change and abate, does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our NATO allies,” Pence said Sunday. Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, who heads the US delegation to NATO's parliamentary assembly, agreed that Trump had legitimate national security concerns in Greenland. But he told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “there certainly is no authority that the president has to use military force to seize territory from a NATO country.” Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul and Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine are planning to impose speed bumps. They said in a joint appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” that they are discussing a new war powers resolution on Greenland. They also plan to challenge the new tariffs and highlight a law that stipulates a president can't withdraw from NATO without congressional approval. But he added: “I've heard of no Republican support for that, even though most hawkish members of our caucus have said they won't support that.” Some Republicans hope Trump is merely playing real estate shark. “I think it's just the way Trump deals with things. I mean, look, he's gotten good deals done by taking an aggressive position,” Florida Sen. Rick Scott told Fox News. But an administration empowered by topping Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro seems to have moved on from master dealmaker mode. Days after Trump said he wanted Greenland because it was “psychologically important for me,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday appeared to confirm perceptions that the administration thinks the US is so strong it can take what it wants. Trump's pressure on NATO follows a banner period for the alliance after Sweden and Finland joined during the Biden administration following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trump's fixation on Greenland, which is becoming more important as a race for control of the Arctic speeds up, makes strategic sense. The US has treaties with Denmark that allow it to send troops there. Trump says the island is vital for his Golden Dome missile defense project. But a US Space Force base there already focuses on missile early warning systems. And Trump's claim that China and Russia might invade is disingenuous because the island is already NATO territory the alliance would defend. But Bessent advanced a stunning rationale that implies Trump could act unilaterally on any global issue. It is a strategic decision by the president,” he told NBC. President Emmanuel Macron drew a striking parallel between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's territorial gangsterism when he wrote on X that France favored the independence and sovereignty of all nations. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — each of whom has tried to befriend Trump — both spoke to him by phone. Meloni, a populist conservative, said she “doesn't agree” with Greenland-related tariffs. But it will take more than words to appease Trump. Can Republicans on Capitol Hill or NATO allies show him that there will be personal and political consequences for making the annexation of Greenland a top priority? The collapse of the deal or retaliatory tariffs could hurt Trump by spiking prices of imports in a midterm election year in which voters have soured on his economic performance. A severing of transatlantic ties would also complicate some of Trump's other priorities, such as his desire for European support and funding for his initiative to stabilize and rebuild Gaza. And if he really is serious about ending the Ukraine war, it can't be done fairly without Europe. NATO alliance members might also turn away from US arms purchases and investment. Decades of underspending on defense have left them reliant on America's military might 80 years after World War II and nearly 35 after the Cold War ended. There is a genuine will in Europe to be more independent. But it will take decades to build scale and all-around resilience, assuming weak governments can convince disgruntled voters to make sacrifices for defense spending.</p>
