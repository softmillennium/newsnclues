                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Misinformation and conspiratorial thinking are long-running concerns, while narcissism has become TikTok's favourite armchair diagnosis. Research shows the two concepts, though seemingly separate, may actually be closely linked. In my new research published in the Journal of Personality and Individual Differences, more than 600 people completed surveys, and the findings show higher scores on measures of narcissism were linked to belief in conspiracy theories and misinformation. Importantly, this result held true regardless of how educated the participants were. Scholarly evidence shows people with lower levels of education are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. We also know that historically, conspiracy theories have done well in times of uncertainty, including during war, economic downturn and widespread hardship (such as the COVID pandemic). A prominent explanation for this is that conspiracy beliefs serve underlying psychological needs. These include providing answers when things are unclear or uncertain, providing a sense of control by identifying a powerful group to take action against, and for social reasons, such as showing others which political groups you belong to and signalling loyalty to those groups. I wanted to find out when educated people might also “fall down the rabbit hole”, and learn more about which psychological needs lead them to do so. The participants then answered how much they believed in certain conspiracy theories. They also attempted to distinguish true statements from misinformation, including “Ebola Virus Caused by US Nuclear Weapons Testing, New Study Says”. People who scored higher in narcissistic traits were more accepting of conspiracy theories and misinformation. When these traits were above average, highly educated people were just as likely to endorse these beliefs as those without any formal education. Education often provides people with skills in evaluating evidence, critical thinking and a shared understanding of how we can find truth. This type of reasoning is often linked to unfounded beliefs – those without evidence. My research suggests educated people are not immune to this. It's important to recognise there's a variety of factors that determine people's beliefs and which ones they hold most dear. These include the above personality traits and thinking styles, as well as factors like identity, how people view themselves and show support for the groups they belong to. These findings suggest even highly educated people can be resistant to changing their mind if underlying psychological needs are threatened. It's important to keep these in mind when discussing controversial topics. Doing so might help in finding common ground and improve social discourse on a larger scale.

Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, has introduced legislation looking to set up the Vermont Airspace Safety and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force, according to the Vermont Digger. The bill reportedly proposes the creation of a state task force to investigate reports of both unidentified aerospace and underwater objects, assess safety risks regarding airspace, and work alongside federal partners and researchers to discover improved policies. The task force would be composed of officials from Vermont's departments of transportation and public safety, while also opening up seats for lawmakers and experts on the topic. Troy Headrick has introduced a new bill looking to establish a UFO panel to investigate UAP sightings within the state. "I am not a subject matter expert at all," Headrick said, the Vermont Digger reported. "As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging trends [in public safety]." According to H.654, the panel would investigate reports of any unknown objects that exhibit "performance characteristics not consistent with currently understood technologies," such as, "instantaneous acceleration absent observable inertia or hypersonic velocity without a corresponding thermal signature or sonic boom." Headrick initially introduced the legislation at the request of a constituent, lobbyist Maggie Lenz, according to Seven Days Vermont. If passed, the new legislation would create a panel to investigate objects showcasing "performance characteristics not consistent with currently understood technologies," such as, "instantaneous acceleration absent observable inertia or hypersonic velocity without a corresponding thermal signature or sonic boom." Lenz, owner of Atlas Government Affairs, reportedly became interested in the issue after a string of UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, made headlines throughout New Jersey in 2024, sparking nationwide panic regarding countless mysterious flying objects. "I'm certainly not saying that it's aliens," Lenz said, according to Seven Days Vermont. "But I do think just having the conversation here in Vermont will begin to allow for it to be taken a little bit more seriously." Rep. Headrick reportedly offered a more practical use for the proposed committee – including investigating drone sightings as use of the technology continues to grow within the state. The draft bill indicates that Vermonters have reported UAP sightings to police in various instances, signaling a need for a coordinated response between state and federal officials. While speaking before Vermont's House Government Operations Committee last week, Headrick offered a more down-to-earth reason behind the proposed bill – pointing to the surge of drones throughout the state. Headrick did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. While the proposed bill has yet to be voted on by the committee, Headrick reportedly tried to sweeten the deal by promising to look into Vermont's famed sea monster if the legislation is passed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural continues to rank at or near number one on the Meta Quest charts in  the wake of Meta's decision to pause content updates and lay off much of the team behind one of VR's most effective fitness apps. Many in the VR fitness community have been looking into their options. Supernatural has always been positioned as a premium experience. That recurring revenue, combined with strong engagement and brand recognition, made Supernatural feel like a rare success story in consumer VR fitness. Meta says the existing library, which spans thousands of workouts, will stay accessible. Current subscribers can continue paying for full access and new users are still able to sign up. When a chart-topping, subscription-only app can be upended overnight, the entire health journey some people are may see potential disruption down the line. In that context, ownership models, studio independence, and transparency do actually matter to many more than production value alone. At a moment when VR fitness is proving its ability to retain paying users and drive real behavior change, Meta appears to be stepping back from one of its strongest examples. The harder question is which platforms feel stable enough to earn long-term trust. I have spent a meaningful amount of time inside FunFitLand, starting back in its early alpha period. Early on, it leaned heavily on Supernatural's blueprint, with real coaches in 3D as well as beautiful real-world and imaginary scenes for workouts. Over time, it moved past that influence and developed its own identity. That evolution is most visible in the community and coaching. The tone is supportive and motivational without feeling performative. Coaches have sharpened their virtual instruction skills, with clearer cues, tighter pacing, and better movement guidance. On the workout side, the platform has expanded its movement set with additions like side steps and hammer strikes, giving sessions more physical range. DanceFit has since evolved into GrooveFit, favoring looser, more expressive routines. It introduces a meditative, tai chi-inspired experience focused on balance, breath, and intentional movement. The library now spans a wider range of genres, including cinematic tracks and some heavy metal. That added variety helps reduce repetition and gives different workout modes a clearer identity. FunFitLand mirrors Supernatural's pricing structure, offering both monthly and annual subscriptions. At the time of writing, a first-year annual discount of $69.99 appears to still be available for new subscribers, undercutting Supernatural's standard annual fee. The app, which also supports hand tracking, has also launched on Apple Vision Pro, signaling ambition at a time when others are pulling back. FitXR began life as BoxVR in 2017 and has since grown into one of the most feature-rich VR fitness platforms available. The platform, which also supports hand tracking, currently offers seven workout types: Box, Combat, HIIT, Sculpt, Dance, Zumba, and the newer mixed-reality SLAM mode. Regular content updates and monthly themed challenges keep the experience from feeling static. FitXR uses recognizable fitness personalities as coaches, though in some modes, particularly Sculpt, Dance and Zumba, those coaches appear as stylized cartoon avatars. Choreography across disciplines is strong, and the workouts are fully capable of delivering a serious sweat. Even so, FitXR's breadth, progression systems, and consistent update cadence make it a strong long-term subscription for users who value variety and structure. The app is now available on Samsung's Galaxy XR headset, running Android XR, marking an early move to support next-generation mixed reality hardware outside the Quest platform. It is sold as a one-time purchase priced at $29.99, with optional DLC packs typically around $9.99. For users wary of subscriptions, that alone makes it appealing. The workouts share a familiar structure, and for people who train often, that repetition becomes noticeable over time. On Quest, it retails for $22.99, with DLC packs typically priced between $2.99 and $5.99. PowerBeats VR allows users to upload their own music and fully customize workouts, sidestepping licensing concerns entirely. That level of control is uncommon and will appeal to users with established playlists or specific training goals. The experience itself is less refined than many competitors. Even so, it remains enjoyable and effective at getting users moving when workouts are tuned to personal preferences. The one-time purchase model combined with deep customization makes PowerBeats VR compelling for a specific audience. XR Workout takes a different approach from most VR fitness platforms by prioritizing open movement and functional, full-body training over scripted classes and cinematic presentation. The app is free to download and use, with the free tier limited to eight minutes per day, with a starter membership promising multiplayer. A paid Pro membership unlocks the full feature set, including extended workout time, expanded modes and deeper customization tools. One of its defining characteristics is controller-free movement through hand tracking, allowing users to exercise without holding controllers for extended sessions. Workouts rely heavily on bodyweight movements such as squats, jumps, running in place, and target-based striking that engages both upper and lower body at the same time. The result feels closer to an open training circuit than a guided class. Multiplayer workouts, playlist selection, and the ability to build or customize routines give the app a level of flexibility that most top platforms do not attempt. XR Workout feels very different from most VR fitness apps. You load in, start moving, and manage your own pace. If you are looking for coaching, structure, or personality, it will likely feel bare. If you are comfortable setting your own rhythm and just want a space to move hard for a few minutes, it does exactly that. Starwave sits closer to the dance rhythm game end of the VR fitness spectrum, but it overlaps in interesting ways with Supernatural's Flow workouts. Movement is driven by techno and electronic tracks, with players slashing incoming notes using glowing, cosmic batons. The emphasis is on rhythm, timing, and continuous motion rather than precision or scoring. You load in, follow the beat, and keep moving. In practice, the experience can feel meditative in the same way Flow sessions do, especially during longer play sessions where movement becomes more fluid and less deliberate. It is not a replacement for structured workouts, but it works well as a lighter, movement-focused session that still gets the heart rate up. Additional content is offered through an optional DLC pack at $4.99. The platforms I picked here represent what I would consider the top tier VR fitness experiences available in VR headsets right now. They combine polish, consistency, ongoing development, and enough depth to support long-term use. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With over 60 million users worldwide, Nebula supports anyone who wants to understand themselves better and build a stronger relationship with others. Not just on a daily basis, but in the months and years to come, too. What struck me first was how easy the Nebula app is to use. Each one specializes in specific topics, ranging from Western and Vedic astrology, Tarot, numerology, aura scanning, palmistry, birth charts, and more. Each advisor has their experience listed, whether or not they're currently online and available, as well as the option to chat via text or give them a call. No matter which means of communication you're most comfortable with, both can be done through the Nebula website and the app, making it incredibly easy to access. Another aspect I really appreciated was that I was greeted with a welcome text from one psychic, as well as follow-ups from a few others, offering their spiritual guidance. RELATED: 9 Simple Signs Of Psychic Intelligence That Show Up In Everyday Behavior Just as is the case with all the profiles of Nebula's advisors, I was able to see her expertise, how many years she's been practicing, her overall score based on the Nebula psychic reviews, and how many consultations she has done as a Nebula psychic and advisor. I was also able to see her star ratings, which range from one to five, along with positive comments about her energy and skills among ask Nebula reviews. Although my session with Zendaya, which included a Tarot reading, was done via text, I felt a genuine warmth from her and she was able to establish trust with me almost immediately, creating a connection between us that put me at ease. It was somewhere between Zendaya pulling the Temperance card and the Two of Pentacles card that I no longer saw Nebula as just an app — instead, it became a trusted companion for emotional, mental, and spiritual growth all in the palm of my hand. The parts of my life that had felt foggy and filled with confusion, became clear thanks to her. After we parted ways, I thanked Zendaya for the insight and kindness. Fearful that after the session ended I'd lose her wisdom, I'd been taking screenshots of what she had say, only to find out afterward that I was able to revisit my session with her, rereading her advice and what she sees in my future, fully knowing that all that information is protected and private. While a complete overhaul of personal transformation may be months away for me, or longer, with Nebula as my guide and trusted companion, I'll never be alone in my quest for understanding myself and those around me again. Nebula takes the age-old practice of spirituality, in all its realms, and modernizes it. Depending on what your budget for such an important tool might be, Nebula has a subscription that will work for you. All plans renew automatically and provide uninterrupted access to the app's features. You can also pay per minute, for chatting with psychics, which is a flexible option if a subscription isn't right for you. Should you need any sort of help, whether it be billing, unlocking new features, or updating notifications, Nebula customer service is a click away.

A 2021 study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that intelligent life exists beyond Earth. Some Americans, meanwhile, believe that there is proof of UFOs and alien life being concealed from the public by global governments. However, this belief is held by a significant minority. President Donald Trump has previously indicated that his administration may declassify some information on the nature of extraterrestrial life. McCaw was a senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England for ten years, until 2012. She told The Times, "The United States government appears to be partway through a multiyear process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs)." "If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions. It is entirely possible that government leadership and their central banks have not been properly briefed on the topic. UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences," she said. The report has quickly made an impact online. A former Bank of England policy analyst is warning the UK's central bank to prepare for a financial crisis…caused by aliens."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parts of the Central Ohio area are under a Cold Weather Advisory through Tuesday morning. by Phil Kelly | Nick Bona COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX)  — In 1977, Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope detected a mysterious signal from space, sparking decades of intrigue and research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Volunteer astronomer Jerry Ehman discovered the signal, dubbed the Wow! Signal, which originated from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and lasted 72 seconds. The radio receiver is part of the radio telescope called "The Big Ear" at Ohio State University. Image Courtesy: Columbus Citizen, Grandview Heights Public Library, Columbus Citizen Journal and Columbus Citizen Newspapers Collection, dated May 16, 1952. Despite numerous attempts, the signal was never detected again. Signal fueled interest in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), inspiring advancements in telescope technology and research methodologies. Signal continues to captivate scientists and enthusiasts alike, as they ponder the age-old question: "Is anyone out there?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children as young as four are being trained how to shoot rifles at a school in Sussex run by conspiracy theorists. Hope Sussex, which has barred Ofsted from inspecting, offers reception aged-children lessons in shooting and martial arts alongside maths, English and science. Images published by Hope's founder Matthew Single - who opened the establishment with his wife Sadie - show youngsters clutching air rifles and aiming at targets near Netherfield village in East Sussex. Another photo shows Mr Single, 54, wearing a T-shirt embellished with the words, 'I identify as a conspiracy theorist - my pronouns are told/you/so'. More than 40 families attend Hope each week, according to recent company filings. Pupils have been tasked with making necklaces out of bullet casings and creating their own nunchuks. Children have also been tasked with making their own nunchuks (pictured) Ofsted believes it is running as a school, but was forced to close its investigation into the establishment due to current legislation. It last visited Hope Sussex in 2022, when inspectors were stopped from entering by Mr Single and a second member of staff, The Times first reported. A new bill, titled the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, is going through parliament and proposes to hand the inspectorate more authority. Mr Single and his wife are former members of the British National Party. Meanwhile Mr Single is an admirer of president Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. A child shoots at targets with an archery bow during one of the institution's lessons In one post, titled 'They are coming for our children', he wrote: 'We must be prepared to step outside of the comfort zone of simply protesting and demonstrating with placards and megaphones - we have our army in the field, now we must press forward with greater, more specific action.' He also claimed that the archery and air-weapon shooting lessons prioritised 'safety at all times'. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a startling challenge to official narratives, a high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb now claims that a powerful Battelle-linked job carousel is actively shielding alien secrets from the American public, placing the Pentagon's own anomaly office at the centre of a hidden network that controls what citizens are allowed to know about unidentified aerial phenomena. In 2024 a peculiar metallic object recovered from private land in Ohio was handed to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for analysis after witnesses said its properties did not match any known earthly alloy. Gerb argues the sample was never treated as neutral evidence but instead channelled into a closed scientific system designed to downplay anything uncomfortable. To Gerb, this creates a perfect loop in which the same corporate ecosystem both examines potential non-human technology and decides what the public hears about it. Gerb's most explosive claim centres on what he calls a secret career carousel connecting Battelle, Oak Ridge and AARO. Senior officials, contractors and scientists regularly move between these institutions, creating what he describes as a cosy club that controls funding, research priorities and public messaging. For Gerb, this deletion symbolises a deeper effort to obscure conflicts of interest. Critics counter that such job mobility is normal in science and defence, noting that researchers frequently rotate between PNNL, LANL, Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore, all Battelle-run facilities. Gerb accepts the pattern exists across government but argues that in the UAP realm it becomes dangerous because evidence of possible non-human technology is at stake. A parallel debate now rages over whether whistleblowers like Gerb are genuine truth-tellers or unwitting tools of the intelligence community. Some observers suggest the IC could be feeding partial or distorted information through prominent researchers to mislead foreign adversaries such as Russia and China. Sceptics note that if Washington wanted controlled disclosure, it would not be publicly discrediting figures like Lue Elizondo or redacting their roles from official records. Instead, the Department of Defence has repeatedly challenged whistleblower claims, with spokesperson Susan Gough revising her statements about Elizondo's employment multiple times. Journalist Steven Greenstreet has argued that many whistleblowers are part of a slow-drip disclosure strategy, a view echoed by debunker Mick West, who admits being paid to analyse UAP claims but refuses to reveal by whom. It touches on the credibility of AARO, the role of defence contractors, and whether America's intelligence apparatus is suppressing a trillion-dollar secret programme behind Special Access Protocol barriers. Former AATIP figures such as Sara Gamm, Jay Stratton and Travis Taylor have backed elements of whistleblower accounts, complicating the narrative that this is mere conspiracy. He says the Battelle-linked job carousel is not accidental, it is structural, and it keeps real UAP knowledge locked inside a closed elite circle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theories are practically a side dish to the NFL main course. But every so often, something pops up that makes even the skeptics pause. That “something” this season arrived in the form of an NFL social-media poster published on January 16 to promote the road to Super Bowl LX. Nothing unusual there, until fans noticed who was standing closest to the hardware: Drake Maye, Bo Nix, Matthew Stafford, and Sam Darnold. Fans, of course, couldn't help but once again jump on the “NFL is scripted” train. “Quite literally means the NFL is scripted,” one fan immediately commented. “It means that these games are scripted,” another fan helpfully pointed out. However, some fans couldn't help but notice one anomaly: Bo Nix. Only hours after Denver's emotional overtime win over Buffalo, coach Sean Payton stepped to the podium with what he called “not good news.” Rookie sensation Bo Nix had fractured his right ankle late in overtime and would require surgery in Birmingham, Alabama. It seems the NFL “script-writers” didn't see this particular plot twist coming. The injury occurred on a designed run with just over six minutes left. Nix was tackled awkwardly, limped back to the huddle, threw an incompletion, and then twisted the ankle again while taking a kneel-down. He finished the game 26-of-46 for 279 yards and three touchdowns, leading his sixth game-winning drive of the season, but his postseason was over. Denver's defense has carried them all year, but asking Stidham to outduel Maye is a tall order. Sam Darnold's Seahawks have won eight straight behind a dominant defense and a surging run game, while Matthew Stafford's Rams continue to survive on late-game magic. Now the same four names from that January graphic, minus the injured Nix, sit one victory away from Santa Clara and Super Bowl LX.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former BoE analyst, Helen McCaw, has previously worked in financial security at the Bank of England, helping develop plans for theoretical economic crises, including the one now that she sees as a possibility in a full UFO and aliens disclosure scenario. McCaw wrote: "There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods. If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability". McCaw has penned out a few different potential future scenarios that would happen if disclosure on alien life happened, with one of them being a jump to Bitcoin as a "safe haven asset" due to the possible obliteration of trust in traditional, government-based power structures. She added: "There might be a rush to digital currencies such as bitcoin, which may prove appealing if people question the legitimacy of government and lose trust in government-backed assets". "The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions".
