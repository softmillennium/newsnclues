                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday. Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project. The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans. For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual. But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences for it. Trump said in late August that he was firing Cook from the seven-member Fed Board, citing claims that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two homes she owns. Cook denies any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any crime. A district court judge there on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing her as the lawsuit continued. A federal appeals court soon after upheld that order. The Department of Justice, in filings with the Supreme Court, has called the lower court orders barring Cook's removal "yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to  remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One thing many workers are keen to leave behind heading into 2026? In Owl Labs' 2025 State of Hybrid Work report, 65% of workers reported being interested in microshifting, defined as working in "short, non-linear blocks based on personal energy, responsibilities, or productivity patterns." "Microshifting appeals to employees not just as a scheduling preference, but as a way to reclaim control over their increasingly fragmented work lives," Owl Labs CEO Frank Weishaupt tells CNBC Make It. The interest in microshifting could represent interest in keeping that flexibility, particularly among those with some degree of remote or self-directed work, as it may be more difficult for office workers in traditional 9-to-5 jobs. But microshifting isn't an entirely new practice. Doug Gregory of Grand Rapids, Michigan, says he's been doing it as a remote worker for decades, before it had that name, and even more so since the Covid-19 pandemic. "We kind of got used to the idea of being present or available for loved ones," he says of broader sentiment in the workforce stemming from the pandemic remote work era. "We got used to taking better care of our health." While Gregory acknowledges that "not everybody has control over their calendar," he finds "the day is more fluid" when he's microshifting. "If I need to take an hour off during the day to go do something with the grandkid or to go see a doctor or whatever, it's okay, I make up for it in the evening, I make up for it early in the morning," he says. Gregory previously held sales roles but today is self-employed working in audiovisual integration. "I earn a living based on outcomes," he says. Microshifting could be particularly useful for parents and caregivers; Owl Labs' report found caregivers were roughly three times as likely to try microshifting as non-caregivers. Robertson says she juggled her work, including a former role as a project manager, with caregiving for her late husband, who had chronic health issues, for 25 years. "To me, it was just making sure I didn't lose my job," she says. That meant scheduling meetings around his doctors' appointments and starting some days early or ending others late to take him to those appointments, manage his medications and handle other caregiving responsibilities. "We had a routine; after I got him settled, made sure he was dressed and he had his medicine and he had his food, then I could relax and focus on work," she says. Some of her jobs during this period, like in project management, were more outcome-based so she was trusted to manage her time as long as she handled her work, she notes. "As long as I got the job done on time and on budget, they weren't really looking at did I punch a clock to see was I in the building at 7 a.m." she says. Today, Robertson runs a virtual assistant agency, which she says helps her continue to microshift. She sets her hours such that she's mostly free on Friday afternoons, for example, to tend to personal matters. "That's the only way I'm able to have a life and produce an income."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. "Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation," Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC. "Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door." Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using "virtually worthless" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an "escape valve" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC. "This was a violent repricing driven by fear," Li said. "As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight." He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, "they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible," in an emergency situation, Li said. "That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack," he added. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose. "If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse," said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU. However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of "put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really "driverless" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel? Instead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.

Thomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program. "It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport," von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. Von der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. At the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. Customers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. Vay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. The startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said. Inside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat. Vincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride. To deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. There were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office. Vay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber. Von der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride. Users are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym. When Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25. When asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure. Von der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle. "So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price," he said. Vay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia. While von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features. "We're not in competition with them," von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators. Since its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO. "It's extremely busy today already," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIJING — An Alibaba-backed AI startup is currently being valued at $4.8 billion in a fresh funding round, two people with knowledge of the deal said, just weeks after it was valued at $4.3 billion. Moonshot AI is the company behind the Kimi chatbot, which surged in popularity in China months before DeepSeek's release last year. Since Moonshot's previous in December, rival Chinese AI companies — Zhipu and MiniMax — surged after going public in Hong Kong. The sources told CNBC that Moonshot was closing a funding round that will value it at least $500 million higher than the December round. Both asked to remain anonymous while discussing private information. Moonshot AI had not responded to a request for comment as this article went live. The sources added that the company could be valued even higher in subsequent rounds that could follow, due to a surge of interest in Chinese AI IPO candidates. Chinese AI companies have particularly boomed as U.S. AI chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, aren't officially available in mainland China. Beijing restricts access to many U.S.-based internet services, while American companies have faced growing restrictions from the White House on doing business with China. IDG, Alibaba and Tencent participated in it, according to Chinese financial news outlet LatePost. Moonshot AI has not commented on any plans for an IPO. Zhipu, listed under the name Knowledge Atlas, had a market value of $13 billion as of Monday's close, according to Wind Information data. MiniMax was worth $15.2 billion, the data showed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped. U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024. Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines. "The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well," he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically. He said he believes the company should "stay together" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands. Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution. Investors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his "Dare Forward 2030" business plan. U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers. Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles. "In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need," he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold and silver surged to fresh highs just days after breaking previous records, as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid a choppy geopolitical and economic ‍outlook. U.S. gold futures for February delivery rose 1.71% to $4,674.20 per ounce on Monday, after earlier hitting a record high last week. It comes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods from eight European countries until a deal for "the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," as he ramps up his rhetoric on annexing the Arctic island. "Gold's rally has been powerful, but it has also been grounded in fundamentals that are still very much in place. With real rates likely to fall and central banks continuing to diversify their reserves, we see more reason for gold to consolidate or edge higher than to sell off sharply," George Cheveley, natural resources portfolio manager at Ninety One, said in the asset manager's 2026 sectoral outlook, published on Monday. At current prices, margins are expected to be four to five times higher than in 2024, per the outlook. Silver followed gold's upward swing and looks comfortable at such prices. U.S. silver futures for March advanced to a record $93.035 per ounce and were last seen 5.06% higher at $93.02. Silver's spot price was 3.55% higher at $93.16 per ounce. Gold and silver tend to perform well in periods of heightened uncertainty as riskier assets, such as equities, fall out of favor. European and Asia-Pacific markets mostly slipped on Monday as investors assessed geopolitical threats. Shares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers and key luxury goods names fell on Monday morning as investors digest possible tariffs on European countries. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index was 2.2% lower in early dealmaking, while the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 index 2.9% lower. European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader economic counter-measures. The Justice Department's criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may also be rattling markets as investors weigh up the long-term impact of Trump's war of words aimed at pressuring it to lower interest rates. Other base metals also gained but were driven by megatrends rather than geopolitics. Copper in particular has an "attractive" risk-reward profile thanks to demand from energy and data center infrastructure, per Cheveley. U.S. copper futures for March were last seen 0.54% higher at $5.8625 per ounce, paring gains from a Jan. 6. peak. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a rising wave of tariffs on several European allies, raising the alarm for industries and businesses across the region. Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, a part of the United States. The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said. European political leaders are set to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response, with retaliatory measures and broader punitive economic policies reportedly on the table. CNBC takes a look at some of the sectors expected to be the most exposed to Trump's tariff threats. Europe's car giants, which were hit hard by Trump's back-and-forth trade policies last year, are considered to be highly exposed once again. The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group were all trading more than 2.5% lower on Monday morning, with Milan-listed Stellantis last seen down by around 2.1%. Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, said Trump's tariffs clearly represent a negative development for Germany's economic outlook, a country traditionally seen as Europe's growth engine. "If we do get tariffs, and, of course, we have to see how the geopolitical situation pans out, then … the chemicals, industrials, autos sectors, these will be the most impacted, which directly feeds to German growth," Kumar told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday. Luxury stocks were seen as largely sheltered from U.S.-EU trade tensions in the first quarter of last year, given their robust pricing power and ability to pass on added costs to consumers. Analysts warned at the time, however, that the prospect of tariffs ushering in a broader economic downturn could have spillover effects, even for the wealthiest shoppers. Alongside seven other European countries, Trump's proposed tariffs single out France, which is home to the likes of industry bellwether LVMH and Kering. Luxury groups, including Switzerland's Richemont, Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, and Britain's Burberry, were also trading lower. EU exports of pharma products to the U.S. came in at 84.4 billion euros ($98.1 billion) during the first three quarters of last year, ahead of machinery and mechanical parts (68.3 billion euros) and organic chemicals (66.3 billion euros) over the same period, according to Eurostat data. Some of the sector's biggest European names fell slightly on Trump's latest tariff threats on Monday morning. Denmark's Novo Nordisk was 2.1% lower, Switzerland's Roche dipped 0.3% lower, and France's Sanofi fell 0.9% during early deals. Europe's oil and gas stocks could also be indirectly impacted by Trump's latest tariff threats, due to factors such as weaker global demand, lower crude prices and increased supply chain costs. Oil prices were last seen trading slightly lower amid heightened concerns of a trade war between the U.S. and Europe — and what this could mean for global demand. Ozan Özkural, founder and managing partner at Tanto Capital, said Trump's latest tariff threats should not have been unexpected, warning of a broad impact for European sectors. I think this is going to be the sort of year that we are going to talk a lot more about what it means not to have the U.S. play ball with the traditional allies," Özkural told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday. "It's going to have an impact on oil prices, commodity prices, equity markets, debt markets, private credit. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for cool heads as tensions rise between Washington and its European allies after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose fresh tariffs on a number of countries if they block his bid to buy the Arctic territory. In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future. "On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies," Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence. "But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone," he added. Over the weekend, Starmer said that the U.K.'s position on Greenland was clear, although he, like other European leaders, also looked to appease Trump by saying NATO allies should do more together to address Russian threats across the Arctic. "Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes," Starmer said in a statement released by the British government on Saturday. "Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration," he added. Trump contends that U.S. ownership of Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, would make the world safer and deter Russia and Chinese activity in the Arctic island. Moscow and Beijing have dismissed his claims while European leaders insist that Greenland's future is a matter for the island and Denmark. European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory levies and wider economic counter-measures against the U.S. but the U.K. has traditionally held off from threatening counter-tariffs. Starmer said again on Monday that the use of tariffs to resolve such an issue was "completely wrong" and was not "the right way to resolve differences within an alliance. "A trade war is in no one's interest," he said. Still, the PM is known to have a warm and friendly relationship with Trump, despite their political differences. The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. That relationship matters profoundly, not just to our security, but to the prosperity and stability that people here depend upon ... we're determined to keep that relationship strong, constructive and focused on results," Starmer said Monday. But, at a time when "events are moving fast," he said that "what matters most is being clear about the values and motives that drive us."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European states are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened fresh export levies, deepening a rift over Greenland. Trump announced Saturday that eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the mineral-rich island which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. The much-vaunted instrument is seen as a nuclear option when it comes to economic counter-measures as it could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region. Despite being seen as a "big bazooka" against Trump's tariffs playbook, it has not been used before, and regional leaders have already said they want to pursue dialogue with the U.S. in the coming days to resolve the rift over Greenland. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the European Parliament will likely now suspend its work on the EU-U.S. trade deal struck last July. The assembly had been due to vote on removing many EU import duties on U.S. goods on Jan. 26-27, but that approval could now be delayed, Reuters reported. French Finance Minister Roland Lescure said Monday that the EU "must be prepared" to use its anti-coercion mechanism, in comments translated by Reuters. While France is more gung-ho about the ACI, Germany is among the countries that have tended to shy away from using it before. "The key question to watch is whether the EU will try to keep the confrontation confined to such a more "classic" trade war, or whether calls for a harsher line prevail," Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in emailed comments. "Representing the latter camp, France has called on its partners to formally invoke the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument ... [but] other EU member states, including Germany, will likely remain careful." The reasons for this divide are multifaceted, Nickel noted, including factors such as France traditionally advocating for a more independent European role in continental security, and it being less export-dependent than other nations like Germany. European leaders were quick to react to Trump's surprise tariff threat, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that "applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong," while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as "unacceptable." Nonetheless, leaders are expected to use the World Economic Forum taking place in Davos, Switzerland, this week, as an opportunity to try to talk to Trump, who is addressing the forum on Wednesday. Economists warn that, much like last year when months of wrangling took place before a trade deal was signed between the U.S. and EU, this spring will likely be dominated by similarly thorny discussions over Greenland. "My base case is that the Feb. 1 [tariffs] deadline is going to be postponed as diplomatic measures are implemented," Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, told CNBC Monday. "That said, I think this is different from the usual TACO [Trump Always Chickens Out] trade. But what Trump has shown is that he wants Greenland. I don't see how the issue is going to go away that soon. So we are looking at months, or potentially quarters, of uncertainty over tariffs. Growth will be reduced," he warned, ahead of what could be a frantic market day for European bourses on Monday, with regional indexes looking set to slump at the open.

In my early 30s, I was working long hours as the editor in chief of a magazine, juggling deadlines and the looming "should we have kids?" "Come back to manage a new launch later this year." My plan for a year off collapsed into two months. It began quietly in India at a yoga retreat near Kerala and ended with an adventure in Indonesia, climbing Mount Bromo and motorbiking through Yogyakarta. I was an established professional stepping away when the stakes were high. Extended time off can carry long-term costs — lower earnings, disrupted savings, slower compounding — but for some, the benefits outweigh the risks. David Burkus, an organizational psychologist and author, began researching sabbaticals in 2015. "People report better mental and physical health, increased confidence, and a greater sense of purpose after an extended break," Burkus told Business Insider. He also notes the benefits for employers: Teams cross-train, share knowledge, and become less dependent on a few "indispensable" people. Paid sabbaticals are still a rarity in the US. Society for Human Resource Management data showed that 5% of companies offered them in 2019, rising to 7% by 2023. And despite employers not rolling them out broadly, employees are increasingly seeking time off. In SHRM's 2025 benefits survey, leave was the second-highest priority for workers — trailing only health benefits — for the fourth year in a row. All interviewees said they came back as better leaders. DJ DiDonna, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and coauthor of the study, says everyone he interviewed wished they had taken one earlier.
