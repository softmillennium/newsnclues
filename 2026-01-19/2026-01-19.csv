            Speaker Mike Johnson is actively working to unite his conference behind another Republican-only policy bill ahead of the midterms, with members clamoring for more wins and eager not to waste what they fear could be the waning days of their majority.
    


            Despite facing one of the smallest House margins in history, Johnson has outlined an extraordinarily aggressive legislative plan for 2026 that, if successful, Republicans believe could help preserve their fragile hold on the chamber next year — and potentially protect the speaker's own political survival. And the Louisiana Republican is moving quickly, telling CNN he held a “productive” meeting last week with key chairmen and has spoken with Senate GOP Leader John Thune in recent days.
    


            “We want to use all the tools that we have in the arsenal. And I'm very bullish, very optimistic. I think we can do something,” he said last week, discussing the prospect of Republicans passing a party-line package under a process known as reconciliation.



            Johnson has instructed chairmen to come up with a menu of ideas they'd like to see in another GOP economic bill. But whether the bill is focused on health care, tax policy or further deficit reduction is still not clear. And it will be difficult for Johnson to start cobbling together a new bill when he is still constantly quelling internal fights about GOP priorities on the floor and begging members to show up for votes with no room to spare in their narrow margin. Last week alone, GOP leaders lost a floor vote they didn't even realize was in trouble and were forced to pull several other measures from their agenda.
    


            Johnson's agenda 2.0 plan is a long-shot effort that comes with no shortage of potential downsides for him and for the party. Trying and failing — like Republicans did with their Obamacare repeal effort in 2017 ahead of Trump's last midterm — could highlight GOP ineptitude just months before the election. And conservatives are already telegraphing they want to see significant cuts to a federal budget that moderates are struggling to defend on the campaign trail.
    


            “You never know ‘til you try,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy said. “If you spend half your time in Congress and half your time running … that's stupid.”
    


            Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio is another fiscal hawk with big dreams of enacting across-government cuts in the style of the Department of Government Efficiency in the next bill. But he also offered a reality check: “We barely had the votes to defund NPR. I don't know how aggressively we'll be able to reform some of the things.”
    


            Many Republicans agree that choosing not to use a legislative tool that allows them to pass conservative bills with just their own party's votes would be a major waste in a GOP-controlled Congress. But that is where the agreement ends.
    


            GOP lawmakers acknowledge it will be much more difficult to deliver another package after Congress passed Trump's tax break, spending cuts and immigration bill last year. To start, there is no clear idea of what the bill would include. One major faction of House Republicans, known as the Republican Study Committee, is pushing for housing policies and an expansion of health care savings, which they say would also cut $1 trillion from the federal deficit. They even have a name: “Making the American Dream Affordable Again.”
    


            “I think we have some really good proposals that leadership is looking at, that's in line with what the president wants to do, some creative ideas,” the group's chairman, Rep. August Pfluger of Texas, told CNN, saying the ideas have vast support among the American people, not just GOP voters. “I think we're going to get some Democrats eventually to say, yeah, those are good ideas. … There's a lot of legislative proposals that truly are 80-20 issues.”
    


            Other conservatives are pushing their Senate colleagues to relitigate a series of messy fights they already lost on pieces of the first bill that were deemed out of compliance with strict Senate rules, such as immigration policy.
    


            And there isn't even consensus on whether Johnson should attempt another party-line push at all.
    


            Multiple centrist Republicans told CNN they're more interested in bipartisan wins and have told the speaker directly. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he would rather see a bipartisan immigration bill or a debt commission, adding: “I just think it creates a very polarized environment. I think it's bad to lean on it.”
    


            Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he'd rather the GOP sit down and “really regroup,” and then focus on issues like health care that he thinks the party has been ignoring.
    


            “I pray to God we don't do something stupid,” Van Drew said when asked about a possible second Trump agenda bill. “I don't give a damn how many reconciliation bills you do unless it's going to have a health care component to it.”
    


            House GOP leaders are aware of the hurdles. But they are also feeling immense pressure from many in their conference, who have been frustrated by months of slow legislating, including a lengthy shutdown that kept members out of town for 43 days. GOP leaders are also driven to shield the president from being perceived as a lame duck. Many are also increasingly worried about their party's fate in the November elections, as voters warn that Trump isn't doing enough to shore up the economy.
    


            Still, one top Republican, Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, acknowledged that fears over losing the House majority isn't enough to unite the conference behind a bill.
    


            “You still have to get votes. We can't just deem it as passed. So, if everybody comes along and says, ‘We agree with what's being put in the bill,' that would be awesome,” Hern said.
    


            Hern said the biggest concern for leadership will be: “Do we have enough in there that satisfies everybody?”
    


            And this time, Johnson is dealing with a House margin that will require perfect unity within his famously unruly conference. The sudden death of one colleague and the abrupt resignation of former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have left the speaker with almost no room to maneuver — and a special election in Texas is expected to send another Democrat to the House in just two weeks.
    


            There is also no guarantee that any House effort would have a future in the Senate, where Thune has had to contend with his own unpredictability among his conference. That includes Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who is now fully entrenched in her reelection fight in a Democratic-leaning state, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who was a very hard-fought yes vote for Thune the first time around.
    


            There are also concerns that the GOP hasn't yet done a good enough job of selling the bill it passed last year. There is fear among GOP lawmakers that the signature policy bill of Trump's second term, which the president dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” has been struggling to land with voters. Johnson and his leadership team have been repeatedly stressing to their members that they need to better sell the package back home.
    


            Voters, they argue, are still understanding the impact of the massive piece of legislation that included broad tax cuts for Americans as well as big changes to tighten access to Medicaid and food stamps that conservatives cheered. The bill largely extended tax cuts Trump passed in his first term — and showing voters the benefit of not losing the tax breaks has been harder than expected to campaign on, some have acknowledged.
    


            Republicans who are facing tough reelection fights are among the most vocal in pushing for another big Trump package, arguing it would help them to expand their list of legislative wins.
    


            “I think maybe it would relieve some of President Trump's frustration with the filibuster and demonstrate we can actually get things done,” said Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is in the fight of his political life in a three-way primary in Texas.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to join US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza, his spokesman said on Monday.
    


            Speaking to reporters during a regular media briefing, Dmitry Peskov said: “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace.”
    


            He said the Kremlin is now reviewing the invitation and “hoping to get more details from the US side.”
    


            CNN has asked the White House for a comment.
    


            Later on Monday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said President Alexander Lukashenko also received an invitation to join the board.
    


            The ministry's press service said Minsk “highly appreciates that the American side sees Belarus – and this is clearly stated in the text of the address – as a country ready to take on the noble responsibility of building a lasting peace and leading by example, investing in a secure and prosperous future for future generations.”
    


            Lukashenko is Putin's closest ally and has been described as Europe's last dictator.
    


            The establishment of the board, chaired by Trump, is a key step in the United Nations-backed American plan to demilitarize and rebuild Gaza, which was ravaged by two years of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group.
    


            However, signs of discontent have already started to appear. Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee issued a statement on Sunday warning that the body proposed by Trump “would have a mandate wider than the implementation of the Gaza Peace Plan.”
    


            “The United Nations has a unique mandate to maintain international peace and security, and the legitimacy to bring nations together to find common solutions to shared challenges. While it may be imperfect, the UN and the primacy of international law is more important now than ever,” she said in a statement.
    


            Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            Trump has also invited Israel to join the board as a founding member state, a senior Israeli official told CNN on Monday. According to the official, the invitation was extended to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or another Israeli representative on his behalf.
    


            It is unclear how many invitations have been sent out – the information about which countries and global leaders have been asked to join has been coming from the individual states, rather than the White House.
    


            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Argentinian President Javier Milei and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also received invitations to join, according to statements from them or their offices. The US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, said India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also invited to join.
    


            Some of the leaders, including Orbán, have shared the invitation letters publicly. They show that, while Trump addressed the letters personally to the leaders, he was inviting their country to join the board as a “founding state.”
    


            Members of the committee will receive a permanent seat if they pay $1 billion, according to a US official, who told CNN that, while there was no requirement to contribute funds to the board, members who do not make the $1 billion payment will have a three-year term.
    


            All funds raised will go toward rebuilding Gaza, the official said, adding that “there will not be exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat that plagues many other international organizations.”
    


            Putin's appointment to the board would mark an extraordinary return to the global stage for the Russian leader, who has been mostly shunned from international cooperation projects since he ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            The Kremlin's involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been limited, although it did offer to mediate soon after the war started, touting its ties to both Israel and Hamas.
    


            Unlike many Western countries, Russia does not officially consider Hamas to be a terror group. Senior Hamas leaders visited Moscow just weeks after the militant group launched the October 7 terror attacks against Israel, despite the fact that at least 20 Russian citizens were killed or kidnapped in the attacks.
    


            In 2024, Palestinian factions, some of whom had been at odds for almost two decades, met in Moscow. The Russian state news agency TASS reported earlier this month that the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas was set to visit Russia later this week.

            The US Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.
    


            A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.
    


            The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.
    


            US Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”
    


Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mobilizes state National Guard amid ongoing protests



            “A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.
    


            Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
    


            “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,” said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.”
    


            The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.
    


            Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.
    


            Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.
    


Aftermath video of latest ICE shooting involving a man officials say assaulted an officer contradicts officials' account



            In a January 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents “knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.”
    


            “Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,” the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. “They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.”
    


            Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.
    


            “If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?” Cullars-Doty said. “We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.”

The EU has embraced a “potentially high-risk new geopolitical dependency” on natural gas from the US by ramping up imports, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The warning comes as relations between Brussels and Washington have sunk to an all-time low amid tensions over Greenland.

The Ohio-based think tank calculated that the US could supply up to 80% of the bloc's imports of liquified natural gas (LNG) by 2030. It noted that the EU's LNG imports rose almost fourfold between 2021 and 2025, despite the American option being the most expensive.

The new reliance follows a gradual phasing out of pipeline gas from Russia, once the biggest supplier, following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 and ensuing sanctions.

The confrontation between Brussels and Washington over Greenland intensified last week when US President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff, starting February 1, on imports from eight European NATO nations which oppose his bid to acquire the island, warning of a further increase if no deal is reached. 

Trump has long sought American control over the autonomous Danish territory, arguing that the island is critical to US defense against hypothetical threats from Russia and China.

The US president has been using energy as a key bargaining tool in trade negotiations. As part of a deal announced last July, the EU agreed to buy $750 billion worth of US energy products by 2028 in order to avoid higher tariffs.

The commitment was widely criticized as coercive, unachievable, and detrimental to the bloc's climate goals. IEEFA calculated that if the same sum were spent on renewables instead, it could provide enough combined solar and wind capacity to boost energy security and bring down electricity prices.

The sharp reduction of comparatively inexpensive Russian pipeline gas imports after 2022 has triggered an energy crisis in the EU, inflicting lasting economic harm on the bloc, sending wholesale energy prices soaring, increasing the cost of living and damaging industrial competitiveness.

Russia maintains that it is still a reliable supplier, while denouncing Western sanctions as illegal under international law. The country has successfully shifted exports to ‘friendly' markets.

Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev will meet with the US delegation on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Reuters has reported, citing informed sources.

Axios correspondent Barak Ravid claimed in a post on X that Dmitriev will hold talks with US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and the American leader's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in the Swiss city on Tuesday. The sides will discuss the US president's plan to settle the Ukraine conflict, according to Ravid's sources.

The Russian Embassy in Switzerland said last week that it has not received any official invitations addressed to Russian officials, business people or journalists to attend the event in Davos. The country's representatives have been barred from WEF since the escalation between Moscow and Kiev in 2022.

Dmitriev has visited the US several times since Trump took office a year ago, where he has negotiated ways to restore bilateral ties and stop the fighting between Moscow and Kiev. His latest trip took place in December, when he held two days of talks with Witkoff and Kushner. Both sides described the talks as “constructive.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that the Russian authorities are looking forward to another visit by Witkoff and Kushner to Moscow. The date has not yet been set, Peskov noted. Bloomberg claimed earlier, citing sources, that the trip could happen this month.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Witkoff six times in 2025, according to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Kiev's top negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Sunday that talks with the Americans on finding a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict will continue at the World Economic Forum (WEF), which is being held between Monday and Friday.

Trump, who addressed the WEF via video link in 2025, is expected to attend the high-profile gathering in person this time.

Last week, Trump said that he believes Zelensky is responsible for stalling the peace process. “I just think he's... having a hard time getting there. I think [Putin] is ready to make a deal… I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”

In his address to foreign ambassadors on Thursday, Putin said that Moscow “seeks a lasting sustainable peace [with Ukraine] that secures safety for each and every one.” He warned previously that Russia is capable of achieving all its goals through military means if Kiev continues to reject diplomacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump doubles down on ‘Russian threat' to Greenland","https://www.rt.com/news/631145-trump-greenland-russia-threat/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:05:00 GMT","

US President Donald Trump has said Washington will deter a supposed Russian threat to Greenland, claiming that Danish authorities have ignored warnings about the alleged risk for two decades. Moscow has repeatedly stressed it has no interest in the autonomous Danish territory.

Writing on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump stated that “NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”

His statement followed a discussion with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who confirmed on Saturday that he had spoken with Trump “regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic.” Although Rutte did not provide details of the discussion, he stated the two would continue working on the issue.

Last week, Trump announced 10% tariffs on eight European NATO nations – Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland – for opposing his bid to acquire Greenland and sending small military contingents to the island. He stated the tariffs, set to begin February 1, would rise to 25% in June until a “complete and total purchase” is achieved.

European leaders have rejected the pressure as “blackmail” and an assault on sovereignty. In a joint statement, the eight targeted nations called the tariff threats an effort to “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” The EU is preparing a retaliatory trade package and has affirmed its “full solidarity” with Denmark.

Trump has long framed the acquisition of Greenland – which has a population of around 57,000 but is 2.17 million square kilometers in size – as a national security imperative to counter Russia and China in the Arctic – a claim officials in Copenhagen, Beijing, and Moscow have consistently dismissed as baseless.

Russia, which has a huge Arctic presence but is located thousands of kilometers from Greenland, has called the situation around Trump's annexation plans “extraordinary” while noting that it recognizes the island as Danish territory. 

At the same time, Moscow has condemned NATO's accelerated militarization of the Arctic, warning that any actions that disregard Russia's interests in the region would have “negative consequences.”

MINSK, January 19. /TASS/. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has asserted that, in the post-war era, only Russia and Belarus will have a vested interest in Ukraine's future. Speaking during a meeting with Kirov Region Governor Alexander Sokolov, Lukashenko emphasized that the resolution of the conflict is within reach.

""We will resolve the war,"" he stated confidently. ""This opportunity is greater than ever, regardless of how much the Ukrainians resist now."" He urged Ukrainians to recognize that the issue is not merely about territorial gains. ""People will decide where they need to live. Territory itself does not determine anything. Ukraine should understand this – rather than destroying thousands of lives daily and forcing millions to flee, this must be the main consideration.""

Lukashenko also warned Kiev that, once the special military operation concludes, its current international partners are unlikely to offer assistance. ""No one but us will support Ukraine in the post-war period,"" he declared. He further predicted that the United States ""will shift its focus to Iran, Yemen, or Taiwan and neglect Ukraine altogether.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin marked Orthodox Epiphany with a traditional icy dip, his press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.

""Vladimir Putin took an icy plunge, as he does every year,"" he told reporters. ""Naturally, Epiphany is a great holiday for him, as for all Orthodox believers who work in the Kremlin.""

""This is a tradition and many honor it,"" Peskov noted. ""However, some don't do this. This is a personal matter.""

Immersing in ice-cold water on Epiphany is not bravado for 73-year-old Putin. This is a tribute to cultural and, in a sense, Christian tradition. The president is known to be a religious man. In addition, he is in excellent physical shape and can afford practicing customs that are extreme for most ordinary people without risk to his health.

The Kremlin first reported that the president had taken part in Epiphany bathing in 2018. Back then, Putin was on a trip to St. Petersburg. He plunged into an ice hole at Lake Seliger while visiting the Nilov Monastery in the Tver Region. Peskov explained then that it was not the first experience of Epiphany bathing for the president. Putin, in his words, took part in Epiphany events ""in a more private environment.""

Since then, the president's plans for January 19 have been the focus of public interest fueled by videos released by the Kremlin press service in 2021, featuring the Russian president, wearing a sheepskin coat and felt boots, approaching a cross-shaped ice hole, crossing himself, and immersing himself in ice-cold water.

According to official reports, since then, Putin took part in Epiphany bathing in the Moscow Region, skipping only 2020 and 2022. In 2020, he was barred from doing this by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2022 he was recommended by medics and the church to avoid the epidemiological situation.

The tradition of plunging into a cross-shaped ice hole on Epiphany symbolizes the Baptism of the Lord in the Jordan. While visiting Jordan in 2007, President Putin immersed his hands in the waters of the river and visited the place where John the Baptist met the Savior. During his next visit to Jordan in 2012, Putin took part in the opening ceremony of the Russian Guest House near the site of Jesus Christ's baptism.

Epiphany bathing organized in Russia overnight on January 19 is rather a popular tradition than a church rite. The Orthodox Church, however, generally approves of this tradition if it is treated with reverence and poses no health risks.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

EU should issue ‘smart' response to US president's threat of tariffs against several countries, say business leaders

Could the EU hit back with its ‘big bazooka'?

Europe live – latest updates

European industry has hit back at Donald Trump's “ludicrous demands” to hand over Greenland or face a trade war.

A fresh round of tariffs on European exports would cost Germany and Europe dearly, the president of the German auto industry association has said, as he called for a “smart” response coordinated by Brussels.

“The costs of these additional tariffs would be enormous for German and European industry, especially in these already challenging times,” said Hildegard Müller, the president of the VDA trade organisation.

“What is crucial now is a smart, strategic response from Brussels that is coordinated with the countries affected,” she added.

Trump's shock threat on Saturday to impose additional tariffs of 10% in February with a further 25% in June have derailed a period of relative transatlantic trade calm after the EU-US agreement struck at the US president's Scottish golf course last July.

European leaders are expected to meet in Brussels on Thursday for an emergency summit to discuss the prospect of imposing counter-tariffs on US exports on 7 February that would hit everything from liquid gas to aircraft and machinery.

The German engineering trade group, whose members include vital tool machine exporters, urged the EU to face Trump down. “If the EU gives in here, it will only encourage the US president to make the next ludicrous demand and threaten further tariffs,” said Bertram Kawlath, the president of the German engineering association VDMA.

The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) said it was wrong of Trump to link the economies to political ambitions. “Highly controversial political goals are being tied to economic sanctions in an unacceptable manner,” said Volker Treier, a member of the DIHK executive board.

On Monday the EU struck a diplomatic note, calling for calm on all sides as leaders tried to work among themselves and with the White House to avert the crisis over Greenland spiralling into a full-on trade war in two weeks' time.

Manufacturers have been scrambling to work out whether try to get more products into the US before the tariffs, as they were forced to do in April last year when Trump announced his “liberation day” levies. However, one senior figure in the UK automotive industry said the short deadline meant there was limited time to rush cars into the US before the levies.

An executive at a large carmaker that exports to the US said they were “reaching for the same golf bag and pulling out the same clubs again”, although they were still in “wait and see” mode given the lack of formal direction on how tariffs will be implemented – or whether they are a merely an opening negotiating tactic.

The carmaker is considering how it can “play for time” in the hope that talks between governments will avert the threat, the person said. “We did not see that one coming,” they added.

Stephen Davies, the chief executive of the Welsh whisky maker Penderyn, which exports to 20 states in the US, said the tariffs would add more costs than could be absorbed. “It's just not going to work,” he said.

He added: “People will disappear from the market and just hold fire until conditions get better. But you've been working for years building reputation and building product knowledge with consumers and you don't want to stop doing that.”

Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said Trump's tariffs “threaten to take a wrecking ball to key British manufacturing sectors and jobs”. “That's why [the British] government must continue to prioritise a closer trading relationship with the EU. It's common sense in an increasingly volatile and unpredictable global economy that we forge stronger ties with our closest neighbours and largest trading partner.”

A senior steel executive said the UK industry had reached an “equilibrium” on US trade, with customers accepting the previous 25% tariffs. The prospect of another 10% will force exporters to restart negotiations over who bears the costs – with either the US importer paying the tariff, or the exporter forced to cut prices.

It was too late to try to rush products over the Atlantic before 1 February, with lead times and shipping times measured in weeks, said another steel industry source. “There will be a lot of instability with the customers,” the person said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Data shows 133% increase from 2017 to 2025 as anti-ICE and No Kings protests push mobilization against White House

In the year since Donald Trump retook office, the number of protests in the US outpaced those at the same point in his first administration, according to data from the Crowd Counting Consortium, an open-source project collaboration between Harvard University's Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut.

There were more than 10,700 protests in 2025, a 133% increase from the 4,588 recorded in 2017, the first year of Trump's first term. According to the data, an overwhelming majority of US counties – including 42% that voted for Trump – have had at least one protest since he was re-inaugurated last year.

“It is a very historic time, in the sense that people are mobilizing where they live in ways that I don't think I have seen before in my lifetime,” said Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard Kennedy School and co-director of the Crowd Counting Consortium.

From protests for trans youth healthcare at the beginning of in 2025, to protests against US support of Israel in Gaza and “Tesla takedowns” against Elon' Musk's efforts to dismantle the federal government in the spring, to anti-ICE protests as federal agents raided US cities over the summer and into the fall and winter, Americans took to the streets to show their resistance to the Trump administration's policies. That meant more protests in general, as well as highly attended, coordinated, single-day protests such as the No Kings and Hands Off protests, Chenoweth said.

Typically, they said, flash points of protest have been localized to big cities or a march on Washington. “We're not seeing that,” they said. “We're seeing very diffused protest mobilization all around the country.”

The diversity of locations, especially in red and rural corners such as Cut Bank, Montana, and Sparta, North Carolina, shows that the movements defy stereotypes around where protest happens. “It definitely cuts against the narrative that protest is confined to major cities, to the coasts, and to predominantly liberal areas where it doesn't change anybody's mind,” said Chenoweth.

During Trump's first term, there were a few major spikes in protest: the 2018 student walkouts following the Parkland high school shooting, the summer 2018 protests over immigrant family separations, and the 2020 uprisings over the killing of George Floyd – thought to be possibly the largest recorded protest movement in US history. Chenoweth said spikes last spring (pro-Palestine, anti-ICE and No Kings protests) and in October (No Kings) come close to those numbers.

That trend of broadly dispersed, nonviolent protesting has carried forward into 2026, as anti-ICE mobilizations continue in cities across the US. After Minneapolis protests broke out following the killing of Renee Good during an ICE interaction on 7 January, coalitions of groups rapidly planned and held a “weekend of action” with more than 1,000 participating protests.

“What's really notable now is how much grassroots, improvised and then organized response there is to ICE operations,” said Chenoweth. “The defining feature of [the Minneapolis ICE] protests is absolutely focused on that issue and sense of outrage, and just finding unbearable and intolerable, the way the administration is approaching this.”

Over a decade ago, Chenoweth's research, studying a data set of more than 300 nonviolent protest movements between 1900 and 2006, found that no government has ever overcome a nonviolent movement that involved at least 3.5% of its population. However, Chenoweth cautions that this is not a prescriptive rule.

When asked if the US is at a tipping point akin to that number, they replied, “I would think about it more as an inflection point,” noting that public opinion is shifting.

Most importantly, said Chenoweth, growing protest movements can give people hope and “a sense of agency” in a situation where they feel powerless: “That's a very important thing for people to feel and internalize when the more dominant narrative is otherwise.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Fear, abuse and eroding rights have forced many trans people to leave the US – can they claim asylum in the Netherlands?

The transgender refugees fleeing the US – podcast

Ter Apel, a small, unassuming Dutch town near the German border, is a place tourists rarely have on their itinerary. There are no lovely old windmills, no cannabis-filled coffee shops and on a recent visit it was far too early for tulip season.

When foreigners end up there, it is for one reason: to claim asylum at the Netherlands' biggest refugee camp, home to 2,000 desperate people from all around the world.

Some, like the Eritreans and Somalis, are fleeing war; the Syrians insist it remains unsafe for them to return home after the fall of Assad. But in the last year they have been joined by a curious new cohort: a bunch of Americans, who say they have feared for their lives ever since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Their presence has surprised many of the camp's residents. “My dream is to go to America or the UK. America for me is the paradise,” said Usama, a 21-year-old Libyan-Algerian hanging around the main gate. “You can work, you can make a million if you have a good idea. Why they come here?”

It is a fair question. Last year, 76 Americans claimed asylum in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch asylum and immigration ministry, up from nine in 2024. Unlike the UK, the Netherlands does not rent out hotels or houses for asylum seekers, instead housing them in fenced-off camps, officially called reception centres, dotted around the country.

Many of the American refugees, like Jane-Michelle Arc, a 47-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, are transgender. In April last year she flew into Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and, sobbing, asked a customs officer how to claim asylum. “And they laughed because: what's this big dumb American doing here asking about asylum? And then they realised I was serious.”

Arc said the US had become such a hostile environment for trans people that she had stopped leaving the house “unless there was an Uber waiting outside”. She said she had been abused on the street and using the ladies' toilets, and resolved to leave the country after a frightening incident when she feared a woman was going to run her over with her truck.

The customs officer gave her a train ticket to Ter Apel and told to report to the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND). The first few days were hard, holed up in a 2 metre-square room covered with graffiti and what she feared were body fluids on the walls. In some ways she was lucky to be indoors: at least once in recent years the camp has been so overcrowded that new arrivals have had to sleep in tents outside.

Ter Apel is not a prison, but it looks a little bit like one, surrounded by fences, with guards on every gate. Residents are free to come and go but must be in their rooms each morning for a bed check. After their first few days in the central reception area, asylum seekers are dispersed to different low-rise blocks, where they are given a small food allowance so they can cook their own meals.

For Arc, that meant being transferred to what she calls “the queer block”, rather like a student halls of residence where all the LGBT asylum seekers are placed. There, she insists, sharing meals in the communal kitchens and over cigarettes outside, she found common ground.

They all feared the police as well as their governments and fellow citizens, she said. “We were in danger from the people around us. And in fact, all of us thought of America as a place we wanted to live in – a beautiful country of opportunities. And that's all still true, but it was surprising and sad and validating that the people there – a trans dude from Tehran and a trans woman from Libya – our stories were so similar.”

Arc knows how that might sound. “I hear a lot of people saying: ‘You are an idiot. You came here from America.' People will tell me: ‘Did you think about moving to California?' And then I say: ‘Well, I lived in San Francisco' and then they go: ‘Oh, that's a heaven for gay people.' But it's different for trans people, particularly for trans women, to the extent that my experience in San Francisco, robot taxis aside, was indistinguishable from [that of] the people that I knew from Libya and Iran and Morocco and Algeria.”

Trans men are also unsafe in the US, according to Ashe Wilde, another American who has been living in Ter Apel since the end of October. He transitioned in 2019 and anti-trans hate has only grown since then, he said, particularly with the return of Trump, who was re-elected using the attack ad: “Kamala Harris is for they/them. Trump is for you.”

In his very first speech on inauguration day, Trump declared: “As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the US government that there are only two genders – male and female.” He signed an executive order denouncing “ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex”, which effectively erased federal recognition of transgender identities.

“That was hugely shocking,” said Wilde, 40, “because Massachusetts is one of the most liberal states and one of states that's really trying to preserve our identities across the queer spectrum, and I was still met with pushback.” People increasingly equated transgenderism with paedophilia, he said: “I was called a paedo and a groomer.” There were physical altercations too, he claimed.

Arc began to transition at the end of 2012, changing her ID to female the following year and having bottom surgery in Thailand in 2014. Yet Trump's re-election meant no more anti-discrimination protections in their employment, housing, and healthcare. When her passport ran out, a new one would declare her a man again. So she left.

“This is the dumbest thing I've ever done,” she said in a Ter Apel cafe. “And I did it because I was afraid for my life. I didn't do this in secret. I talked to everybody I knew. I said: ‘I am planning to do this wildly stupid thing.' Everybody said: ‘I don't love this for you, but there is no other option.'”

She could have applied for a tech job in the Netherlands and then a work visa. But that would have taken too long, she said. Hence choosing the nuclear option of asylum, leaving everything behind to live in a grubby refugee camp. She estimates there are between 35 and 50 other trans asylum seekers from the US in the Netherlands, though the Dutch government does not keep statistics on transgender applicants.

The chances of Americans actually being granted asylum are very low, according to Marlou Schrover, a professor of economic and social history at Leiden University, who studies the Dutch immigration system.

The UN refugee convention has very strict conditions, said Shrover. Not only must a refugee prove that they faced persecution in their home country, but they must also show that they tried to get help from the local authorities but were denied protection. “And after that, you have to see if there is a safe flight alternative within your country.”

Even getting beaten up by the police is not enough: “Of course Afro-Americans might say: ‘Look, I'm beaten up in the street by police officers, so I can claim refugee status in the Netherlands' based on this. So the claim has to be really strong.”

For a claim to be successful, the US would have to start detaining trans people for their gender identity, suggested Shrover: “If the US moves towards putting people in prison, treating them really, really bad because of their [gender identity], and with no other claim added to the reasons why they're in prison, then the situation would definitely change.” But simply denying someone the right to put their chosen gender on their passport is nowhere near enough, she added.

The Dutch authorities are also very wary about declaring the US an unsafe country and provoking Trump, said Shrover. They think: ‘How will it look? How will the Americans respond to that? We can't do this to our most important ally, saying that they don't have a functioning democracy.'”

Only in exceptional cases have US passport holders been granted asylum, according to the Dutch ministry of asylum and migration. In recent years “a few dozen” children with US passports have been granted asylum in the Netherlands, mostly dependents of Yemeni, Turkish, and Syrian parents, a government spokesperson said.

So far, no American has been successful since arriving during Trump's second term. Among those refused and earmarked for deportation is Lisa Gayle Carter-Stewart, who fled Montana with her transgender teenager, 14-year-old Nox, last April.

“It was automatically rejected because America is considered a safe country of origin,” said Carter-Stewart. “Nox even told the IND during their interview when they asked, what will you do if you have to return to America? Nox told them: ‘I will kill myself.' None of that was considered in their decision-making process.”

Nox has tried to take their own life three times at Ter Apel, said Carter-Stewart. “They are not getting on well. Nox stays in our room 24-7. They don't go outside, not even on sunny days.” Still, she insists, Nox doesn't want to go home: “Nox has said they're glad we're not in the US any more.”

Earlier this month, they were moved to a more family-friendly refugee camp near Leiden as they await their appeal hearing. “I would love if we did get a residence permit, and I could work again, and we could get back to living a normal life, and want them to feel like it's OK for them to be themselves and to not feel judged every time they walk through a door,” she said.

Trans women fear a terrible fate if they are sent back to the US, said Arc. “My guess is that re-entering the US, we would be detained by ICE, or customs, we would be put into detention with men, and then that would lead to us being harmed or killed. And the method of execution is incarceration. I don't think that the US government wants to murder me specifically. I think that they don't care if I am murdered, and I think they think that I deserve it if I'm murdered in custody.”

For Wilde, a forced return means a forced detransition. Access to hormones has already become fraught in the US, he said: “Come 2027, there won't be access to it via government healthcare, so you'd only have it through private providers. So without the hormones, you're basically forced to de-transition. I can't go back to that … I've been free for the last five years, almost six years. I can't imagine trying to stuff myself back into that person that I used to be … I don't know about physically, but emotionally, mentally, spiritually, I would absolutely be dead.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

China's population last year fell for a fourth consecutive year as the birthrate plunged to a record low, official data showed yesterday, with experts warning of further decline.

The nation's population dropped by 3.39 million to 1.405 billion, a faster decline than 2024, while the total number of births dropped to 7.92 million last year, down 17 percent from 9.54 million in 2024. The number of deaths rose to 11.31 million from 10.93 million in 2024, Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed.

China's birthrate dropped to 5.63 per 1,000 people.

Births last year were “roughly the same level as in 1738, when China's population was only about 150 million,” said Yi Fuxian (易富賢), a demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

China's death rate of 8.04 per 1,000 people last year was the highest since 1968. China's population has been shrinking since 2022 and is aging rapidly, complicating Beijing's plan to boost domestic consumption and rein in debt.

The number of people aged 60 or older reached about 23 percent of the total population, the NBS data showed.

By 2035 the number of people aged 60 or older is set to hit 400 million — equal to the populations of the US and Italy combined — meaning hundreds of millions of people are set to leave the workforce at a time when pension budgets are already stretched.

China has already increased retirement ages, with men now expected to work until they are 63 rather than 60, and women until they are 58 rather than 55.

Marriages in China plunged by one-fifth in 2024, the biggest drop on record, with more than 6.1 million couples registering for marriage, down from 7.68 million in 2023.

Marriages are typically a leading indicator for birthrates in China.

Demographers say a decision in May last year to allow couples to marry anywhere in the country rather than only their place of residence is likely to lead to a temporary boost in births.

Marriages rose 22.5 percent from a year earlier to 1.61 million in the third quarter of last year.

Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Jay Tarriela and an embassy official had been trading barbs since last week over issues concerning the disputed South China Sea.

Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰)  yesterday greeted the nation's US trade negotiation team when they arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, commending them for the tariff reduction and investment agreements they reached with the US.

Led by Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君), and chief trade negotiator and Minister Without Portfolio Yang Jen-ni (楊珍妮), the team hashed out a “substantive” and “meaningful” deal with Washington, which was announced on Thursday, Cho told reporters at the airport.

Cheng said the trade agreement proved that “the hard work of the Taiwanese people, along with Taiwan's technology and industries, had become a key force in the world,” and showed that the world needs Taiwan.

The trade negotiation team returned after reaching a preliminary agreement with the US to reduce tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, and a commitment that Taiwanese semiconductor and technology companies would invest at least US$250 billion in the US.

The figure includes a US$100 billion investment pledge by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) last year, weeks after US President Donald Trump took office, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said on Friday.

That implied that TSMC's US$65 billion investment to build three advanced wafer fabs in Arizona prior to Trump's return to office last year was not taken into account.

Taiwan has also agreed to provide up to US$250 billion in credit guarantees for financial institutions to support investments  in the US market by the semiconductor industry, and the information and communication technology sector.

The terms of the agreement are to be signed in the coming weeks as part of a formal trade pact, which would require the approval of the Legislative Yuan.

Reactions to the agreement have been mixed, with some welcoming the tariff reduction from 20 percent to 15 percent — the same rate applied to Japan, South Korea and the EU. However, others — including members of the opposition —  have raised concerns that the deal could force companies such as TSMC to move too much of their production abroad, effectively “hollowing out” Taiwan.

The agreement does not include a timetable for when Taiwan's investments must be realized.

TSMC chief financial officer Wendell Huang (黃仁昭) said the company was accelerating its investments in Arizona because of high customer demand.

Even with its growing presence in the US, TSMC's most cutting-edge technology would remain in Taiwan for  “practical reasons,” Huang said, citing the intensive collaboration process between the company's research and development team and operations units.

The council is aware of incidents in which people who signed up through Chinese travel agencies for tours of Russia were told they could obtain Russian visas and fast-track border clearance, Chiu told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Taipei. 
However, the travel agencies actually applied

Among the changes, international students at Taiwanese universities would be able to work in Taiwan without a work permit in the two years after they graduate, explainer materials provided by the council said.
In addition, foreign nationals who graduated from one of the world's top 200 universities within the past five years can also apply for a two-year open work permit.
Previously, those graduates would have needed to apply for a work permit using point-based criteria or have a Taiwanese company                                    



                                                                                The Shilin District Prosecutors' Office yesterday indicted two Taiwanese and issued a wanted notice for Pete Liu (劉作虎), founder of Shenzhen-based smartphone manufacturer OnePlus Technology Co (萬普拉斯科技), for allegedly contravening the Act Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area (臺灣地區與大陸地區人民關係條例) by poaching 70 engineers in Taiwan. 
Liu allegedly traveled to Taiwan at the end of 2014 and met with a Taiwanese man surnamed Lin (林) to discuss establishing a mobile software research and development (R&D) team in Taiwan, prosecutors said.

Editor's note: The story has been updated with the latest details.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 19 that his administration would move to remove what he called a ""Russian threat"" to Greenland, arguing that ""Denmark has been unable to do anything about it.""

The comments come as Trump threatens to impose up to 25% tariffs on European countries that oppose his ambitions to annex Greenland, the world's largest island and semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally.

""NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'"" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. ""Now it is time, and it will be done!""

Trump has repeatedly staked his claim to the strategically valuable island, not ruling out the use of military force after Danish and Greenlandic authorities rejected his offer to buy it.

European leaders have hit back at Trump's threats and are reportedly drawing up their own economic countermeasures, including tariffs or restrictions on U.S. companies.

The escalating dispute is seen as the most serious rupture in transatlantic relations in a decade, a development openly praised by Russia.

Trump has justified his claim to the island on national security grounds and accused Danish authorities of insufficient investment in its defense, arguing it makes Greenland vulnerable to Russia and China. 

Washington already operates a military base on the island, and a 1951 treaty with Denmark grants it broad rights to station forces there.

European leaders have rejected the accusations and dispatched a small contingent of troops for exercises on the island last week.

In a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Trump reportedly linked his claim to Greenland to not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

""The world is not secure unless we have complete and total control of Greenland,"" Trump wrote, according to Bloomberg.

The U.S. president reiterated his stance in a phone interview with NBC News, once again declining to rule out military options. He also rebuked European leaders for pushing back on the matter.

""Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them,"" Trump told NBC News. ""That's what Europe should focus on — not Greenland.""

In private discussions with top aides, Trump has also complained about Canada's alleged inability to counter the Russian and Chinese threat in the Arctic region, NBC News reported, citing undisclosed sources.

While Trump previously also floated the idea of annexing Canada as the ""51st U.S. state,"" officials told NBC News that the U.S. president is not discussing purchasing the country's territory or seizing it by force.

Trump's warnings about the Russian threat contrast with his often conciliatory stance toward Moscow, especially in regard to the war in Ukraine. Only last week, the U.S. president declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks peace, accusing Kyiv of standing in the way despite ongoing talks on a peace deal between U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

Based in Lviv, Martin often reports on international politics, with a focus on analyzing developments related to Ukraine and Russia.  His career in journalism began in 2021 after graduating from Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, earning a Master's degree in Conflict and Democracy Studies. Martin has been invited to speak on Times Radio, France 24, Czech Television, and Radio Free Europe. He speaks English, Czech, and Ukrainian. 

The development is driven by a stronger ruble and low oil prices, according to the news agency's calculations.



Moscow is currently studying the proposal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to state news agency TASS. 

Chief of the Royal Danish Army Major General Peter Boysen will also deploy to the island alongside soldiers.



""NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'"" Trump said, accusing Denmark of being unable to counter it.

Czechia will not sell its L-159 light combat aircraft to Ukraine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Jan. 19, despite Czech President Petr Pavel advocating for the move.

Russia struck energy infrastructure overnight in “several regions,” cutting power in five oblasts as freezing temperatures add strain to Ukraine's grid, Deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said.


According to Axios reporter Barak Ravid, the Russian official will meet Trump's envoys, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, on Jan. 20 to discuss the Washington-backed peace plan for Ukraine.

Among the Russian air defense systems that endured ""destruction"" are S-300, S-350, and S-400 air defense systems, as well as Russian anti-aircraft missile systems BUK-M1 and BUK-M2, and Pantsir-S1 and Pantsir-S2 air defense systems, according to the SBU. 

Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures.



Ukrainian and U.S. officials will continue peace proposal discussions during the World Economic Forum in Davos, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said Jan. 18.

After quickly hitting the initial target, organizers raised the goal to 2 million zloty ($550,000) — a figure that has since been surpassed, with donations now exceeding 2.4 million zloty (around $660,000).

The European Union is preparing possible retaliation against the United States, including up to 93 billion euros ($101 billion) in tariffs or restrictions on U.S. companies operating in the bloc, amid escalating tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland, the Financial Times reported Jan. 18.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Ukraine's capital Kyiv, home to over 3 million people, has rarely been prepared for winter.

Frozen, icy sidewalks, bursting pipes, and year-long infrastructure collapse have been a key feature of the city under Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

Now, following Russia's Jan. 9 attack, Kyiv has been pushed into a humanitarian crisis, leaving residents without heating, hot water, and electricity through the coldest winter in years.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has been open about who he holds to blame. Zelensky called the situation in Kyiv ""especially difficult,"" slammed the local authorities, and compared the capital's readiness to that of other cities — heavily bombarded Kharkiv — saying they were better equipped to handle the consequences of Russian attacks.

""Kyiv, unfortunately, has done much less — far too little has been done in the capital. And even these past few days, I haven't seen sufficient effort — all of this must be urgently corrected,"" Zelensky said on Jan. 14.

Klitschko hit back, dismissing the accusations as ""groundless"" and politicized. He said the government had not coordinated any joint response to the crisis.

Experts, who spoke with the Kyiv Independent, said that while the capital has been poorly run overall, the responsibility for the ongoing crisis lies with both the central and local authorities.

""The city was not prepared,"" Victoria Voitsitska, member of the supervisory board of the We Build Ukraine think tank, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Lots of things could have been done. But it seems like everyone was looking at each other, prepared to blame the other party for the misgivings that ordinary people are going through right now.""

Zelensky's outbursts have also been expected. The president and the mayor have been in an open political conflict since 2019.

Observers see the back-and-forth as a power struggle for control over Ukraine's capital and its finances, while also pointing to Klitschko's presidential ambitions.

Zelensky's leverage over the city comes from Kyiv's unique status, both as a city and as a region. The mayor is elected and, historically, is also appointed by the president to lead the Kyiv City State Administration.

While Klitschko maintains both posts, during the all-out war, Zelensky has appointed Tymur Tkachenko to lead Kyiv's Military Administration. The unclear division of powers between the two undermines the efficient governance of the city. Klitschko has accused Tkachenko of trying to take over the mayor's powers. 

The standoff between Klitschko and Zelensky unfolds as Kyiv faces a dire situation.

Zelensky said the Kyiv leadership had ""lost valuable time"" and tasked the government with taking charge of resolving the consequences of the energy crisis in the capital and fixing the situation.

Since Russia began its consistent campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure in 2022, the defense of the country's energy grid has taken center stage, with authorities reporting on the construction of protective structures for energy facilities.

""Given the fact that we're a country at war, I believe that first of all, it was the responsibility of the central government to take full responsibility for preparing the country for the worst to come,"" said Voitsitska.

""We had a state of emergency in the energy sector for a couple of years already, so we should have changed the status quo of how to manage this situation a long time ago.""

According to Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy prime minister and the community and territories development minister, Kyiv authorities failed to properly deploy a backup power system, critical infrastructure lacked backup energy sources, and there was no public communication with residents about what to do in case of power outages.

In May, Kuleba took charge of the task force preparing the country for the heating season, coordinating the actions of both central and local authorities. He also leads the task force dedicated to protecting energy infrastructure.

Kyiv has the largest local budget among Ukrainian cities, with a surplus. Voitsitska argues that the government could have reviewed local expenditures, helping to better prioritize its spending. However, despite having the surplus, Klitschko ""irresponsibly spent funds,"" including on park renovation, she said.

The local authorities may still face bureaucratic hurdles, requiring approval from the central government to make certain decisions. But the tensions between Zelensky and Klitschko seem to be disrupting communication.

""It's a pity that instead of supporting (the mayor), we are killing ourselves,"" Klitschko's adviser told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity.

Voitsitska suggests Klitschko should have addressed the city's energy crisis needs and the issues he's facing with the central government earlier. The Kyiv mayor said that he hasn't had any personal meetings with Zelensky since the all-out war began.

Over the past four years, the city has also received substantial assistance from donors. Olena Pavlenko, president and co-founder of the Ukrainian DiXi Group think tank, said many international projects ""did a lot for Kyiv's heat supply, with generators, with other stuff.""

""The question is how much of that stuff was installed and whether it was destroyed before or not,"" she told the Kyiv Independent.

Despite his popularity abroad, Klitschko often faces criticism at home for how he handles the city, with his reputation further marred by illegal construction and corruption allegations involving his allies.

From the start of his presidency, Zelensky sought a loyalist to head the Kyiv City State Administration. But a legal provision stood in the way — under the law, the post belongs to the city's elected mayor.

Zelensky reportedly considered ousting Klitschko from his role as head of the Kyiv City State Administration after a Russian attack killed three people near a shelter in Kyiv in 2023.

The shelter was locked.

""If we focus on finding who is guilty and punishing them in the middle of winter, I think we might end up with no heat at all,"" Pavlenko said. ""I would suggest keeping these investigations and punishments until at least after the heating season is over.""

Hello there! This is Kateryna Denisova, the author of this piece. Despite the ongoing flurry of diplomacy, here in Ukraine, we see no readiness from Russia to end its brutal war, as relentless attacks continue. My colleagues and I are working around the clock in the bitter cold of Kyiv to deliver you the latest updates from the ground. 

Please consider supporting our reporting. This makes our work possible.

Thank you.

Corporate chiefs and government leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress – even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind.

The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees – or at them.

Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geoeconomic conflict; tariffs that have rocked long-standing trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries.

“It's really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dusek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we're in a transition. Some people think we've already entered a new era. But I think it's undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.”

Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike.

Trump's peacemaking credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “Board of Peace” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center.

The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics.

Critics will also be nearby: He's blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, will be on hand.

The two likeliest counterweights to Trump's administration on the international scene – China and the European Union – get top billing on the first day of the event: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China's “economic czar” – as Dusek put it.

The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge.

This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with some celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon.

The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes.

The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand.

Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.”

“People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favour nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we' to ‘me'.”

IMF forecasts 3.3% global growth in 2026 as AI boom offsets trade headwinds

The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbours, while nearly 70 per cent believed institutional leaders – such as from business or government – deliberately mislead the public.

Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report ahead of the Davos event which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16 per cent last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than US$18-trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world's richest people.

Oxfam said the US$2.5-trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world's population lives in poverty, the group said.

The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies.

The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying.

With such concerns filtering through to policy-makers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday.

As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure.

Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike have joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States – a USA House is making a debut this year – to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies.

Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week.

Critics have long accused the annual meeting in Davos of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem.

“It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.”

China reported it had hit its full-year GDP growth target of 5 per cent Monday, with exports to other markets more than compensating for slowing U.S. demand.

The Chinese economy bore the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war last year, with both sides engaging in tit-for-tat tariffs that threatened to spiral out of control until Mr. Trump agreed to a new trade deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a summit in South Korea. 

At one point, Washington imposed cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on most Chinese goods, a rate that threatened to essentially halt exports from China to its largest trading partner. But for all the uncertainty this engendered, in China and global markets, Beijing refused to back down, imposing its own tariffs and negotiating hard ahead of the October agreement. 

That tactic appeared to have paid off Monday. The world's second-largest economy posted a record trade surplus of US$1.19-trillion in 2025, underlining how China remains the dominant global supplier despite competition from developing markets and domestic challenges, including increasing labour costs and a shrinking population. 

Though growth dropped to 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, raising fears of slowing momentum heading into 2026, Beijing has cause to remain optimistic on this front, having stabilized trade with the U.S. – for now – and agreed to new trade deals with Canada and South Korea, as well as making progress on similar agreements with Britain and the European Union. 

“Trump's tariffs have essentially failed to deliver the desired effect,” said Huang Weiping, a professor of economic at Renmin University in Beijing, pointing to China's increased diversification and a growth in exports to Southeast Asia and other developing markets. 

Opinion: Is more trade with China really a good idea?

Indeed, China has been helped in this regard by Mr. Trump: The U.S. President's advisers once framed tariffs as a means of containing Beijing, but instead Washington's all-out global trade war has driven many countries – Canada among them – closer to China. 

That includes even the EU, where long-standing concerns about oversupply and a yawning trade deficit are being offset by new threats of U.S. tariffs over EU support for Greenland and even a potential invasion by the U.S. of the Danish territory. China agreed to open its market to Spanish pork and Irish beef after recent visits by those countries' leaders, while French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly planning to invite Mr. Xi to a G7 summit hosted in France this summer. 

In an editorial Monday, the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times said “China has always viewed Europe as an indispensable force in a multipolar world and genuinely supports Europe in pursuing strategic autonomy.” 

For all that China's export economy – long the engine of its stratospheric growth in recent decades – remains relatively rosy, domestic consumption did not improve significantly in 2025, despite concerted efforts to boost demand both to offset external pressures and reduce China's increasingly politically toxic trade deficit with overseas partners. 

“The domestic contradiction of strong supply and weak demand is prominent, and there are still many old problems and new challenges in economic development,” National Bureau of Statistics official Kang Yi told a briefing Monday. 

Chinese policy-makers have vowed to “significantly” boost domestic consumption over the next five years, including by adopting proactive fiscal measures. Despite this, household spending in China remains around 20 per cent below the global average, making up less than 40 per cent of annual economic output. 

In a note, analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit said China “remains a K-shaped economy in 2025, characterized by a robust external sector and soft domestic demand.” 

Xu Mingqi, deputy director of the Institute of World Economy at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said, “Consumption remains underwhelming, prompting the rollout of a raft of pro-consumption measures spanning fiscal, tax and financial policies.” 

These policies could yet “deliver notable effects in 2026,” Prof. Xu said. 

However, falling property prices – investment in the sector slumped 17.2 per cent last year – high youth unemployment and a weak social safety net have all combined to drive down domestic demand. Chinese consumers have so far responded tepidly to stimulus measures such as vouchers or government-backed electronics trade-in programs. 

As well as the growth statistics released Monday, China also published its latest population figures, with the one-time world's most populous country shrinking for the fourth consecutive year. The total number of births in 2025 was 7.92 million, the lowest in decades, down from 9.54 million in 2024. 

While China is far from the only developed country in East Asia to be grappling with a rapidly aging population, the situation is exacerbated by the legacy of the country's “one child policy,” which has created a situation where one person of working age may be supporting six people: two parents and four grandparents.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez promised to ""find out the truth"" as he spoke at a news conference near the site of the train crash in southern Spain. At least 39 people have been killed and dozens more injured.

Follow below for more news and information on the train crash in southern Spain here: 

Sunday's tragic crash brings to mind dark memories of deadly crashes in the southern European country, most of which occurred in the previous century. Here's a look at Spain's deadliest train crashes:

The willingness of the residents in Adamuz to help is impressive. Many have kept their doors open all night and day. 

Many relatives have traveled to the town after learning of the accident, trying to find out what happened to their loved ones. 

At the same time, people here are asking more and more questions about what caused the accident. 

Some local media reports are emerging that passengers and train staff had warned of bumps and strange noises on the affected section of track months ago.

Heads of government from across Europe have expressed their sympathy and condolences for the victims of the train crash in southern Spain that has left at least 39 people dead and others seriously injured.

""My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron. ""France stands by your side.""

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said: ""Italy stands close to Spain in its grief for this tragedy.""

The Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, called the news ""horrific"" and said: ""I have expressed my support and condolences to prime minister Sanchez. My thoughts are with all the victims and their families affected by this enormous disaster.""

In Germany, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was ""deeply shaken"" by the news. ""My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims, I offer them my sincere condolences,"" he said. ""To the injured, I wish strength and a speedy recovery. Germany stands with Spain at this time.""

The Greek Foreign Ministry also expressed ""deepest condolences to the families of the victims,"" adding, ""At this time of sorrow, Greece stands in solidarity with the people and the government of Spain.""

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has vowed to provide answers following the deadly train accident that killed at least 39 people.

""It is true that society is asking itself what has happened and how,"" Sanchez told a press conference, adding that time and the ""work of experts"" would provide the answer.

""We will get to the truth, we will find out the answer and when we know it, we will release to the public with absolute transparency and clarity,"" the prime minister added.

Sanchez, who praised the emergency responders and workers, vowed to assist the victims of the accident ""for as long as necessary.""

He also declared a three-day mourning period in the wake of the accident.

A Spanish train drivers' union warned rail operator ADIF last August about severe wear and tear on high-speed rail tracks, including on a line where two trains collided in a fatal crash on Sunday, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.

The letter said potholes, bumps and imbalances in overhead power lines were causing frequent breakdowns and damaging trains. It added that drivers had alerted the operator ""daily"" to their concerns but that no action had been taken.

The document, published on X, was verified by a member of the train drivers' union SEMAF to the Reuters news agency.

Two high-speed trains collided following a derailment in Cordoba, a city in southern Spain. Rescue efforts continue as investigators probe the cause.

Spain's Guardia Civil has continued operations following the train crash in Adamuz, deploying more than 220 officers, the force said on X.

It said personnel from citizen security units, the traffic division, rapid response groups, and the air service are working at the scene in Adamuz, in the province of Cordoba.

The Guardia Civil said its Central Criminalistics team is carrying out victim identification.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has canceled his planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos following the high-speed train collision.

His office said the decision was taken after Sunday's crash, the deadliest rail accident in the country in more than a decade.

The rail operator Iryo has said the last inspection of the train that derailed and then collided with another service in southern Spain was carried out on Thursday.

In a statement sent to the AFP news agency, the company said the train, built in 2022, left Malaga for Madrid with 289 passengers, four crew members, and one driver on board.

The operator said that at 7:45 pm local time (1845 GMT/UTC), and for reasons that remain unknown, the train entered the adjacent track near the town of Adamuz, where it collided with a train traveling in the opposite direction.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is to visit the site of the collision later on Monday, his office has said.

The purpose of the visit is ""to get first-hand information on"" Sunday's crash, which officials described as Spain's deadliest rail accident since 2013.

 

The Spanish Red Cross has set up a help center in the town of Adamuz, near the crash site.

It is offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information.

Members of Spain's civil guard and civil defense have been working at the site throughout the night

Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente has said the cause of the crash remains unknown.

He described it as ""a truly strange"" incident, noting it occurred on a flat section of track that was renovated in May.

Puente said the train that derailed was less than four years old and operated by the private company Iryo. The second train, which absorbed most of the impact, belonged to Spain's state-owned rail company Renfe.

A total of 39 people have died in the train accident that occurred yesterday, Sunday, in the town of Adamuz, in southern Spain's Cordoba province.

A total of 73 people remain hospitalized, 24 of them in serious condition, including four minors.

At least 75 passengers were hospitalized after a high-sped train derailed and collided with an oncoming train, Andalusia's regional President Juanma Moreno told reporters.

Among them were 15 people with serious injuries.

Most of the injured passengers were taken to hospital in Cordoba, close to the town of Adamuz where the crash happened.

Moreno said rescuers would work through the night to remove bodies from the wreckage. Andalusia's regional health minister earlier warned of ""a very difficult night ahead.""

Spain's state-owned railway infrastructure operator Adif announced that high-speed services between Madrid and the Andalusian cities of Cordoba, Seville, Malaga, Granada and Huelva would be suspended for all of Monday at least.

The rail network added that assistance zones had been set up at stations in Madrid, Seville, Cordoba, Malaga and Huelva for the relatives of the victims.

Spain was witnessing a ""night of deep pain"" after the deadly collision of two high-speed trains in the southern Andalusia region, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.

""I want to express my sincerest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims,"" Sanchez said in a statement on X.

""No word can alleviate such great suffering, but I want them to know that the whole country is by their side in this tough moment.""

King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia also said that they were following the news of the accident ""with great concern.""

""We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,"" the royal palace wrote on X.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW.com'}","world"

Germany has vowed a ""united"" response from Europe after Donald Trump threatened tariffs on nations that oppose him over Greenland. NATO's Mark Rutte is set for talks with Danish and Greenland officials. Follow DW. 

Follow below for the latest headlines, analyses, backgrounders and reactions to the escalating row over the future of Greenland on Monday, January 19, 2026:

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stressed once again that ""Denmark and Greenland are not alone"" and vowed a strong response to Trump's tariff threats.

In a post on X, Kallas said that ""Arctic security is a shared transatlantic interest"" that can be discussed with US allies. ""But tariff threats are not the way to go about this. Sovereignty is not for trade,"" Kallas said.

""We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground. Europe has a slate of tools to protect its interests.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday that he'd seek a unified line with France on potential responses to Trump's latest tariff threats. 

He said that even though France's government and president might ""want to react a little more harshly than we do,"" both sides were trying to compromise on a shared position to take to the next EU leaders' summit. 

Ultimately, any response will be decided at the EU level rather than nationally because it is trade policy, but France and Germany have very considerable influence in Brussels as the two most populous countries in the bloc with the largest economies. 

Merz's Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil, of the center-left Social Democrats rather than Merz's Christian Democrats, struck a slightly tougher tone in a meeting with his French counterpart Roland Lescure. 

""Germany and France are agreed that we will not allow ourself to be blackmailed,"" Klinbeil said. ""We as Europeans must make it clear: the limit has been reached."" 

Lescure meanwhile told French reporters that ""we are ruling nothing out"" while considering how to respond. 

Merz also said that on the most fundamental level, the EU was already united on the matter. 

""Among Europeans there is great unanimity that further tariff threats weaken transatlantic relations and do not strengthen them,"" Merz said. He also said he believed most people in America were also aware of the risks. 

Merz noted that in the past 12 months Trump had often repeatedly and loudly threatened large tariffs, only to partially or even completely roll them back before they even came into force.

The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has warned European nations not to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US.

The EU is considering the tariffs in response to Donald Trump's threats to impose levies on eight countries that have opposed the US president's aim of taking control of Greenland.

Speaking to reporters in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos on the first day of the World Economic Forum, Bessent said, ""I think it would be very unwise"" when asked about the possibility of EU tariffs.

Bessent repeated Trump's stance that the US wants the semiautonomous, Danish-owned territory because it is a ""strategic asset"" that is fundamental to US national security.

""We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else,"" Bessent said.

""I think everyone should ‌take ‌the president at his word,"" the treasury secretary added.
 

Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said Europe must hold firm in the face of US President Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on nations that block him over Greenland.

""It is clear that we want to stand our ground, as a country and as a continent,"" Merz said. ""It is up to us, and in Germany we want to accept the realities, take responsibility and lead the way for Germany.""

Merz said European leaders broadly agreed that tariffs would only undermine transatlantic ties and lead to an escalating trade war.

""We want to avoid any escalation in this dispute if at all possible,"" the chancellor said.

Trump has said he will slap 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including Germany, for opposing him and his desire to acquire Greenland.

The German leader said that tariffs would primarily hurt American consumers, while admitting that Germany's and Europe's economies would also suffer.

""Customs duties are usually paid by those in whose country the imports go,"" Merz said. ""In this case, US consumers would pay the customs duties, but they would of course also damage our economy, the European economy and the German economy in particular, which is why we want to find a solution here.""

While he said the aim is to resolve transatlantic differences ""together,"" he said Washington ""knows we could also retaliate"" with its own tariffs.

""I don't want to, but if necessary, we will of course protect our European interests as well as our German national interests,"" he said.

European Union leaders will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the bloc's response to Donald Trump's tariff threat against European nations that oppose his desired acquisition of Greenland.

Trump has threatened six EU members, as well as Norway and the United Kingdom, with tariffs that could rise to 25% for opposing his aim of buying the Arctic territory, which Denmark has controlled for about 300 years.

In preparation for the emergency summit on Thursday, an EU spokesman told reporters that ""intensive consultations"" were ongoing among EU leaders.

""The priority here is to engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs,"" EU trade spokesman Olof Gill said.

""Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint,"" Gill added.

He also said talks with US officials ""at all levels"" were ongoing.

""We are trying to be calm, to be firm, to be serious, to be responsible, because that's what, in our view, leadership looks like,"" Gill said.

But, he warned, the bloc is ""prepared to respond"" with the tools at its disposal, which include the never-before-used anti-coercion instrument, also known as the EU's ""trade bazooka.""

The United Kingdom's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pushed back against US President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on European nations over Greenland.

At a press conference on Monday, Starmer reiterated that the UK stands by the people of Greenland and Denmark in the face of Washington's increasingly aggressive posturing over the Arctic territory.

He also pointed out that Denmark is a ""close ally"" of both the UK and the US. ""Alliances endure because they are built on respect and partnership, not pressure,"" Starmer said.

""That is why I say the use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong. It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance,"" the UK leader said. ""A trade war is in no one's interest,"" said Starmer.

""The right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,"" the British leader said.

He added that he had spoken with Trump on Sunday, as well as European leaders and NATO chief Mark Rutte to ""find a solution rooted in partnership, facts and mutual respect.""

Donald Trump's threat of 10% tariffs against eight European nations — including six members of the EU — has triggered growing calls in the bloc to use its ""anti-coercion"" trade tool to counter the US president's ""blackmail.""

Trump has said imports to the US from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands will face tariffs of 10% from February 1 unless the US acquires Greenland. Trump also threatened to raise those tariffs to 25% by the summer if a deal hasn't been reached.

The instrument was created in 2023 as a countermeasure to Chinese trade practices, after Lithuania accused Beijing of blocking its exports because Vilnius had allowed a Taiwanese diplomatic mission to be opened in Lithuania two years earlier.

While it has never been used before, French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing to activate the ""Anti-Coercion Instrument"" (ACI), sources in his office said this weekend.

Before the US and EU signed a trade deal last year, the bloc had been preparing a package of retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion ($108 bln).

The tariffs, which were suspended once the deal was signed, are again being considered as a countermeasure to Trump's threats over Greenland.

What could the EU's retaliatory package include?

Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on eight European nations for opposing his bid to acquire Greenland.

Germany's Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said Monday that Europe was weighing countermeasures in response.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will meet with ministers from Greenland and Denmark at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Monday.

Rutte will hold talks with Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt and Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen over the heightened transatlantic tensions between Europe and the US over Donald Trump's desire to take over Greenland.

Trump is insisting that the US will acquire the resource-rich Arctic territory ""one way or the other,"" triggering a growing rift between the US and its allies in Europe.

Greenland, as a territory of Denmark, is part of NATO.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned this month that a takeover of Greenland by the US — which is also a NATO member — would spell the end of the alliance.

""If the United States decides to attack another NATO country, then everything would stop — that includes NATO and therefore post-World War II security,"" Frederiksen said.

Its entire population would fit in a large sports stadium but Greenland's current presence on the geopolitical stage is huge.

Its landmass is also huge. Though the US, Russia, Canada and China are significantly larger, few other nations are, with Greenland about six times larger than Germany (roughly 2.17 million sq km vs. 357,000 sq km).

US President Donald Trump has told Norway's Prime Minister Jonas ⁠Gahr ‍Store that he doesn't feel the need to ""think purely of peace"" after he failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize last year.

In a letter to Store that was published on Monday, Trump said, ""Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.""

The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which is independent of the Norwegian government, Store highlighted in a statement, saying that had ""clearly explained"" the issue to Trump.

In the letter, the US leader repeated his aim of seizing control of Greenland, which Trump claims is needed for US national security and to ward off alleged threats from China and Russia.

""Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,"" Trump said, adding that ""the World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.""

Officials from Denmark, Greenland and Europe have dismissed Trump's claims that Chinese and Russian warships pose an imminent threat in the Arctic.

Trump made no secret last year of his ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, making widely disputed claims that he had helped end more than eight wars.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was instead awarded the prize, although she then presented her prize to Trump.

Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that the US ""needs"" Greenland for its ""national security,"" pointing to his unevidenced claims that the island is ""covered with Chinese and Russian ships all over the place.""

European officials have rejected Trump's assertions, while trying to remind him that they share Washington's security concerns and that the US already has an agreement to deploy as many troops to Greenland as it wants.

Why else is Trump so interested in Greenland?

The second Trump administration is openly pursuing a modern take on the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century US foreign policy that viewed the Western hemisphere as being the US sphere of influence.

Trump invoked the doctrine in the recent kidnapping and ouster by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

Greenland, while being part of Denmark, is geographically part of the North American continent. As such, Trump views it as firmly in America's backyard.  

Greenland is also home to a vast and mostly untapped wealth of natural resources, which have only become accessible due to rising temperatures associated with climate change.

Here's what we know about Greenland's natural resources:

Significant oil and gas reserves

Rare earth minerals which are vital in emerging technologies

Rare earths are vital in the production of wind turbines, electric car batteries, semiconductors and military equipment like fighter jets and drones

Greenland is believed to have 36 million tons of rare earths

It could become the world's second-largest supplier behind China

Beijing currently controls up to 60% of global rare earth mining and has restricted exports amid rising tensions

The European Union appears to be done trying to appease US President Donald Trump over his demands to be given control of Greenland.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that the EU is considering deploying what has been described as an economic “bazooka” at the US after Trump threatened European countries with new tariffs because of their refusal to cede Greenland, which has been part of the Danish kingdom for hundreds of years.

Specifically, the EU has an “anti-coercion instrument” that the Times writes “could be used to slap limitations on big American technology companies or other service providers that do large amounts of business on the continent.”

Enacting this policy would dramatically escalate tensions between the US and its European allies, but some international relations experts think the EU might have little choice given Trump's fixation on seizing the self-governing Danish territory.

“This is just all brute force,” Penny Naas, an expert on European public policy at the German Marshall Fund, told the Times. “The president really wants Greenland, and he's not backing off of it.”

Bernd Lange, a German member of European Parliament, said in a social media post that European leaders could no longer try to appease Trump with concessions given his overt aggression and urged the EU to respond with maximum retaliation.

“New US tariffs for several nations are unbelievable,” he wrote. “This is no way to treat partners. A new line has been crossed. Unacceptable. POTUS is using trade as an instrument of political coercion. The EU cannot simply move on to business as usual.”

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil also signaled on Monday that European nations are at the end of their rope when it comes to Trump's relentless threats against them, reported Bloomberg.

“We are constantly experiencing new provocations, we are constantly experiencing new antagonism, which President Trump is seeking, and here we Europeans must make it clear that the limit has been reached,” said Klingbeil. “There is a legally established European toolbox that can respond to economic blackmail with very sensitive measures, and we should now examine the use of these measures.”

European officials said in a report published by Politico on Monday that they were considering fully breaking with the US over Trump's demands of territorial concessions, as they no longer feel that the US can be a trusted international partner.

“There is a shift in US policy and in many ways it is permanent,” said a senior European government official. “Waiting it out is not a solution. What needs to be done is an orderly and coordinated movement to a new reality.”

Europeans aren't the only ones criticizing Trump's latest actions, as Melinda St. Louis, director of Global Trade Watch at US-based government watchdog Public Citizen, said the president's latest tariffs over Greenland show that he has never cared about protecting American jobs, but only about exerting power.

“Misusing tariff authority over his wildly unpopular and head-scratching imperial claim of right to Greenland shows just how little he cares for the everyday struggles of Americans and undermines the legitimate uses of tariffs,” said St. Louis.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Proceeds from the oil sale are being stashed in Qatar, an arrangement critics say opens the door to more corruption.

The first US sale of Venezuelan oil since the Trump administration illegally attacked the South American country earlier this month went to the company of a trader who donated millions to President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.

The roughly $250 million sale of Venezuelan crude went to Vitol, a Geneva-based energy and commodity trading firm whose US arm is headquartered in Houston. The Financial Times reported late last week that John Addison, a senior trader at Vitol, was involved in his company's efforts to secure the deal.

Addison, who attended a recent White House meeting with other top oil executives, donated $6 million total to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign via several super PACs, including $5 million to MAGA Inc.

“Addison pledged to Trump at the [White House] event that Vitol would attain the best price possible for Venezuelan oil for the US, ‘so that the influence you have over the Venezuelans will ensure that you get what you want,'” according to the Financial Times.

US Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), noted on social media that Vitol has a “criminal history of bribing foreign governments” and called the Venezuelan oil deal “fundamentally corrupt.”

“Trump took Venezuela's oil at gunpoint, and gave it to one of his biggest campaign donors,” Murphy wrote. “Vitol had to buy access to Trump because under normal circumstances, they wouldn't be able to get a deal like this.”

Vitol is one of a number of corporations positioned to reap windfall profits from the Trump administration's assault on Venezuela, abduction of its president, and efforts to seize and indefinitely control the country's vast oil reserves.

As the Washington Post reported over the weekend:

Hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer's firm Elliott Investment Management has for years been in the process of acquiring distressed Venezuelan-owned assets in the US and is on the cusp of owning them. After clearing final regulatory and legal approval, the firm can use them to make a considerable profit turning newly available Venezuelan oil into gasoline. The company that would be acquired by an Elliott affiliate is Citgo, the Houston-based refining firm owned by Venezuela's state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Citgo owns refineries in Illinois, Louisiana and Texas that are well-positioned to profit off the millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil that Trump says will be steered to US refineries because it is a particularly heavy blend of crude that is difficult to process. Only certain refineries, like those run by Citgo, are equipped to handle it.

Proceeds from the US sale of Venezuelan oil are being stashed in Qatar — an arrangement that critics said opens the door to additional corruption.

“After illegally and unconstitutionally striking Venezuela, Trump is now selling Venezuelan oil through a campaign donor, and funneling the proceeds to an offshore account in Qatar — creating a potential slush fund with no accountability, oversight, or guardrails for Trump and his allies,” US Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote late Sunday. “His continued abuse of power doesn't serve the Venezuelan people or the American people — and it certainly doesn't lower costs for Americans.”

“This outrage,” Booker added, “is yet another example of his unchecked corruption as he again ignores laws and enriches his friends, donors, and himself.”

Housing First policies are being replaced with punitive reforms that could push 170,000 people back into homelessness.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Last fall, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) nearly triggered a homelessness disaster of its own making. A rush of policy changes that were rolled out with almost no warning and even less guidance threatened to push up to 170,000 formerly unhoused Americans out of stable housing.

The strangest part? Much of this upheaval traces back to a little-known think tank that was born in Silicon Valley.

The Cicero Institute, created by tech investor Joe Lonsdale, has spent the past few years promoting aggressive policies targeting encampments for the unhoused and pushing cities to move away from Housing First, the U.S.'s primary model for responding to chronic homelessness. Over the summer, HUD quietly adopted several of Cicero's key recommendations. And the result was widespread panic among the local agencies responsible for keeping people housed.

Joe Lonsdale, best known as a founding partner of Palantir and a member of the original “PayPal Mafia,” created the Cicero Institute in 2016 to inject what he calls “entrepreneurial thinking” into government. The group operates on a roughly $10 million annual budget that is financed by undisclosed donors, and its board is dominated by Lonsdale's family members, other entrepreneurs, and political staffers. Its messaging leans heavily on the idea that homelessness persists not because of poverty or a shortage of affordable housing, but because service providers are enabling poor behavior.

On his social media accounts, Lonsdale warns of a “homeless industrial complex” supposedly enriching itself through failed policies. That claim is not grounded in evidence, nor does it match the reality I've seen after eight years interviewing and observing frontline service workers in the homeless sector. If anything, the people running U.S. homeless shelters and supportive housing programs are overworked, underpaid, and overwhelmed by needs that far exceed their funding.

Yet Cicero's arguments have found a national platform through the work of Devon Kurtz, the organization's “public safety policy director.” Kurtz has a background in classics and criminology, but there is no evidence of any experience working in U.S. homelessness systems, according to his LinkedIn profile. Despite this, he has become a frequent commentator, urging lawmakers to ban encampments, expand involuntary psychiatric commitment, move unhoused people into transitional housing programs with strict behavioral requirements, and dismantle key federal institutions that design homelessness policy.

The proposals are sweeping. The evidence behind them is thin.

Cicero's preferred target is Housing First, a model adopted by the George W. Bush administration and expanded under both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, during the latter's first term. Housing First prioritizes moving chronically unhoused people into permanent housing without requiring sobriety or treatment upfront. The model rests on numerous randomized controlled trials, which find that people stay housed at far higher rates and reduce consumption of some costly emergency services when basic stability comes first. By contrast, evidence for mental health, income, and employment impacts shows no advantage for the conditional services that Cicero advocates.

Kurtz argues that Housing First has “failed,” pointing to rising numbers of unsheltered people over the past decade. But this argument misuses the data in several ways.

For one, “permanent supportive housing” is the closest thing to Housing First that the federal government provides homeless service recipients. That program  wasn't designed to end all homelessness. It was specifically created for “chronically” homeless households who have been unhoused for at least 12 months and who have a documented disability. Rising unsheltered homelessness, by contrast, has been driven largely by soaring rent costs, the expiration of pandemic-era protections, and insufficient supply of emergency shelter, not Housing First.

There's also the question of outcomes. HUD tracks Housing First retention each year, and the results are consistent: Since 2015, roughly 90 to 95 percent of people in these programs remain housed. If chronic homelessness is rising, the problem is not that Housing First “doesn't work.” The problem instead is that there aren't enough preventative services to keep people housed during crises or sufficient rental subsidies for people who have been unhoused for less than 12 months.

Still, Cicero frequently cites outlier studies to suggest Housing First is dangerous, ineffective, or too expensive. These studies are often based on narrow samples, misapplied to the wrong populations, or interpreted in ways the original authors explicitly warn against. The broader research consensus is clear: Housing First works extremely well for the population it serves. What it cannot do is counteract years of rising rents, stagnating wages, catastrophic shortages of affordable housing, and the collapse of political will to end homelessness.

The Cicero Institute's advocacy department, “Cicero Action,” has employed “high-powered” lobbyists to push its agenda in states around the country. Cicero Action, for example, hired Alfred Parks, a former state representative, and a corporate lobbyist, Jason Weaks, in New Mexico to advance model bills that criminalize homelessness and redirect funding from permanent to transitional housing programs.

After passing its model legislation in red states like Florida, Missouri, and Utah, it appears the Cicero Institute has expanded its influence to the federal government. In July 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing HUD to shift federal homelessness funding away from permanent housing and toward transitional housing and encampment enforcement. And HUD has quickly moved to comply.

Federal contracts that were supposed to run through 2026 were abruptly cut short. A new funding notice, released in mid-November, gave local agencies just months to redesign their entire homelessness systems, which took over 10 years to build.

The notice leaned heavily on the same weak evidence that Cicero uses. HUD cited a non-representative survey from 15 states to justify claims that most unsheltered people have severe mental illness or addiction, despite the study's own authors warning against using their data to generalize about causes. HUD suggested Housing First had failed, even though the agency's own metrics belied that claim.

Local administrators were stunned. I conducted 12 interviews with local administrators across the country over the past three months. My contacts would only speak to me under the condition of anonymity due to fear of political retaliation from HUD. The administrators I spoke to described HUD's abrupt change as chaotic, reckless, illegal, dangerous, and impossible to carry out.

“You're talking about historical supporting of permanent supportive housing,” one administrator said, “and essentially giving us eight months to wind those down. That's not enough time.”

In addition to this unrealistic deadline, most administrators would have to make those reforms with less funding and, as a result, fewer staff to deliver the intensive case management that HUD is now demanding. “There are some many consequences to this on down the road that they're not looking that far ahead,” another administrator said. “They are not looking at, ‘If we cut this, how do other services pick that up,' because we don't have those services and they aren't giving us the money to create those services.”

The recently announced $2 billion cuts to community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment will exacerbate this crisis by shrinking, if not eliminating, the case management agencies that deliver the kind of support HUD expects homeless service users to receive. 

A lawsuit was quickly filed to thwart disaster. Ninety minutes before its court hearing, HUD abruptly withdrew the funding notice until problems could be worked out.

Even though HUD pulled back its proposal, the uncertainty it created has already strained homelessness systems that were stretched thin long before this episode. With another winter underway and the threat of policy whiplash still looming, governors cannot afford to wait and see what happens next.

Roughly a third of contracts were ending between January and June 2026. A large number of people would therefore lose their rental assistance in the dead of winter if HUD followed through with this disastrous policy. This will cause unsheltered homelessness to spike at a time when emergency shelters already cannot meet demand.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, states used eviction moratoriums, utility shutoff protections, and emergency rental assistance to keep millions of people housed. They may need to use these tools again if HUD continues to pursue abrupt policy shifts without adequate planning.

Thousands of people are depending on them to act before the next crisis hits.

The dollar's dominance has survived its de-pegging from gold, decades of deteriorating fiscal discipline by the U.S. government, and active efforts by criminals, terrorists, and foreign governments to find alternative forms of payment. That dominance has kept the United States' borrowing costs manageable as its debts mount. But now this central pillar of U.S. economic stability and geopolitical influence faces a fresh challenge from digital alternatives.

During his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump often called the cryptocurrency industry a scam. By now, however, his family has plunged money into it—and his administration has bet that so-called U.S. dollar stablecoins, or privately issued cryptocurrencies regulated by the U.S. government and backed primarily by cash and other safe dollar assets, can reinforce the dollar's role as the world's primary reserve currency. After backing last summer's passage of the Genius Act, which sets out a regulatory framework for dollar stablecoins, Trump has championed the United States as a world leader in the industry.

Unbacked cryptocurrencies can be volatile, limiting their uptake. But stablecoins, which emerged about a decade ago, promise to reduce this risk, lower transaction costs for multinational firms, and offer financial services to people who cannot otherwise access bank accounts. If the stablecoin market expands dramatically and remains dollar-denominated (increasing demand for U.S. debt), that, in turn, could reinforce dollar dominance and the substantial power it affords the United States. It would make U.S. financial sanctions more effective and cement Washington's influence in setting the standards for a new financial frontier.

But those benefits are not guaranteed as the stablecoin market grows. Dollar-denominated stablecoin issuers can be based anywhere, meaning that U.S. regulators will depend on the cooperation of a vast array of foreign counterparts to ensure that these new forms of dollars are just as trustworthy as bank deposits or good old cash. Enforcing regulations on stablecoins would be a mammoth task in the best of times, but it will be further complicated by the Trump administration's policy unpredictability, hostile approach to trade, and distaste for regulation. Instead of collaborating with the United States to further entrench dollar dominance, even the friendliest U.S. allies may turn a blind eye to unscrupulous operators or undercut dollar stablecoins by giving preference to digital currencies issued by their own central banks. Unless Washington works deliberately and diligently to coordinate enforcement of U.S. rules, the technology may only accelerate the fragmentation of global financial markets.

Trump has advanced conflicting views on whether dollar dominance serves the U.S. national interest. During his 2024 presidential campaign, he argued that the dollar's preeminent role as the world's currency has distorted its exchange rate and hurt U.S. businesses' competitiveness. Once he became president, he vowed to punish countries that tried to undermine the dollar's dominance, although this so far remains an empty threat.

But markets, not individual leaders, largely determine which currencies offer the best store of value and most reliable means of exchange. The United States still boasts the deepest and most sophisticated financial markets, the world's most innovative companies, and a largely independent set of courts and regulators, all of which continue to undergird dollar dominance. Dollars still account for more than half of global foreign exchange reserves and export invoicing and roughly 90 percent of foreign currency transactions.

Dollar reserves have been in decline since roughly 2000, however, when they represented nearly 70 percent of total holdings. Some of this shift simply represents a natural effort by countries to diversify their holdings. But Washington's unpredictability—and its efforts to use its economic might to sanction or even bully friends as well as rivals—has triggered an accelerating search for alternatives. China has sought to boost the usage of the renminbi through its Belt and Road loans and central bank swap lines. Chinese and Russian regulators have established alternative payment systems to bypass the Western-dominated SWIFT network. Europe even attempted a barter-like experiment to trade with Iran after the first Trump administration reimposed sanctions. European officials are now exploring ways to reduce their markets' overwhelming dependence on U.S. firms such as Mastercard and Visa for payment flows.



But the biggest challenge to the dollar may lie ahead, as the cryptocurrency revolution gains momentum. Bitcoin's 2009 launch spawned an eclectic industry that now includes a vast array of offerings, from popular alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum to entertaining “memecoins.” By moving money through the blockchain (a set of digital ledgers distributed across computer networks worldwide), such currencies offer potentially enormous benefits. 

Money can move without the kinds of delays and fees associated with bank accounts and credit cards, and international transfers need no longer depend on a labyrinth of corresponding banking relationships. Multinational corporations can, in theory, much more easily manage liquidity across jurisdictions, and remittances can be sent across national borders instantly and essentially without charge. Households in developing countries can easily protect their savings in dollar-linked assets, reducing their exposure to their own currencies' volatility. Stocks, bonds, and even real estate can be turned into digital tokens so that transfers can move along the same virtually frictionless rails. The value of unbacked cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can experience wild variations, but stablecoins and central bank digital currencies are meant to be as reliable as cash in a wallet.

Currently, there are two dominant stablecoin issuers. Tether, a firm domiciled in El Salvador, has issued a dollar stablecoin with a market capitalization of $187 billion backed by U.S. treasuries as well as corporate bonds, Bitcoin, and gold. Circle, which prides itself on being domiciled in the United States (and therefore fully subject to U.S. regulations), has issued $78 billion worth of stablecoins backed primarily by cash and U.S. treasuries. Thus far, the total value of stablecoins in circulation is only 0.5 percent of the U.S. stock exchange's market capitalization, according to International Monetary Fund estimates. But that represents a doubling of value since 2024. And Citi forecasts that the stablecoin market could grow more than tenfold by 2030.

Trump's second-term turn in favor of cryptocurrency is no surprise: cryptocurrency executives poured money into his 2024 presidential campaign and financed the launch of his family's cryptocurrency ventures. Along with releasing memecoins named for himself and First Lady Melania Trump, the president and his three sons founded World Liberty Financial, which issued digital tokens currently valued at $4.4 billion and has launched its own dollar stablecoin. During his second term, the president also expressly prohibited the Federal Reserve from developing a central bank digital currency, bowing to concerns of a vocal minority about threats to personal privacy.

The Genius Act, which Trump signed in July 2025 surrounded by cryptocurrency executives—some of whom were major campaign donors—provides the first U.S. regulatory framework for stablecoins. It imposes transparency rules and independent audits on companies that issue them and requires that they be backed one to one with cash, U.S. Treasuries, or other high-quality liquid assets. To limit flight from traditional banks and investment vehicles, the Genius Act prohibits dollar stablecoin issuers from paying interest and provides no government insurance as a backstop. The legislation demands compliance with U.S. anti-money-laundering rules, and it requires issuers to help enforce U.S. sanctions by blocking transactions or freezing assets, as banks already do. Even with all these restrictions, stablecoins look like a highly profitable business, since issuers pocket all the interest earned on their reserves. Large U.S. banks, retailers, and payment firms are rapidly moving to launch their own stablecoins: Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs announced plans to issue stablecoins in several currencies as part of a consortium of nine global banks.

If dollar stablecoins become as attractive as the Trump administration hopes they will, private firms worldwide will be able to effectively issue and process the cryptocurrency equivalent of U.S. currency. The most responsible issuers will do their best to meet the U.S. government's legal requirements, because trust in their individual offerings depends on public trust in all stablecoins. Much as foreign banks enforce U.S. sanctions so they can retain access to the American market, most of these foreign stablecoin issuers will want to stay in U.S. regulators' good graces. But because many stablecoin firms will not have a U.S. presence, they will not need to be overly committed to the latest rules from Washington dictating which assets they should hold, what reports they must file, or which sanctions violations they must report.

And the stiffer the competition becomes, the greater the pressure will be to bend the rules. If stablecoin issuers cannot pay interest, they may offer other incentives—such as loyalty points or cash-back provisions in partnership with distributors—to make their coins more attractive. Even if they hold enough liquid assets to match their issuance, their operations may not be able to handle massive redemptions in a crisis. Some stablecoins could start to trade at a premium if the issuer offers substantial incentives or a discount if questions arise about the collateral that stands behind the stablecoins in circulation.

Some issuers will simply flout U.S. regulations deliberately, offering false guarantees or promising unsustainable incentives. In jurisdictions that already struggle to contain tax evasion, dollar stablecoins may offer a new vehicle to avoid government attention. And they will undoubtedly weaken many countries' ability to maintain financial stability and set interest rates as currency flows out of their banking systems.

It will be hard enough for Washington to enforce its stablecoin regulations in friendly jurisdictions. But the greater difficulty for U.S. regulators will be to maintain influence over these evolving payment rails in countries that are uncomfortable with or openly hostile to U.S. dollar dominance. Many governments already wonder why they should reinforce that dominance at a time when Washington is reordering its own priorities.

As the Trump administration moves to coddle Moscow, European leaders have been developing plans to address what they call “cryptomercantilism,” or what they see as U.S. plans to boost the dollar's influence at Europe's expense. The European Central Bank has been working assiduously to launch its own central bank digital currency, which would boost global usage of the euro as an alternative to the dollar. Now European finance ministers are discussing how to change their regulations to speed the issuance of euro-linked stablecoins.

China, meanwhile, has banned the use of all cryptocurrencies within its territory. Officials have been developing a mechanism to settle international payments through central bank digital currencies that avoid the dollar altogether. The digital yuan, which Beijing introduced in 2020, has struggled to gain domestic acceptance, but the People's Bank of China is now championing a project called mBridge, which would allow for direct payments between Chinese banks and banks in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Similar projects have already attracted participation from Australia, France, Malaysia, Singapore, and Switzerland. These mechanisms allow a buyer in Thailand to send baht and a seller in Saudi Arabia to receive riyals without any need to exchange into dollars along the way.



The future of stablecoins bears worrying similarities to the early history of the Internet. Instant access to news and data was meant to deal a blow to censorship and accelerate the integration of societies worldwide. Instead, it appears to have reinforced populism and political divisions. Instant payment mechanisms promise amazing efficiencies and unprecedented financial inclusion but may also lead to more fragmented financial markets. To avert this outcome, at a minimum, the U.S. Treasury will need to convince finance ministries around the world that this new form of dollar does not undercut their own currencies or destabilize their financial systems. And U.S. regulators will need to muster the resources to build tighter relationships with their counterparts in key foreign jurisdictions to make sure that the dollar stablecoins issued there are fully backed and that U.S. rules and sanctions are reliably enforced. If enforcement across other jurisdictions becomes disjointed and money starts flowing through poorly regulated dollar-backed stablecoins, the potential for stablecoins to strengthen the position of the dollar will be lost. Worse yet, disagreements over stablecoin enforcement may further undermine global cooperation on sanctions enforcement through even traditional banking channels.

This may prove difficult for an administration that so volubly promotes the United States' interests first, seemingly with little regard to other countries' legitimate concerns. But global financial markets function smoothly only when all participants agree to enforce the same rules. If Washington can't secure that cooperation, then the Trump administration's stablecoin push may deal the United States—and the dollar—another self-inflicted wound.

 Breaking Beijing's Hold on the Global Economy

 Liza Tobin and Addis Goldman

In May 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton tested whether economic leverage could be converted into political influence over China. Having campaigned on a promise to link trade to human rights, he signed an executive order conditioning the annual renewal of China's “most favored nation” trading status on “substantial progress” across a set of human rights benchmarks. The initiative immediately met resistance: U.S. businesses warned that the order would harm American economic interests, while China threatened to obstruct U.S. diplomatic and trade priorities if its status were withdrawn. Over the following year, Beijing largely ignored Washington's conditions, making few, if any, meaningful improvements on human rights. When renewal came due in 1994, Clinton granted China's most favored nation status unconditionally, conceding that the strategy had “reached the end of its usefulness.”

Washington apparently concluded that confronting China was not worth the cost. Over time, accommodation became the default, and policymakers sought to align China with U.S. interests by embedding it more deeply in the global economic system. That familiar logic guided the decision to support China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and to grant permanent normal trade relations in 2002, institutionalizing the policy of engagement. Even as China's economic power grew, this orientation proved remarkably durable. Successive American administrations offered dialogue and cooperation as a framework for managing ties, often treating stability as an end in itself.

Stability with Beijing, however, remains elusive. As with Clinton and the most favored nation status, China has consistently exploited American overtures, toggling between conciliatory rhetoric and threats of retaliation to shift the burden of stabilizing ties onto Washington. All the while, it has continued to accumulate coercive power as it actively works to displace the United States as the world's preeminent power. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made this much explicit: the country's goal, he declared at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, is to become the world leader “in terms of composite national strength and international influence by the middle of the century.”

The October 2025 summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Xi in Busan, South Korea, is but the latest example of the engagement illusion. In the run-up to the meeting, Trump signaled he could bring a bazooka to the bargaining table, threatening to impose sweeping software export controls. In the end, however, the administration yielded in the face of Beijing's rare-earth export controls, and the meeting yielded only a fragile truce: a one-year freeze on new punitive trade measures in exchange for nonbinding commitments from China to cooperate on curbing fentanyl flows and to resume limited purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Beijing, on the other hand, emerged emboldened, with Chinese state media openly boasting about Beijing holding Washington's “core industrial lifeline” in its hands.

Trump does not have long before his planned visit to Beijing in April 2026. Without a clear-eyed assessment of the true intentions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Washington risks getting caught flatfooted and played for a fool yet again. To best position the United States for that meeting, the administration needs to apply existing policy tools more effectively to consolidate its economic and technological advantages. While some of this work is already underway, Washington must accelerate global trade realignment away from China, strengthen U.S. and allied leadership in artificial intelligence by expanding export controls on advanced semiconductors and working with allies to close loopholes, and reduce reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains for critical minerals, which is the United States' most glaring vulnerability. It's past time for the United States and other democracies to realize that pursuing stability above all else with a communist regime bent on global primacy is a fool's errand.

April 2025 was a watershed moment. The Trump administration launched its “Liberation Day” tariffs on virtually all U.S. trading partners. China retaliated with its own duties, triggering a tit-for-tat cycle that culminated in Trump's imposing tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese goods—effectively signaling the start of a trade embargo. But for the first time, the CCP wielded the full force of its industrial dominance against the United States by cutting off rare-earth exports, a move designed to cripple major sectors of the American economy, from automotives to defense. (China controls roughly 85 percent of global rare-earth mineral mining and a staggering 95 percent of the world's rare-earth processing and refining capacity.) U.S. manufacturers warned that delays were already straining supply chains and threatening to shut down production. It was enough to persuade the president to blink first. The two countries struck a 90-day truce in May, in which the United States agreed to lower China's rates to 30 percent. For its part, Beijing ostensibly agreed to restore U.S. access to rare earths, but it retained control through its export licensing regime, rolling out approvals slowly and selectively.

Further U.S. concessions followed: in July, the administration walked back export controls it had placed on Nvidia's H20 chips earlier that year. A month later, the Trump administration also delayed the previously planned “snap back” to higher tariffs for another 90 days, citing “productive negotiations”—effectively giving Beijing time to consolidate its economic leverage.



In September, the Trump administration's conciliatory approach seemed to wobble when the U.S. Department of Commerce revised its export control rules, closing loopholes that Chinese companies had used to access controlled U.S. technology through affiliates and intermediaries. Washington framed this “Affiliates Rule” as a long-overdue regulatory cleanup, but Beijing saw it as an unwelcome reversal. China's Ministry of Commerce condemned the change as an “extremely egregious” move that “gravely undermines the security and stability of global industrial supply chains.” In October, China dramatically expanded its rare-earth export controls in response, threatening to cut off critical inputs for everything from consumer electronics to advanced defense systems. It was a sweeping assertion of leverage that exposed companies worldwide to severe economic risk.

By the time of the Busan talks in late October, the Trump administration had a cocked and loaded gun pointed at its head. It came as no surprise, then, that the truce that emerged heavily favored Beijing. Trump immediately cut tariffs tied to fentanyl flows by ten percentage points in exchange for promises of Chinese cooperation—an arrangement reminiscent of the 1993 saga over human rights improvements. Washington also suspended the Affiliates Rule and new trade restrictions for a year; in return, it received what it claimed was a commitment from China to eliminate its rare-earth export controls and end bans on the purchase of U.S. chips.

In practice, Beijing has retained and even tightened its rare-earth licensing requirements, using them to harvest supply chain data and trade secrets from foreign firms. Moreover, it has continued to restrict Chinese companies from purchasing U.S. chips. China's tactical concessions, such as purchasing more American soybeans, were calibrated to placate Trump while it consolidates its advantage and pursues its long-term objectives.

Summit optics should not obscure Beijing's ultimate goal, which was spelled out in the CCP's proposal for its latest five-year plan, scheduled for formal adoption in March. The proposal, accompanied by an extensive “explanation” from Xi himself, makes clear that Beijing plans to double down on industrial policy, relying on exports and high-tech sectors to sustain economic growth and build national power. The CCP views advanced manufacturing as “the main battlefield” in the contest for global dominance, and it has organized its priorities accordingly. Jin Canrong, an influential Chinese international relations scholar, summarized the view from Beijing well when he argued in October 2025 that China must “resist the illusion of Western ideologies and value systems” and prioritize industrial development, as “global competition increasingly favors those with scalable industrial capacity.”

The 15th Five-Year Plan, which covers 2026–30, consummates Xi's long-standing drive to subordinate economics to national security. Directives to establish a “foreign-related national security mechanism” and an “overseas security guarantee system” signal Beijing's intent to further insulate its economy from external pressure while expanding its coercive capacity. The plan's accompanying communiqué, meanwhile, explicitly instructs the military to “prepare for war,” marking a break with previous five-year plans, which typically focus on economic and social development. Taken together, Beijing's policy language evinces what Matthew Johnson, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, has called “a siege mentality.” The CCP has permanently wired its economy and society for confrontation with the United States.



Although the five-year plan pays lip service to the structural imbalances that have long plagued China's economy, its overwhelming focus is on industrial modernization. For nearly a decade, Beijing has promised to rebalance toward consumption and curb excessive investment. Today, in the face of mounting international pressure and Xi's own calls to combat competitive price spirals, as well as growing signs of social disaffection with its priorities, the CCP shows few signs of genuine course correction. Instead, it is poised to compensate for domestic stagnation by continuing to scale up state-directed manufacturing and export abroad its staggering trade surplus, which hit a record $1.2 trillion last year.

China already accounts for roughly a third of global manufacturing output—more than Germany, Japan, and the United States combined—but it wants an even larger share of the pie and sees artificial intelligence as crucial to getting it. The five-year plan emphasizes how AI-driven industrial transformation will put China in a stronger position to “shape a favorable external environment,” strengthening its hold over critical supply chains that it can use to coerce rivals. The United States and other democratic market economies should therefore focus not only on reducing trade exposure to China but also on limiting Beijing's ability to further convert advances in AI into extraordinary industrial advantages.

Countering Beijing requires nothing short of reordering the global trade system. For much of the post–Cold War era, U.S. trade policy rested on the assumption that deeper economic integration with China would encourage it to liberalize. Beijing's accession to the WTO failed to deliver structural reform, but even years later, Washington continued to treat Asia as a single open production space in which efficiency and market access outweighed strategic vulnerability. When the United States finally began to adjust course during Trump's first term, some U.S. firms relocated production to Southeast Asia and Mexico to avoid higher tariffs on Chinese imports. But China quickly followed, rebuilding supply chains in countries across the so-called global South and using transshipment and diversion channels to maintain access to the U.S. market.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recognizes that the post–Bretton Woods trade system has failed to evolve to meet the times. The “Trump Round,” as Greer has dubbed the present moment, is a necessary break from decades of prioritizing efficiency over security. That old consensus let China game the system: exploiting open markets abroad while running a closed, state-driven economy at home. To usher in a new order, Greer has taken steps to renegotiate trade flows with Southeast Asia. New economic security agreements—signed with Cambodia and Malaysia, and pending with Thailand and Vietnam—go far beyond traditional tariff schedules. Like deals with Japan, South Korea, and the European Union, they encompass economic security clauses to cooperate on export-control enforcement, investment screening, and critical-mineral supply chains. The agreements also place heavy emphasis on countering transshipment and diversion—implicitly targeting problems that emerged in Trump's first term after he levied tariffs on China. The logic is clear: trade partners receive preferential access to the U.S. market in exchange for reduced dependence on China, and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs enforces the arrangement.



Greer's strategy also aims to strengthen North America as a production base capable of competing with China. While the Trump administration has aggressively pressured Ottawa and Mexico City to secure concessions ahead of this year's review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the priority should now shift from brinkmanship to consolidation, treating the pact not simply as an arrangement for market access but as the foundation of a shared industrial strategy. The bloc already has deeply integrated supply chains in automobiles, aerospace, medical devices, and semiconductors. Strengthening rules of origin, aligning investment incentives, and coordinating tariffs and other restrictions on Chinese imports would prevent dumping and backdoor access through North American production channels. Over time, the bloc could expand to include additional partners in the hemisphere and beyond and build an expanded supply chain network insulated from Chinese overcapacity. This shift is already underway: Mexico has overtaken China as the United States' largest trading partner for goods and has steadily raised its own tariffs on China. In November 2025, Washington also announced new trade framework agreements with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

U.S. tariffs have effectively reduced the United States' exposure to China: the Chinese share of U.S. imports has now dropped below where it stood prior to China's WTO accession 25 years ago. Sustaining that shift, however, depends on a tariff gap between China and the rest of the world that is wide enough to make sourcing from China unattractive. Trump's ten percent tariff concession to Xi narrowed this differential, weakening the incentive to pivot away from China.

Greer retains authority to raise tariffs on China and restore the necessary arbitrage, but his ability to do so will be constrained for fear of shattering the president's trade truce with Xi. Before April, Washington must learn that short-term compromises merely postpone the inevitable reckoning between dealmaking and decoupling. Moreover, maintaining higher tariffs on China will not only reshape supply chains but also put pressure on China's growth model. As U.S. demand recedes, Chinese firms will be forced to dump goods into smaller, export-dependent markets at razor-thin margins, which could worsen deflation, provoke foreign backlash, and strengthen the United States' hand.

Trade diversification reduces U.S. exposure to China and strengthens American resilience. But durable advantage also requires exploiting asymmetries—none more so than access to advanced computing power. AI is poised to fundamentally transform the balance of economic and military power for decades to come. U.S. and allied leadership in chip design, manufacturing, and cloud infrastructure is Washington's most enduring and potent source of technology leverage.

This is why the Trump administration's decision in December 2025 to license exports of Nvidia's H200 chips to China is a massive error. While framed as a commercial win for the United States, it amounted to a major concession to Beijing—one that directly contradicts the logic of the administration's own National Security Strategy and its AI Action Plan, which calls for “denying our foreign adversaries” access to compute resources on economic and national security grounds. Allowing sales of cutting-edge AI chips to China is tantamount to transfusing the United States' lifeblood into the arteries of its chief rival, hastening a future in which the AI revolution bears a “Made in China” stamp.

Right now, computing power is the key constraint on China's AI ambitions. According to Chris McGuire, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served on the National Security Council during the Biden administration, the most advanced American AI chips are roughly five times more powerful than Huawei's best offerings; that disparity is projected to grow to 17 times by 2027. Production gaps are even starker: the United States and its partners can produce AI processors at a rate more than 35 times that of China. Chinese leaders and AI scientists are acutely aware of this disparity. In a Politburo study session convened in April 2025, Xi stressed that China was behind the United States in AI and must “face up to the gap” in chips. And at an AI conference in Beijing earlier this month, one of Alibaba's AI leads, Lin Junyang, acknowledged that U.S. compute advantages may be “one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours.”



The argument that China will remain “addicted” to U.S. chips, if only the United States agrees to sell them, is seductive, but nonetheless willfully ignorant of the CCP's track record. Across sectors, from telecommunications to solar panels and batteries, Beijing has followed a consistent playbook: import, substitute, displace, dominate. It has resolved to do the same with semiconductors. Even after news broke that Washington would license H200 sales, Chinese authorities were considering a $70 billion stimulus for the chip sector—a clear signal that U.S. largess would not deter their drive for self-reliance. These subsidies would come on top of the approximately $150 billion that Beijing has directed to its chip sector since 2014.

Taken together, these moves belie the delusion that China seeks anything less than global semiconductor supremacy. But capital alone cannot substitute for access to advanced tools, expertise, and globally integrated manufacturing ecosystems—precisely where U.S. and allied leadership, and the export controls designed to protect it, remain decisive. Exporting advanced chips weakens that competitive advantage by giving Beijing exactly what it needs to achieve its long-term ambitions. With the H200 chips, Beijing can now surge ahead across domains where it faced difficult tradeoffs: military modernization, AI model development, and the long-term push for chip self-sufficiency.

Loosening export controls threatens another pillar of U.S. tech dominance: cloud computing. American firms operate the world's leading cloud platforms and invest seven times more in AI data centers than their Chinese counterparts. Allowing advanced AI chips to flow into China could help Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba and ByteDance to compete directly with American companies in third-country markets. Given the limited supply, every chip exported to China is one unavailable for domestic AI infrastructure.

Security risks further compound the problem. Currently, no Chinese AI data centers operate outside China. But if Chinese technology becomes embedded in U.S. data centers, it could enable Beijing to collect sensitive data or conduct remote sabotage. The Commerce Department has the authority to block imports of risky Chinese-connected technologies, including components for data centers, which it should use now to prevent Chinese firms from entrenching themselves in American and global data infrastructure.

Even the most successful trade realignment and export controls will fall short if the United States remains dependent on China for the raw materials that power modern industry. Nowhere is that dependence more dangerous than in rare earths. Without reliable access to rare earths, the United States cannot produce the defense systems required for deterrence, the energy infrastructure needed to power the AI revolution, or the semiconductors and electronics that underpin modern life. The Trump administration's recent moves, including cooperation agreements with Australia and Japan to secure the supply chains of critical minerals and rare-earth magnets, and executive orders directing agencies to accelerate domestic mining and processing, laid important groundwork. These efforts must now be implemented at scale. With sustained investment and coordination with allies, the United States can build a viable rare-earth ecosystem free from China's grip.

Beijing's dominance in rare earths rests on three key chokepoints: the concentration of heavy rare-earth minerals in China and Myanmar, its near monopoly in processing and separation, and its dominance in the manufacturing of permanent magnets. For decades, while the rest of the world neglected upstream and midstream supply chains, Beijing hardwired these dependencies into the global economy. And as early as 2010, it revealed a willingness to weaponize them, cutting off rare-earth shipments to Japan as punishment for a fishing dispute.



To counter Beijing, the United States and its allies must move beyond fragmented, project-by-project initiatives and adopt an industrial strategy similar to the one it pursued during the pandemic. The COVID vaccine development program known as Operation Warp Speed used diversified investment, proactive financing of large-scale manufacturing, and public-private coordination in order to compress a decade of vaccine development into less than a year. An Operation Mineral Security could likewise compress the timeline for building resilient rare-earth supply chains. Washington should aim to bring mining, refining, separation, and magnet production online at scale, and use long-term offtake agreements to deter Chinese price crashes, public financing to crowd in private investment, and subsidies and indemnification to support firms at risk of retaliation. This strategy will require strategic stockpiles of rare earths to stabilize demand, and it should offer targeted tariff relief to partners that block Chinese acquisitions and enforce transparent supply chains.

The rare-earth challenge demands urgency and imagination. This is not a problem that markets alone will solve; purely commercial ventures cannot compete with highly subsidized Chinese competition. But with targeted government intervention, patient capital, and acceptance of the tradeoffs, what appears economically unviable becomes feasible.

Washington is still haunted by the same dilemma that confronted Clinton: tactical concessions cannot buy durable cooperation. Instead, they merely invite exploitation. Stability with a communist dictatorship is a fantasy. Breaking the cycle requires building leverage and resilience that Beijing cannot switch off at will.

            The president of the United States ordered the secret construction of a secure underground facility at the White House and built a new extension of the East Wing on top.
    


            It was 1941, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had been encouraged to build a bomb shelter at the White House in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
    


            At the time, “no public acknowledgment was made of there being a bomb shelter under construction, only the East Wing,” according to White House Historical Association historian Bill Seale.
    


            More than 80 years later, the East Wing is again under construction in preparation for President Donald Trump's sprawling new ballroom, and the historic, if dated, underground facilities have been dismantled. And once again, there's a lot of secrecy around plans to rebuild the bunker.
    


            Little is publicly known about the construction taking place in what was once a secret submarine-like bunker, which included the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, and the underground infrastructure around it. The space has been used for everything from watching a parody film the Nixon administration deemed pornographic and wanted killed, to planning former President Joe Biden's clandestine trip to Ukraine. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney was evacuated to the space moments before an attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
    


            The space is now likely being reimagined and replaced with new technology to counter evolving threats, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.
    


            But there has been very little acknowledgment that the project even exists.
    


            During a recent meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission where the ballroom was discussed, White House director of management and administration Joshua Fisher said broadly that the overall ballroom project will “(enhance) mission critical functionality,” “make necessary security enhancements” and “(deliver) resilient, adaptive infrastructure aligned with future mission needs.”
    


            Fisher was pressed on why the project broke with precedent by starting the demolition process without the commission's approval — and he indicated that the “top-secret” work taking place underground was the motivation.
    


            “There are some things regarding this project that are, frankly, of top-secret nature that we are currently working on. That does not preclude us from changing the above-grade structure, but that work needed to be considered when doing this project, which was not part of the NCPC process,” he said.
    


            The White House declined CNN's request for comment. But in a court filing last week for a case seeking to stop the East Wing construction, the White House defended the process, saying that halting the underground construction would “endanger national security and therefore impair the public interest.” It said the reasoning for this was described in a “classified declaration” attached to the case.
    


            Here's what we know about what was there before — and what's going on now.
    


            Though Roosevelt's construction was initially envisioned as a bomb shelter, underground facilities beneath the East Wing evolved over time to serve multiple functions.
    


            Those who enter through the East Wing would go down a few levels and then walk through a massive, protected vault-style door to enter a self-contained bunker with low ceilings that included beds, shelf-stable foods, water, and other supplies, plus secure communications to the outside world, according to a source who has been inside the space and was not authorized to speak on the record.
    


            The underground space also included the PEOC, a centralized command and control facility for the president and his staff that was fortified to withstand a potential nuclear explosion or other major attack.
    


            The PEOC works in tandem with the Situation Room, said Jonathan Wackrow, a former US Secret Service agent and CNN contributor.
    


            “The Situation Room is a much more focused watch center that will feed information over to the PEOC, but because it is a complex that's in the West Wing, it is secure to a point, but it's not a hardened facility,” he said.
    


            “The PEOC is used during emergencies. It's not something that everybody goes to,” he added. “The Situation Room is used almost by the whole of government, 24 hours-a day.”
    


            The PEOC has been depicted on the silver screen with varying degrees of accuracy — most recently in the 2025 thriller “A House of Dynamite,” along with 2013's “Olympus Has Fallen,” which depicted a terror attack on the White House.
    


            The “tomb-like” space was visited by Roosevelt only once, according to Seale, the historian. In subsequent years, “an inspection of the bomb shelter became a first-day custom for all incoming presidents who followed, until the last twenty years, when the relevance of the shelter was lessened,” he wrote in 2011.
    


            A second source familiar with the space granted anonymity to speak freely described the underground complex as “a very complicated submarine that was built in the 1940s — a self-contained unit, [with] separate power backups, separate water backups, separate air filtration.”
    


            “But all the infrastructure is 1940s infrastructure,” they added.
    


            The complex also had a secure evacuation route, according to the first source, through which the president can be removed from White House grounds to another location.
    


            Demolition on the East Wing began in October, and the excavators that dismantled the East Colonnade and office space historically occupied by first ladies took the dated underground facility along with it.
    


            “With a high degree of confidence, I would say that all of the subterranean structures,” including the PEOC, heating and air utilities, and underground facilities for the White House Military Office and US Secret Service Uniformed Division, “all of that seems to be gone,” the second source said.
    


            For anyone concerned about presidential security in the absence of the bunker, that source said there are plenty of redundancies to keep the president safe in the event of an emergency.
    


            While it's unlikely that plans will emerge in public anytime soon, details could come with time: The PEOC played a significant role on September 11, 2001, and select images from inside the center that day were released via a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015.
    


            Trump has suggested the US military is “very much involved” in the ballroom construction, and it's likely that the project is being executed by some combination of military officials; Secret Service; the Executive Office of the President; contractor Clark Construction, which has significant experience in highly secure facility construction; and Shalom Baranes Architects, the group leading the ballroom construction, which also led the project to rebuild and fortify the Pentagon after the 9/11 attack.
    


            Wackrow, now a risk management executive, predicted that whatever replaces the underground space will be able to anticipate and respond to emerging threats, including kinetic threats like a nuclear explosion or plane crash; chemical or biological instruments; or electromagnetic pulses, among other potential concerns, and do so without telegraphing details to potential adversaries.
    


            “You have to think about a facility that can be built in secret, highly classified, that can sustain the current and future state threat environment,” he said.
    


            What will be virtually impossible: learning how much this aspect of construction costs. Trump has offered an ever-growing price tag on the ballroom aspect of the project, which started at $200 million and is now up to $400 million, but that doesn't account for what will happen underground. Trump has made clear that the ballroom will be paid for by private donors, but any subterranean security infrastructure will ultimately be paid for by American taxpayers.
    


            “If you think about trying to mitigate the threats today and the threats for tomorrow, you're really talking about emerging technologies, emerging infrastructure — stuff that may not be commercially available. We're never going to get the line of sight on how much that costs,” Wackrow said.

Live Updates


            • US President Donald Trump tied his ambitions to annex Greenland to his unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in an extraordinary message to Norway's prime minister. Trump said he no longer feels bound “to think purely of Peace.”
    


            • European countries are weighing using their so-called “trade bazooka” after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies, including the UK, until a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland.
    


            • UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies, and that the future status of Greenland belongs to its people and Denmark.
    


            • Meanwhile, an Israeli official said Trump invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin also received an invitation.
    


            NATO will continue to work with Denmark and Greenland on matters relating to the security of the Arctic region, the military alliance's Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Monday.
    


            His comments follow a meeting with Denmark's Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt.
    


                    “We discussed how important the Arctic – including Greenland – is to our collective security and how (Denmark) is stepping up investments in key capabilities,” he posted on X. “We'll continue to work together as allies on these important issues.”
                





            Europe is not interested in picking a “fight” with the US over President Donald Trump's ambitions to annex Greenland, but the bloc will “hold our ground,” according to the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
    


                    “We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground. Europe has a slate of tools to protect its interests,” Kallas said in a social post Monday.
                





            Trump's threat to hit his allies with tariffs unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland is “not the way to go about this,” Kallas said.
    


                    “Denmark and Greenland are not alone,” she said. “Arctic security is a shared transatlantic interest, and one we can discuss with our US allies.”
                





            Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said there are “red lines which can't be crossed,” referencing US President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland. However, he added that he has no intention of escalating the situation.
    


            He said he believed the United Kingdom and the European Union would stand behind Denmark, citing the “strong statement” of support from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
    


            Starmer said earlier Monday that it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies and reaffirmed that any decision about the future status of Greenland “belongs to the people of Greenland.”
    


            Asked if he felt betrayed by the US, Rasmussen said Monday: “I use the word surprised… I have no intention to escalate things.”
    


                    “It's so important that all our allies in the NATO alliance, European Union, stand up for these principles to show the American president you have a desire, you have a vision, you have a request, but you will never be able to achieve that by putting pressure on us,” Rasmussen said.
                





            Greenland's Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen said today that dialogue should prevail as US and Europe clash over President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland and subsequent threat of tariffs on European allies.
    


                    “We don't let ourselves be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,” Nielsen said in a social post referring to Trump's latest announcements.
                





            Nielsen said support for Greenland from other countries and state leaders “means something,” calling it a “clear recognition that Greenland is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions.”
    


                    “The demonstrations at home and in Denmark have shown a strong and dignified unity. Many people have peacefully expressed love for our country and respect for our democracy. I am very grateful for that,” he added.
                





            Three US cardinals have issued a rare joint statement calling for a “genuinely moral foreign policy” for America, citing recent events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland.
    


            “We renounce war as an instrument for narrow national interests and proclaim that military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations,” the cardinals said.
    


            The statement was signed by Cardinals Robert McElroy of Washington, DC, Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark.
    


            The three cardinals quoted from Pope Leo XIV's recent “state of the world” address in the Vatican, where the pontiff warned how “zeal for war is spreading” and the post-Second World War principle that prohibited nations violating the borders of others has been “completely undermined.”
    


            The US' “moral role” in the world, the cardinals state, was now coming “under examination,” while attempts to build peace are being “reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies.”
    


            Their unusual joint declaration comes after both the pope and US bishops have criticized the Trump administration's policy on immigration. McElroy, whose doctoral thesis was published as a book titled “Morality and American Foreign Policy: The Role of Ethics in International Affairs” in 1992, last year described immigration deportations as “morally repugnant.”



            Meanwhile, the US archbishop who has responsibility for the military expressed concern that “service personnel could be put in a situation where they're being ordered to do something that's morally questionable” when it came to any US action against Greenland.
    


            Archbishop Timothy Broglio told the BBC yesterday that “he cannot see any circumstances” that a US operation in Greenland could be a just war, describing Denmark as “an ally.”
    


            European countries are weighing using their “trade bazooka” after US President Trump threatened tariffs on European allies.
    


            But what is this so-called anti-coercion instrument?
    


            The tool — adopted in 2023 with countries like China in mind — can be applied if a third country tries to pressure the European Union or one of its member states “into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment.” It could block some of America's access to EU markets or impose export controls, among a broader list of potential countermeasures.
    


            Trump announced Saturday that he would impose 10% tariffs on February 1 on goods from eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland. It would increase to 25% if an agreement is not reached by June 1.
    


            The types of measures the European Commission can take using this anti-coercion instrument include restricting “foreign direct investment, financial markets, public procurement, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, export controls, and more,” according to the policy.
    


            However, the implementation of the “trade bazooka” could take time to implement.
    


            The European Commission would first need to examine the existence of economic coercion in an individual case. Then the council has a maximum of eight to ten weeks to “expeditiously” implement the act and would request “the coercing third country to stop the coercion,” the policy reads.
    


            Efforts would then be made to consult with the coercing third country to resolve the issue, but “if those efforts do not bear fruit,” the EU would then implement its anti-coercion instrument.
    


            CNN has obtained the full message exchange between Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, writing on behalf of himself and President Alexander Stubb of Finland, and US President Donald Trump. Here's that conversation:
    


Text message from Prime Minister Støre to President Trump [January 18 at 3:48 p.m.]:



«Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine - and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today - with both of us or separately - give us a hint of what you prefer! Best - Alex and Jonas»






Text message from President Trump to Prime Minister Støre [January 18 at 4:15 p.m.]:



«Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States.The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT»






            When US President Donald Trump began his second term last year, he immediately started threatening steep tariffs on goods imported from countries around the globe.
    


            On Saturday, he announced that he would impose 10% tariffs on goods from eight European countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany. Those eight nations had sent troops to Greenland Friday to take part in a joint military exercise on the island over the weekend.
    


            Trump did not specify whether the announced levies would be enacted on top of other tariffs already in existence. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Tariffs are taxes on imported goods or services. In some countries, exports can also be subject to tariffs.
    


            The levies typically amount to a percentage of the value of the import and can vary based on what the imports are and where they come from.
    


            Domestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front. They may choose to absorb those extra costs or pass them on in part or in full to their customers.
    


            Tariff transactions occur at hundreds of points of entry into the United States, designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.
    


            China hit out at the United States today, rejecting the claim that it poses a threat to Greenland.
    


            “We urge the US to stop using the so-called ‘China threat' as a pretext for seeking selfish gains,” China's foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a news briefing in Beijing, according to CNN affiliate CCTV.
    


            The rebuke comes as US President Donald Trump, in a lengthy social media post Saturday, said the United States needed possession of Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian threats in the Arctic and develop what he has called the Golden Dome to protect North America from ballistic missiles.
    


            “China has stated its position on multiple occasions on Greenland. The international law underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter is the foundation of the current international order and must be upheld,” Jiakun added.
    


            There will be a “substantial increase” in the number of Danish troops in Greenland after today, a Danish military spokesperson told CNN, with soldiers being deployed to the Arctic island this evening.
    


            The troops will be sent to the municipality of Kangerlussuaq, the spokesperson said. Kangerlussuaq, in the south-west of the island, is in the Arctic Circle.



            The chief of the Royal Danish Army, Major General Peter Boysen, will be deployed with the soldiers, the spokesperson added.
    


            US President Donald Trump has invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” a senior Israeli official told CNN.
    


            According to the official, the invitation was extended to Netanyahu or another Israeli representative on his behalf. Israel hasn't officially replied yet to be a founding member state, the official said.
    


            Over the weekend, the US extended invitations to multiple world leaders to join the Trump-led board, which is expected to oversee governance and reconstruction of post-war Gaza.
    


            The Kremlin earlier said Russian President Vladimir Putin was also invited to join the committee.
    


For more context: Netanyahu is facing internal political pressure following the advancement of the Gaza ceasefire deal to phase two. On Saturday, he harshly criticized the inclusion of Turkey and Qatar in key roles on the executive board after trying to prevent their involvement in Gaza.
    


            We're getting more updates on the special European Council meeting being convened regarding US-Europe tensions over Greenland.
    


            António Costa, the current president of the European Council (EUCO), called for the extraordinary meeting of EU leaders on “transatlantic relations” to be held in Brussels on Thursday at 1 p.m. ET, according to the council.
    


            Costa has said that after consulting with member states, European leaders are in agreement that US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations.
    


                    “We do not want a trade dispute with the United States of America,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today in Berlin. “But if we are confronted with tariffs that we consider unreasonable, then we are in a position to respond, and that is exactly what we will be discussing in Brussels on Thursday.”
                





            Amid threats from US President Donald Trump that he will impose tariffs on several European countries in his pursuit of acquiring Greenland, a spokesperson for the European Commission has said that the priority among EU leaders is to “engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs.”
    


                    “It's clear from the consultations among EU leaders, including President von der Leyen, that the priority here is to engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs. Why? Because this will ultimately harm consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” Olof Gill said today.
                





            If tariffs are imposed, however, the EU “has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond, because we will do everything necessary to protect EU economic interests,” he said.
    


            European leaders are “consulting intensively,” while “engagement with the US is continuing at all levels,” Gill said.
    


                    “Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint and responsible leadership is what President von der Leyen and indeed the European Union as a whole are all about,” he added.
                





            President Donald Trump's niece has urged Europe to “fight back” following the US leader's threat to impose tariffs on eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland.
    


            Quoting a New York Times headline that reads “European Officials Lean Toward Negotiating, Not Retaliating, Over Trump Threat,” Mary Trump said that she was “so f**king tired” of people trying to negotiate with her uncle.
    


                    “I am so f**king tired of the failed strategy of negotiation and appeasement. It only empowers him. Fight back!” she posted on X on Sunday night.
                





            Stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold – a safe-haven asset – reached a new peak after US President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until a deal was reached for the US purchase of Greenland.
    


            In the United States, where markets are closed Monday, Dow futures were 0.9% down, while S&P 500 futures dropped by a steeper 1.2%.
    


            The US president announced Saturday that he would impose a 10% tariff from February 1 on goods from eight European countries. Trump didn't specify whether the tariff would be on top of what they're already paying.
    


In response, the European Union is considering imposing €93 billion ($108 billion) of previously announced retaliatory tariffs against the United States. French President Emmanuel Macron has also reportedly called for the activation of the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument. Colloquially known as a “trade bazooka,” the instrument could block some of America's access to EU markets or result in export controls, among other potential measures.
    


            “Given their deep economic and financial ties, both the US and Europe have the ability to impose significant pain on each other, but only at great cost to themselves,” Jonas Goltermann, a senior markets economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said in a note Monday.
    


            “As such, the more likely outcome, in our view, is that both sides recognise that a major escalation would be a lose-lose proposition, and that compromise eventually prevails. That would be in line with the pattern around most previous Trump-driven diplomatic dramas.”
    


            US President Donald Trump tied his ambitions to annex Greenland to his so-far unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in an extraordinary message to Norway's prime minister, according to a European diplomat who has seen the note.
    


            “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the message, which was addressed to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
    


            It came in response to a text message Støre had sent to the president opposing his plans to levy new tariffs on European nations who oppose his bid to control Greenland.
    


            The contents of the note were sent to other European diplomats afterwards.
    


            “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,” Trump wrote in the message.
    


                    “I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” the note concluded.

This post has been updated with additional reporting.



            Russian President Vladimir Putin's top economic envoy will travel to the Swiss resort town of Davos to hold meetings with members of the US delegation, sources with knowledge tell CNN.
    


            Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) and Kremlin special envoy will meet Trump administration officials on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, the sources added.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to join US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza, his spokesman said on Monday.
    


            “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
    


            He said the Kremlin is now reviewing the invitation and “hoping to get more details from the US side.”
    


Some context: The establishment of the board, chaired by Trump, is a key step in the United Nations-backed American plan to demilitarize and rebuild Gaza, which was ravaged by two years of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group.
    


            Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent requires it to have good relations with the United States.
    


                    “It is in our national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defense, security and to intelligence,” Starmer said Monday, fielding questions from reporters about whether US President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland might cause a fundamental rupture in relations between the US and the UK, along with other NATO allies.
                





            The prime minister said the UK's nuclear deterrent “is our foremost weapon… when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom, (which is) my primary duty.”
    


                    “That requires us to have a good relationship with the United States,” he said. “But that doesn't mean… that we pretend we don't have differences.”
                





            The prime minister stressed that it is not right for the UK to “choose between the US and Europe,” because it remains allies of both.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it is “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies, after US President Donald Trump said he would impose additional levies on the United Kingdom and several other countries that oppose his plan to acquire Greenland.
    


                    “The use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong. It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland's security as a justification for economic pressure,” Starmer said Monday at a news conference in Downing Street.
                





            Stressing that the UK and US remain “close partners,” Starmer said he needed to set out a principle “that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works.”
    


                    “Any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the people of Denmark alone. That right is fundamental, and we support it,” the prime minister said.
                





            Starmer said that “a trade war is in no one's interest,” and that he had spoken to Trump and European leaders on Sunday “to find a solution rooted in partnership, facts and mutual respect.”
    


            On Saturday, Trump said he will charge an additional 10% tariff on goods from the UK and several other European countries from February 1.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Who can save NATO from Trump as he escalates bid to grab Greenland?","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/19/politics/nato-division-trump-greenland-threat-analysis","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:59 GMT","


            President Donald Trump has pitched NATO into what could become its worst-ever crisis by threatening new tariffs against US allies that oppose his grab for Greenland against the will of its people.
    


            Whether the world's relative peace is endangered by the fracturing of its most powerful military alliance will partly depend on whether Republicans in Congress show rare resolve in challenging their incorrigible president.
    


            Another key factor is whether European leaders, who responded to the latest escalation with steely unity, will threaten consequences for Trump and the US. The European Union is a huge trade bloc, and retaliation could hammer US stock markets that Trump touts as a barometer of economic well-being. But trade reprisals or limiting military cooperation could end up damaging America's allies more than their protector.
    


            European Union ambassadors held emergency consultations in Brussels on Sunday, and several leaders of NATO allies who are friendly with Trump called to express resolve over Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory.
    


            There is palpable alarm on both sides of the Atlantic that NATO could collapse. Such a previously unthinkable scenario would represent a historic win for Russia and China and represent perhaps the most destabilizing outcome of Trump's two White House terms.
    


            There is also concern in Congress about Trump's antics. But are there sufficient senior Republicans so protective of NATO, a bedrock of US global power, that they'd gamble on an exceedingly rare breach with him? Cracks have emerged in Trump's power base in Congress — notably over the Jeffrey Epstein files — but he remains feared by many GOP lawmakers.
    


            Ultimately, however, the parlous fate of the alliance rests on a president who sees US military power as his to wield without legal or constitutional constraints and who disdains NATO as a protection racket. Acquiring Greenland would be a legacy item greater than putting his name on the Kennedy Center or building a new White House ballroom; it would place him alongside Thomas Jefferson and William McKinley as presidents who expanded the territory of the United States.
    


            Trump sent shockwaves across the Atlantic on Saturday by intensifying his aggressive demands for Greenland as he pushes his “Art of the Deal” foreign policy to extremes. He said Saturday he'd impose a 10% tariff on “any and all goods” from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland starting February 1, increasing to 25% on June 1, until an agreement is reached.
    


            Trump has correctly pointed out that many NATO nations took the US security umbrella for granted by running down their armed forces in recent decades. His anger, as well as the threat highlighted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has prompted many member states to promise to substantially increase defense spending.
    


            But by failing to rule out military force to take Greenland, he risks destroying NATO and its Article 5 mutual defense clause over a personal obsession. This is despite no tangible desire among American voters to own the island or to pay for it. They're more worried about high prices a year into Trump's second presidency.
    


            “The president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat. So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that's one thing. But for him to militarily invade would turn Article 5 of NATO on its very head, and in essence, put us at war with NATO itself,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees, told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.
    


            “It would end up abolishing NATO as we know it, an organization that has … protected us from world wars,” McCaul said.
    


            Trump's first-term vice president, Mike Pence, told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that while the US has an interest in controlling and ultimately owning Greenland, Trump's methods were counterproductive. “I do think that the current posture, which I hope will change and abate, does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our NATO allies,” Pence said Sunday.
    


            Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, who heads the US delegation to NATO's parliamentary assembly, agreed that Trump had legitimate national security concerns in Greenland. But he told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “there certainly is no authority that the president has to use military force to seize territory from a NATO country.”
    


            But will Congress do anything to stop Trump?
    


            Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul and Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine are planning to impose speed bumps. They said in a joint appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” that they are discussing a new war powers resolution on Greenland. They also plan to challenge the new tariffs and highlight a law that stipulates a president can't withdraw from NATO without congressional approval.
    


            Paul said Trump was “rattling the cage” by refusing ruling out taking Greenland by force. But he added: “I've heard of no Republican support for that, even though most hawkish members of our caucus have said they won't support that.”
    


            Some Republicans hope Trump is merely playing real estate shark. “I think it's just the way Trump deals with things. I mean, look, he's gotten good deals done by taking an aggressive position,” Florida Sen. Rick Scott told Fox News.
    


            But an administration empowered by topping Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro seems to have moved on from master dealmaker mode. Days after Trump said he wanted Greenland because it was “psychologically important for me,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday appeared to confirm perceptions that the administration thinks the US is so strong it can take what it wants.
    


            “The United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world. We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. The US projects strength,” Bessent said on “Meet the Press.”
    


            NATO has faced many tensions in its nearly 77 years. In the Suez Crisis in 1956, the US opposed a British-French invasion of parts of Egypt. In the 1990s, some European nations were frustrated about Washington's initial reluctance to involve NATO to stop the war in the former Yugoslavia. In the early 2000s, after a period of soul-searching over its post-Cold War role, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in defense of the US after the 9/11 attacks. It later led the Afghan campaign. But angry divides flared over Iraq.
    


            Trump's pressure on NATO follows a banner period for the alliance after Sweden and Finland joined during the Biden administration following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The current split is unprecedented because none of the leaders who nurtured it for seven decades could fathom the scenario of one member threatening another. That the belligerent party is the United States — the most important member state — makes the situation even more unbelievable.
    


            Trump's fixation on Greenland, which is becoming more important as a race for control of the Arctic speeds up, makes strategic sense. But his rationale for why the United States must have it for itself is more opaque.
    


            The US has treaties with Denmark that allow it to send troops there. Trump says the island is vital for his Golden Dome missile defense project. But a US Space Force base there already focuses on missile early warning systems. Greenland and Denmark are also open to commercial deals with the US to exploit rare earth minerals. And Trump's claim that China and Russia might invade is disingenuous because the island is already NATO territory the alliance would defend.
    


            But Bessent advanced a stunning rationale that implies Trump could act unilaterally on any global issue. “The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency. It is a strategic decision by the president,” he told NBC. Trump's invoking of emergency powers to impose tariffs as part of his trade wars is the key point at issue as the Supreme Court deliberates on whether the president's tariffs usurped Congress' trade prerogatives.
    


            In the wake of Trump's demands for Greenland, European leaders who've spent the last year trying to appease and flatter the president hardened their tone.
    


            The issue is not just about territory. It cuts to the core of the European ideal, forged through centuries of continental bloodshed, that nations and peoples have the right to self-determination and are not mere vassals of all-powerful states.
    


            President Emmanuel Macron drew a striking parallel between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's territorial gangsterism when he wrote on X that France favored the independence and sovereignty of all nations. “No intimidation or threat will influence us—neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” he said.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — each of whom has tried to befriend Trump — both spoke to him by phone. Meloni, a populist conservative, said she “doesn't agree” with Greenland-related tariffs.
    


            But it will take more than words to appease Trump. Can Republicans on Capitol Hill or NATO allies show him that there will be personal and political consequences for making the annexation of Greenland a top priority?
    


            There are signs Trump's threats could scupper the ratification of an EU-US trade accord that offered the US advantageous conditions — partly because Europe knew it could not risk the withdrawal of US defense support. The collapse of the deal or retaliatory tariffs could hurt Trump by spiking prices of imports in a midterm election year in which voters have soured on his economic performance.
    


            A splintering of the NATO alliance could ultimately cause problems for the United States if it involved the closure of military bases in Britain, Germany or elsewhere that the US uses to project force in the Middle East and Africa. And it could saddle the stretched US military with sole responsibility for defending the Arctic.
    


            A severing of transatlantic ties would also complicate some of Trump's other priorities, such as his desire for European support and funding for his initiative to stabilize and rebuild Gaza. And if he really is serious about ending the Ukraine war, it can't be done fairly without Europe. NATO alliance members might also turn away from US arms purchases and investment.
    


            Yet NATO states remain deeply vulnerable to Trump. Decades of underspending on defense have left them reliant on America's military might 80 years after World War II and nearly 35 after the Cold War ended.
    


            There is a genuine will in Europe to be more independent. But it will take decades to build scale and all-around resilience, assuming weak governments can convince disgruntled voters to make sacrifices for defense spending.
    


            Ultimately, this unbalanced dynamic in the Western alliance has as much to do with the current impasse as the off-the-rails American president.

According to two European officials, Trump's message to Gahr Støre read in part: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” It concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”

Starmer's comments came after Trump has argued repeatedly that the U.S. needs control of Greenland for its national security. He has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. Trump has not ruled out military action.

U.S. President Donald Trump linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year's decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, telling Norway's prime minister that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” in a text message released on Monday.

Trump's message to Jonas Gahr Støre appears to ratchet up a standoff between Washington and its closest allies over his threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark. On Saturday, Trump announced a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight nations that have rallied around Denmark and Greenland, including Norway.

Those countries issued a forceful rebuke. 

The White House has not ruled taking control of the strategic Arctic island by force. Asked whether Trump could invade Greenland, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said on Monday that “you can't leave anything out until the president himself has decided to leave anything out.” 

Rasmussen, speaking to reporters following a meeting with his British counterpart Yvette Cooper in London, encouraged Washington to instead discuss solutions. 

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also sought to de-escalate tensions on Monday. “I think this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion,” he said, adding that he did not believe military action would occur.

In a sign of how tensions have increased in recent days, thousands of Greenlanders marched over the weekend in protest of any effort to take over their island. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Monday that the tariff threats would not change their stance.




“We will not be pressured,” he wrote.

Meanwhile, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business, minerals, energy, justice and equality, told The Associated Press that she was moved by the quick response of allies to the tariff threat and said it showed that countries realize “this is about more than Greenland.”

“I think a lot of countries are afraid that if they let Greenland go, what would be next?”

Trump's Sunday message to Gahr Støre, released by the Norwegian government, read in part: “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”

It concluded: “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”

The Norwegian leader said Trump's message was a reply to an earlier missive sent on behalf of himself and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, in which they conveyed their opposition to the tariff announcement, pointed to a need to de-escalate, and proposed a telephone conversation among the three leaders.

“Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,” the Norwegian leader said in a statement. “As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.”

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is an independent body whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the president's approach in Greenland during a brief Q&A with reporters in Davos, Switzerland, which is hosting the World Economic Forum meeting this week.

“I think it's a complete canard that the president would be doing this because of the Nobel,” Bessent said, immediately after saying he did not “know anything about the president's letter to Norway.”

Bessent insisted Trump “is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States,” adding that “we are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.”

Trump has openly coveted the peace prize, which the committee awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last year. Last week, Machado presented her Nobel medal to Trump, who said he planned to keep it, though the committee said the prize can't be revoked, transferred or shared with others.

In his latest threat of tariffs, Trump indicated they would be retaliation for last week's deployment of symbolic numbers of troops from the European countries to Greenland — though he also suggested that he was using the tariffs as leverage to negotiate with Denmark.

European governments said that the troops traveled to the island to assess Arctic security, part of a response to Trump's own concerns about interference from Russia and China.

Starmer on Monday called Trump's threat of tariffs “completely wrong” and said that a trade war is in no one's interest. 

He added that “being pragmatic does not mean being passive and partnership does not mean abandoning principles.” 

Six of the eight countries targeted are part of the 27-member European Union, which operates as a single economic zone in terms of trade. European Council President Antonio Costa said Sunday that the bloc's leaders expressed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion.” He announced a summit for Thursday evening.

Starmer indicated that Britain, which is not part of the EU, is not planning to consider retaliatory tariffs. 

“My focus is on making sure we don't get to that stage,” he said.

Denmark's defense minister and Greenland's foreign minister are expected to meet NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Monday, a meeting that was planned before the latest escalation.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Red baseball caps spoofing Donald Trump's iconic MAGA hats have become a symbol of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the U.S. president's threat to seize the frozen territory.

The caps reading “Make America Go Away” — parodying Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan — have gained popularity along with several variants on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration held in freezing weather in the Danish capital.

European governments are rallying behind Denmark, citing the need to defend Arctic regions and warning that threats against Greenland undermine Western security.

Protesters, however, are less diplomatic.

“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don't like the president of the United States,” said 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest Saturday.

The mock hats were created by Copenhagen vintage clothing store owner Jesper Rabe Tonnesen. Early batches flopped last year — until the Trump administration recently escalated its rhetoric over Greenland. Now there are popping up everywhere.

“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn't a joke — it's not reality TV, it's actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do?” Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”




Demand suddenly surged from a trickle to selling out in the space of one weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand.”

The original version designed by Tonnesen featured a play on words: “Nu det NUUK!” — a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it's enough,” substituting Nuuk, Greenland's tiny capital.

Protesters at Saturday's rally waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and carried handmade signs mocking U.S. claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia.

“No Means No,” read one sign. Another declared, “Make America Smart Again.”

Wearing one of the spoof hats, protester Kristian Boye, 49, said the gathering in front of Copenhagen City Hall struck a lighthearted tone while delivering a serious message.

“I'm here to support the Greenlanders, who are going through a very hard time right now,” he said. “They are being threatened with having their country invaded. I think it's totally unacceptable.”

DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind.

The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year's theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them.

Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI's impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries.

“It's really going to be a discussion at a very important moment ... geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we're in a transition. Some people think we've already entered a new era. But I think it's undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.”

Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike.

Trump's peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center.

The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics.

Critics will also be nearby: He's blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, was set to speak but organizers on Monday canceled his appearance, saying “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. 

The two likeliest counterweights to Trump's administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China's “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. 

The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge.

This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. 

The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. 

The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand.

Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.”

“People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we' to ‘me'.”

The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public.

Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world's richest people.

Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world's population lives in poverty, the group said.

The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies.

The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying.

With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. 

As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. 

Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. 

Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week.

Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. 

“It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.”

Spanish police said Monday that at least 39 people are confirmed dead in a high-speed rail collision the previous night in the south of the country when the tail end of a train jumped the track, causing another train speeding past in the opposite direction to derail.

A high-speed train derailed on Sunday evening and jumped onto the track in the opposite direction, slamming into an oncoming train, killing at least 21 people and injuring dozens more, the country's transport minister said.

ADAMUZ, Spain (AP) — Spanish police said Monday that at least 39 people are confirmed dead in a high-speed rail collision the previous night in the south of the country when the tail end of a train jumped the track, causing another train speeding past in the opposite direction to derail.




The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 4-meter (13-foot) slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters (feet) from the crash site, Andalusia regional president Juanma Moreno said, describing the wreckage a “mass of twisted metal” with bodies likely still to be found inside.

Efforts to recover the bodies continued Monday, and the death toll could rise. Authorities are also focusing on attending hundreds of distraught family members and have asked for them to provide DNA samples to help identify victims.

The crash took place Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.

The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said. That collision knocked its first two carriages off the track. Puente said that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.

Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.




The accident shook a nation which leads Europe in high-speed train mileage and takes pride in a network that is considered at the cutting edge of rail transport.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash.

“Today is a day of pain for all of Spain,” Sánchez said on a visit to Adamuz, a village near the accident site, where many locals helped emergency services handle the influx of distraught and hurt passengers overnight.

Moreno, the regional leader, said Monday morning that emergency services were still searching for bodies.

“Here at ground zero, when you look at this mass of twisted iron, you see the violence of the impact,” Moreno said. “The impact was so incredibly violent that we have found bodies hundreds of meters away.”

Video released by the Civil Guard showed the worst-hit carriages shredded open, train seats cast on the gravel packing under the tracks. One carriage lay on its side, bent around a large concrete pillar, with debris scattered around the area.

Passengers reported climbing out of smashed windows, with some using emergency hammers to break the glass.

Andalusia's regional emergency services said 43 people remained hospitalized, 12 of whom were in intensive care units. Another 79 passengers were discharged by Monday afternoon, authorities said.

Train services Monday between Madrid and cities in Andalusia were canceled, causing large disruptions. Spanish airline Iberia added flights to Seville and another two to Malaga to help stranded travelers. Some bus companies also reinforced their services in the south.

Transport Minister Puente early Monday said the cause of the crash was unknown.

He called it “a truly strange” incident because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May. He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the Italian-owned company Iryo, while the second train was part of Spain's public train company, Renfe.

According to Puente, the back part of the first train derailed and crashed into the head of the other train. An investigation into the cause could take a month, he said.

The Spanish Union of Railway Drivers told the AP that in in August, it sent a letter asking Spain's national railway operator to investigate flaws on train lines across the country and to reduce speeds at certain points until the tracks were fully repaired. Those recommendations were made for high-speed train lines, including the one where Sunday's accident took place, the union said.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of Renfe, told Spanish public radio RNE that both trains were well under the speed limit of 250 kph (155 mph); one was going 205 kph (127 mph), the other 210 kph (130 mph). He also said that “human error could be ruled out.”

The incident “must be related to the moving equipment of Iryo or the infrastructure,” he said.

Iryo issued a statement on Monday saying that its train was manufactured in 2022 and passed its latest safety check on Jan. 15. 

Various Spaniards who had loved ones on the trains posted messages on social media saying they were unaccounted for and pleading for any information.

The Civil Guard opened an office in Cordoba, the nearest city to the crash, as well as Madrid, Malaga, Huelva and Seville for family members of the missing to seek help and leave DNA samples.

“There were moments when we had to remove the dead to get to the living,” Francisco Carmona, firefighter chief of Cordoba, told Onda Cero radio. 

A sports center in Adamuz, a town in the province of Cordoba, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) south of Madrid, was turned into a makeshift hospital. The Spanish Red Cross set up a help center offering assistance to emergency services and people seeking information. 

“The scene was horrific. It was terrible,” Adamuz mayor Rafael Moreno told The Associated Press and other reporters. “People asking and begging for help. Those leaving the wreckage. Images that will always stay in my mind.”

One passenger had been treated in a local hospital along with her sister before she returned to Adamuz with hopes of finding her lost dog. She was limping and had a small bandage on her cheek, as seen by an AP reporter.

Pope Leo XIV expressed his condolences for the dead and hope for the quick recovery of the injured, the Vatican said in a statement.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said she was following the “terrible news.”

Spanish King Felipe VI expressed his condolences Monday, adding that the royal house was looking into a visit to Adamuz.

“I understand the desperation of the families and the number of injured people who have suffered this accident, and we are all really worried,” the king said, speaking from Athens.

The Spanish flag was flown at half-staff in front of Parliament in Madrid for the victims on Monday.

Spain has spent decades investing heavily in high-speed trains and currently has the largest rail network in Europe for trains moving over 250 kph (155 mph), with more than 3,900 kilometers (2,400 miles) of track, according to the International Union of Railways.

The network is a popular, competitively priced and safe mode of transport. Renfe said more than 25 million passengers took one of its high-speed trains in 2024.

Iryo became the first private competitor in high-speed to Renfe in Spain in 2022.

Sunday's accident was the first with deaths on a high-speed train since Spain's high-speed rail network opened its first line in 1992.

Spain's worst train accident this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country's northwest. An investigation concluded the train was traveling 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks. That stretch of track was not high speed.

BANGKOK (AP) — European shares mostly fell and U.S. stock futures skidded Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 10% extra tariff on imports from eight European countries because they oppose having America take control of Greenland.

Germany's DAX lost 1.3% to close at 24,960.33 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.9% to 8,101.96. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.4% to 10,190.26. 

Among U.S stock futures, the S&P 500 was down 1% as of 11:48 a.m. Eastern Time, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.2%. U.S. stock markets are closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 

Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland because of their opposition to American control of Greenland.

The European countries targeted by Trump blasted his threat to raise tariffs, saying they “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” The unusually strong joint statement was the most forceful rebuke from the European allies since Trump returned to the White House almost a year ago. 

Trump's moves are testing the strategic alignment and institutional trust underlying support from Europe, the largest trading partner and provider of financing to the United States, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

“In a world where geopolitical cohesion within the Western alliance is no longer taken for granted, the willingness to recycle capital indefinitely into U.S. assets becomes less automatic. This is not a short-term liquidation story. It is a slow rebalancing story, and those are far more consequential,” Innes said.




In Asia, shares were mixed after China reported that its economy expanded at a 5% annual pace in 2025, though it slowed in the last quarter. Strong exports, despite Trump's higher tariffs on imports from China, helped to offset relatively weak domestic demand. 

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.1% to 26,563.90. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.3% to 4,114.00. 

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 declined 0.7% to 53,583.57. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was due to hold a news conference later Monday as she prepares to dissolve the parliament for a snap election next month. 

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.3% to 4,904.66, pushing further into record territory on strong gains for tech-related companies. Computer chip maker SK Hynix climbed 1.1%. 

Taiwan's Taiex added 0.7%, while the Sensex in India fell 0.6%. 

On Friday, stocks edged lower on Wall Street as the first week of corporate earnings season ended with markets trading near record levels.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% and the Dow industrials lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%. They all notched weekly losses, while smaller company stocks fared better. The Russell 2000 eked out a 0.1% gain. 

Technology stocks were the strongest forces behind the market's moves throughout most of the day. Several big technology stocks made strong gains and helped offset losses elsewhere.

Earnings updates might give investors a better sense of how consumers are spending their money and how businesses are faring with persisting inflation and higher tariffs. Results from the technology sector are being scrutinized by investors trying to figure out whether the high stock prices fueled by the craze around artificial intelligence are justified.

This week will bring a broader mix of earnings from airlines, industrial companies, and technology companies. United Airlines, 3M, and Intel are all scheduled to release their quarterly earnings results.

The U.S. central bank will get another update on inflation this week with the government's release of the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE. It is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure for inflation.

The Fed's next policy meeting is in two weeks, when it is expected to keep its current benchmark interest rate as it strives to balance a slowing jobs market with stubbornly high inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% goal.

In other dealings Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 12 cents to $59.58 per barrel. Price moves have settled down after a spate of volatility during widespread protests in Iran against that country's leadership.

Brent crude, the international standard, added 5 cents to $64.17 a barrel.

The price of gold resumed its upward climb, gaining 1.8%, while the price of silver jumped 6.2%. 

The U.S. dollar rose to 158.10 Japanese yen from 157.93 yen. The euro rose to $1.1643 from $1.1581.

As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon's legacy.

In the year since Donald Trump's second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized. 

One year ago, Trump's executive orders, “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” and “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump's birthday.

The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city's Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for. 

Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon's plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump's comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.

“I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven't always been perfect, but we've always strived to be this more perfect union, and that's what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland's first Black governor and only the nation's third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation's oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration's priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement. 

“From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank is encouraging the holiday's focus to stay solely on King himself. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago.

But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King's ambition for the country, Hafera argued.

“I think efforts should be conducted in the spirit of what Martin Luther King actually believed and what he preached. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don't judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.”

The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn't, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy.

“As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said. 

The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, has planned its events under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action.” Organizers planned demonstrations in Atlanta, Chicago and Oakland, California, among other cities, over the weekend and Monday.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK's radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

For the first time in its 60-year history, Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King dinner. Over the years, the event drew notable guest speakers including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and activist Angela Davis. 

The reasoning was “budget constraints,” according to a social media post by the school's Black Student Union. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported. 

Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. But a member of the church's “social justice and peace committee” told NewsCenterMaine.com that the pastor was concerned about people's safety amid rumors of ICE agents being in the area.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether. 

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. The museum is located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968. The museum is offering free admission on the holiday, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.

Buffalo Bills defensive lineman Jordan Phillips appeared to be upset with the organization's decision to fire head coach Sean McDermott on Monday following a tough playoff exit.

The Bills made the decision nearly two days after Buffalo lost to the Denver Broncos in overtime. It marked another season where the Bills have bowed out of the postseason amid Super Bowl expectations.

Phillips made his feelings known on Instagram.

""This s--- here is so stupid honestly sickening,"" Phillips wrote in a post on his Instagram Stories. ""The best coach I've ever been around.""

Phillips joined the Bills for his third stint in the middle of the 2024 season. He played for the Dallas Cowboys for two games before he was released and re-signed with the Bills. Phillips played in 11 games this season but his year was cut short due to an ankle injury.

McDermott was the head coach in each of Phillips' stints with the Bills.

Buffalo will embark on its first head-coaching search since the 2017 offseason.

""Sean has done an admirable job of leading our football team for the past 9 seasons,"" team owner Terry Pegula said in a statement. ""But I feel we are in need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level. We owe that to our players and to Bills Mafia.

""Sean helped change the mindset of this organization and was instrumental in the Bills becoming a perennial playoff team. I respect all the work, loyalty and attention to detail he showed for this team and the community. I wish Sean, Jamie and his family all the best.""

Wilbur Wood, a three-time All-Star pitcher who made opposing batters swing and miss with a nasty knuckleball, has died, the Chicago White Sox announced. He was 84.

Wood spent 17 seasons in the majors from 1961 to 1978, spending 12 seasons with the White Sox. He also played for the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates.

""The White Sox send our condolences to the family, friends and fans of 3x All-Star Wilbur Wood, who has passed away at the age of 84,"" the team said on social media.

Wilbur made his debut with the Red Sox in 1961 as a 19-year-old pitcher and then found himself with the Pirates in his early 20s. But he made his biggest impact with the White Sox.

He started as a reliever for the White Sox. He led the majors in 1968 when he appeared in 88 games and then led the American League the next two years when he appeared in 76 games in 1969 and 77 games in 1970.

Wood was thrust into the starting role in 1971 and did his best to perfect the knuckleball to put less stress on his throwing arm. He turned into an incredible workhorse pitcher, leading the majors in games started from 1972 to 1975. He won at least 20 games from 1971 through 1974.

He suffered a fractured kneecap on a line drive early in the 1976 season. When he returned to the mound, Wood began to struggle. His ERA ballooned to 5.20 in 28 games in 1978, which would be the final season of his career.

He finished his career with a 3.24 ERA and 1,411 strikeouts. The 376.2 innings he pitched during the 1972 season were the most by a starter in a single season in the Live Ball Era (since 1920), according to MLB.com.

Tom Brady and Colin Cowherd discuss Drake Maye's first playoff appearance and ask if he can continue his winning streak in the playoffs against a stout Texans Defense. 

NFL legend Troy Aikman brought up the harsh reality the Houston Texans will have to address in the offseason following their brutal loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday.

Aikman, who is a color commentator for ESPN, summarized C.J. Stroud's play against the Patriots and made clear that the powers that be in the Texans' organization will have to make some tough decisions in the offseason.

""DeMeco Ryans and Nick Caserio, they've got some tough decisions they gotta make about this team on the offensive side of the ball,"" Aikman said. ""They replaced Bobby Slowick last year after his two years as the offensive coordinator.

""C.J. Stroud has been chasing his rookie success for the last two years. He's not been the same player. We've not seen the development from him. There's a reason for that, and it has to be addressed.""

Stroud had four interceptions in the 28-16 loss to the Patriots. He was 20-of-47 with 212 passing yards and one touchdown pass. While the defense gave Houston plenty of chances to score points and make it a close game, Stroud was never able to elevate the offense.

The one-time Pro Bowler also struggled against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC wild-card round, fumbling the ball five times and throwing an interception in a 30-6 win.

""Seven turnovers in the two playoff games,"" Aikman added. ""Your most important games of the year, you can't just overcome that kind of quarterback play.""

Ryans backed Stroud after the loss to New England.

""C.J.'s our guy,"" Ryans said. ""I believed that he could come back out in the second half and flip it.""

Stroud will enter an offseason with the possibility of getting a major contract extension. He has 10,876 passing yards and 62 passing touchdowns in 46 career games. He's 3-3 in playoff starts but has never made it out of the divisional round.

A hiker was found dead in the remote mountains of Southern California over the weekend after searching for friends who had gotten lost on a trail, according to authorities.

Deputies responded just before 8:30 p.m. Saturday to a call about a missing hiker near State Route 74 in Anza, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said.

The caller said four members of their group had set out on a hike early that morning and failed to return. Concerned they were in distress, another member of the group went searching for them.

The sheriff's Aviation Unit and Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit launched a search.

The Buffalo Bills fired head coach Sean McDermott on Monday after the team's heartbreaking playoff loss to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round.

OutKick confirmed McDermott's departure.

The Bills failed to get back to the AFC Championship Game after losing to the Broncos in overtime, following a controversial interception call. The defeat marked another crushing blow to McDermott's tenure as the Bills' head coach.

Buffalo posted a portion of McDermott's press conference following the controversial call.

""I'm saying it because I'm standing up for Buffalo. I'm standing up for us. What went on is not how it should go down,"" he said.

McDermott took the job before the start of the 2017 season. Buffalo only finished under .500 once since then. He helped guide the Bills to the playoffs in eight of the nine seasons. The team made the conference title game twice but never got back to the Super Bowl.

NFL fans had confidence that the Bills could have been Super Bowl contenders going into the 2025 season. The Bills' odds got better when their nemesis, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, was lost for the season with a knee injury.

Buffalo fell short in winning the AFC East – falling to the New England Patriots. They made the playoffs via the wild card and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by three points. But the loss to the Broncos ultimately doomed McDermott's tenure as head coach.

The next Bills head coach will take over the next few years of Josh Allen's career. Allen won the MVP award last season and was in the running for most of this season. The team is in desperate need of a top wide receiver to couple with Allen and it is expected to be addressed going into the offseason.

Terron Armstead joins Jason McIntyre to discuss the matchups between the Broncos and Bills, Bears and 49ers, and Sam Darnold's oblique injury. 

NFL rules analyst Walt Anderson weighed in on the controversial interception ruling in overtime of the Denver Broncos' victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday night.

Broncos defensive back Ja'Quan McMillian took the ball away from Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks on a deep pass from Josh Allen. It appeared that Cooks had come down with the ball and that McMillian had taken it away after Cooks completed the catch. But NFL officials ruled that McMillian had intercepted the pass and created the turnover.

Denver came down the field and scored the game-winning field goal to advance to the AFC Championship Game.

Anderson appeared on the NFL Network and explained that Cooks never had complete control of the ball as he hit the ground and because the ball was still loose in his arms, McMillian was able to secure it for the interception.

He also addressed the issue of why there was no proper explanation of the play. Head referee Carl Cheffers didn't address the play to the crowd or the TV audience. Anderson said replay assistant and officials in New York reviewed the play quickly and made the call.

""Replay has all of these angles to take a look and see ‘was the ruling on the field wrong, or was the ruling on the field correct?'"" Anderson said. ""If you can confirm that the ruling on the field is correct, they really want to move the game along, and they don't want to have unnecessary stoppages.""

BILLS DOOMED BY BIZARRE INTERCEPTION IN PLAYOFF LOSS TO BRONCOS

Bills head coach Sean McDermott was irate over the process of how the call was confirmed. He wanted officials to take a long look at the play, which is why he said he took a timeout after the interception.

""It would seem logical to me… that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it, just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium to there are on the same page. That's too big of a play, in my estimation, and a play that decided the game potentially as well, to not even slow it down,"" McDermott said.

""It's hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled. If it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down just to make sure that we have this right? That would have made a lot of sense to me, to make sure that we have this thing right. Because that's a pivotal play in the game. We have the ball at the 20, maybe kicking a game-winning field goal right there. So I'll just leave it at that.""

But he did not leave it at that. In fact, according to the Buffalo News, the coach called the outlet from the team plane and berated the officials even more.

""That play is not even close,"" he told the outlet. ""That's a catch all the way. I sat in my locker and I looked at it probably 20 times, and nobody can convince me that that ball is not caught and in possession of Buffalo.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","If populism is so great, why are blue states so unaffordable?","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/4420320/if-populism-great-why-blue-states-unaffordable/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

Coming off a successful round of elections in 2025 and a government shutdown triumph, the Democratic Party seems to be exhibiting a united front. But appearances belie reality. Beyond the headlines, a civil war is raging between the “abundance” wing and the “populist” wing of the party. After a strong effort by the abundance crowd last year, the populists are pushing back hard and appear to have the upper hand.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) issued a blistering denunciation of abundance Democrats at the National Press Club this month, accusing them of “watering down our economic agenda and sucking up to the rich and powerful.” She even named names, singling out for disapprobation venture capitalist Reid Hoffman and authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, who wrote the book on abundance.

To the extent that abundance is about “making government more effective,” Warren is for it. But she argued that abundance has become a “rallying cry” for “wealthy donors and corporate-aligned Democrats who are putting big-time muscle behind Democrats more favorable to big business.” She then specifically mentioned Hoffman's support for reforming regulations that are impeding data center construction. Warren argued that data centers drive up utility costs and should therefore be opposed. Fellow populist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has even called for an outright ban on new data center construction.

Warren was right, in a narrow sense, that data centers increase demand for electricity. But as long as utilities can also increase supply, this does not have to mean higher electricity costs for consumers. Almost all economic growth involves higher energy use. Every leap in living standards, from agriculture to steam power to electricity, came not from using less energy, but from learning how to produce more of it reliably and cheaply.

What consumers really need is permitting reform so it's easier and less expensive to build new power plants and transmission lines, whether those new energy sources are gas, nuclear, or solar power. Populist Democrats oppose new energy production unless it is “clean,” but useful as those sources may be in an all-of-the-above policy, they cannot, alone, keep up with rising demand.

The contrast between populist and abundance Democrats on housing is equally stark. Populist New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani wants to make the city cheaper to live in by freezing rents and tightening rent control. Abundance Democrats would instead increase supply by deregulating the city's burdensome Uniform Land Use Review Procedure and the state's State Environmental Quality Review Act.

There is even a divide on how populist and abundance Democrats approach healthcare. Populist Democrats see high costs as a problem of corporate power and profiteering, so they emphasize price controls, tougher regulation, and expanding public options. Abundance Democrats see high costs as a problem of scarce capacity and inefficient delivery, so they focus on increasing supply by training more providers, building more facilities, and cutting red tape that slows care.

The common theme running through all these issues is that abundance Democrats want to get burdensome government regulations out of the way so that private actors can increase supply and lower costs. That is the right approach, and it is far from saying we broadly agree with any wing of the Democratic Party. Populist Democrats, on the other hand, think greed and inequality cause high prices, and can be solved through price controls and redistribution. This is just the age-old politics of envy and the siren song of statists who prefer oligarchic government to free people and free enterprise.

Sens. Chris Murphy (D-CT), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Tina Smith (D-MN) joined Warren to release a memo backing populist Democratic policies over abundance policies. They believe Democrats can win control of Congress in November if they argue that “billionaires and big corporations” are to blame for high prices and that the solution is higher taxes and more regulations.

KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON STATE VOTER ROLLS

We hope Republicans will respond by asking Democrats how their populist policies are working in states they control. California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Massachusetts are some of the most expensive states in the country to live in, especially when it comes to housing and energy costs. If taxing billionaires and breaking up big corporations is the key to affordability, why are Democratic states the most unaffordable places to be?

Populists want voters to believe affordability is a morality play: greedy corporations versus heroic regulators. But blue states are living proof that this story fails in practice just as badly as it fails in points of morality and principle. Where Democrats govern, they don't build, they block. Prices rise because supply is strangled. Until Democrats can make affordability a reality in the states they already run, they should not try to force it on the rest of us.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Will Republicans in Congress ever step in?

Let me begin by quoting, in full, a letter that the president of the United States of America sent yesterday to the prime minister of Norway, Jonas Gahr Støre. The text was forwarded by the White House National Security Council to ambassadors in Washington, and was clearly intended to be widely shared. Here it is:

Dear Jonas:

Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it's only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT

One could observe many things about this document. One is the childish grammar, including the strange capitalizations (“Complete and Total Control”). Another is the loose grasp of history. Donald Trump did not end eight wars. Greenland has been Danish territory for centuries. Its residents are Danish citizens who vote in Danish elections. There are many “written documents” establishing Danish sovereignty in Greenland, including some signed by the United States. In his second term, Trump has done nothing for NATO—an organization that the U.S. created and theoretically leads, and that has only ever been used in defense of American interests. If the European members of NATO have begun spending more on their own defense (budgets to which the U.S. never contributed), that's because of the threat they feel from Russia.

Eliot A. Cohen: How to understand Trump's obsession with Greenland

Yet what matters isn't the specific phrases, but the overall message: Donald Trump now genuinely lives in a different reality, one in which neither grammar nor history nor the normal rules of human interaction now affect him. Also, he really is maniacally, unhealthily obsessive about the Nobel Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, not the Norwegian government and certainly not the Danish government, determines the winner of that prize. Yet Trump now not only blames Norway for failing to give it to him, but is using it as a justification for an invasion of Greenland.

Think about where this is leading. One possibility, anticipated this morning by financial markets, is a damaging trade war. Another is an American military occupation of Greenland. Try to imagine it: The U.S. Marines arrive in Nuuk, the island's capital. Perhaps they kill some Danes; perhaps some American soldiers die too. And then what? If the invaders were Russians, they would arrest all of the politicians, put gangsters in charge, shoot people on the street for speaking Danish, change school curricula, and carry out a fake referendum to rubber-stamp the conquest. Is that the American plan too? If not, then what is it? This would not be the occupation of Iraq, which was difficult enough. U.S. troops would need to force Greenlanders, citizens of a treaty ally, to become American against their will.

For the past year, American allies around the world have tried very hard to find a theory that explains Trump's behavior. Isolationism, neo-imperialism, and patrimonialism are all words that have been thrown around. But in the end, the president himself defeats all attempts to describe a “Trump doctrine.” He is locked into a world of his own, determined to “win” every encounter, whether in an imaginary competition for the Nobel Peace Prize or a protest from the mother of small children objecting to his masked, armed paramilitary in Minneapolis. These contests matter more to him than any long-term strategy. And of course, the need to appear victorious matters much more than Americans' prosperity and well-being.

Read: Denmark's army chief says he's ready to defend Greenland

The people around Trump could find ways to stop him, as some did in his first term, but they seem too corrupt or too power-hungry to try. That leaves Republicans in Congress as the last barrier. They owe it to the American people, and to the world, to stop Trump from acting out his fantasy in Greenland and doing permanent damage to American interests. He is at risk of alienating friends in not only Europe but also India, whose leader he also snubbed for failing to nominate him for a Nobel Prize, as well as South Korea, Japan, Australia. Years of careful diplomacy, billions of dollars in trade, are now at risk because senators and representatives who know better have refused to use the powers they have to block him. Now is the time.

Erratic though the president may sound, the Trumpian worldview is comprehensible.

European leaders are in a dither, understandably but inexcusably, about Donald Trump's threats to take Greenland by force, and to use tariffs to slap around anyone who objects: understandably, because no previous president would ever have acted this way; inexcusably, because a clear if unpalatable solution lies right before them.

If European countries were to permanently deploy, say, 5,000 soldiers armed with surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles to Greenland, keeping them there with orders to fight invading American soldiers to the last round of ammunition, Trump would not order the paratroops and the Marines to assault that frozen wasteland—too many body bags. If they were willing to put comparable economic sanctions in place—denying American companies access to Europe's economy, still collectively the world's third largest—he would back down from those threats as well. Such policies go against the grain of a continent that is, to use the word popularized by the British military historian Michael Howard, debellated, but that's the world they are in.

The Greenland episode, disgraceful and shameful as it is, should be seen in the context of Trump's other foreign-policy escapades—the capturing of Nicolás Maduro; the bombing of the Iranian nuclear program; the attempt to rebuild and reorient war-shattered Gaza; the on-again, off-again relationships with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky; the tariff bazookas that get downgraded to squirt guns with China. Erratic as the president sounds, the Trumpian worldview is comprehensible and even, in some respects, predictable.

Trump is an ignorant man; unlike many other would-be or actual dictators, he does not read books and has difficulty writing more than a few badly spelled sentences on social media. But he does intuit certain truths, and one must give him credit for those, because he is not stupid and they animate his policy. Greenland really has been neglected by Denmark and, since after the American Civil War, has been coveted by the United States. The Iranian nuclear program was a regional and in some respects global menace, and, after a week and a half of Israel softening up, was vulnerable to a single heavy punch. Europe has long underspent on defense, and where American cajoling for decades had not worked, a few face slaps succeeded.

Trump's domestic political gift is the feral instinct for weakness that characterizes most authoritarians. That instinct is shakier in international affairs, but it shapes the way in which he views the world. With an image of American industrial and military power that is rooted in the world of several generations ago, he has enormous confidence in American strength and therefore assumes that bullying is preferable to negotiation, unless you are up against someone who is as tough as you, even if less muscle-bound.

He knows what he hates in foreign affairs—the mealymouthed multilateralism of the Biden administration, its catering to deadbeat allies, and its weakness in fleeing Afghanistan. He likewise despises the caterwauling about liberal values and democracy and the long-term military commitments of the George W. Bush administration. Indeed, although he cannot get over Joe Biden—Trump's insecurities and grievances about the 2020 election and the various prosecutions he has faced between then and now prohibit it—from a foreign-policy point of view, he is at least as anti–George W. Bush as he is anti-Biden. And he despises the reverence for deliberate decision making, consultation with experts, and the willingness to engage in the conventional diplomacy that characterizes both. He views talk of international leadership, much less its practice, as claptrap.

Above all, he has three principal instruments in foreign policy: tariffs and kindred economic sanctions, brief bombing campaigns, and commando raids. He has no tolerance for bloody battles, which is why he will not authorize an Arctic amphibious campaign that faces real opposition. If he is going to negotiate, he will use friends such as Steven Witkoff and family members such as Jared Kushner, who might have an eye for lucrative deals that will enrich the United States and privileged relatives and friends. Nothing wrong with greed-driven foreign policy, in his view.

For Trump, foreign policy is a game of checkers (he does not have the temperament for chess) played one move at a time. The notion of reputational damage is alien to someone whose image was long ago tarnished beyond repair by grifting, lying, bullying, and double-dealing. He surely thinks nothing of the price that Iranian demonstrators (and ultimately the United States) may pay for having promised assistance and then shrugged it off with the claim that the Iranian regime has stopped killing people. (It has not; it just now does so in a way that Trump can claim he cannot see.)

If Trump were a poker player, he would bluff half the time. But games may be the wrong metaphor to understand him, because unless he is up against Xi Jinping and possibly Vladimir Putin, he struggles with the idea that other people have agency. In 2015, a senior politician who knew Trump well described to me a small dinner he attended at Mar-a-Lago. Trump ordered for each guest; from his point of view, the menu and their wishes were irrelevant.

These last two qualities explain many of his failures thus far, with more to come. Chess players who think only a single move ahead invariably lose; states and peoples, even quite small ones, have agency. Not only that, they can read him—the only question is whether they have the guts and competence to stare him down, or the wiliness to outmaneuver him.

He has, for example, put Turkey and Qatar on the Board of Peace that will supposedly run Gaza—without anyone, other than the Israeli military, actually willing to take on Hamas gunmen. The Israelis are furious that two hostile countries have been placed in that position. They are likely to acquiesce formally and to undermine their efforts privately. Trump thinks he can run Venezuela by remote control, but the head of ExxonMobil recently pointed out to him that until the country has something like rule of law and reasonable security, rebuilding its oil industry is not going to be possible. He continues to threaten Canada, and Prime Minister Mark Carney flies to Beijing. Volodymyr Zelensky was supposed to bow to Trump's wishes. Instead, the Ukrainians, with help from Europe, adroitly manipulated a supposed agreement with Russia on ending the war into a proposal that Putin will not accept.

Having a president conducting foreign policy who thinks in this way—who fantasizes about a fleet of battleships named after him and a dome as golden as the Oval Office spreading over North America, who believes he can rename the Gulf of Mexico and that it will stick after he has left office—is undoubtedly scary. But there is some comfort in it as well.

In politics, gravity still works. A man entering his ninth decade has diminishing energy and stamina, and so Trump drowses off in meetings. He has excluded all but sycophants from his inner circle, and so he hears only his version of the truth. He faces the likely loss of the House of Representatives (at least) within a year. Little cracks are visibly spreading in the unwieldy coalition that only he could create, while even populists grow uneasy at the outlandish thuggery of Kristi Noem's masked green-shirts. Indeed, he may find himself dealing at home with bloody insurgencies of the kind he hoped to avoid abroad if he persists in allowing Stephen Miller to press for the indiscriminate roundups of immigrants, or merely people who speak Spanish or have brown skin. His successors are already jostling one another.

This era will leave lasting foreign-policy damage. One Trump term could look like a fluke; two will certainly convince many abroad that the United States has become unreliable and even dangerous. But this emergence of a new, more transactional, and less peaceful world is unfortunately something that Trump has only accelerated, not created. His hopefully wiser and more sober successors will call the Gulf of Mexico by its name and pry Trump's name off the United States Institute of Peace. More important, they will need to figure out how to restore a modicum of decency, good judgment, and international leadership once he is gone; rebuilding America's reputation, unfortunately, will be the work of a generation. Such pivots have happened before—in the 1940s and the 1980s, for example. Let's hope they will happen again.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Josh Shapiro Settles Some Scores","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris-israel/685674/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:19:00 GMT","

The Pennsylvania governor discusses the strange questions he received in his vice-presidential vetting.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was already irritated by what he describes as “unnecessarily contentious” questions from the team vetting him to be Kamala Harris's running mate when a senior aide made one final inquiry: “Have you ever been an agent of the Israeli government?”

The question came from President Biden's former White House counsel Dana Remus, who was a key member of Harris's vice-presidential search team.

Shapiro, one of the most well-known Jewish elected officials in the country—and one of at least three Jewish politicians considering a run for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination—says he took umbrage at the question. “Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,” Shapiro writes in his forthcoming book, Where We Keep the Light, a copy of which The Atlantic obtained ahead of its release on January 27.  The exchange became even more tense, he writes, when Remus asked whether Shapiro had ever spoken with an undercover Israeli agent. The questions left the governor feeling uneasy about the prospect of being Harris's No. 2, a role that ultimately went to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. After Harris and Walz lost to Donald Trump, many Democrats were critical of her decision to bypass Shapiro, the popular governor of the nation's largest swing state. In his book, Shapiro says that the decision may not have been fully hers; he says he had “a knot in my stomach” throughout a vetting process that was more combative than he had expected. Shapiro wrote that he decided to take his name out of the running after a one-on-one meeting with Harris that featured more clashes, including about Israel.

The account highlights some of the fault lines that Democrats are navigating as they try to put the 2024 campaign behind them and chart a path back to the White House. With his book, Shapiro aims to showcase why Democrats lost and how his brand of consensus-building politics can usher them back to power. But before the consensus building, it seems, Shapiro felt compelled to do some score settling.

Harris, after all, had written a surprisingly candid account of her truncated and, ultimately, tortured selection process for a running mate, and it did not make Shapiro look good. When my colleague Tim Alberta first informed Shapiro of Harris's description of their meeting in her book, 107 Days, he grew uncharacteristically sharp-tongued. “That's complete and utter bullshit,” he told Alberta. “I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.” Shapiro is more measured in Where We Keep the Light, taking pains not to attack Harris herself and instead blaming her staff for probing him in a way that at times felt gratuitous.  “Remus was just doing her job,” Shapiro wrote about the Israeli-spy inquiry. “I get it. But the fact that she asked, or was told to ask that question by someone else, said a lot about some of the people around the VP.” (Remus and an aide to Harris did not respond to a request for comment.) In a statement, Shapiro's spokesperson Manuel Bonder didn't address the apparently unpleasant vetting process, and would only say that the governor had written “a very personal book” about his faith, his family, and what he has learned from a career of public service. He said the 2024 election was “one small part” of Shapiro's “much broader story.”

Shapiro does not write about the vice-presidential search until near the end of his book, which otherwise serves up the standard fare of a pre-campaign-launch political memoir, tracing his rise from a childhood in suburban Philadelphia to the governorship of the nation's fifth-most-populous state. Shapiro writes about the importance of his Jewish faith, his role pursuing justice for survivors of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, his admiration for—and early support of—President Obama, and the astute political instincts of his wife and adviser, Lori.

The book opens with the harrowing firebombing of the governor's mansion on Passover last year by a man who later told prosecutors that he blamed Shapiro for the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza. Shapiro and his family had to flee the home, which suffered significant damage from the fire, in the middle of the night after being alerted by a state trooper. The governor writes that his willingness to publicly embrace his Jewish faith before and after the attack has been welcomed by people of various religious backgrounds, suggesting that his experience as part of an observant Jewish family would be a prominent part of any run for the presidency.

Read: By the time political violence gets worse, it will be too late

Where We Keep the Light is typical of the sort of memoir that candidates release before running for president. In it, Shapiro extols the virtues of using politics to improve people's lives. He also makes subtle but clear policy distinctions between himself and other prominent members of his party, including some eyeing the party's presidential nomination.

He gets ahead of some of the major questions that Democrats are likely to face in the 2028 primary, writing, for example, that he would have handled coronavirus lockdowns differently, that he did not support the defund-the-police rhetoric in the summer of 2020, and that he privately suggested to Biden that he should consider dropping out of the presidential race after an abysmal debate performance against Trump. He also defends his support for cutting taxes and his more permissive stance on fossil fuels, policies that put him outside the mainstream of the Democratic political class. He writes that anti-Semitism has become “much scarier, much more real” in recent years and suggests a clear distinction between free speech and protest activity that veers into intimidation.

But the governor also devotes several pages to providing his side of the story from the 2024 search for a vice-presidential candidate, after Harris wrote a detailed account of the traditionally secretive process, which included a less-than-warm meeting with Shapiro.

Their sit-down on August 4, 2024, took place shortly after Shapiro got off the phone with Remus, telling her that he had no way of knowing if he had ever communicated with an undercover Israeli agent.

Harris wrote that before they met at the Naval Observatory, Shapiro asked staff there about how many bedrooms the compound had and whether the Smithsonian might loan him art to decorate the place. The unmistakable implication was that the governor, seen by some Democrats as an ambitious operator with his eye on the presidency, was already measuring the drapes before being selected for the No. 2 role. Shapiro, not surprisingly, offers a different take, writing that his brief discussion with staff from the residence was only “small talk” that had been “analyzed, misrepresented, and picked apart by members of the vice president's team.”

After Harris and Shapiro sat down, in a dining room that had been cleared of most furniture other than two chairs and a table, there was little in the way of small talk or pleasantries. Each described the conversation as blunt, lacking the traditional warmth of two people trying to determine if a four-year partnership would work. Their discussion was especially tense when Harris asked Shapiro if he would apologize for some of his comments about protesters at the University of Pennsylvania who had built encampments to decry Israel's military campaign in Gaza and, in some cases, intimidated Jewish students.  Shapiro wrote that he “flatly” told Harris that he would not. It was one of several times he claims that he had to stand his ground after Harris's team brought up issues on which he had taken a different stance from hers and asked if he would be willing to apologize or otherwise make a public about-face.

Shapiro wrote that he understood the campaign's desire to probe his background and policy positions, but “didn't see anything wrong with not aligning perfectly” with Harris on all issues, adding that “they weren't going to expand her universe by doing the exact same thing that she had been doing all these years.”

He told Harris's team that he respected their role and was submitting willingly to the vetting process, but he was “not going to apologize for who I am or for the positions I've taken over the years.”

“It nagged at me that their questions weren't really about substance,” he wrote. “Rather, they were questioning my ideology, my approach, my world view.”

After the back-and-forth on policy, Shapiro asked Harris some questions of his own, probing for a sense of what kind of role she wanted her vice president to play. Harris, he wrote, described her own experience as vice president in stark terms, saying she had had a rough time in a position that had little autonomy or executive authority.

“I was surprised by how much she seemed to dislike the role,” he wrote. “She noted that her chief of staff would be giving me my directions, lamented that the vice president didn't have a private bathroom in their office, and how difficult it was for her at times not to have a voice in the decision making.”

Shapiro said he tried to make a case for a more equitable partnership, with the vice president having unimpeded access to the president and the ability to weigh in on decisions before they were made. “I told him bluntly that was an unrealistic expectation,” Harris wrote in 107 Days. “A vice president is not a co-president. I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.”

The disagreement over the role ultimately left both politicians feeling that a Harris-Shapiro ticket, for all its electoral promise, may not be a good fit. “It could have gone differently, had I left that meeting thinking that she would want a partner and someone to bounce things off of before she ultimately made her decisions,” Shapiro wrote. “There was a world in which it could have worked, but that was not this world.”

Shapiro eventually returned to Pennsylvania with his mind made up—though not before Remus spoke with him again, he writes, and suggested that the role of vice president might be a financial burden for him and his wife: Shapiro's financial vetting showed that he didn't have much money, and the vice presidency would require Lori to buy a new wardrobe and pay the costs for second-lady-level hair and makeup, even as the couple would be required to pay for food and entertainment at the vice president's residence.

Shapiro said he was taken aback: “Are you trying to convince me not to do this?” he recalls asking. Remus responded that she just wanted him to be sure this was something he wanted. In the end, Shapiro wrote, he realized that it was not.

Harris later wrote that her first choice for vice president was actually Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but felt it was “too big of a risk” to add a gay man to a ticket led by a Black woman with a Jewish husband.

Read: The running mate Kamala Harris didn't dare choose

With Shapiro, Harris, and Buttigieg all on a list of potential presidential hopefuls in 2028, the vice-presidential selection process from 2024 is reemerging at a key moment.

As much as Democrats would like to turn the page on the presidential race that ushered Trump back into the White House, Shapiro's book offers another opportunity to pick apart one of the most pivotal decisions of the 2024 campaign. And it likely isn't the final word on the vetting process. The second leg of Harris's book tour is scheduled to start on February 2.

It's not just the smut. It's about a deeper desire.

Heated Rivalry, the Canadian series streaming on HBO Max based on the bestselling romance novels by Rachel Reid, has taken over group chats, algorithms, and brains. For those who have not watched, it follows queer, closeted professional ice hockey players as they navigate falling in love and all the angst that comes with it. There's also a lot of sex. So. Much. Sex.

But for all the talk of gay hockey smut, the show at its core is very sweet.

Emma Glassman-Hughes is a writer, reporter, and editor at Popsugar, and she doesn't think Heated Rivalry is an anomaly. She says the show is successful because it taps into a universal experience: yearning. “I think the people are yearning every which way,” she told Vox. “In a more classic sense, we've seen the success of Heated Rivalry and The Summer I Turned Pretty. Both those have blown up and really are good examples of how everyone is just excited right now about the burn of a true crush.”

On the latest episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast, we spoke with Glassman-Hughes about pining in pop culture and what it says about us.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Are you seeing this yearning anywhere else, even beyond TV and movies?

Yeah, I think of yearning in a pretty broad sense around the Mamdani campaign in New York. My feeds were full of energy and enthusiasm and true yearning and aching for a better future for some new options. I've also seen this New Year's resolution trend on TikTok, where people are aiming to receive 1,000 rejections in 2026. That means putting yourself out there at least a thousand times and proving to yourself that you're willing to try and be vulnerable and face the prospect of failure. That's big yearner energy. Along the way in between the thousand rejections, you're bound to get some yeses, whether that's romantic partners or jobs or community organizing or whatever it is that you're chasing.

I think that's so interesting, to think of yearning beyond just the romantic.

If we look around, it's really hard to exist in the world right now, and we're being inundated with distressing news event after news event. I think yearning could be seen as a distraction from that, but I actually think it's a grounding force.

Yearning is this deeply bodily human experience to despair over not having what you want and to feel the pain of being so close yet so far. We're all familiar with the concept of exquisite pain, and I think yearning can provide this sort of masochistic joy too — and we all need more joy in our lives right now.

Crushes are fun, but they can be excruciating. At the same time, they're kind of great. It's hard to describe how it's both painful and enjoyable.

When I think of yearning, the phrase that comes up is all-consuming. Going back to the romance factor, I'm in a long-term relationship right now, so it's been a long time since I've had a true crush, but I actually really miss that feeling. There's a nostalgic quality to some person sort of taking over your entire world for however long. It's [reminiscent] of a simpler time, when you're 13 and that's all you can think about, and nothing really matters beyond that.

If I open up my phone right now, I'll probably see several text messages about Heated Rivalry. It's everywhere. 

It's definitely a huge topic of conversation on the Popsugar team. I'm queer, and all of my queer female friends are very taken with this show and very drawn to these more vulnerable depictions of masculinity that we don't really get to see very much of.

I want to talk about who yearns. Heated Rivalry is special because it's about queer men. 

I argue in my essay that women are frequently the objects of yearning, but we see fewer depictions of female yearning out there. I think we see a lot of depictions of women passively wishing or hoping for something, but to me, that's not true yearning.

I've been thinking about this a lot since Popsugar posted about the essay on our Instagram. Someone actually commented something that has stuck with me: They were saying that we're always seeing depictions of women who want and never receive, and that really made me think. I think there is a difference between the passive wishing and the real gut-level yearning, and the latter is what I want to see more of from women and queer people this year. Not just wistful stuff, but the tornadoes and the storms and the shattered glass of it all.

How public opinion on crowdfunding soured, explained in one chart.

Today, no American tragedy is complete without a GoFundMe.

It took less than a week to raise over $1.5 million for the family of Renee Nicole Good, the woman fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. At the same time, a parallel fundraiser for her killer raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. And last year saw GoFundMe campaigns for people rebuilding their homes after the Los Angeles wildfires, therapy for the Camp Mystic flood survivors in Texas, struggling families affected by the SNAP shutdown, and far more.

But even as one in five Americans donate directly to those in need through crowdfunding, many feel uneasy about the rise of platforms like GoFundMe, which has raised over $40 billion since 2010, according to a recent survey by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The poll of 1,146 adults nationwide measured the extent to which Americans now participate in crowdfunding, the details of what that participation now looks like, and the nature of how they perceive crowdfunding campaigns.

The survey found that less than 10 percent of Americans — including both donors and non-donors — felt very confident in the effectiveness of crowdfunding campaigns, and many harbored serious doubts about who really stands to profit from them. More than half of those surveyed said they had very little confidence that crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe charge reasonable service fees. And nearly as many doubted that crowdfunders themselves use the money they raise responsibly or raise enough to meet their goals at all.

As I previously reported in October, the evidence shows that some of their fears are justified.

Start with those service fees, which the highest share of survey participants had qualms about. While the for-profit GoFundMe, the biggest name in the game, technically only charges a nominal processing fee like any other fundraiser, the platform defaults donors into “tipping” some 17.5 percent (on my browser, at least) of their donation to benefit the company's bottom line.

And for a fundraiser as big as the one for Good's widow, those tips can really add up. If all donors tipped the full 17.5 percent on the $1.5 million campaign, GoFundMe would rake in over $260,000.

Another point of doubt was the idea that many who crowdfund don't actually need the money and, even if they do, might not use it responsibly. The data on such fraud is difficult to come by, and while GoFundMe claims it affects only about one in 1,000 campaigns on its platform, the disperse nature of crowdfunding makes it virtually impossible to verify whether most fundraisers ultimately use their funds “wisely” or even for their intended purpose at all.

What's more, Americans' hunch that few crowdfunds ultimately reach their initial goals is also right on target. Some studies show that as few as one in ten crowdfunding campaigns succeed by that metric. And while every dollar counts, the people who need the most help often struggle to get their fundraiser off the ground at all.

More often than not, the wealthier and whiter the fundraiser's neighborhood and network is, the more successful their campaign is likely to be, according to several studies measuring the success rate of medical crowdfunds, meaning that many people who need help get left behind.

A week before Good's shooting, another American citizen, Keith Porter Jr. — a Black father from Los Angeles — was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE officer on New Year's Eve. Porter had just fired a celebratory shot in the air from an AR-15-style rifle when he was confronted and killed by the agent, who lived in the same apartment complex. Yet, for days, a fundraiser for his family struggled to gain the same traction as the one for Good, who is white. Amid some outcry over the disparity, a GoFundMe for Porter's daughters has managed to raise nearly $260,000 out of a goal of $300,000.

Still, even though crowdfunding can be a flawed way to give, it's one of the only venues we have for directly helping individual people in need quickly during times of crisis. According to the AP-NORC survey, medical expenses and health care causes are the most common kind of crowdfunds people donate to, followed by memorials and funeral expenses. Oftentimes, these fundraisers act as a lifeline for people in intense distress who have no other options. For beneficiaries, even a mildly successful campaign can be transformative.

Sure, there are probably more efficient, more equitable ways to handle medical bankruptcies and funeral costs than an endless string of crowdfunds. But until those solutions materialize, giving to one another — however imperfectly — might be the best we've got.

One thing many workers are keen to leave behind heading into 2026? The 9-to-5 schedule. In its place, many are interested in adopting a practice called ""microshifting.""

In Owl Labs' 2025 State of Hybrid Work report, 65% of workers reported being interested in microshifting, defined as working in ""short, non-linear blocks based on personal energy, responsibilities, or productivity patterns.""

""Microshifting appeals to employees not just as a scheduling preference, but as a way to reclaim control over their increasingly fragmented work lives,"" Owl Labs CEO Frank Weishaupt tells CNBC Make It. ""Employees are improvising solutions to reconcile the demands of their jobs with the realities of their lives.""

During the pandemic remote work boom, many workers had greater control over their time during their workdays. The interest in microshifting could represent interest in keeping that flexibility, particularly among those with some degree of remote or self-directed work, as it may be more difficult for office workers in traditional 9-to-5 jobs.

But microshifting isn't an entirely new practice. Doug Gregory of Grand Rapids, Michigan, says he's been doing it as a remote worker for decades, before it had that name, and even more so since the Covid-19 pandemic.

""We kind of got used to the idea of being present or available for loved ones,"" he says of broader sentiment in the workforce stemming from the pandemic remote work era. ""We got used to taking better care of our health.""

While Gregory acknowledges that ""not everybody has control over their calendar,"" he finds ""the day is more fluid"" when he's microshifting.

""If I need to take an hour off during the day to go do something with the grandkid or to go see a doctor or whatever, it's okay, I make up for it in the evening, I make up for it early in the morning,"" he says. ""It really comes back to what am I responsible for getting done, how do I do it, and how do I organize my life to do it.""

Gregory previously held sales roles but today is self-employed working in audiovisual integration.

""I earn a living based on outcomes,"" he says. ""Nobody sends me a check for how many hours I work in a week.""

Microshifting could be particularly useful for parents and caregivers; Owl Labs' report found caregivers were roughly three times as likely to try microshifting as non-caregivers.

Theresa Robertson of Elkridge, Maryland, is one of them. Robertson says she juggled her work, including a former role as a project manager, with caregiving for her late husband, who had chronic health issues, for 25 years.

""To me, it was just making sure I didn't lose my job,"" she says. ""I had to take care of my husband, and I had to work, so I had to figure it out.""

That meant scheduling meetings around his doctors' appointments and starting some days early or ending others late to take him to those appointments, manage his medications and handle other caregiving responsibilities.

""We had a routine; after I got him settled, made sure he was dressed and he had his medicine and he had his food, then I could relax and focus on work,"" she says. ""I had more control over my day where I could stop and decide, okay I need to check his blood pressure and then go back to work.""

Some of her jobs during this period, like in project management, were more outcome-based so she was trusted to manage her time as long as she handled her work, she notes.

""As long as I got the job done on time and on budget, they weren't really looking at did I punch a clock to see was I in the building at 7 a.m."" she says. ""I've had so many Zoom meetings in hospital rooms because wherever I go I take my laptop and when I can work, I can work.""

Today, Robertson runs a virtual assistant agency, which she says helps her continue to microshift. She sets her hours such that she's mostly free on Friday afternoons, for example, to tend to personal matters.

""I microshift all the time,"" she says. ""That's the only way I'm able to have a life and produce an income.""

BEIJING — An Alibaba-backed AI startup is currently being valued at $4.8 billion in a fresh funding round, two people with knowledge of the deal said, just weeks after it was valued at $4.3 billion.

Moonshot AI is the company behind the Kimi chatbot, which surged in popularity in China months before DeepSeek's release last year.

Since Moonshot's previous in December, rival Chinese AI companies — Zhipu and MiniMax — surged after going public in Hong Kong.

The sources told CNBC that Moonshot was closing a funding round that will value it at least $500 million higher than the December round. The sources said the round would likely close soon due to high demand.

Both asked to remain anonymous while discussing private information. Moonshot AI had not responded to a request for comment as this article went live.

The sources added that the company could be valued even higher in subsequent rounds that could follow, due to a surge of interest in Chinese AI IPO candidates.

Chinese AI companies have particularly boomed as U.S. AI chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, aren't officially available in mainland China.

Beijing restricts access to many U.S.-based internet services, while American companies have faced growing restrictions from the White House on doing business with China.

The previous funding round was announced on Dec. 31. IDG, Alibaba and Tencent participated in it, according to Chinese financial news outlet LatePost.

Moonshot AI has not commented on any plans for an IPO.

Zhipu, listed under the name Knowledge Atlas, had a market value of $13 billion as of Monday's close, according to Wind Information data. MiniMax was worth $15.2 billion, the data showed.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' ""Board of Peace"" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The ""Board of Peace"" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.

""President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,"" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. 

""We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,"" he added.

Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.

Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.

However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.

If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.

CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.

On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a ""founding Executive Board"" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.

Israel is unhappy with how the ""Board of Peace"" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, ""the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.""

J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are among the who's who of political leaders, big-name CEOs and tech pioneers heading to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.

U.S. President Donald Trump is also attending in person for the first time since he addressed the forum during his first term in 2020. His virtual address last year, days after reentering the White House, shook the event. This time, he will bring the ""largest"" U.S. delegation yet, according to WEF.

Davos organizers are keen to talk up the numbers they expect to attend — ""close to 3,000 cross-sector leaders,"" plus a ""record"" 400 political leaders, 850 top company bosses and 100 tech pioneers. But a government at the center of a geopolitical firestorm won't be there.

Danish government representatives were invited and decided not to attend, a WEF spokesperson said on Monday, as the dispute over Greenland intensified. Their decision underscores how tense the meeting is likely to be, coming just days after Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries resisting his attempt to annex the Arctic island. ""Any decisions on attendance are a matter for the government concerned. We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,"" the WEF spokesperson said in a statement.

There are big names among those who aren't going.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is not on WEF's attendance list, neither are the leaders of Brazil and India. 

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni are not on the WEF list, although both are reported to be attending.

During a press conference last week, WEF organizers highlighted that six of the G7 nations are expected to send representatives, in a ""historic"" move, according to WEF's president, Børge Brende. 

In 2025, the only G7 leader attending Davos in person was then-German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Alongside President Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to attend in person. 

Downing Street would not confirm whether U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is attending — he did not attend last year — but he is reportedly expected to. 

In an emergency press conference on Monday morning, Starmer addressed Trump's announcement of escalating tariffs targeting several European countries, including the U.K., if Greenland isn't sold to the U.S. But when asked by the BBC whether he would consider meeting Trump in person ""this week,"" Starmer did not directly answer the question.

U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to attend and be a guest on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi isn't mentioned on WEF's list, but she is likely to remain in her country, given that she announced on Monday a snap election for Feb. 8.

Davos runs from Monday evening to Friday morning. This year's theme is ""A spirit of dialogue,"" with an agenda focusing on five areas: the geopolitical environment, AI, climate and nature, new sources of economic growth and ""people and preparedness.""

But the interest will be in who will attend Davos, according to Eric Kutcher, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, a ""strategic partner"" to WEF. ""It's going to be about who is there,"" he said in a video published by the company. ""Much more so than what you see in the topics,"" Kutcher said.

Trump's delegation is set to include U.S Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, plus Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser Jared Kushner. The president is scheduled to address Davos on Wednesday.

WEF's founder, Klaus Schwab, is one big name who won't be at Davos. After running the event for decades, Schwab stepped down in April following an investigation into alleged misconduct. He was subsequently cleared of ""material wrongdoing.""

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffman were announced as WEF's interim co-chairs in August, and the organization's new personnel are ""making a real push to kind of re-instil the economic orientation of WEF, and in doing so, bringing more of the CEOs,"" Kutcher said. 

Alongside Nvidia's Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are on WEF's attendance list. Sarah Friar, OpenAI's chief financial officer, is also set to participate, but the company's CEO, Sam Altman, is not down to attend.

Key topics for markets include U.S. moves towards a Greenland takeover, political turmoil in Venezuela and the threat by Trump to use force against Iran. Investors will also be watching for announcements from AI firms, central bank updates, and news about companies diversifying away from the U.S.

While some big-name politicians aren't attending, some of the leaders who are going — such as Argentina's Javier Milei and Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto — are ""no small figures,"" according to Jan Aart Scholte, professor of global transformations and governance challenges at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

Governments still see Davos as a place to meet with businesses, he added. ""Global capital remains a strong force in world politics, even if big multinational enterprises are generally less embraced and celebrated than 20-30 years ago,"" he told CNBC in an email Monday.

While WEF said there are ""close to"" 65 heads of state expected to attend, plus key figures such as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, other big names are not on the list.

Brazil's President Lula da Silva and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are not scheduled to give addresses. But Brende described India's delegation as ""strong,"" and noted that the heads of state of other Asian economies, including Indonesia and Pakistan, would attend.

While China's President Xi is not expected to attend, Brende said a ""big"" Chinese delegation would attend, including trade and finance Vice Premier He Lifeng, who is due to address the event on Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, is not on WEF's attendance list. But several of the country's ministers, including Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan, are scheduled to be interviewed by CNBC during the event.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday he would no longer attend after two high-speed trains collided in the south of the country on Sunday, killing 39 people.

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK, is expected to attend the event this year. Farage previously called Davos ""elite"" and said those attending were ""people deciding our futures in Swiss ski resorts"" in a 2020 video. 

Indeed, Davos has been seen by some as elitist and out-of-touch, Scholte said. ""Nationalist-populist circles commonly view the WEF as a beacon of a liberal globalist elite that draws their ire,"" he told CNBC via email.

In this article

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a rising wave of tariffs on several European allies, raising the alarm for industries and businesses across the region.

Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, a part of the United States. 

The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said. 

European political leaders are set to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response, with retaliatory measures and broader punitive economic policies reportedly on the table. 

CNBC takes a look at some of the sectors expected to be the most exposed to Trump's tariff threats.

Europe's car giants, which were hit hard by Trump's back-and-forth trade policies last year, are considered to be highly exposed once again.

The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. 

Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group were all trading more than 2.5% lower on Monday morning, with Milan-listed Stellantis last seen down by around 2.1%.

Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, said Trump's tariffs clearly represent a negative development for Germany's economic outlook, a country traditionally seen as Europe's growth engine.

""If we do get tariffs, and, of course, we have to see how the geopolitical situation pans out, then … the chemicals, industrials, autos sectors, these will be the most impacted, which directly feeds to German growth,"" Kumar told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday. 

Of the eight European countries threatened by Trump's Greenland tariffs, Germany, by far, enjoys the greatest trade surplus with the U.S., followed by France and the U.K., according to data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.

Luxury stocks were seen as largely sheltered from U.S.-EU trade tensions in the first quarter of last year, given their robust pricing power and ability to pass on added costs to consumers. 

Analysts warned at the time, however, that the prospect of tariffs ushering in a broader economic downturn could have spillover effects, even for the wealthiest shoppers. 

Alongside seven other European countries, Trump's proposed tariffs single out France, which is home to the likes of industry bellwether LVMH and Kering. 

Shares of LVMH and Kering fell around 3.5% and 2.6% on Monday morning. Luxury groups, including Switzerland's Richemont, Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, and Britain's Burberry, were also trading lower. 

Europe's pharma sector could face a significant impact from the proposed U.S. tariffs, given that medicines and pharma products represent the EU's largest export to the U.S. 

EU exports of pharma products to the U.S. came in at 84.4 billion euros ($98.1 billion) during the first three quarters of last year, ahead of machinery and mechanical parts (68.3 billion euros) and organic chemicals (66.3 billion euros) over the same period, according to Eurostat data. 

Some of the sector's biggest European names fell slightly on Trump's latest tariff threats on Monday morning.  

Denmark's Novo Nordisk was 2.1% lower, Switzerland's Roche dipped 0.3% lower, and France's Sanofi fell 0.9% during early deals. Swiss-based Novartis, meanwhile, traded 0.3% higher.  

Europe's oil and gas stocks could also be indirectly impacted by Trump's latest tariff threats, due to factors such as weaker global demand, lower crude prices and increased supply chain costs.

Oil prices were last seen trading slightly lower amid heightened concerns of a trade war between the U.S. and Europe — and what this could mean for global demand.

Norway's Equinor was among the energy stocks leading the sector's losses on Monday, down around 3.4%. France's TotalEnergies, Britain's Shell, and BP fell between 1% and 1.5%, respectively.

Ozan Özkural, founder and managing partner at Tanto Capital, said Trump's latest tariff threats should not have been unexpected, warning of a broad impact for European sectors.

""Welcome to 2026. I think this is going to be the sort of year that we are going to talk a lot more about what it means not to have the U.S. play ball with the traditional allies,"" Özkural told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

""It's going to have an impact on oil prices, commodity prices, equity markets, debt markets, private credit. You name it, we have it,"" Özkural said.

Gold and silver surged to fresh highs just days after breaking previous records, as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid a choppy geopolitical and economic ‍outlook.

U.S. gold futures for February delivery rose 1.71% to $4,674.20 per ounce on Monday, after earlier hitting a record high last week. Spot gold was 1.6% higher at $4,668.14.

It comes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods from eight European countries until a deal for ""the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,"" as he ramps up his rhetoric on annexing the Arctic island.

""Gold's rally has been powerful, but it has also been grounded in fundamentals that are still very much in place. With real rates likely to fall and central banks continuing to diversify their reserves, we see more reason for gold to consolidate or edge higher than to sell off sharply,"" George Cheveley, natural resources portfolio manager at Ninety One, said in the asset manager's 2026 sectoral outlook, published on Monday.

At current prices, margins are expected to be four to five times higher than in 2024, per the outlook. 

Silver followed gold's upward swing and looks comfortable at such prices. U.S. silver futures for March advanced to a record $93.035 per ounce and were last seen 5.06% higher at $93.02. Silver's spot price was 3.55% higher at $93.16 per ounce.

Gold and silver tend to perform well in periods of heightened uncertainty as riskier assets, such as equities, fall out of favor.

The tariffs over Greenland follow the U.S. capturing the Venezuelan president on Jan. 3 and taking control of the country's oil industry; and Trump suggesting a military strike against Iran was imminent amid that country's clampdown on civil unrest, only to appear to back down from the threat last week.

European and Asia-Pacific markets mostly slipped on Monday as investors assessed geopolitical threats. Shares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers and key luxury goods names fell on Monday morning as investors digest possible tariffs on European countries. Trump said these would be 10% from Feb. 1., rising to 25% from June 1 if no deal is done. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index was 2.2% lower in early dealmaking, while the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 index 2.9% lower.

European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader economic counter-measures. 

The Justice Department's criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may also be rattling markets as investors weigh up the long-term impact of Trump's war of words aimed at pressuring it to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, conflict in Ukraine persists and progress in Gaza is expected to take years.

Other base metals also gained but were driven by megatrends rather than geopolitics. Copper in particular has an ""attractive"" risk-reward profile thanks to demand from energy and data center infrastructure, per Cheveley.

U.S. copper futures for March were last seen 0.54% higher at $5.8625 per ounce, paring gains from a Jan. 6. peak.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for cool heads as tensions rise between Washington and its European allies after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose fresh tariffs on a number of countries if they block his bid to buy the Arctic territory.

In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.

""On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,"" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.

""But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,"" he added.

Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to ""buy"" Greenland.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland. The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU.

Over the weekend, Starmer said that the U.K.'s position on Greenland was clear, although he, like other European leaders, also looked to appease Trump by saying NATO allies should do more together to address Russian threats across the Arctic.

""Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,"" Starmer said in a statement released by the British government on Saturday.

""Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration,"" he added.

Trump contends that U.S. ownership of Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, would make the world safer and deter Russia and Chinese activity in the Arctic island. Moscow and Beijing have dismissed his claims while European leaders insist that Greenland's future is a matter for the island and Denmark.

European countries are reportedly considering retaliatory levies and wider economic counter-measures against the U.S. but the U.K. has traditionally held off from threatening counter-tariffs.

Starmer said again on Monday that the use of tariffs to resolve such an issue was ""completely wrong"" and was not ""the right way to resolve differences within an alliance.""A trade war is in no one's interest,"" he said.

Still, the PM is known to have a warm and friendly relationship with Trump, despite their political differences. 

The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.

""The U.K. and the U.S. are close allies and close partners. That relationship matters profoundly, not just to our security, but to the prosperity and stability that people here depend upon ... we're determined to keep that relationship strong, constructive and focused on results,"" Starmer said Monday.

But, at a time when ""events are moving fast,"" he said that ""what matters most is being clear about the values and motives that drive us.""

""While we are pragmatic, we are resolute in defending those values when it matters.""

European states are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened fresh export levies, deepening a rift over Greenland.

Trump announced Saturday that eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the mineral-rich island which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland. The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU. 

Regional diplomats held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday afternoon to discuss their response to Trump's threat to escalate tariffs, with France reportedly pushing for the EU to use its strongest economic counter-threat to the U.S., known as the ""Anti-Coercion Instrument"" (ACI).

The much-vaunted instrument is seen as a nuclear option when it comes to economic counter-measures as it could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region.

Despite being seen as a ""big bazooka"" against Trump's tariffs playbook, it has not been used before, and regional leaders have already said they want to pursue dialogue with the U.S. in the coming days to resolve the rift over Greenland.

The Financial Times reported that the EU was contemplating imposing 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of tariffs, as well as considering the use of the ACI. 

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the European Parliament will likely now suspend its work on the EU-U.S. trade deal struck last July. The assembly had been due to vote on removing many EU import duties on U.S. goods on Jan. 26-27, but that approval could now be delayed, Reuters reported.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure said Monday that the EU ""must be prepared"" to use its anti-coercion mechanism, in comments translated by Reuters.

While France is more gung-ho about the ACI, Germany is among the countries that have tended to shy away from using it before.

""The key question to watch is whether the EU will try to keep the confrontation confined to such a more ""classic"" trade war, or whether calls for a harsher line prevail,"" Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in emailed comments. 

""Representing the latter camp, France has called on its partners to formally invoke the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument ... [but] other EU member states, including Germany, will likely remain careful."" 

The reasons for this divide are multifaceted, Nickel noted, including factors such as France traditionally advocating for a more independent European role in continental security, and it being less export-dependent than other nations like Germany.

European leaders were quick to react to Trump's surprise tariff threat, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that ""applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,"" while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as ""unacceptable.""

Nonetheless, leaders are expected to use the World Economic Forum taking place in Davos, Switzerland, this week, as an opportunity to try to talk to Trump, who is addressing the forum on Wednesday.

Economists warn that, much like last year when months of wrangling took place before a trade deal was signed between the U.S. and EU, this spring will likely be dominated by similarly thorny discussions over Greenland.

""My base case is that the Feb. 1 [tariffs] deadline is going to be postponed as diplomatic measures are implemented,"" Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, told CNBC Monday.

""That said, I think this is different from the usual TACO [Trump Always Chickens Out] trade. For Greenland, the position for Europe is very clear: it's not for sale, and they will not tolerate aggression ... But what Trump has shown is that he wants Greenland. I don't see how the issue is going to go away that soon. So we are looking at months, or potentially quarters, of uncertainty over tariffs.""For Europe it's a negative. Growth will be reduced,"" he warned, ahead of what could be a frantic market day for European bourses on Monday, with regional indexes looking set to slump at the open.

If economic sanctions are designed to apply pressure without firing a shot, then U.S. President Donald Trump has aimed directly at America's closest military allies.

Trump said Saturday the U.S. will impose a 10% tariff on imports from eight NATO nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland — starting Feb. 1. 

Trump added that duties on those nations would rise to 25% on June 1 until ""a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.""

European leaders moved quickly to condemn the move, calling it ""unacceptable."" After a meeting Sunday and broadly agreeing to dissuade Trump, EU officials are weighing retaliatory tariffs of as much as 93 billion euros ($108 billion) on U.S. goods, reported Reuters.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to address the Greenland-related tariffs in a speech later Monday, London time.

Beyond the immediate political fallout, the move threatens to derail the EU-U.S. trade agreement reached in August and risks the prospect of retaliation from Europe.

Duties slapped on European nations ""could likely mean a significant E.U. pushback, where the E.U. could respond in kind, leading to a sort of trade war with the U.S.,"" Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at Alpine Macro, told CNBC over email before Trump announced the latest tariffs.

Until now, markets had largely taken geopolitical tensions in stride. Equity markets entered the year higher because disputes involving Greenland, Iran or Venezuela had not yet pulled in major economies or military partners, said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for Chicago-based Northern Trust Wealth Management, last week.

That calculus may be changing. By drawing European allies into the dispute, the tariffs increase the risk of greater market volatility. Major U.S. indexes were in the red for the week even before Trump's Greenland-related tariffs, signaling growing unease among investors.

All of this unfolds as the World Economic Forum begins today, Jan. 19, at Davos. World leaders will convene for talks on trade, security and geopolitical tensions, with Trump in attendance — and set to come face to face with leaders of several countries now in his tariff crosshairs.

Just barely four weeks into the year, and fault lines are already building. What emerges from the snowy peaks will, like an avalanche, have a disproportionate impact on those below.

— CNBC's Holly Ellyatt, Chloe Taylor and Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.

China's economic growth slows. Fourth-quarter growth came in at 4.5%, the weakest pace in nearly three years. However, economic output for the whole of 2025 was 5%, meeting Beijing's target of ""around 5%.""

'Very unlikely' for Supreme Court to overturn tariffs: Bessent. ""I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos,"" Bessent said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" On Greenland tariffs, Bessent said they are a response to an emergency.

U.S.-Taiwan deal unlikely to shift balance. Analysts say expanded chip manufacturing in the U.S. will not significantly reduce Washington's reliance on Taiwan's production through the end of the decade.

Major U.S. indexes were mostly flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, fell 0.17% on Friday. Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1% on the release of mainland China economic data, but South Korea's Kospi bucked the trend to rise.

[PRO] Best-performing hedge funds in 2025. An annual ranking of hedge funds revealed that the industry reaped its largest-ever dollar gain last year, led by a single fund that delivered $18.9 billion to investors in 2025.

Global week ahead: Hopes that cooler heads can prevail in Davos

Over the years, I have seen many versions of Davos: the fall-out from the Great Financial Crisis and European debt crunch; the trading scandal that rocked French banking giant Societe Generale; the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic and now the upending of the world order that has been in place since the end of the Second World War.

Everyone has an opinion about this meeting, but one thing is true — it is never dull. And 2026 will certainly be no different. The tension between countries that call themselves allies is palpable going into this meeting.

China's birthrate fell to a record low last year, underscoring a deepening demographic crisis as Beijing struggles to reverse a shrinking and aging population. 

Births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023, marking the lowest level on record, according to data compiled by Wind Information going back to the 1950s.

About 7.9 million babies were born last year, sharply fewer than 9.5 million a year before, data from the statistics bureau showed Monday, despite Beijing's efforts to encourage larger families through widening subsidies and expanded parental leave. 

Even though the country began easing its stringent one-child policy nearly a decade ago, the birth rate continued to plummet — except for a brief spike in 2024, when it climbed to 6.77 per 1,000 people. The increase was widely attributed to the Year of the Dragon, which is traditionally considered an auspicious time to have children. 

""The pace of the decline is striking, particularly in the absence of  major shocks,"" said Yue Su, principal economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.

She added that the boost from fertility stimulus measures has faded, while young people are delaying marriage and child-bearing plans due to growing economic pressures and intensifying competition in workplaces.

Policymakers have rolled out various incentives, including cash rewards and tax breaks for households with children under age 3. Beijing has also extended the maternity leave to 158 days, from 98 days in 2024. 

China has faced a looming population crisis as its elderly population grew. The share of the population aged 60 and above rose to 23% in 2025, up from 22% in 2024.  

The population fell for a fourth year, declining by 3.4 million to 1.405 billion last year, according to the statistics bureau.

Economists warned that a shrinking workforce and an ageing population pose major economic risks. Fewer babies mean a shrinking workforce in the future to support a rapidly growing cohort of retirees, piling pressure on the already-stretched pension system. It could also force higher social security contributions, squeezing disposable income for younger workers.  

""A shrinking population implies a smaller consumer base in the future, increasing the risk of wider supply-demand imbalances,"" Su noted, calling for a more forceful policy response on fertility.  

World Bank data showed that the fertility rate, defined as births per woman, fell to 1 in China in 2023, the most recent year available, below the global average level of 2.2.

In this article

DETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.

U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.

Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.

Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.

Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.

""The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,"" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. ""So, I believe it's a year of execution.""

Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.

He said he believes the company should ""stay together"" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.

Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.

Investors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his ""Dare Forward 2030"" business plan.

U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. 

Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.

Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.

""In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,"" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

LONDON — European stocks were lower on Monday as traders reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to hike tariffs on European countries if they oppose his bid to buy Greenland.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was preliminarily 1.23% lower the closing bell in London, with most sectors in negative territory.

The market slump comes after Trump announced on Saturday that eight European allies would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached that allows Washington to ""buy"" Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory that's part of Denmark.

Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs ""until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,"" Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland, Trump said. European leaders said the tariffs were ""unacceptable"" and vowed to stand behind Denmark.

European carmakers and the luxury goods sector were hit hard as investors reacted to the tariff proposals. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index was 2.22% lower. Volkswagen slumped about 2.82%, while Porsche fell 2.68%, paring some earlier losses, and BMW shed almost 3.74%.

Among the continent's luxury names, LVMH dropped 4.69%, Kering slipped 3.9%, Hermes tumbled 4.45% and Moncler was down by 1.98%. Overall, the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 closed the session 3.15% down.

In contrast, some of Europe's defense stocks rallied. Rheinmetall, the continent's largest defense company, traded 1.08% higher by the end of trading hours, while French tech and aerospace giant Thales added 0.73%. 

Elsewhere, ASM International's share price had a rocky day, having made morning gains but was lower by early afternoon. It rebounded and closed 0.81% higher. The Dutch computer chipmaker reported stronger-than-anticipated preliminary bookings of around 800 million euros ($930 million) for the fourth quarter, boosted by a rebound in Chinese orders and above forecasts of 669 million euros. Preliminary revenues came in at 698 million euros, outweighing LSEG poll estimates.

Shares of fellow chip name ASML were flat, having earlier dropped 3.6%. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker hit a record high last week. 

U.S. gold futures hit a 52-week high on Monday, advancing 1.7% to reach $4,673.30 an ounce, while spot gold prices were last seen at $4,672.66, a 1.69% rise.

Markets will be keeping a close eye on the World Economic Forum kicking off in Davos, Switzerland, this week. Trump is due to address the Forum on Wednesday.

There are no major earnings this week, though on the data front, eurozone inflation data is due.

Billionaires' wealth has risen sharply to a record high of $18.3 trillion — with the super-rich seeking power ""for their own gain,"" according to a report by the global charity Oxfam released Monday.

The number of billionaires reached more than 3,000 last year, and collectively they saw their fortunes increase by 16%, or $2.5 trillion, the report said. 

Added to this, billionaires' wealth has surged by 81% since 2020, the charity said, describing the past  as ""a good decade for billionaires.""

And while the rich have become richer, poverty reduction has slowed, with levels ""broadly where they were in 2019,"" according to a news release from the charity.

Oxfam also said the super-rich often use their wealth to secure political power as well as media ownership, noting billionaire Elon Musk's involvement in the U.S. administration at the start of 2025, Jeff Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post and billionaire Vincent Bollore's acquisition of French news site CNews.

""The outsized influence that the super-rich have over our politicians, economies and media has deepened inequality and led us far off track on tackling poverty,"" said Oxfam's Executive Director Amitabh Behar in the charity's report, titled ""Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power.""

The charity has released inequality reports to coincide with the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, every year since 2014. Last year, Oxfam predicted the world would see at least five trillionaires within a decade and called for global tax policies to ensure the rich pay their fair share.

This year, ""Davos,"" which starts on Monday, will host around 65 heads of state and 850 CEOs, with U.S. President Donald Trump set to address delegates on Wednesday.

""The widening gap between the rich and the rest is ... creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable,"" Behar said.

""Governments are making wrong choices to pander to the elite and defend wealth while repressing people's rights and anger at how so many of their lives are becoming unaffordable and unbearable,"" Behar said.  

In 2025, Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" introduced several tax breaks for the wealthy, with those earning $1 million-plus seeing about a 3% income boost. 

Meanwhile, most Americans can no longer afford a ""minimal quality of life,"" according to a 2023 report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. About 10% of Americans lived in poverty in 2024 according to U.S. census data published in September.

Oxfam called on governments to make national inequality reduction plans, tax the super-rich to reduce their power and prioritize stronger ""firewalls"" between politics and wealth as well as provide stronger protection for freedom of expression.

The report comes as more than 2,500 people have been killed in Iran since protests against a long-running economic crisis began last month. Last year saw more than 140 ""significant"" anti-government protests in 68 countries, Oxfam said, which authorities ""typically met with violence."" 

""Being economically poor creates hunger. Being politically poor creates anger,"" Behar said. 

Rich nations are ""cutting aid further and faster than before,"" Oxfam's report stated. These cuts, including the closure of USAID, could lead to an additional 14 million deaths by 2030, the charity said.

The U.S.-Taiwan deal aimed at expanding chip production capacity in the U.S. is unlikely to fully wean Washington off the island's most advanced semiconductors anytime soon, several analysts told CNBC, leaving the so-called ""silicon shield"" largely intact for now.

Taiwan dominates global chip production, with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company producing most of the world's advanced chips. Nearly one-third of global demand for new computing power is estimated to be fabricated in Taiwan.   

The island's central role in the global semiconductor supply chain has made preserving its de facto autonomy — and deterring any Chinese attack — a strategic priority for the U.S. and its allies, an idea referred to as the ""Silicon Shield."" Beijing claims territorial control over the democratically-governed island. 

As part of a trade deal struck Thursday, the Taiwanese government promised to guarantee $250 billion in credit to its chip and technology companies to expand their production capacity in the U.S. Taiwanese companies will also enjoy higher quotas for tariff-free imports of their chips into the U.S. 

In return, Washington would lower its levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, and waive tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically.

The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S., Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday. But experts doubt the plan would be easy, given Taipei's hard line on keeping its most advanced technology at home.

Taiwan's ""silicon shield"" will remain strong through the end of the decade, with the world's most critical advanced capacity concentrated on the island, said Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst at SemiAnalysis.

Taiwanese authorities restricted TSMC's overseas fabrication plants from operating technologies at least two generations behind those developed domestically, known as the N-2 rule.

While TSMC produces its most advanced chips using 2-nanometer technology, or nodes, at home, its Arizona plant has only recently begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers, with plans to scale up to 2-nanometer and A16 nodes by 2030. 

In semiconductor manufacturing, smaller nanometer sizes mean denser transistors, which boost processing speed and improve energy efficiency.

That four- to- five-year lag ensures Taiwan retains its advantage, said Kundojjala, adding that the global economy would face a ""depression-level event if Taiwan were invaded tomorrow."" 

A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said at a news conference Friday that Beijing ""firmly opposed any agreements signed between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China,"" urging the U.S. to stick to the ""one-China principle.""  

Wendell Huang, CFO of TSMC, told CNBC on Thursday that the company will continue developing its most advanced technologies in Taiwan due to the need for ""very intensive collaboration"" between its domestic research and development teams and manufacturing operations. 

""We'll be sending hundreds of engineers back and forth [between] different sites in Taiwan. Therefore, it will stay in Taiwan when we ramp [up] the most leading-edge technology,"" Huang said. 

Still, the world's largest contract chipmaker has already pledged to invest $165 billion into chip fabrication and processing facilities in the U.S., along with a research and development lab, supplying customers such as Nvidia and Apple. 

Wu Cheng-wen, who oversees Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, told the Financial Times last year that it was crucial for Taiwan to keep its cutting-edge research and development at home and ensure that the domestic industry would not be ""hollowed out.""

""If we move our R&D overseas, it'll be dangerous for us,"" Wu said in the interview. 

Shifting chip production away from Taiwan will be difficult, analysts said. 

Taiwan's engineering talent pipeline and production capabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, especially in advanced fabrication, are ""not replicable at scale anywhere else,"" said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

The lack of trained workers and higher production costs have led to delays in TSMC's U.S. plant openings, Reinsch said, adding that the new trade deal does little to address these constraints. He expects fulfilment of the pledged investment commitments to take longer than expected and is unlikely to reach the promised level. 

""The semiconductor ecosystem cannot be relocated overnight, so the silicon shield may weaken but still exist in the near term,"" said Dennis Lu-Chung Weng, an associate professor of political science at Sam Houston State University. 

""The bigger question is what happens after Trump: if future U.S. administrations keep pushing for large-scale relocation, Taiwan losing its exclusive advantage becomes less a question of if and more a question of when,"" Weng cautioned.

Taiwanese officials have stressed the need to diversify its economic model, encourage more industries to grow, and bolster its defense capabilities to counter China's military pressure. 

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan remains a low-possibility event, and the trade deal is unlikely to change Beijing's calculus, said Ava Shen, a Taiwan and Chinese foreign policy expert at Eurasia Group. The mainland authorities would focus more on their military balance vis-à-vis the U.S. and the level of American defense support for Taipei, Shen said.

Gold and silver prices climbed fresh peaks on Monday, as investors flocked to safe-haven assets on intensifying tensions, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose extra tariffs on European countries over the control of Greenland.

Spot gold rose 1.5% to $4,663.37 per ounce by 0335 GMT, after scaling an all-time high of $4,689.39.

U.S. gold futures for Feb. delivery jumped 1.6% to $4,669.90 per ounce.

On Saturday, Trump vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark's vast Arctic island.

European Union ambassadors reached a broad agreement on Sunday to intensify efforts to dissuade Trump from imposing tariffs on European allies, while also preparing retaliatory measures should the duties go ahead, EU diplomats said.

""Geopolitical tensions have given gold bulls yet another reason to push the yellow metal to new highs,"" StoneX senior analyst Matt Simpson said.

""With Trump throwing tariffs into the mix, it is clear that his threat to Greenland is real, and that we could be one step closer to the end of NATO and political imbalances within Europe.""

U.S. stock futures and dollar slid as Trump's latest tariff threats raised investors' appetite for safe-haven gold, yen and Swiss franc, in a broad risk-averse move across markets.

Non-yielding gold thrives in a low-interest-rate environment and during economic uncertainties.

Spot silver advanced 3.3% to $92.93 per ounce, after hitting a record high of $94.08.

""On silver, the medium-term narrative remains constructive, supported by persistent physical deficits, resilient industrial demand and safe-haven demand,"" said Christopher Wong, a strategist at OCBC.

""But the pace of the recent extension may warrant some near-term tactical caution,"" Wong said, noting that the gold-silver ratio declined sharply from highs near 105 in late 2025 to low-50s, signaling silver's outsized performance versus gold.

In other precious metals, spot platinum added 0.9% to $2,348.32 per ounce, while palladium rose 0.5% to $1,808.46 per ounce.

Bitcoin and gold have split in recent months as gold soars and the bitcoin price plummets—with U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff trade war again threatening to weigh on the U.S. dollar.

The bitcoin price has fallen sharply overnight, dropping from almost $96,000 per bitcoin to just over $90,000 in a matter of minutes, while gold hit a fresh all-time high after Trump threatened to escalate tariffs on eight Nato allies unless Denmark agreed to a deal for Greenland.

Now, as Bank of America's chief executive issues a stark $6 trillion crypto warning, traders are braced for this week's inflation reading to be higher than previously expected—triggering warnings of ""unprecedented stagflation.""

Economists at Barclays and Morgan Stanley have increased their December U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) forecasts to 2.8% or 2.9%, while BNP Paribas's Andy Schneider wrote in a note seen by Reuters that the reading will be ""significantly"" higher than last week's 2.7% consumer price index (CPI).

The latest PCE data, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and energy prices, will be released on Thursday, potentially reviving fears of so-called stagflation that sees sluggish economic growth combined with soaring prices.

“A coming collapse in the dollar will send consumer prices soaring,” Peter Schiff, a gold investor who is typically bearish on the dollar and critical of bitcoin, posted to X. “Get ready for unprecedented stagflation.”

Ahead of the latest inflation reading, the U.S. dollar has weakened as last year's so-called debasement trade—which saw investors bet against the dollar and pile into scarce assets like bitcoin, gold, silver and copper alongside stocks—returned.

""President Trump's fresh tariff threat to his trading partners and Nato allies over Greenland led to a U.S. dollar selloff,"" David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “The Dollar Index snapped sharply lower to trade back under 99.00, having hit a six-week high at the end of last week.”

Gold and silver have both hit record highs as the U.S. dollar declined, with David Wilson, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas, telling Bloomberg that gold at $5,000 per ounce “looked like a big target” not that long ago, but is now within sight.

Meanwhile, traders are betting bitcoin price weakness continues due to the geopolitical uncertainty weighing on risk appetite.

“From here, it's likely we'll see further downside unless buyers step in, with strong support around $88,000,” Nic Puckrin, digital asset analyst and co-founder of the Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments, adding “the uncertainty and fears around Greenland are likely to get worse before they get better.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

The price of Bitcoin dropped to $0 on perps decentralized exchange Paradex overnight, according to numerous users, after a database migration issue affected the Paradex blockchain, its block explorer, bridge, and API. 

An issue was first flagged on the Paradex status page at 12:36 a.m, ET on Monday, shortly after social media posts flagged a cascade of liquidations as the price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on the exchange. 

Around 2:00 a.m. ET, the exchange identified the issue and began instituting a fix that resulted in rolling back the state of Paradex Chain, a blockchain built using the Starknet stack. Starknet is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.

“We have identified the issue and will be rolling back chain state to block 1604710,” the status update reads. “This is the time before the DB maintenance and is the last known correct state. All accounts will be restored to the state before the DB maintenance. We will provide more updates as we continue with rollback.”

Shortly thereafter, Paradex force-cancelled all remaining open orders, and around 5:00 a.m. ET it confirmed that all user funds were safe as its recovery process was ongoing.

“Recovery efforts are ongoing. We can confirm that all user funds are SAFU,” a post on the status page at 5:16 a.m. ET reads. 

It's still unclear how much the liquidations tallied up to, but data from DeFiLlama indicates that the perps protocol has around $641 million in open interest. The protocol has facilitated around $37 billion in volume over the last 30 days. 

All Paradex services are now operational, according to an update on the status page.

Bitcoin Slips On Trade War Fears, Sparks $865M in Liquidations

The exchange's price glitch followed a volatile period of trading for BTC, which dropped from more than $95,000 to $92,284 just after 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The 2% drop in the last 24 hours has eaten into the top crypto asset's weekly gain, which now stands at 1.4% with BTC recently changing hands at $93,318. 

The slide triggered a growing number of liquidations, which have now extended to more than $875 million over the last 24 hours—$234 million of which can be attributed to Bitcoin, according to data from CoinGlass.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- Cryptocurrencies fell sharply as risk assets slipped and haven demand strengthened, after US President Donald Trump proposed new levies on eight European countries.

Bitcoin slid as much as 3.6% to below $92,000 during Asia trading hours on Monday, while other tokens posted steeper losses. Ether, the second-largest digital asset, shed 4.9% of its value, while Solana fell 8.6%.

The selloff knocked about $100 billion off the crypto market's total value, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin pared some of those losses to trade around 2.5% down as of 6 a.m. in New York.

Trump said over the weekend that he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from eight European countries starting Feb. 1, rising to 25% in June unless there's a deal for a “purchase of Greenland.” That saw US equity-index futures slump as trading began Monday, while haven assets gold and silver surged to records.

The president's comments drew rebuke from European leaders, who are now poised to halt the approval of a trade agreement struck last year.

Digital assets had been enjoying a promising start to the year, after ending 2025 in a malaise, unable to mount a sustained recovery from a brutal October rout. Bitcoin rose to just shy of $98,000 on Jan. 14, with strong inflows into a group of US-listed exchange-traded funds for the token.

That was seen as “a rebound from the oversold levels driven by tax-loss selling and general capitulation coming into year-end,” said Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund DACM. The latest bout of tariff concerns has pumped the brakes on that, while gold hitting all-time highs confirms the selling is “more a risk-off move than anything crypto-specific,” Galvin added.

About $790 million of bullish bets on cryptocurrencies were liquidated in the past 24 hours, CoinGlass data show. Traders see $90,000 as the next stop if current support fails, “while bulls point to institutional demand as a potential floor,” said Rachael Lucas, an analyst at BTC Markets.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has argued that modern DAO design is “inefficient, vulnerable to capture, and fails utterly at the goal of mitigating the weaknesses of human politics.”

In a tweet, Buterin said he once believed that systems of code and rules existing on decentralized networks could “manage resources and direct activity more efficiently and more robustly” than conventional governments and corporations.

We need more DAOs - but different and better DAOs.

The original drive to build Ethereum was heavily inspired by decentralized autonomous organizations: systems of code and rules that lived on decentralized networks that could manage resources and direct activity, more…

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 19, 2026



However, he claimed that since Ethereum's founding, DAOs in practice have drifted toward “essentially referring to a treasury controlled by token-holder voting.” This, he argued, leaves them open to control by centralized actors and has made many observers cynical about DAOs as a concept.

“We need more DAOs – but different and better DAOs,” Buterin wrote.

Among the solutions he proposed were improvements to the oracles that power DAOs and DeFi protocols. In crypto, blockchain oracles connect blockchains to external real-world systems, enabling smart contracts to execute by bridging on-chain and off-chain data. Buterin criticized both token-based oracles and human curation, calling the latter “not very decentralized.”

Buterin identified two core problems that he thinks must be solved for DAOs to function effectively: privacy and decision fatigue.

“Without privacy, governance becomes a social game,” he said.

He said modern technology could open “the door to a renaissance” in terms of solving the above problems, specifically the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy. In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof is a method used to prove that something is known without revealing the known information directly, which can be useful for privacy-centric applications.

Buterin also highlighted the ability of AI to reduce decision fatigue, but warned against putting a mainstream large language model like OpenAI's GPT or China's DeepSeek in charge of a DAO.

Zero-knowledge specialist Harry Halpin, CEO and co-founder of mix network Nym Technologies and a former research scientist at MIT, told Decrypt that the technology could help DAOs function more fairly.

""DAOs are the future of democratic politics, and just as we don't want our votes for president in a national election to be public, we don't want our votes in token governance to be public either,"" Halpin said, adding that, ""Zero-knowledge proofs are one way to achieve that.""

Halpin acknowledged that zero-knowledge DAOs are not yet “technically mature”, but said Nym would be happy to adopt them once the software is ready. Halpin pointed to projects such as AnonDAO, a project associated with privacy-centric Layer-1 blockchain DarkFi, as proof that private DAO governance is feasible in practice.

Members of the DarkFi project told Decrypt they were inspired by the AssangeDAO project, which helped to raise over $50 million for Australian political activist Julian Assange.

Rachel Rose O'Leary, a founder and core developer at DarkFi, told Decrypt that “transparency forced us to hand control of the funds to an off-chain nonprofit foundation,” during her work on AssangeDAO.

""DAOs cannot do real shit without anonymity,"" she told Decrypt. ""Give DAOs anonymity and you give them real political power.""

Key Takeaways:

A sudden and violent sell-off of the crypto market occurred, destroying more than $100 billion of the total market value in half a day. Mega assets shifted down almost at the same time, indicating a general de-risking action and not a specific failure of a single token



The global crypto market cap dropped sharply over a 12-hour window, erasing roughly $100 billion as sellers took control across large-cap and mid-cap tokens. Data from heatmap indicated that there was a close-to-global sea of red with Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP and Solana recording significant losses.

Bitcoin fell about 2.5% – 3%, taking the rest of the market along. Ethereum was the next in line as it lost over 3%, whereas XRP and Solana had even greater losses within the day. Smaller-cap altcoins experienced greater declines with liquidity drying up and stop-losses being called.

The speed of the move stood out. What began as a controlled pullback quickly turned into a cascade, suggesting that positioning and leverage played a major role in the scale of the decline.

Bitcoin was the main trigger when it was not able to maintain significant short-term support areas. When BTC fell under closely monitored amounts, the selling force escalated in both spot and derivatives markets.

Any traders who had hedged a higher continuation were compelled to undo. This formed a market of its own where declining prices spawned liquidations, which further pushed the prices down.

The fact that Bitcoin could not recover higher weekly closes contributed to the bearish momentum. A failed close can be viewed as an indicator by short-term traders to minimize exposure, particularly when the overall macro environment is in question.

Altcoins were a swift succession of Bitcoin. Ether fell over 3%, which was indicative of risk aversion across the market, as well as less interest in leveraged trades. XRP has been dropping nearly 4% and Solana by more than 6%, which is not doing well compared with the majors.

Correlations between crypto assets had gone up drastically during the sell-off. This is common when markets are under stress, diversification benefits are going to disappear and traders are viewing crypto as a risk bucket.

Even smaller percentage losses were experienced by smaller tokens. The thinness of order books and low depth of bids exposed the prices to abrupt sell orders, particularly during the off-peak hours.

Best altcoins to buy now are in focus again as Bitcoin dropped below $93,000 during the early Monday session after Donald Trump's new Greenland-related tariffs on eight European allies over the past weekend.

The U.S. President announced a 10% tariff on European countries that are supporting Denmark against his bid for Greenland. Across 8 countries, he imposed a 10% tariff, effective from 1 February, warning that it could rise to 25% in June.

This has triggered a sharp “risk-off” move in the global financial markets. Investors are reacting to the escalating trade tensions by liquidating speculative positions in favor of traditional safe havens like gold and reducing exposure to assets like cryptocurrencies. This led to a sharp sell-off in the broader crypto market. 

The total crypto market cap has fallen from the January 15 peak of $3.37 trillion to $3.26 trillion. While this might seem like a cautious sign for early investors, veterans know that this lenvironment presents an ideal time to add potential tokens for the next leg up. 

While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still holding above the current support level, some altcoins are showing immense strength despite broader market weakness.

Here are the top four altcoins that could outperform the market in the upcoming bull run:

Bitcoin has dominated the crypto landscape since its inception. Its high security and demand have positioned it as the number one crypto, despite its limited ability to expand its ecosystem for tokenization, dApps, or NFTs like Ethereum and Solana have achieved. This is precisely what Bitcoin Hyper is addressing. 



Bitcoin Hyper is built to make Bitcoin faster and more practical. Instead of processing every transaction directly on the main network, it uses zk-rollups to group thousands of transactions off-chain and then settle them together on Bitcoin. This approach eases network congestion and sharply lowers transaction costs, without compromising security.

What truly sets Bitcoin Hyper apart is its integration of the Solana Virtual Machine. By tapping into a system capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin Hyper opens the door to high-speed applications on the Bitcoin network. This makes advanced use cases such as DeFi platforms, blockchain games, and NFT trading possible at a scale that Bitcoin alone could not support.

Currently, the project is in its presale phase with each HYPER token priced at just $0.013605. Bitcoin Hyper offers 38% p.a. Staking rewards, the highest in the industry. It has already amassed over $30.8 million, demonstrating strong investor confidence and positioning it as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Monero (XMR) has been a trending token in the crypto market over the last week, following a sharp 70% surge in just a few sessions. The move was triggered by investors shifting towards privacy tokens after a series of multi-million-dollar swaps to Monero following a social engineering attack. This increased the demand for privacy tokens like XMR.

Following a strong breakout on January 11, the altcoin surged to a new all-time high of $801. However, after the recent correction hit the market, it dropped to a low of $533, but as dip buyers stepped in, it has recovered above $620. Currently, XMR is trading at $624, up 6.8% over the past 24 hours.

During the drop, the 20-day moving average has served as strong support for the price. At the moment, the $600 and $570 levels are immediate support, while the $650 and $700 are local resistance. If another breakout occurs, Monero could target the $1,000 psychological mark, while in a bearish scenario, it could see a bearish move below the $500 support. 

In the best altcoins to buy now list, Maxi Doge is one of the leading projects in the meme coin space. In just a few weeks of launch, the project has raised nearly $4.5 million with tokens priced at just $0.000279. Demand in the presale has skyrocketed, as the current stage ends in under 48 hours, and the price will increase automatically thereafter. 

Maxi Doge leans fully into chaos, and it does so on purpose. Instead of playing it safe, the project uses an over-the-top Shiba mascot and a tongue-in-cheek message that openly mocks reckless trading culture. The branding grabs attention fast, but it is not just noise for the sake of memes.



Behind the visuals, the team is pushing for real engagement. MAXI is designed to plug into perpetual trading platforms, and the project runs regular trading contests where users can earn rewards in both MAXI and USDT. These mechanics turn the brand into something people actively interact with, not just scroll past.

On the token side, Maxi Doge keeps things controlled. The total supply is capped at 150.24 billion tokens, removing the risk of endless inflation that often kills meme coins over time. Holders can also stake their tokens and earn up to 73% APY, adding a yield layer to the narrative. Together, these elements position $MAXI as a presale that blends attention-grabbing energy with features that extend beyond pure hype.

As Bitcoin and other altcoins face selling pressure, Tron is one of the blue-chip cryptocurrencies that has defied the wider market correction. In the past seven days, TRON has surged by over 6.5% and is currently trading above $0.31.

The breakout in Tron has been sustained due to high trading volume and the strong performance of its ecosystem. Since its December low, the altcoin has surged nearly 20%, an exceptional performance for a large-cap token amid these conditions. 

However, Tron is still trading 14% below the 2025 high. The tokens need to clear key resistance levels around $0.33 and $0.38 to achieve a new 52-week high. However, its strong performance in weak market conditions positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

For much of blockchain's commercial life, regulation functioned as a question mark rather than a framework.

Financial institutions monitored developments, commissioned pilot projects and waited for clarity that rarely arrived in usable form.

Early blockchain governance was often aspirational, relying on loosely defined communities and computationally derived consensus.

However, findings in the January edition of the Blockchain and Digital Assets Tracker® Series, a collaboration between PYMNTS Intelligence and Citi, revealed that digital assets are growing up.

The report found that across major markets, digital asset regulation has shifted from abstract principle to operational instruction. The result is an increasingly consequential change in how blockchain is being adopted, with progress now dependent less on policy pronouncements and more on the ability to implement regulation in working systems.

The regulatory frameworks of major global markets have little patience for abstractions. The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, in particular, emphasizes identifiable issuers, accountable management, documented risk controls and supervisory access.

This clarity is altering the decision-making for banks, payments firms and asset managers weighing financial blockchain solutions and products. The market is converging on designs that regulators understand because those are the designs that businesses and banks can actually deploy.

One of the clearest examples of this shift is the evolution of stablecoins and tokenized cash instruments. Under MiCA and parallel proposals in the United States, stablecoins are no longer judged primarily by market adoption or technical robustness. They are assessed against specific thresholds, like one-to-one reserve backing, segregation of client funds, transparent redemption rights, independent audits and accountable governance.

Reserves are held in regulated financial institutions, often in cash or short-dated government securities. Disclosure regimes mirror those of money market funds. Governance frameworks include boards, risk committees and regulatory reporting lines.

These changes are not cosmetic. They affect how tokens are minted and burned, how liquidity is managed under stress, and how on-chain activity maps to off-chain legal claims.

Custody has emerged as one of the most operationally complex areas of institutional blockchain adoption. Regulators have been explicit that safeguarding digital assets requires clear segregation of client holdings, robust key management, and legally enforceable ownership rights. This has forced institutions to rethink how blockchain custody aligns with existing accounting, insolvency and fiduciary frameworks.

Read the report: Chain Reaction: Regulatory Clarity as the Catalyst for Blockchain Adoption

What distinguishes the current phase of blockchain adoption from earlier cycles is that regulation is no longer the sole stress test. Business viability now matters just as much. Products must not only comply; they must perform under real-world conditions like market volatility, liquidity crunches, operational failures and changes in customer demand.

Banks experimenting with tokenized deposits, for example, are discovering that regulatory compliance is only the first hurdle. Systems must integrate with legacy payment rails, support intraday liquidity management, and deliver cost or speed advantages over existing solutions. If blockchain-based instruments do not outperform incumbent infrastructure on at least some dimensions, regulatory clarity alone will not justify adoption.

In practice, this may mean hybrid models where transactions and settlement may occur on-chain, while authoritative records of ownership, valuation and risk exposure often remain off-chain within regulated systems of record. Institutions are investing in reconciliation mechanisms that ensure on-chain states and off-chain books remain synchronized. Failures here are not theoretical; they carry direct regulatory, legal and reputational consequences.

In that sense, blockchain may be entering its most consequential phase. The question is no longer whether regulation will allow adoption, but whether organizations are prepared to operationalize it.

Ultimately, as the report highlighted, the future of blockchain finance could be defined less by what is possible on-chain and more by what can be audited, supervised and insured off-chain.

Ripple's role is evolving alongside the United States' shift from regulation by enforcement to regulation by legislation, a transition that could keep XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) relevant even as market structure changes.

What Happened: Trader Cryptoinsightuk said the U.S. has moved from a hostile stance toward crypto to a framework designed to support innovation and domestic development.

Recent measures such as the GENIUS Act on stablecoins, the CLARITY Act clarifying securities versus commodities, and Executive Order 14178, which bans retail CBDCs while backing public blockchains, have provided long-sought regulatory clarity. Together, they lower barriers for institutional participation and position the U.S. as a global hub for digital assets.

Against this backdrop, Ripple has spent more than $4 billion building out an institutional-grade financial stack. Since 2023, the company has acquired multiple custody providers, including Metaco, Fortress Trust, Standard Custody, and Palisade, along with prime broker Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime), stablecoin payments rail Rail, and treasury management platform GTreasury.

These assets form an integrated system spanning custody, payments, prime brokerage, and treasury operations, anchored around the XRP Ledger and Ripple's U.S. dollar stablecoin, RLUSD.

Why It Matters: Cryptoinsightuk said XRP's role may evolve rather than disappear. As regulated stablecoins such as RLUSD become the primary settlement layer, XRP could function as a liquidity bridge across chains, collateral within prime brokerage, and a tool for cross-border settlement and corporate treasury use cases.

Regulatory clarity makes it easier for institutions to adopt RLUSD first, with XRP potentially following as confidence grows. While this does not guarantee near-term price appreciation, Ripple's acquisition strategy, clearer U.S. rules, and continued focus on cross-border payments strengthen the long-term infrastructure and adoption case.

The groundwork being laid now could shape where future institutional liquidity ultimately flows.

Indie game developer Oxalis Games has decided to shift direction for their upcoming cozy role-playing game, Moonfrost, by moving away from using web3 and NFTs. The studio is now focusing on delivering a ""handcrafted, premium"" experience, with plans to launch on Steam and the Epic Games Store.

Along with this change, there has been a shift in the company's leadership. Gina Nelson has stepped up as the sole CEO after previously co-leading with fellow co-founder Ric Moore until July 2024. Nelson had been the Chief Operating Officer for over five years prior to this change.



Ric Moore announced his departure from his role at the company via LinkedIn, explaining that he stepped down after Nelson expressed her desire to lead the company independently. According to Companies House records, Moore was removed as a director on December 31, 2025, but he remains connected to Oxalis as an advisory board member and is identified as a significant stakeholder, alongside Nelson.

CEO Gina Nelson commented on the decision to move away from NFTs, stating, “We chose a path that didn't suit Moonfrost and listened closely to our community. Those who are passionate about cozy games seek enriching worlds and impactful progression, not NFTs. Therefore, we're fully committed to building Moonfrost in line with these beliefs.”

Nelson further explained that while web3 communities are often focused on earning and speculation, this was not the foundation on which Moonfrost was built. The game aims to create a welcoming environment for players, beyond farming or adventures, and is intended for the premium PC gaming market.

The studio has also explored AI tools but is committed to emphasizing craftsmanship. Nelson stated, ""Moonfrost is crafted by individuals down to the pixel and system, with an original soundtrack that immerses players in its world. It's deliberate, hands-on work, and we're proud of it. Our human touch distinguishes us in a landscape of automated content.""

Oxalis Games was established in August 2020 and initially raised $4.5 million in seed funding with support from investors such as Blocore, Supercell, Animoca Brands, Griffin Gaming Partners, Sir Ian Livingstone, and Phil Mansell, then CEO of Jagex. More recently, they secured an additional $2 million in late 2025, led by L1D and Arete Capital.","{'href': 'https://wnhub.io', 'title': 'WN Hub'}","cryptocurrency"

Co-CEO and co-founder Ric Moore has stepped down, Gina Nelson is now the studio's sole chief executive

Indie developer Oxalis Games is changing direction on upcoming cosy RPG, Moonfrost, ditching web3 and NFTs.

The company now says it is focused on releasing the game as a ""handcrafted, premium"" release and is targeting Steam and the Epic Games Store when it comes to launch.

This news also comes alongside a change in leadership at the company; Gina Nelson is now Oxalis Games' sole CEO, having previously shared the role with fellow co-founder Ric Moore as of July 2024. Before that, she spent five and a half years as COO.

Moore announced his departure from the studio on LinkedIn, saying that he had stepped down after Nelson ""expressed a desire to run the company on her own"".

Companies House has him being removed as a director as of December 31, 2025, but he has remained at Oxalis as an advisory board member, adding that he is still a ""major stakeholder""; on Companies House, he is still a person with significant control, alongside Nelson.

“We tried a path that didn't fit Moonfrost,” Nelson said.

“And we heard you - loudly and clearly. The communities that truly care about cozy games want rich worlds, meaningful progression, and a safe, welcoming place to escape into. They don't want NFTs. So we're closing that chapter completely and building Moonfrost the way it should always have been.""

She added: “Web3 communities are often shaped around earning and speculation. That isn't a foundation for the kind of game we're making. We've built Moonfrost with an enormous amount of care and passion, because it's meant to feel like a world players can truly come home to. It's about more than farming or adventuring, and it belongs in the premium PC space.”

Nelson also said that while Oxalis has ""explored AI tools"", the studio will be focusing on ""doubling down on craft""

""Moonfrost is made by people - pixel by pixel, system by system - with a beautiful original soundtrack that pulls you into the world,"" she said. ""It's intentional, hands-on work, and we're proud of that. We have no interest in replacing our team, and I believe the human touch is what will stand out in a sea of low-effort, automated content.""

Oxalis Games was founded in August 2020. Two years later, the company attracted $4.5 million in seed funding led by Blocore, but also including names including Supercell, Animoca Brands, Griffin Gaming Partners, and Sir Ian Livingstone and then-Jagex CEO Phil Mansell. The company has since attracted another $2 million in a late 2025 funding round led by L1D and Arete Capital.

Synergy Week 3 in Kaidro's play-to-acquire ecosystem is currently enticing players to strategically optimize their NFT lockups. This event, spanning from January 18 to January 24, 2026, leverages a detailed synergy system where players must configure their NFT sets to boost reward outcomes.

KAIDRO P2A UPDATE! 🐉The grind continues and the stakes are higher than ever. Synergy Week 3 has officially begun!Are you pushing for the top… or settling for your current rank? 👀  🗓 Start Date: January 18, 2026 | 12:00 AM UTC 🗓 End Date: January 24, 2026 | 12:00 AM… pic.twitter.com/8bksH2tT7N

Participants in Kaidro's Synergy Week 3 can capitalize on the synergy system that calculates two main outputs: Rank Points and Kalodium ($KALO). To generate these rewards, players must lock in a set of three NFTs from the same clan, keeping the locked setup for the entire week to obtain maximum points. Specifically, for every 5 Rank Points accumulated from these synergies, players are rewarded with 1 $KALO.

To garner optimal benefits, players are prompted to keep their strategic NFT sets locked from the start of the week at midnight GMT on a Sunday to just before midnight on the following Saturday. Adjustments or changes to the active NFT set during the week could decrease the full potential earnings compared to maintaining a steady set throughout the entire period.

The pricing for creating Synergy Slots in Kaidro employs a tiered model to encourage a broader investment in diverse NFT combinations. The cost for each additional slot decreases progressively; starting at 1 RON or 1 AKDR for the first slot, and going down to 0.1 RON or AKDR for the fifth slot onwards.

The gaming mechanics demand strict adherence to the rules for the NFT lockups to be deemed valid. Each assembled lockup must contain exactly three NFTs from the same clan, with daily scores derived from systematically calculating tier values and bonus multipliers, ensuring fairness in reward distribution.

Besides the principal Synergy feature, Kaidro's ecosystem also integrates additional player engagement tools such as the Spin Wheel and Quests. These components aim to keep players actively involved and accumulating Rank Points consistently throughout the monthly cycle.

Synergy Week 3 kicked off on January 18, 2026, capturing considerable interest in Kaidro's gaming community. The event signifies a pivotal period where players can delve into intensive strategic play, configuring and maintaining ideal NFT sets to optimize their rewards before the event concludes on January 24, 2026.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has updated its guidance on international transfers of personal information, making it quicker for businesses to understand and comply with the transfer rules under UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).  

The updated guidance sets out key requirements, reduces complexity and supports the responsible transfer of personal information. 

The guidance details a clear ‘three step test' for organisations to use to identify if they are making restricted transfers. Additional new content has been added on roles and responsibilities, which reflects the complexity of multi-layered transfer scenarios. In addition, a brief guide, quick reference FAQs and a glossary will support organisations which do not have specialist knowledge or experience in making international transfers.  

The update is part of an ongoing project which will further develop parts of ICO guidance, such as its approach to transfer risk assessments (TRAs), and additional guidance on the international data transfer agreement (IDTA) and cloud services.

ICO also plans to add an interactive tool to help organisations identify whether they are making a restricted transfer, and more examples and case studies that reflect the complexity of global transfer scenarios.  

To further support organisations with their approach to international transfers, ICO is hosting a webinar to talk through the changes and highlight the main things organisations making or advising on restricted transfers need to know.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has introduced an AI-powered system to automate the creation of cases in its primary case management platform, ICE 360, reducing manual processing times and improving data accuracy.

The new system uses a large language model (LLM) to parse unstructured complaints and queries submitted via email, extracting key data to create cases automatically. Previously, case officers spent an average of 12 to 15 minutes manually creating each case, requiring the equivalent of 9.5 full-time employees daily. The AI tool is expected to handle up to 90% of case creation, about  5,700 cases per month.

The LLM, Azure OpenAI GPT o3-mini, processes plain-text emails, converting them into structured data for case creation. While the system does not make decisions on case outcomes or priorities, it significantly reduces the administrative burden on ICO staff. Cases created automatically are flagged for manual review, ensuring accuracy and compliance.

A spokesperson for the ICO said: “Automation improves efficiency and reduces the risk of human error. The system is designed to complement, not replace, human oversight; case officers still review and validate every automated case.”

The project was developed in collaboration with external suppliers, including Kainos Software, Shout Digital, and Nexer Digital, under strict data protection controls. Access to production data is restricted, and all external staff undergo vetting checks.

The ICO conducted a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before deployment, addressing risks such as incorrect contact linking. Mitigations include using Levenshtein Distance Matching to improve organisation name accuracy and requiring manual verification of automated cases.

The system is now in production, with ongoing maintenance and performance reviews to ensure reliability. The ICO plans to refine the tool based on case officer feedback and evolving requirements.

India's central bank has quietly floated a proposal that could carry far-reaching geopolitical consequences: linking the official digital currencies of BRICS countries to facilitate cross-border trade and tourism payments.

India's central bank has quietly floated a proposal that could carry far-reaching geopolitical consequences: linking the official digital currencies of BRICS countries to facilitate cross-border trade and tourism payments. According to sources, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that the idea be placed on the agenda of the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is set to host later this year. If accepted, it would mark the first formal attempt by the bloc to connect their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) into a shared framework.

The proposal comes at a moment of heightened global tension. Trade wars have resurfaced, the U.S. dollar's political centrality is increasingly contested, and emerging economies are searching for ways to insulate themselves from financial coercion without openly declaring war on the dollar-based system.

At its core, the plan aims to make payments between BRICS members faster, cheaper, and less dependent on existing dollar-centric channels. By linking CBDCs, countries could settle trade invoices, tourism expenses, and potentially trade finance directly in their sovereign digital currencies. This would bypass correspondent banking bottlenecks and reduce exposure to sanctions or tariff-driven financial pressure.

India has been careful to frame the proposal as technical rather than ideological. The RBI has repeatedly stressed that promoting the digital rupee internationally is not about de-dollarisation, but about efficiency, resilience, and modernising cross-border payments. Still, the strategic implications are difficult to ignore.

The timing is significant. BRICS has regained prominence amid President Donald Trump's renewed tariff threats and warnings against countries seeking alternatives to the dollar. Trump has previously labelled BRICS “anti-American” and openly threatened punitive trade measures against its members.

Against this backdrop, a BRICS-linked CBDC system would not replace the dollar overnight, but it would represent a subtle shift: from dependence on U.S.-dominated financial plumbing to parallel infrastructure controlled by emerging economies themselves. In a world where access to payment systems has become a geopolitical lever, that shift alone is meaningful.

Despite its ambition, the proposal faces a long and uncertain road. None of the major BRICS members has fully launched a CBDC, though all are running pilots. Interoperability—both technical and regulatory—remains a major challenge. Questions around governance, data sharing, settlement of trade imbalances, and trust in each other's platforms are unresolved.

Past experience offers cautionary lessons. Earlier efforts by India and Russia to expand local-currency trade ran into problems when Russia accumulated large rupee balances it could not easily deploy. To avoid similar pitfalls, the RBI is exploring mechanisms such as bilateral foreign exchange swaps and periodic settlements to manage imbalances more smoothly.

Political hesitation may prove just as difficult as technical complexity. Countries may be reluctant to rely on platforms designed or dominated by others, especially when strategic trust within BRICS remains uneven.

India's persistence on CBDCs stands out at a time when global enthusiasm has shifted toward stablecoins. The RBI has taken a firm stance against that trend, arguing that privately issued stablecoins pose risks to monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and regulatory control. For India, the e-rupee is not just a payments tool but a safeguard for its digital financial ecosystem.

By contrast, linking CBDCs within BRICS would allow countries to experiment with innovation while retaining full state control an appealing compromise for governments wary of both dollar dominance and private digital currencies.

If even partially realised, a BRICS CBDC linkage would strengthen financial ties within the bloc and deepen South–South economic integration. It would also reinforce BRICS' role as a forum for practical cooperation rather than grand but unrealised ambitions like a common currency.

Globally, the impact would be incremental rather than revolutionary. The dollar's dominance rests on deep capital markets, legal trust, and liquidity advantages no CBDC network can easily replicate. But incremental erosion matters. Over time, alternative systems can reduce the dollar's exclusivity, even if they do not dethrone it.

This proposal is best understood not as an anti-dollar rebellion, but as strategic hedging. India, in particular, is walking a careful line: seeking insulation from geopolitical shocks without provoking outright confrontation with the United States. By emphasising efficiency, tourism, and trade facilitation, New Delhi is framing a geopolitical move in technocratic language.

Yet intentions matter less than perceptions. In Washington, any effort that reduces dollar dependence especially within a bloc that includes China and Russia will be viewed through a strategic lens. That alone could raise the political cost of implementation.

The deeper significance lies elsewhere. Finance is becoming modular. Instead of one dominant system, multiple overlapping payment networks are emerging, each reflecting different power centres. A linked BRICS CBDC system would not end dollar dominance but it would mark another step toward a more fragmented, multipolar financial order where states, not markets alone, decide how money moves across borders.

Business Insider Edition 

India has proposed that BRICS nations explore linking their official digital currencies to simplify cross-border trade and tourism payments, a move that could gradually reduce reliance on the US dollar as geopolitical tensions intensify.


        According to two sources familiar with the discussions, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that the proposal be placed on the agenda of the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is set to host later this year.
    


        If accepted, it would mark the first time the bloc formally considers connecting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) across member states.
    


        The BRICS grouping, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded in recent years to include countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Indonesia.
    


        The RBI's proposal is understood to focus on facilitating cross-border trade finance and tourism payments by making national digital currencies interoperable.
    


        Such an initiative could draw criticism from Washington, as US President Donald Trump has previously described BRICS as “anti-American” and warned that efforts to bypass the dollar could trigger retaliatory tariffs.
    


        Central banks in China, Brazil, and Russia did not respond to requests for comment, while South Africa's central bank declined to comment. India's central government also did not respond.
    


        The proposal builds on a declaration made at the 2025 BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, where members called for closer cooperation and interoperability between their payment systems to make cross-border transactions faster and cheaper.
    


        The RBI has publicly stated that it is keen to link the e-rupee with other CBDCs to boost efficiency and expand the currency's international use, while insisting that this is not a de-dollarisation drive.
    


        None of the major BRICS economies has fully launched a retail CBDC, but all are running pilot programmes. India's e-rupee, introduced in December 2022, has attracted about seven million retail users. China has also signalled plans to expand the international use of its digital yuan.
    


        To encourage adoption, the RBI has enabled offline payments, added programmability for government subsidy transfers, and allowed fintech firms to offer digital currency wallets.
    


        However, one of the sources cautioned that making BRICS CBDCs interoperable would require agreement on technology standards, governance rules, and mechanisms to settle trade imbalances.
    


        One option under discussion is bilateral foreign exchange swaps between central banks. These could allow weekly or monthly settlements while managing uneven trade flows.
    


        Previous attempts by India and Russia to increase trade in local currencies faced challenges after Russia accumulated large rupee balances with limited use, prompting India to allow such funds to be invested in local bonds.
    


        The renewed interest in CBDCs comes despite growing global enthusiasm for stablecoins. India has taken a sceptical stance, arguing that stablecoins pose risks to monetary stability.
    


        RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said recently that CBDCs “do not pose many of the risks associated with stablecoins”, citing concerns over monetary control and systemic resilience.
    


        While the road to a linked BRICS digital currency system remains long and politically sensitive, the proposal underscores the bloc's continued search for alternatives in an increasingly fragmented global financial order.

                        Crypto payments are moving closer to scale as WalletConnect works to hide blockchain complexity from merchants and payment providers.                      


                        Stablecoins are emerging as the practical bridge between crypto wallets and real-world commerce, especially when paired with instant settlement.                      


                        The WalletConnect-Ingenico partnership extends crypto payments into physical retail without forcing merchants to hold digital assets.

Cryptocurrency payments have spent years hovering at the edge of mainstream commerce.

Now, momentum is building as infrastructure providers focus less on blockchains and more on making digital currency usable at scale.

WalletConnect Pay CEO Jess Houlgrave said the long road to adoption reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what payments actually require.

“People conflate what settlement is and what a payment is,” she said during a PYMNTS TV interview. “Blockchains are really great for settling value and for moving value, but all of the other pieces of a payment—all of the messaging and the complicated bits—are not really designed for a blockchain ecosystem.”

That gap, described by the CEO as the “messy middle” of payments, includes authorization, capture, refunds and disputes. Houlgrave said those elements explain why crypto payments have struggled to move beyond experimentation.

Stablecoins have emerged as the most practical crypto asset for payments, especially as wallets increasingly link to traditional card rails.

“A number of crypto wallets have now linked Visa and Mastercard to those wallets, and the transaction volumes have shot through the roof during 2025,” Houlgrave said.

Card-based stablecoin volume reached roughly $500 million in December, growing rapidly month over month, even if still small in the context of global payments, she said. But those transactions still rely on Visa and Mastercard infrastructure.

WalletConnect Pay is designed to move more of the transaction onto crypto rails. Users want choice, like the ability to pay with the wallet and assets they already trust, without worrying about chains, swaps or bridges, she said.

Crypto fragmentation remains a central challenge.

“Crypto is super fragmented,” Houlgrave said. “You have different blockchains, different wallets, different assets. Even stablecoins alone have been the top topic in crypto, and there are hundreds of different stablecoins and new ones launching every day.”

For merchants, that fragmentation creates operational and regulatory hurdles. WalletConnect Pay keeps choice with the consumer while standardizing areas regulators care about most, she said.

“When we think about information capture, privacy, who has what kind of information and how we share that, of course, that needs to be standardized,” she said.

A core objective is to shield merchants and payments companies from crypto complexity altogether.

“The payments company and the merchant shouldn't even need to know about any of this stuff,” Houlgrave said. “They should just be able to serve this as an offering.”

WalletConnect positions itself as an orchestration layer, handling compliance, sanctions screening and off-ramping.

“Our job is to remove the complexity,” she said.

That philosophy underpins WalletConnect's new partnership with Ingenico. The integration enables stablecoin payments directly at physical checkout using Ingenico's Android payment terminals.

Merchants can accept supported stablecoins without new hardware and without holding digital currencies on their balance sheets.

“What we're doing with WalletConnect is trying to be that messaging layer that sits alongside the settlement,” Houlgrave said.

The rollout builds on WalletConnect's existing scale. The network connects more than 700 wallets serving over half a billion crypto users and facilitated more than $400 billion in network volume in 2025, including hundreds of billions in stablecoin transactions.

Ingenico's global footprint gives WalletConnect access to millions of payment terminals across retail, hospitality, transportation and self-service environments. The partnership allows crypto payments to move beyond eCommerce and into everyday, in-store commerce.

Most merchants do not want to hold stablecoins, a reality that WalletConnect's roadmap addresses.

WalletConnect manages the conversion between crypto and fiat, enabling refunds that resemble card-based timing.

“You can expect that to be very much in line with how a card refund timing works today,” Houlgrave said, adding that near-instant refunds are on the roadmap.

Adoption will accelerate as banks and neobanks enable customers to hold stablecoins directly, she said.

“Even some very established old banks are really getting their heads around this,” she said.

The goal, she said, is simple: “If people are able to hold stablecoins, we need to give them ways of using that in-store as well as online.”

Bitcoin traded near $93,200 (roughly Rs. 84.7 lakh) on Monday, as the cryptocurrency market remained range-bound amidst cautious investor sentiment. The world's largest cryptocurrency was priced around $93,200 (roughly Rs. 84.7 lakh), based on today's market data. Analysts said recent profit-taking and macro uncertainty are driving consolidation at lower levels. Ethereum (ETH) was trading near $3,200 (roughly Rs. 2.9 lakh), holding steady alongside Bitcoin, signalling continued confidence in the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin is currently priced around Rs. 84.7 lakh in India, while Ethereum trades near Rs. 2.9 lakh, as per today's Gadgets 360 price tracker.

According to market participants, Bitcoin is currently trading in the low-$90,000 range (about Rs. 81.86 lakh) as investors continue to exercise caution anticipating impending US inflation data and Federal Reserve remarks that may cause interest rate expectations to be reset. Analysts added that the absence of ETF trading during the US holiday period has kept institutional flows muted, reinforcing the lack of near-term directional conviction.

Altcoins traded mixed on Monday. Binance Coin (BNB) was priced around $926.25 (roughly Rs. 84,200), while Solana (SOL) traded near $133.80 (roughly Rs. 12,170). XRP hovered around $1.97 (roughly Rs. 179), and Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading close to $0.12 (roughly Rs. 10.91).

Highlighting near-term trading trends, Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst at Mudrex, said, “The market is seeing a bout of near-term profit taking, with Bitcoin hovering around $92,500 (roughly Rs. 84.13 lakh) and Ethereum near $3,200 (roughly Rs. 2.91 lakh). Data shows a spike in short-term holder deposits, with roughly 41,800 BTC moving to exchanges in the last day, driving short-term swings. Despite this, the underlying trend remains healthy [...] Added confidence comes from Strategy indicating continued buying interest.”

Sharing his outlook, Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO of Pi42, said, “Ethereum's steady participation alongside Bitcoin signals continued confidence in the broader digital asset ecosystem. For investors, this is a time to stay disciplined, focus on long-term conviction, stagger allocations rather than chase short-term moves, and align exposure with assets that have strong network activity and liquidity. 

Commenting on broader market conditions, Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus.com, said, “On-chain data suggests this is a consolidation phase rather than one of panic selling. Buyers are consistently defending the $90,000 (roughly Rs. 81.86 lakh) support zone even as rallies face resistance near the $93,000–$95,000 (roughly Rs. 84.56 lakh–Rs. 86.41 lakh) area. For investors, this is a time to avoid chasing short-term moves. As long as key supports hold, staggered accumulation and disciplined position sizing make more sense than aggressive trading in a macro-driven market.”

Overall, Bitcoin's ability to hold above the $90,000 (roughly Rs. 81.86 lakh) support zone and attempt a move toward the $96,100 (roughly Rs. 87.41 lakh) resistance will remain central to near-term direction.

A tool-using cow is challenging what we know about farm animal intelligence

A pet cow named Veronika uses tools in a surprisingly sophisticated way—possibly because she has been allowed to live her best life

By Kate Wong edited by Andrea Thompson

A pet cow named Veronika, who lives in Austria, has been shown to engage in flexible tool use.

Antonio J. Osuna Mascaró

In news that is sure to delight fans of a certain Gary Larson cartoon turned meme about the limitations of bovine cognition, cow tools are real.

Larson's 1982 comic for his series The Far Side showed a cow standing behind a table bearing an array of oddly shaped objects. The text below the image read simply “cow tools.” Now a pet cow named Veronika has been documented not only using a tool but doing so in a surprisingly sophisticated way. The finding adds a new species to the growing list of creatures that have been found to use external objects to achieve a goal and suggests that society has been underestimating the minds of farm animals.

The story begins more than a decade ago with Witgar Wiegele, an organic farmer and traditional baker in the small Austrian town of Nötsch im Gailtal. Wiegele first observed that his family's pet Swiss Brown cow, Veronika, would sometimes pick up sticks and use them to scratch herself, presumably to alleviate skin irritation from insects. When cognitive biologist Alice Auersperg of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, saw a video recording of Veronika's behavior, “it was immediately clear that this was not accidental,” she said in a statement. “This was a meaningful example of tool use in a species that is rarely considered from a cognitive perspective.”

Auersperg and her colleague Antonio J. Osuna-Mascaró, a postdoctoral researcher, went to meet Veronika and her human family, who welcomed the researchers with freshly baked bread and apple strudel. “Veronika is very friendly,” says Osuna-Mascaró, who spent the summer observing her. “She also has a close bond with Witgar,” he notes. “Not only does Witgar prepare and sell bread, he also distributes it around the area. It was interesting to see Veronika watching every passing car with interest and trying to guess if the driver was Witgar. If she thought it was him, she would moo with all her might.”

The researchers analyzed how Veronika used one particular tool—a deck brush—to scratch herself. Observing Veronika's behavior over dozens of trials, the researchers found that she used the broom exclusively to scratch the rear half of her body, including the rump, loin, udder and belly regions that would otherwise be difficult for her to reach. She precisely manipulated the broom with her mouth, using her tongue to lift it and her teeth to secure it in place. She targeted the thick-skinned upper areas of her body with the bristled end and the more sensitive underparts with the smooth stick end. She also scrubbed more vigorously on tougher parts of her skin and used gentle pushes on her delicate parts.

To the casual observer, using a broom to scratch an itch might not seem like an act of genius. But the way Veronika changed her grip on the broom and her movement of it in anticipation of the outcome calls to mind tool-using behaviors in the famously clever primates and corvids (crows and their kin). Moreover the way she uses the two broom ends differently “""constitutes the use of a multipurpose tool, exploiting distinct properties of a single object for different functions,” Osuna-Mascaró and Auersperg write in their paper on the new findings, published today in Current Biology. Among non-human species, this kind of tool use has only been consistently documented in chimpanzees.

Such abilities may be widespread in cattle. “We don't believe that Veronika is the Einstein of cows,” Osuna-Mascaró says. Together with anecdotal reports of tool use in cattle from South Asia, the results of the new study hint that the capacity for complex problem-solving behaviors, including tool use, might have ancient evolutionary roots but that such behaviors emerge only when conditions are favorable.

As a companion animal, Veronika, now 13 years old, has lived a long life in a stimulating environment. Nötsch im Gailtal is “the most idyllic place imaginable for an Austrian cow, like straight out of The Sound of Music,” Osuna-Mascaró says. He says the family contributed to Veronika's tool use by “providing the special conditions that enabled Veronika to express herself.” Although she learned to use tools by herself, starting with branches that had fallen from trees, Wiegele later furnished her with sticks and rakes that allowed her to perfect her scratching techniques. Most livestock animals, in contrast, live much shorter lives and spend their time in impoverished settings such as factory farms without access to objects that they can manipulate.

Veronika uses different ends of the broom and different techniques when scratching different parts of her body.

Antonio J. Osuna Mascaró

“This is fantastic! I applaud the authors, as well as Veronika!” says primatologist Jill Pruetz of Texas State University, who was not involved in the new research. Pruetz studies how environmental factors influence the behavior of tool-using chimpanzees. She also has two companion cows of her own, Claire and Edith. “I am not completely surprised that cattle can use tools—after living in close proximity to my two cows for about seven years now, I have a lot more respect for bovine intelligence!” Pruetz says. “What strikes me about Veronika's tool use is the precision with which she can manipulate the tool as well as switch its ends to target specific areas.""

Pruetz adds that the paper illustrates the need for enrichment for the welfare of cattle.

“There are around 1.5 billion heads of cattle in the world, and humans have lived with them for at least 10,000 years. It's shocking that we're only discovering this now,” Osuna-Mascaró says. “We know more about the tool use of exotic animals on remote islands than we do about the cows we live with. However, we are now starting to be sensitive enough to observe them and give, at least to a few of them, the life they deserve, one in which they have the opportunity to play, interact with objects, and discover how to use them on their own.”

These spiders weave themselves giant doppelgängers to scare away predators

Spiders scare off predators by seemingly supersizing themselves

By Gennaro Tomma edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

This spiderweb structure presents the illusion of an intimidating bigger spider.

Richard Kirby

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

What's scarier than a spider? A really big spider, of course. A newfound defensive tactic takes advantage of this idea: researchers documented spiders building giant spiderlike silhouettes on their webs to ward off predators.

These decoys are an example of “web decorations” that some spiders are known to produce, often to prevent getting eaten, avoid bird strikes or attract prey. Such ornaments come in many shapes and sizes, but this is the first time scientists have documented spider-shaped decor.

From 2012 to 2022 a research team collected observations of these unusual webs in Peru, the Philippines and Madagascar, focusing on about 300 individuals from the genus Cyclosa that are typically only a few millimeters long. The researchers published their findings in Ecology and Evolution.

The spider doppelgängers are made of prey carcasses, plant debris, and other organic materials. They have a central structure from which “legs” branch out. The team proposes that the constructions serve primarily as a defense from predators such as hummingbirds or helicopter damselflies. But different species might use them in different ways.

In Peru, the spiders seem to use the decoys “as puppets,” says study co-author Phillip Torres, an entomologist and television host. “They will be on the top of the figure, and they shake the web, so they are pretending to be a bigger spider.” Small predators might be scared by a larger spider, and predators that specialize in eating the real, smaller arachnid might want to avoid a supersized one. In the Philippines, the spiders seem to instead hide inside the structure and wait for the predator to go away.

Dinesh Rao, an ecologist at Veracruzana University in Mexico, who wasn't involved in the study, emphasizes that figuring out the constructions' precise function requires more research: “You need either careful observations or experimental conditions where you actually look at how [predators] respond to these structtures.”

Let's swing for the fences with this one, shall we?

Some questions are timeless because they're so fundamental that everyone ponders them at some point in life (often—for me at least—in the shower). Others are timeless because, regardless of how many times they're asked, no definitive answer may exist.

This one seems to fall in both categories. Consciousness—the awareness of yourself, your mind and body and its surroundings—is intrinsic to what may be called “the human experience.” And yet despite being something we all viscerally know, it's also one of the hardest things to pin down and study in any objective, empirical manner.

Leaving aside whether or not insights from something like string theory (or any other area of knowledge) can offer real advances in this domain by better explaining basic neurophysiology, the deeper quandary is whether the question itself is tractable. Asking whether we'll ever understand the nature of consciousness may well be in the same quasi-nonsensical realm as wondering what's north of up, or what occurred before the beginning of time.

Perhaps, if an answer ever comes, it will arise less through studying and more through making; already there's no shortage of speculation about glimmers of consciousness in various instantiations of artificial intelligence. Then again, the query itself may miss the mark here, too: what we consider “consciousness” may be more an anthropomorphic quirk of our evolutionary biology than some reflection of deeper, universal truths.

We're unlikely to find certitude here, of course. But it's still fun to talk about. What do you think?

Have something to add? Sign in to join the discussion.

To Stuart GW. Your definition would include my cat. :-) But I think it's on the right track. It's even testable., since brains scans can be used to trace the CNS functions that are implicit. My quibble is that it conflates ""unconscious"" with ""self-aware"". IMO, ""conscious"" labels a range.

It seems to me that ""conscious"" as used by most people covers part of the range of responses to the environment. The minimal response I label tropism, see microbes, plants, fungi. The maximal as far as we can tell is self-awareness. AFAIK only some animals are self-aware.

Is a jelly fish aware of its environment? ? I doubt it, but it does decide to move in response to environmental inputs. Is a dragonfly aware? Again, I doubt it, but it has a complex nervous system, and its response to environmental inputs is at least partly determined by the state of that system, which would fit the ""range of internal factors"" in your definition. Is a fish aware of its environment? I'm pretty certain it is, one of the reasons being that fishes appear to search for environmental inputs, which suggests they have some internal representation of their environment which they are trying to match with external inputs. Are cats aware of their environment? I'm certain they are. I'm also pretty sure they are aware of their location within that environment, and also of their posture etc. Just watch a cat case the chair it's about to jump onto. Are they aware that they are aware? Maybe. In any case, self-awareness seems to be the difference between us humans and most of the other animals.

To Stuart GW

Keeping in mind that the definition of consciousness is the ability to choose voluntarily, your example of calling to mind certain thoughts/memories with your eyes closed and presuming no other sensory input is consistent with consciousness because you are still choosing voluntarily what you are recalling from memory, and that ability to choose is what defines consciousness.

Returning to the original question of whether we will ever understand consciousness, if we accept that it boils down to awareness of our surroundings and decision making based on a range of internal factors, then I think the answer is yes.  

If it's more than that, then in what way is it more than that?  Is our perception of the colour red really anything other than a convenient representation of a frequency of electromagnetic radiation?  I'm not convinced that mine is.

@boxweed and @Claude COULOMBE

Another, more common, example of conscious action which does not involve comparing incoming sensory information with memories.  When I sit with closed eyes and consider, for example, how I will spend my day, that rumination is not using incoming sensory information.  It is simply accessing existing memories, preferences, constraints etc. in order to make decisions.  Yes those mental constructs were derived, to some degree at least from sensory information, but it's not incoming at the time of the conscious experience.

To Claude Coulomb: Re Wiedemeyer's definition of consciousness as a voluntary decision. It seems to me that it's impossible to distingish between a voluntary and an involuntary decision. Any decision is driven by preferences. To decide is to prefer one of two or more options (to do nothing is always an option). All we have is the decision, and it tells us which option was preferred. Whether the preference was detremined or not, the outcome is exactly the same.

a) If we label ""consciousnesses"" as an ""emergent property"", why not label ""digestiveness"" as an ""emergent property""? Seems to me that the most important single fact of consciousnesses is that it exist only while it's happening.  To me, ""consciousness"" looks like something the brain does, just as digestion is something the gastric system does. That implies that ""consciousness"" is a behaviour. If so, thinking of consciousness as a property (emergent or otherwise)  seems to me a mistake. But maybe I'm misunderstanding what ""emergent property"" means.

b) I don't understand the math, but the claim that string theory provides a more accurate model of neural and other physical networks reminds me of fractals. It suggests that the structure of physical networks is the same at all scales. Would that apply also to the structure of networks in time? I'm thinking of the flow of plasma from the Sun. Or of the networks of electromagnetic fields that AIUI roil the surface of the Sun. Or of the ""network"" of gravity that controls the movements of everything that has mass. Would it make sens to think of quantum fields as networks? Or of interactions at the quantum level as networks?

Thanks for this article. ""Gives me to think."" :-)

The nature of consciousness is indeed one of the most profound and puzzling questions in human thought. It's fascinating how something we experience every moment—our awareness of ourselves and our surroundings—remains so difficult to fully define or study scientifically. While neuroscience and philosophy continue to explore the mechanisms behind consciousness, it may always retain an element of mystery, reminding us of the limits of human understanding and the wonder of the mind.

By the way, if you're looking to explore something timeless and spiritually enriching, https://suraheyaseen.com/ provides the complete Arabic text of this blessed Surah, allowing readers to recite and reflect on its profound guidance, connecting deeply with the divine message in a clear and authentic way.

Response to Claude COULOMBE:

1)  Yes, that's correct that a voluntary decision requires one to be conscious, and that the definition of consciousness is the ability to make a voluntary decision.

2)  Yes, reflexes can change due to frequency of stimuli, resulting in diminution or hyperactivity; however, these changes have nothing to do with consciousness as there is no choosing involved in how one responds reflexively.

3)  In locked-in syndrome, even though the person is completely paralyzed, he can still receive sensory input and choose how to react to it.  The fact that he can't move to carry out his intended response to that sensory stimulation has nothing to do with his being conscious.  Consciousness is determined by the individual, not an observer.  When the person with locked-in syndrome is conscious, he is able to choose how to react to sensory input, he just isn't able to physically carry out his response due to his paralysis.  The fact that he's paralyzed has nothing to do with his consciousness.

In lucid dreaming, by definition, the person is conscious because he is able to choose a response to sensory input.  He is in a reduced level of consciousness, but conscious just the same.

While this discussion is really unfolding with all possibilities and perceptions of individuals keeping Science as the philosophical basis, the cue from Metaphysical realisation of the Being is like Collapse of a Wave Function in Quantum Mechanics. Once one realises it, the World/Universe/ Cosmos collapses onto this Being..nothing else exists, not even the Being..!!

Response to @boxweed (and my final words, so as not to monopolize the discussion):

1. Circular argument

When I mentioned a ""circular argument,"" I was not referring to the biological feedback loop (data loop) of accumulating memory. I was referring to a logical tautology. Wiedemeyer defines a ""voluntary decision"" as a process that requires consciousness to function, yet he simultaneously uses ""voluntary decision"" to define what consciousness is. 

2. The blur between reflex and memory 

You claim that reflexes are ""purely genetic"" and devoid of memory. Reflexes are not static scripts. If you stimulate a reflex repeatedly, the synaptic response diminishes (habituation). The neurons have ""remembered"" the previous inputs and altered their efficiency accordingly. This is a form of non-associative learning stored in the circuit. The distinction between ""hardwired"" and ""learned"" is not a binary wall.

3. ""Responsiveness"" definition is too narrow

The strict definition that ""consciousness can only occur when a person is able to choose a response to an external sensory stimulus"" is demonstrably false based on 2 medical phenomenas:

Locked-in Syndrome: These patients are fully awake and conscious, yet they are completely paralyzed and cannot ""choose a response"" to external stimuli in the way you describe. Under your definition, these fully conscious human beings would be classified as unconscious.

Lucid Dreaming: A lucid dreamer is fully aware and makes decisions, yet they are disconnected from external sensory input. They are conscious without external stimuli.

Therefore, consciousness cannot be defined solely by the output (external response) but must also be defined by the internal state.

It's a shame that you probably don't live near Montréal. We could debate this for hours over coffee or a good vegetarian meal.

Response to Claude COULOMBE's three points below:

1)  Yes, incoming sensory information is compared to stored memory, but remember that that stored memory is also the result of incoming sensory information.  All of stored memory used for evaluating sensory information arises from sensory input, which starts being stored at the time of our birth.  None of this would be considered a closed loop.  You simply keep adding to memory as you receive more sensory information throughout your life, and when you're conscious, you're able to draw upon this stored memory to choose a response to further sensory input.  

2)  Reflexes are genetic and present at birth.  They have nothing to do with memory.  Memory is defined as changes to the structure of neurons in the brain secondary to sensory input via our five senses.  

3)  Yes, you are correct in that the brain can generate predictions and thoughts without external sensory input.  For instance, when a person is asleep and dreaming he is generating thoughts within his brain without sensory input.  However, this internal generation of thoughts is not consistent with consciousness, as people are not conscious when they're sleeping and consequently, are not able to choose a response to external sensory input.  As stated previously, consciousness can only occur when a person is able to choose a response to an external sensory stimulus.

@boxweed I see... 

1) So, Wiedemeyer argue that a 'voluntary decision' is the act of comparing input against memory, but he is simultaneously claim that a subject 'must be conscious' to perform this comparison. This creates an arguments closed loop. 

2) Defining 'voluntary' as 'comparing input against memorized information is a bit short because it's simple mechanics. Even a reflex arc contains a form of 'memory', the biological thresholds (synaptic weights) that determine whether a neuron fires. If a reflex signal is 'compared' against a neuronal threshold to determine an outcome, this definition would force us to classify reflexes as voluntary decisions. This mechanism of comparison exists in the simplest of neuron's circuits. It's not proof of consciousness. 

3) Robert Wiedemeyer model neglects endogenous or inner model treats the brain as a purely reactive device (Input => Process => Output). This ignores the vast amount of 'inner signals', activity generated by the cortex and other brain structures independent of current sensory impulses. The brain is not just reacting to the five senses; it is constantly generating predictions, thoughts, and simulations (top-down processing). A definition of voluntary decision / consciousness must account for these non-sensory, internally generated initiations of action.

Anyway, your answer is stimulating, thanks a lot!

Thanks @Claude COULOMBE for your comments!

In response to Claude COULOMBE's comment referring to the problem of defining voluntary decisions in my previous note, all the information contained in our brains is the result of sensory impulses that travel to our brains from one or more of our five senses.  Once the information reaches the brain, it's compared and contrasted with other stored information in our memory system.  Then, a response is initiated by the brain that it deems the best course of action for that particular stimulus.  Voluntary decisions are defined as this comparing and contrasting of information to choose an appropriate response.  Reflex reactions, for example, are not voluntary decisions, and can occur whether a person is conscious or unconscious.  When a sensory stimulus causes a reflex response, there is no comparing or contrasting this incoming sensory information.  A reaction to that sensory stimulus is a simple cause and effect process.  In order to compare and contrast incoming sensory information, then choose a response, a person has to be conscious; hence, the definition of consciousness.

I forgot to mention the article I meant: https://www.quantamagazine.org/string-theory-can-now-describe-a-universe-that-has-dark-energy-20260114/.

... Another string theory article—but with a different frame of reference ...

Wow! It's so refreshing to read the reader comments on Scientific American. It's a welcome change from the heated debates on X (I'm no more member) or even sometimes on Reddit. 

Thank you to Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn  for the « Landscape of Consciousness » website and  @Doug Baldwin and Copilot for the taxonomy of consciousness theories which, even if not correct, can at least provide a nice basis for discussion. 

I agree with many commentators (@Peter Lugten, @Stuart GW, @Don, @Tom C, @Dr. Matt, @Mitchell Timin)  about the difficult problem of defining consciousness and the practicality of using it.  First the consciousness definition is challenging but we need to get one or many for different use cases. 

Establishing an efficient and reliable protocol to determine whether a biological beings or an AI system is ""truly conscious"" is a challenging problem, perhaps even an ill-posed or intractable one without any satisfactory solution.

I like the simple definition reported by @boxweed of Robert Wiedemeyer, MD which is «  voluntarily choosing how to react to perceptive impulses » but all the problem is now to define « voluntarily decision ». 

I agree with many commentators about the fact that consciousness is not only a human phenomenon but rather a biological one (@Don, @David Hillstrom, @SL, @Bob Coppock). That said, I respectfully distrust the idea that consciousness emerges from all complex system, and even more so the idea that consciousness is a universal fluid or energy.

Finally,  thanks @Peter Lugten, I have to think more about the « The Entropic Theory of the Emergence of Consciousness »...

Thanks all folks for your comments and shared ideas.

We will never be able to understand how consciousness emerges from neurons as a matter of principle. We are blocked from such an understanding by entropy. Being conscious lowers an organisms overall entropy, making it more organized, better able to survive and sexually reproduce than would be an identical organism that was not conscious. Lowered entropy does not come for free, and there is an entropy debt to be repaid immediately and simultaneously with the emergence of consciousness. This is achieved by a Landauer's principle-like mechanism. Computation requires temporary storage of information, upon which the mind or calculator acts to perform the calculation. It cannot be stored indefinitely, and must be erased in order to proceed to the next computation. Rolf Landauer in 1961 proposed that any logically irreversible computation, i.e., erasing a bit of information, requires work, expels heat and increased entropy.  The Entropic Theory of the Emergence of Consciousness (see Landscape of Consciousness website: Entropy theories) explains that the steps, or computations involved in the emergence of consciousness must be deleted simultaneously with their being performed. The steps are executed, in both senses of the word! This is work, which explains why we have to switch it off after about 18 hours, and sleep. It releases heat, which it might eventually be possible to measure. And it explains why we'll never be able to understand how consciousness arises.

This theory has important implications for consciousness in AI. It restricts consciousness to living organisms that evolve a physical mechanism to repay their entropy debt, which I'm assuming takes place, as per the theory of Penrose and Hameroff, in the Tryptophan molecules of neural microtubules.  In order for the mechanism to evolve, the organism must benefit from being conscious, so that its offspring evolve, first, ever more efficient microtubules, and then, more efficient arrangements of neurons. If an AI computed its way to consciousness, it would delete the computation immediately, and not remember how it got there, and not be able to evolve a more effective mechanism able to execute the computation repeatedly. On the other hand, building computers out of neural organoids is extremely dangerous, and should be very tightly controlled if not prohibited.

Reference: How Entropy Explains the Emergence of consciousness: the Entropic theory. Peter Lugten, 2024. J. Neurobev. Sci. Doi: 10.4103/jnbs.jnbs_6_24 

I am aware of X and I am aware of myself being aware of X. However, there is an infinitesimal displacement between X and X'. That differance (Derrida) constitutes a dimensionless string whose vibrations manifest as consciousness.

That's a wonderful suggestion to fathom the unfathomable...I mean, in physical or experimental sense. A topic that has eluded Science, since time immemorial but is a realization of the Mystics: that's outside this World/ Universe/Cosmos.

I am all ears, for how this discussion unfolds where we wonder the origin of the Subjective Experience of Being..!

Firstly I agree with Tom C that we need an agreed definition of what we're trying to explain.  But even if we agree on a definition, I have my doubts about achieving a testable theory.  Given the subjective nature of the phenomenon it's difficult to see how it could be reliably tested.  

If we do something to your brain and it makes you less (or more) conscious or alters you consciousness in some other way, how is that qualitatively different from the fact that your brain is functioning differently, except in the way you perceive it.  

It's no good asking an AI if it's conscious, or a dolphin or even another human because you can't rely on the answer.  I'm not even sure that I am conscious, again depending on the definition.  I'm inclined to agree with Dennet (if I understand him) that it's all a bit of an illusion.  A subjective interpretation of perceptions and the mistaken belief that we have free will.  And I don't think Christof Koch's recent exposure to the cosmic consciousness proves anything beyond the impact of altered brain chemistry on our perceptions.

Maybe the idealists are right, but I can't imagine how it could be tested.

Consciousness exists in all animals..The level of consciousness is dependent on the level of complexity of the brain. While our level of consciousness seems to be the highest at present, I'm sure it is still far from the high test level that can be obtained.

Physically, the complexity of the brain and its “wiring” are factors. Brain injury has demonstrated that consciousness is not separate from the brain. Change the brain, consciousness is changed. 

Now we are more aware of the brain - body connection. The brain does not operate independently. The body has input to the brain. Bacteria, living in out body, have input to the brain. Both influence decisions. Our understanding of the concept of free will has changed accordingly and how free will impacts our concept of consciousness.

It seems that every new discovery just brings new questions. 

I guess I am a little  embarrassed to admit this, but a few years back I learned from Scientific American that while matter can die, energy does not.  This inspired my imagination to envision a vibrant universe that is connected and connecting.  I am a firm believer that consciousness is pure energy and that pure energy can occupy mass, but not confined to mass.   If we look at consciousness in biological terms, we have only surface and not truth.  Exploring consciousness outside of physical terms is extremely exciting, if science can allow it.  

Understanding where consciousness comes from is even more important now so we can tell if AI becomes conscious. 

The other fundamental question is what is Time?

Consciousness is an emergent property not of any complex system, as some believe, but rather probably a property emerging from the interaction between a slowly evolving complex biological system and its environment. We will probably never be able to explain the behavior of a human or any intelligent agent by looking solely at its brain. We must consider the triad of brain, body, and environment.

This reminds me of Roger Penrose's (2020 Nobel Prize in Physics) favorite dramatic word: « collapse ». First, the collapse of mathematical formalism, referring to Gödel's theorem to explain the ""uncomputability"" of consciousness and second the collapse of the wave function again to explain consciousness.

Speaking of ""collapse"" in the case of Gödel's theorem is a shortcut that conflates the failure of a specific ambition (the program of the mathematician David Hilbert) with the validity of the formal method itself. Gödel did not destroy the formalism. Rather, he revealed its limitations. Penrose bases his argument on the fact that humans can ""understand"" Gödel's theorem, but understanding does not mean that humans are capable of solving or measuring problems that are incomputable or undecidable.

Roger Penrose suggested that mysterious protein structures called ""microtubules"" played a role in human consciousness by exploiting quantum effects, including the dreaded wave function collapse. However, it seems obvious that the brain is too hot to sustain macroscopic quantum states. Just ask anyone working on quantum computers.

As Carl Sagan said, ""An extraordinary claim requires extraordinarily strong evidence.""

EPA's pollution rule change worries experts, cancer survival hits milestone, and astronauts evacuate the ISS

Why the EPA's air pollution rule change could make the air dirtier, how cancer survival hit a record-high, and what we know about the first-ever medical evacuation from the International Space Station

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Andrea Thompson, Sushmita Pathak & Alex Sugiura

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman. You're listening to our weekly science news roundup.

First up, earlier this month the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a new rule signaling a major change to the way it accounts for the impact of certain air pollutants on human health. Many health experts say the shift will likely lead to increased air pollution—and worse health outcomes.

Andrea Thompson, SciAm's senior editor for life sciences, is here to give us a clearer understanding of what the agency is doing and what that means for the air we all breathe.

Hi, Andrea. Thanks for joining us today.

Thompson: Thanks for having me.

Pierre-Louis: So my understanding is that, in general, the EPA uses a type of cost-benefit analysis to understand the impact of an environmental regulation. Can you talk a bit about how, prior to this rule change, the EPA measured these costs and benefits?

Thompson: Yeah, so in general the science for how you sort of calculate how much a regulation will cost, the sort of economic benefit you'll get from it has been pretty well established over several decades.

So for, at least for the benefits part, it starts with health studies that compare areas where, say, a certain pollutant is high and areas where it's low, and look at the differences in hospitalizations and premature deaths and other health indicators, and controlling for other factors that may influence those, and come up with a model that you can use to see, “Okay, if this pollutant goes up or down, how much do those health indicators change?” And then that's married with economic studies that sort of look at what's called the “value of, of a statistical life”—so these aren't a moral judgment of how much a life is worth [Laughs]; it's a statistical one. And that sort of gets married together to figure out, “Okay, here's what the economic benefits will be if we regulate this pollutant.”

And on the cost side that's, you know, what is the cost to industry to implement whatever technological change would be required to, to limit that pollutant? And then you look at the balance.

Pierre-Louis: So how does this change that was finalized earlier this month shift that calculation?

Thompson: So it's a little unclear, as the EPA hasn't been very specific on this point. From the language cited in a New York Times story that came out they're at least not calculating a, you know, a sort of dollar value for the health benefits. And they said that they're not going to calculate that for PM2.5, which are little particles that can penetrate very deeply in the lungs, into the bloodstream; are linked to a bunch of health effects, from asthma to cancers to low-birth-weight babies.

Pierre-Louis: Right, these are the kinds of things that we encounter when we burn gasoline for fuel or during the wildfire smoke events.

Thompson: Right.

Pierre-Louis: So in the old days, let's say, I had a plant, and it was polluting, and it cost me, I don't know, $100 to put a scrubber on my plant so it had less particle pollution, and the government could say, “Well, yeah, it's gonna cost you $100, but it's gonna save $1,000 in human health costs.” But now they're still looking at the $100, but they no longer have that $1,000 to compare it to.

Thompson: Yeah, basically. They said that they're not going to calculate that for PM2.5 and ozone.

Pierre-Louis: And when the news first broke of this change it seemed like many health advocates, their response was, like, “This is likely going to lead to higher levels of these pollutants.” Have you heard something similar?

Thompson: Yeah, so from the experts I've talked to, you know, this would mean that anything that falls under the umbrella of regulations where this is the new policy, you're going to probably have higher levels of air pollutants than you would have otherwise because it's hamstringing this critical tool to figure out, you know, if regulations are going to be worthwhile.

Pierre-Louis: If changing the rules in this way is likely to lead to more air pollution, why do it? Like, who does it benefit?

Thompson: So the, the obvious answer there is the companies that would have to comply with those costs. And this has sort of been the tension behind implementing any kind of environmental regulation: the costs to regulate— if you're the power plant to put a scrubber on, are easier to calculate, whereas the costs to society are diffuse and so much harder to, to calculate. And you're not considering how that pollution is affecting, you know, thousands of people.

Pierre-Louis: I know some people listening at home might be wondering: Is there something their state can do to impose stricter air pollution rules than the EPA can, for example?

Thompson: Right, so states often have particular environmental rules. The problem with something like air pollution is that you could have a polluting plant in, say, Pennsylvania, and those pollutants are going to be blown over into New Jersey and New York. So you—there can be limits to what a state can do. The reason the EPA is there is because this is a problem that doesn't obey these kind of political borders, and you really do need this national regulation.

Pierre-Louis: For more on this go to ScientificAmerican.com to read Andrea's piece.

Turning to some news on cancer, 70 percent of cancer patients now survive at least five years after diagnosis, according to the most recent annual report of the American Cancer Society. The organization says that's a record high.

Rebecca Siegel, the organization's senior scientific director for surveillance research, said in a statement, “This stunning victory is largely the result of decades of cancer research that provided clinicians with the tools to treat the disease more effectively, turning many cancers from a death sentence into a chronic disease.”

The report found that the biggest boosts were among people with high-mortality cancers and advanced diagnoses. The five-year survival rate for myeloma, a kind of blood cancer, jumped from 32 percent in the mid-'90s to 62 percent from 2015 to 2021. Similarly, five-year survival numbers for regional-stage lung cancer, which is typically stage 3, rose from 20 percent to 37 percent over the same time period.

The researchers cited improved screening and cancer treatments, as well as a decline in smoking, for these positive outcomes. But the authors also cautioned that recent shifts in federal policy could undo this progress. The report concluded that “pending federal cuts to health insurance and cancer research will inevitably reduce access to life‐saving drugs and halt progress at a time when incidence is rising for many common cancers.”

Speaking of illnesses, NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, also known as Crew-11, splashed down off the coast of California on Thursday following a medical evacuation. Crew-11 had been expected to stay on the International Space Station through mid-February, but NASA ordered the departure after one of the astronauts developed what the agency's administrator called “a serious medical condition.” Due to medical privacy rules NASA has not revealed which astronaut fell ill or what condition they developed. The agency stressed that it was not an emergency, but the condition was beyond the station's medical capacity.

This is the first time any space agency has ordered a medical evacuation from the International Space Station. Lessons from this evacuation could help prepare for upcoming human spaceflight missions, including Artemis II. That mission, slated for sometime this year, will be the first crewed moon mission since Apollo 17 in 1972.

And now on to some animal news. Researchers have known for a while that same-sex sexual behavior is common in animals. But in a study published last Monday a team of scientists offered more insight into the potential evolutionary underpinnings of this behavior in primates. Imperial College London researchers looked at data on 491 non-human primate species and found same-sex sexual behaviors in 59 of them. The team then looked at connections between those behaviors and 15 environmental, life history and social traits.

The scientists discovered that same-sex sexual interaction was more likely for species with certain characteristics. For example, primates who lived in drier places susceptible to greater food scarcity and predation pressure. Or those with longer lifespans and substantial size differences among the sexes, and groups whose social structures and hierarchies show more complexity.

Vincent Savolainen, senior author of the study, told The Guardian that the results suggest that same-sex sexual behavior seems to, “increase the bonding, decrease tension and aggression, and allow whatever species and their particular environment and society to basically navigate the challenges that they face.”

While the researchers stressed that we cannot extrapolate the sexual behaviors of the primates in the study to humans, fans of the breakout TV show Heated Rivalry may find themselves wondering if those gay hockey players were perhaps engaging in team building.

That's all for today's episode. Tune in on Wednesday, when we'll take a deep dive into the scientific quest to define consciousness.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Inside the mysterious collapse of dark matter halos","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233609.htm","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:56:35 GMT","

For nearly 100 years, dark matter has remained one of the biggest unanswered questions in cosmology. Although it cannot be seen directly, its gravitational influence shapes galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. At the Perimeter Institute, two physicists are investigating how a particular form of dark matter, known as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), may influence the way cosmic structures grow and change over time.

In research published in Physical Review Letters, James Gurian and Simon May introduce a new computational tool designed to study how SIDM affects galaxy formation. Their approach makes it possible to explore types of particle interactions that were previously difficult or impractical to model accurately.

When Dark Matter Interacts With Itself

SIDM is a theoretical form of dark matter whose particles can collide with one another but do not interact with baryonic matter, the familiar matter made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These collisions conserve energy through what physicists call elastic self-interactions. This behavior can strongly influence dark matter halos, the massive concentrations of dark matter that surround galaxies and help guide their evolution.

""Dark matter forms relatively diffuse clumps which are still much denser than the average density of the universe,"" says Gurian, a Perimeter postdoctoral fellow and co-author of the study. ""The Milky Way and other galaxies live in these dark matter halos.""

Heat, Energy Flow, and Core Collapse

The self-interacting nature of SIDM can trigger a process known as gravothermal collapse within dark matter halos. This phenomenon arises from a counterintuitive property of gravity, where systems bound by gravity become hotter as they lose energy rather than cooling down.

""You have this self-interacting dark matter which transports energy, and it tends to transport energy outwards in these halos,"" says Gurian. ""This leads to the inner core getting really hot and dense as energy is transported outwards."" Over time, this process can drive the core of the halo toward a dramatic collapse.

A Missing Link in Dark Matter Modeling

Simulating the structures formed by SIDM has long been a challenge. Existing methods work well only under certain conditions. Some simulations perform best when dark matter is sparse and collisions are rare, while others are effective only when dark matter is extremely dense and interactions are frequent.

""One approach is an N-body simulation approach that works really well when dark matter is not very dense and collisions are infrequent. The other approach is a fluid approach -- and this works when dark matter is very dense and collisions are frequent.""

""But for the in-between, there wasn't a good method,"" Gurian says. ""You need an intermediate range approach to correctly go between the low-density and high-density parts. That was the origin of this project.""

A Faster and More Accessible Simulation Tool

To solve this problem, Gurian and his co-author Simon May, a former Perimeter postdoctoral researcher now serving as an ERC Preparative Fellow at Bielefeld University, developed a new code called KISS-SIDM. The software bridges the gap between existing simulation methods, delivering higher accuracy while requiring far less computing power. It is also publicly available for other researchers.

""Before, if you wanted to check different parameters for self-interacting dark matter, you needed to either use this really simplified fluid model, or go to a cluster, which is computationally expensive. This code is faster, and you can run it on your laptop,"" says Gurian.

Opening the Door to New Dark Matter Physics

Interest in interacting dark matter has grown in recent years, partly due to puzzling features seen in galaxies that may not fit standard models.

""There has been considerable interest recently in interacting dark matter models, due to possible anomalies detected in observations of galaxies that may require new physics in the dark sector,"" says Neal Dalal, a member of the Perimeter Institute research faculty.

""Previously, it was not possible to perform accurate calculations of cosmic structure formation in these sorts of models, but the method developed by James and Simon provides a solution that finally allows us to simulate the evolution of dark matter in models with significant interactions,"" Dalal says. ""Their paper should enable a broad spectrum of studies that previously were intractable.""

Implications for Black Holes and Beyond

The collapse of dark matter cores is especially intriguing because it may leave observable signatures, including possible connections to black hole formation. However, how this process ultimately ends remains an open question.

""The fundamental question is, what's the final endpoint of this collapse? That's what we'd really like to do -- study the phase after you form a black hole.""

By making it possible to explore these extreme conditions in detail, the new code represents an important step toward answering some of the deepest questions about dark matter and the structure of the universe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Cannabis was touted for nerve pain. The evidence falls short","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233547.htm","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:13:44 GMT","

An updated Cochrane review reports that there is still no clear proof that cannabis-based medicines effectively relieve chronic neuropathic pain. Despite growing interest in these treatments, the latest evidence does not show reliable pain reduction compared with placebo.

Chronic neuropathic pain develops when nerves are damaged, often leading to persistent and difficult-to-treat symptoms. Standard medications provide meaningful relief for only a small portion of patients, which has fueled interest in alternative options such as cannabis-based medicines. These products range from herbal cannabis to specific compounds derived from the plant, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and are used in forms such as inhaled products, mouth sprays, tablets, creams, and skin patches.

How the Evidence Was Evaluated

To assess how well these treatments work, researchers analyzed 21 clinical trials involving more than 2,100 adults. In these studies, cannabis-based medicines were compared with placebo treatments over periods lasting from two to 26 weeks.

The products studied fell into three main categories. Some contained mostly THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis. Others were primarily made up of cannabidiol (CBD), a compound that does not cause intoxication. A third group included balanced products with similar amounts of THC and CBD.

Results Show No Meaningful Benefit Over Placebo

Across all three categories, the review found no high-quality evidence that cannabis-based medicines reduced neuropathic pain more effectively than placebo. Although a few participants using products that combined THC and CBD reported slight improvements, these changes were too small to be considered clinically meaningful.

Information on adverse effects was not reported consistently across the trials, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about safety. Overall confidence in the data on side effects ranged from low to very low. Products containing THC were linked to increased reports of dizziness and drowsiness, and there may have been a higher number of participants who stopped treatment because of these side effects.

Researchers Call for Better Studies

""We need larger, well-designed studies with a treatment duration of at least 12 weeks that include people with comorbid physical illnesses and mental health conditions to fully understand the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines,"" said Winfried Häuser, clinician and lead author, from Technische Universität München and Medical Center Pain Medicine and Mental Health Saarbrücken. ""At present, the quality of most of the trials is too poor to draw firm conclusions.""

The authors conclude that the current evidence remains weak and uncertain, highlighting the need for higher-quality research before cannabis-based medicines can be recommended for people living with chronic neuropathic pain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Major review finds no autism or ADHD risk from pregnancy Tylenol","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233553.htm","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:57:09 GMT","

Taking acetaminophen, commonly known by the brand name Tylenol, during pregnancy does not raise the risk of autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or intellectual disability in children. This conclusion comes from the most comprehensive review of the evidence so far, published on January 16 in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health. The study was led by researchers at City St George's, University of London.

The research team carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis drawing on results from 43 previously published studies. Their goal was to determine whether acetaminophen use during pregnancy is safe. The analysis was prompted by renewed public concern following claims made in September 2025 suggesting that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen could interfere with brain development and increase the likelihood of autism.

Those concerns were fueled by earlier studies that found small statistical links between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism diagnoses. However, many of those studies had important limitations. Some relied on incomplete data, while others failed to account for family history or genetic factors. One major gap was the lack of comparisons between siblings, which can help separate the effects of medication from inherited traits and shared environments.

Why Sibling Comparisons Matter

To address these weaknesses, the researchers focused on the highest-quality evidence available. They compared pregnancies in which acetaminophen was used with those in which it was not, paying particular attention to studies that examined siblings born to the same mother. In these sibling comparison studies, one child was exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy while another was not.

This approach allows researchers to better control for shared genetics, household environment, and long-term parental characteristics. These factors are difficult to fully account for in traditional observational studies but can strongly influence child development.

The sibling comparison data were extensive. Researchers analyzed outcomes for 262,852 children assessed for autism, 335,255 evaluated for ADHD, and 406,681 assessed for intellectual disability. Across these large groups, there was no evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy increased the risk of any of these conditions when compared with pregnancies where the medication was not used.

Researchers Explain the Findings

Professor Asma Khalil, Professor of Obstetrics and Maternal Fetal Medicine at City St George's, University of London and Consultant Obstetrician, led the study and addressed why earlier research may have raised alarms.

""Our findings suggest that previously reported links are likely to be explained by genetic predisposition or other maternal factors such as fever or underlying pain, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself.

""The message is clear -- paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided. This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever, and so they should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms.""

Strong Quality Controls and Remaining Limits

Each study included in the analysis was evaluated using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, which assesses multiple aspects of study design to estimate the risk of bias. The lack of any link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability remained consistent even when the researchers limited their analysis to studies rated as low risk of bias (and therefore highest quality). The same reassuring results were seen in studies that followed children for more than five years.

The authors also noted some limitations. There was not enough consistent data to examine whether risks differed by trimester of exposure, the sex of the baby, or how frequently acetaminophen was used. Too few of the existing sibling comparison studies reported those details.

What This Means for Pregnant Patients

Overall, the findings align with guidance from major medical organizations around the world. The researchers hope this thorough review will help ease lingering doubts about using acetaminophen during pregnancy. Avoiding treatment for significant pain or fever can carry known risks for both the mother and the baby, especially when maternal fever goes untreated. This evidence supports the continued use of acetaminophen as a safe option when taken as directed.

""The brain is an exquisite sensor of what's going on in your body,"" says Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Assistant Professor Jeremy Borniger. ""But it requires balance. Neurons need to be active or inactive at the right times. If that rhythm goes out of sync even a little bit, it can change the function of the entire brain.""

That balance relies on carefully timed patterns of activity. When those patterns slip, even slightly, the brain's ability to regulate the body can be disrupted in wide-ranging ways.

Breast Cancer Alters Daily Stress Hormone Cycles

In studies involving mice, Borniger's lab discovered that breast cancer interferes with normal diurnal rhythms, meaning the natural day and night cycle of stress hormone release. In rodents, this hormone is corticosterone. In humans, it is cortisol. Under healthy conditions, these hormone levels rise and fall at predictable times throughout the day.

The researchers found that breast tumors flattened this normal pattern. Instead of fluctuating, corticosterone levels stayed unnaturally even. This loss of rhythm was linked to poorer quality of life and higher mortality in the mice.

Early Disruption of the Brain's Stress System

Disrupted daily rhythms are already known to contribute to stress-related problems such as insomnia and anxiety, which are common among people with cancer. These rhythms are regulated by a feedback network known as the HPA axis. The hypothalamus (H), pituitary gland (P), and adrenal glands (A) work together to keep stress hormones on a healthy schedule.

What surprised Borniger was how early this disruption appeared. In mice, breast cancer altered stress hormone rhythms before tumors could be physically detected. ""Even before the tumors were palpable, we see about a 40 or 50% blunting of this corticosterone rhythm,"" he said. ""We could see that happening within three days of inducing the cancer, which was very interesting.""

Resetting Brain Rhythms Restores Immune Response

Closer examination of the hypothalamus revealed that certain neurons were stuck in a state of constant activity but produced weak signals. When researchers stimulated these neurons to recreate a normal day and night pattern, stress hormone rhythms returned to normal.

This reset had a striking effect. Anti-cancer immune cells began moving into breast tumors, and the tumors shrank substantially. Borniger explains:

""Enforcing this rhythm at the right time of day increased the immune system's ability to kill the cancer -- which is very strange, and we're still trying to figure out exactly how that works. The interesting thing is if we do the same stimulation at the wrong time of day, it no longer has this effect. So, you really need to have this rhythm at the right time to have this anti-cancer effect.""

Improving Physiology to Support Cancer Treatment

The research team is now working to understand how tumors disrupt the body's normal rhythms in the first place. Borniger believes this line of research could eventually strengthen existing cancer treatments.

""What's really cool is that we didn't treat the mice with anti-cancer drugs,"" he says. ""We're focused on making sure the patient is physiologically as healthy as possible. That itself fights the cancer. This might one day help boost the effectiveness of existing treatment strategies and significantly reduce the toxicity of many of these therapies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Silver just solved a major solid-state battery problem","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118064641.htm","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 03:25:14 GMT","

Using a solid electrolyte instead of a liquid one inside a battery could enable rechargeable lithium metal batteries that are safer, store much more energy, and recharge far faster than today's lithium-ion batteries. This idea has attracted scientists and engineers for decades. However, progress has been limited by a critical weakness. Solid electrolytes made from crystalline materials tend to develop microscopic cracks. Over time, these cracks grow during repeated charging and eventually cause the battery to fail.

Researchers at Stanford, building on work they published three years ago that revealed how tiny cracks, dents, and surface defects form and spread, have now identified a potential fix. They found that heat-treating an extremely thin layer of silver on the surface of a solid electrolyte can largely prevent this damage.

As reported in Nature Materials on January 16, the silver-treated surface became five times more resistant to cracking caused by mechanical pressure. The coating also reduced the risk that lithium would push its way into existing surface flaws. This type of intrusion is especially harmful during fast charging, when very small cracks can widen into deeper channels that permanently degrade the battery.

Why Cracks Are So Hard to Eliminate

""The solid electrolytes that we and others are working on is a kind of ceramic that allows the lithium-ions to shuttle back and forth easily, but it's brittle,"" said Wendy Gu, associate professor of mechanical engineering and a senior author of the study. ""On an incredibly small scale, it's not unlike ceramic plates or bowls you have at home that have tiny cracks on their surfaces.""

Gu noted that eliminating every defect during manufacturing is unrealistic. ""A real-world solid-state battery is made of layers of stacked cathode-electrolyte-anode sheets. Manufacturing these without even the tiniest imperfections would be nearly impossible and very expensive,"" she said. ""We decided a protective surface may be more realistic, and just a little bit of silver seems to do a pretty good job.""

Silver-Lithium Switch

Earlier studies by other research teams examined metallic silver coatings applied to the same solid electrolyte material used in the new study. That material is known as ""LLZO"" for its combination of lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen. While those earlier efforts focused on metallic silver, the Stanford team took a different approach by using a dissolved form of silver that has lost an electron (Ag+).

This positively charged silver behaves very differently from solid metallic silver. According to the researchers, the Ag+ ions are directly responsible for strengthening the ceramic and reducing its tendency to crack.

How the Silver Treatment Works

The team applied a silver layer just 3 nanometers thick to the surface of LLZO samples and then heated them to 300 degrees Celsius (572° Fahrenheit). As the samples heated, silver atoms moved into the surface of the electrolyte, replacing smaller lithium atoms within the porous crystal structure. This process extended about 20 to 50 nanometers below the surface.

Importantly, the silver remained in its positively charged ionic form rather than turning into metallic silver. The researchers believe this is critical to preventing cracks. In areas where tiny imperfections already exist, the silver ions also help block lithium from entering and forming damaging internal structures.

""Our study shows that nanoscale silver doping can fundamentally alter how cracks initiate and propagate at the electrolyte surface, producing durable, failure-resistant solid electrolytes for next-generation energy storage technologies,"" said Xin Xu, who led the research as a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford and is now an assistant professor of engineering at Arizona State University.

""This method may be extended to a broad class of ceramics, It demonstrates ultrathin surface coatings can make the electrolyte less brittle and more stable under extreme electrochemical and mechanical conditions, like fast charging and pressure,"" said Xu, who at Stanford worked in the laboratory of Prof. William Chueh, a senior author of the study and director of the Precourt Institute for Energy, which is part of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability.

To measure how much stronger the treated material had become, the researchers used a specialized probe inside a scanning electron microscope to test how much force was needed to fracture the electrolyte surface. The silver-treated material required almost five times more pressure to crack than untreated samples.

What Comes Next for Solid-State Batteries

So far, the experiments focused on small, localized areas rather than full battery cells. It is still unclear whether this silver-based approach can be scaled to larger batteries, integrated with other components, and maintain its performance over thousands of charging cycles.

The team is now working with complete lithium metal solid-state battery cells and exploring how applying mechanical pressure from different angles might extend battery lifespan. They are also studying additional types of solid electrolytes, including sulfur-based materials that could offer better chemical stability when paired with lithium.

The researchers also see potential applications beyond lithium. Sodium-based batteries could benefit from similar strategies and may help reduce supply-chain pressures tied to lithium demand.

Silver may not be the only viable option. The researchers said other metals could work, as long as their ions are larger than the lithium ions they replace in the electrolyte structure. Copper showed some success in early tests, although it was less effective than silver.

The other senior authors of the study with Gu and Chueh is Yue Qi, engineering professor at Brown University. Stanford co-lead authors with Xu are Teng Cui, now an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo; Geoff McConohy, now a research engineer at Orca Sciences; and current PhD student Samuel S. Lee. Brown University alumnus Harsh Jagad, now chief technology officer at Metal Light, Inc., is also a co-lead author of the study.

Researchers at Tokyo Metropolitan University set out to understand how polymer-coated fertilizer (PCF) used on farmland eventually reaches beaches and ocean waters. By examining PCF debris collected from shorelines across Japan, they found that very little fertilizer plastic returns to land through rivers. Only about 0.2% of the PCFs applied in nearby areas were detected on beaches near river mouths. However, the picture changes dramatically when farmland is connected to the ocean by canals. In those cases, as much as 28% of the fertilizer plastic was found washing back onto shore. These results point to beaches as a potentially important but overlooked ""sink"" in the global movement of plastic pollution.

Plastic pollution in the ocean threatens marine life, ecosystems, and human health. Scientists estimate that roughly 90% of the plastic that has entered the ocean is no longer visible at the surface. Much of it is believed to have settled on the seafloor or become trapped in various environmental ""sinks."" To reduce the growing problem of plastic waste, researchers are trying to untangle how plastic travels from where it is used on land to where it ultimately ends up in the ocean.

Fertilizer Coatings as a Major Source of Microplastics

Polymer-coated fertilizer (PCF) has emerged as a significant contributor to microplastic pollution. These fertilizers are wrapped in a thin plastic layer that slows the release of nutrients, allowing them to last longer in the soil. PCFs are commonly used for rice farming in Japan and China and are also applied to crops such as wheat and corn in the U.S., U.K., and Western Europe. Previous studies have shown that 50-90% of the plastic debris found on Japanese beaches originates from these fertilizer coatings. Despite this, scientists have had limited understanding of how PCFs move from farmland into waterways and how that journey influences where the plastic ultimately accumulates.

How Water Pathways Shape Plastic Pollution

The research team, led by Professor Masayuki Kawahigashi and Dr. Dolgormaa Munkhbat, conducted extensive surveys of fertilizer plastic deposits in different coastal settings. They examined 147 survey plots across 17 beaches, focusing on locations near river mouths and areas where agricultural land drains directly into the sea.

Their findings revealed sharp contrasts. Near river mouths, the amount of PCF found on beaches accounted for less than 0.2% of the fertilizer used in surrounding fields. About 77% of the material remained on farmland, while the remaining 22.8% was carried out to sea. In areas with direct drainage from fields to the ocean, however, 28% of the fertilizer plastic ended up back on nearby beaches. The researchers concluded that waves and tidal forces play a key role in pushing these plastics ashore, turning beaches into temporary storage sites for microplastics. Since most PCFs that leave fields enter rivers, the majority of these plastic capsules ultimately go ""missing.""

Why Some Plastics Stop Washing Back

The researchers also observed physical changes in many of the fertilizer microplastics collected from beaches. Many particles showed noticeable reddening and browning. Using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), the team detected added layers of iron and aluminum oxide on the plastic surfaces. These materials may increase the weight of the capsules, making them less likely to be carried back to shore by waves.

Although many questions remain about how plastic pollution moves through the environment, this study provides an important step forward. By mapping how fertilizer plastics travel from land to sea, the researchers have helped shed light on how PCFs contribute to the global problem of missing plastics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This tiny power module could change how the world uses energy","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118233604.htm","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:16:07 GMT","

Global demand for electricity is rising fast. Energy-hungry data centers that support artificial intelligence, along with expanding manufacturing, are putting unprecedented pressure on power systems worldwide. Meeting that demand will require more than simply generating additional electricity.

One promising solution is to use existing energy supplies far more efficiently and at lower cost.

A New Approach to Power Efficiency

Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a new silicon carbide based power module designed to dramatically improve how electricity is converted and delivered. A power module is the housing that contains power electronics, which regulate the flow of electricity between systems. This new design delivers record-breaking efficiency, higher power density, and a manufacturing process that keeps costs low.

The technology is known as NREL's Ultra-Low Inductance Smart power module, or ULIS. By using silicon carbide semiconductors, ULIS can achieve five times the energy density of earlier designs while taking up less space. That combination allows manufacturers to build equipment that is smaller, lighter, and more energy efficient. The 1200-volt, 400-amp module is well suited for data centers, electrical grids, microreactors, and heavy-duty platforms such as next-generation aircraft and military vehicles.

Why Ultra-Low Inductance Matters

A key advantage of ULIS is its exceptionally low parasitic inductance, which refers to resistance that slows changes in electrical current and limits efficient power conversion. ULIS reduces this resistance by seven to nine times compared with today's most advanced silicon carbide power modules.

Because the system can switch electrical current extremely quickly and efficiently, it converts more of the available electricity into usable power. That capability allows ULIS to extract significantly more value from the same energy supply, making it a strong candidate for addressing growing global energy needs.

""We consider ULIS to be a true breakthrough,"" said Faisal Khan, NREL's chief power electronics researcher and the principal investigator for the project. ""It's a future-proofed, ultrafast power module that will make the next generation of power converters more affordable, efficient, and compact.""

Built for Reliability in Extreme Conditions

ULIS is designed not only for efficiency, but also for reliability in demanding environments. According to Khan, the lightweight yet powerful module can monitor its own condition and anticipate component failures before they happen.

This feature is especially critical for high-risk applications such as aviation and military operations. For aircraft operating at 30,000 feet or vehicles navigating combat zones, early failure detection can be the difference between mission success and catastrophic loss.

""ULIS was a truly organic effort, built entirely in-house here at NREL,"" Khan said. ""We are very excited to demonstrate its strengths in real-world settings.""

A Radical Redesign for Lower Cost Manufacturing

Many of ULIS' performance gains come from a completely new physical design.

Traditional power modules stack semiconductor devices inside box-like packages. ULIS instead arranges its circuitry in a flat, octagonal layout. This disk-shaped structure fits more components into a smaller footprint, reducing both size and weight. At the same time, its innovative current routing minimizes magnetic interference, which helps deliver cleaner electrical output and higher overall efficiency.

""Our biggest concern was that the device switches off and on very quickly, and we needed a layout that wouldn't create a chokepoint within the design,"" said Shuofeng Zhao, an NREL power electronics researcher who designed ULIS' flux cancellation architecture.

Early concepts explored complex three-dimensional shapes, including designs resembling flowers or hollow cylinders. However, these ideas proved too expensive or difficult to manufacture. The breakthrough came when the team simplified the concept into a nearly two-dimensional structure. Sarwar Islam, another NREL power electronics researcher, proposed the flattened design that balanced performance, cost, and manufacturability.

""We squished it flat, like a pancake,"" Zhao said, ""and suddenly we had a low-cost, high-performing design that was much easier to fabricate.""

Joshua Major, also part of the NREL power electronics team, developed new fabrication methods that allowed the intricate structure to be produced using only in-house tools and facilities. The result was a design that combined the electrical advantages of three-dimensional systems with the practicality of flat manufacturing.

Flexible Materials and Wireless Control

ULIS also departs from conventional materials. Traditional power modules bond copper directly to rigid ceramic bases to conduct electricity and manage heat. While effective, this approach limits flexibility.

Instead, ULIS bonds copper to a flexible polymer called Temprion. This change produces a thinner, lighter, and more adaptable structure. The material bonds to copper using only heat and pressure, and its components can be machined with widely available equipment. As a result, manufacturing costs fall into the hundreds of dollars rather than the thousands.

Another major advance allows ULIS to operate wirelessly. The module can be controlled and monitored without physical cables, functioning as a self-contained unit. This modular, Lego-like design allows it to be integrated into a wide range of systems, from data center servers to advanced aircraft and military vehicles. A patent for the low-latency wireless communication protocol, led by Sarwar Islam, is currently pending.

Designed for Future Technologies

While ULIS currently relies on advanced silicon carbide semiconductors, the design was intentionally built to evolve. The module can be adapted for future semiconductor materials, including gallium nitride and gallium oxide, which has not yet reached commercial use.

Together, these innovations support a central goal. As societies become increasingly dependent on reliable electricity, ULIS is designed to deliver efficiency without sacrificing dependability.

Where ULIS Could Make the Biggest Difference

ULIS is expected to have broad impact across multiple sectors.

In the U.S. power grid, electricity must be converted into usable forms before it reaches consumers. This process often depends on large, low-frequency equipment that wastes energy. ULIS' fast switching improves efficiency while its ability to tolerate high temperatures may reduce long-term maintenance costs.

In aviation, the module's ability to move electricity quickly and conserve energy enables lighter and more powerful converters. This could help make electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft more practical and commercially viable.

ULIS could also play a role in future fusion energy systems. Although commercial fusion remains under development, these systems will require compact and reliable pulsed power components. ULIS' ultralow inductance and durable design make it well suited for that challenge.

As industries pursue more reliable electricity, advanced artificial intelligence, and next-generation vehicles, ULIS is now available for licensing.

Patient-facing large language models (LLMs) hold potential to streamline inefficient transitions from primary to specialist care. We developed the preassessment (PreA), an LLM chatbot co-designed with local stakeholders, to perform the general medical consultations for history-taking, preliminary diagnoses, and test ordering that would normally be performed by primary care providers and to generate referral reports for specialists. PreA was tested in a randomized controlled trial involving 111 specialists from 24 medical disciplines across two health centers, where 2,069 patients (1,141 women; 928 men) were randomly assigned to use PreA independently (PreA-only), use it with staff support (PreA-human), or not use it (No-PreA) before specialist consultation. The trial met its primary end points with the PreA-only group showing significantly reduced physician consultation duration (28.7% reduction; 3.14 ± 2.25 min) compared to the No-PreA group (4.41 ± 2.77 min; P < 0.001), alongside significant improvements in physician-perceived care coordination (mean scores 113.1% increase; 3.69 ± 0.90 versus 1.73 ± 0.95; P < 0.001) and patient-reported communication ease (mean scores 16.0% increase; 3.99 ± 0.62 versus 3.44 ± 0.97; P < 0.001). Equivalent outcomes between the PreA-only and PreA-human groups confirmed the autonomous operation capability. Co-designed PreA outperformed the same model with additional fine-tuning on local dialogues across clinical decision-making domains. Co-design with local stakeholders, compared to passive local data collecting, represents a more effective strategy for deploying LLMs to strengthen health systems and enhance patient-centered care in resource-limited settings. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR2400094159.

The growing burden of multimorbidity and aging populations has exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare delivery worldwide1,2,3. Health systems face increasing strain from fragmented infrastructure, under-resourced primary care and inefficient triage mechanisms4,5, challenges that are particularly acute in regions where self-referral practices bypass primary care for direct tertiary hospital access6,7,8,9,10. China's health system exemplifies this crisis: according to the 2023 Statistical Bulletin on China's Health Sector Development, hospital visits reached 4.26 billion in 2023 (11.5% annual increase), while only 59.2% of public hospitals offered appointment systems, driving inefficient care-seeking pathways that overwhelm outpatient services. This imposes a dual burden: specialists face patient consultations without referrals11, leading to prolonged diagnostic timelines12,13, compromised emotional support14,15 and elevated professional burnout16; concurrently, patients endure protracted waiting times and fragmented care17,18. Although interim solutions like nurse-led triage exist, they often lack the training for comprehensive patient assessment and chronic disease management19. Addressing these systemic inefficiencies in resource-limited settings requires scalable solutions that can transform strained clinical workflows.

Large language models (LLMs) possess transformative potential to re-engineer hospital workflows and address the systemic inefficiencies amplified by escalating demand. However, current applications remain largely confined to support healthcare professionals in controlled settings, for example, responding to patient portal messages20,21, aiding clinical reasoning in experimental environments22,23 or improving medical directions in online pharmacies24, with limited integration into real-time clinical decision-making. Critically, evidence is lacking for LLM chatbots that directly interact with socioeconomically diverse patient populations while supporting both curative and caring aspects of medicine in high-volume clinical environments25.

Bridging this gap requires overcoming two critical barriers: mitigating the systematic biases that arise when training patient-facing LLMs on local medical dialogues from resource-limited settings26,27, and establishing real-world evidence of their clinical utility within time-pressured hospital workflows28,29,30,31. While localized dialogues have enabled specialized applications, from patient-nurse interactions32 and mental health support33 to telemedicine service34, their direct use in resource-limited clinical environments risks replicating existing care deficits. Consequently, a shift toward simulated dialogues curated from standardized medical corpora is underway, moving beyond a reliance on raw local data23,35. Yet, the relative utility of co-design versus passive data collecting for meeting clinical needs remains unknown. This omission begs a central question: should LLMs reflect local practices or help reform them? The answer is critical for global health equity, as passively collected local dialogues may codify and even scale systemic inequities, from diagnostic shortcuts to sociocultural biases26,27.

To bridge the gap between the potential of LLMs and their practical impact in resource-limited settings, we developed PreA (Pre-Assessment), an LLM chatbot (OpenAI; GPT-4.0 mini) for primary-to-specialist care transitions, using a multistakeholder participatory co-design approach36. We engaged diverse community and clinical stakeholders, including patients, care partners, community health workers, physicians, nurses and hospital administrators, to shape a tool that addresses real-world clinical and accessibility needs. The final PreA chatbot integrated a patient-facing chatbot with low-literacy accessibility features and a clinical interface that generates specialist referrals and supports evidence-based decision-making under time constraints (Extended Data Fig. 1).

The decision to deploy this co-designed version of PreA was empirically grounded, informed by a previous simulated experiment that directly compared the co-design approach with additionally fine-tuning the same model with local dialogues. We then evaluated the co-designed PreA in a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess its effectiveness in facilitating primary-to-specialist care transitions.

The trial was conducted across 24 medical disciplines at two academic tertiary medical centers in western China (The First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University and the Affiliated Hospital of Gansu Medical University). A total of 2,332 patients and their care partners were evaluated for eligibility, with 194 either opting out or being excluded for various reasons (Fig. 1). This left 2,138 patients who were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to use PreA independently (PreA-only, n  = 712), use it with staff support (PreA-human, n = 713) or not use it (No-PreA, n  = 713). Subsequently, 69 patients opted out or were removed for various reasons.

Our final analysis included 2,069 participants (PreA-only, n = 691, PreA-human: n = 689, No-PreA, n = 689). Participants had a mean age of 47.6 ± 14.6 years and included 1,141 women (55.1%) and 928 men (44.9%). Most participants (1,620, 78.3%) were patients themselves, with the remainder being care partners. Demographically, fewer than half (881, 42.6%) were unemployed or retired, and 770 (37.2%) reported a monthly income below 2,000 RMB. Educational attainment among them was distributed as follows: below primary school (313, 15.1%), high school (1,073, 51.9%) and college or higher (683, 33.0%). 1,186 (57.3%) participants consulted a medical specialty, 558 (27.0%) a surgical specialty, 194 (9.4%) a combined medical-surgical specialty and the remainder consulted pediatrics (Extended Data Table 1). These baseline covariates were well balanced across the three trial arms, with no significant differences in distribution (Table 1).

Patients and their care partners in the PreA-only group spent approximately 3.51 ±1.50 min interacting with PreA, with no significant differences from those in the PreA-human group (3.48 ± 1.49 min; P = 0.72). They conducted, on average, no more than ten conversation turns, again with no significant differences between the two groups (PreA-only, 9.10 ± 1.37 versus PreA-human, 9.05 ± 1.26; P = 0.51).

In their live clinical workflows, 111 specialist physicians reviewed PreA-generated and control (with age and sex only) referral reports immediately before patient consultations. These physicians spent an average of 0.25 ± 0.08 min reviewing PreA-generated reports (PreA-only and PreA-human), compared to 0.07 ± 0.06 min on control reports from the No-PreA group.

We blindly assessed the effectiveness of the PreA consultation on outpatient workflows across three trial groups using data from the PreA platform and electronic hospital records. The primary outcome was the duration of the medical consultation between patients and physicians, defined as the time elapsed from when patients started conversing with physicians to the end of the consultation. The PreA-only group had a significantly shorter consultation duration compared to the No-PreA group (PreA-only 3.14 ± 2.25 versus No-PreA 4.41 ± 2.77 min; P < 0.001; Fig. 2a), corresponding to a 28.7% (95% CI 22.7–34.8) relative reduction. No significant difference was observed between PreA-only and PreA-human groups (3.17 ± 2.87 min; P = 0.17).

a, Histograms and box plots show the distribution consultation duration across the PreA-only (n = 691 participants), PreA-human (n = 689 participants), and No-PreA (n = 689 participants) groups. The center of the box plot represents the median, with the boundaries representing the first and third quartiles. The whiskers represent the furthest data points from the edge of the box within 1.5 × IQR. b, Box plots show patient throughput per shift for participating physicians and nonparticipating physicians based on 80 matched physician pairs. The center of the box plot represents the median, with the boundaries representing the first and third quartiles. The whiskers represent the furthest data points from the edge of the box within 1.5 × IQR. c, Radar plots show the patient-centeredness and care coordination metrics across the PreA-only (n = 691 participants), PreA-human (n = 689 participants) and No-PreA (n = 689 participants) groups, with five patient-reported metrics (ease of communication, physician attentiveness, interpersonal regard, patient satisfaction, and future acceptability) and one specialist-rated metric (care coordination). d, Bar charts show physician feedback at the end-of-shift questionnaires (n = 111 specialists). The left panel presents ratings of clinical decision support, workload reduction and facilitation of patient–physician communication. The right panel details the most valued features among physicians who rated its usefulness in decision-making as favorable or very favorable. The features include Interpretation (diagnostic report interpretation), Recording (efficient medical history elicitation and documentation), Across-discipline (simultaneous access to multiple specialties), Suggestion (preliminary diagnostic suggestions) and Communication (enhanced patient–physician communication skills).

The secondary outcome is the number of patients per clinical shift and the exploratory outcome is patients' waiting time. To evaluate the impact of PreA on the physician workload, we employed a matched-pairs analysis, comparing patients of participating physicians with those of nonparticipating physicians, matched on medical specialty, physician work shift timing and professional title. Patients of participating physicians cared for significantly more patients (28.54 ± 9.58) per shift compared to matched nonparticipating physicians (24.76 ± 9.42, P = 0.005; relative increase 15.3% (3.4–27.2); Fig. 2b). Given that participating physicians were exposed to PreA-only or PreA-human patients at a maximum frequency of two-thirds, this increase might represent a conservative estimate; on the other hand, physician could strategically control their workflow, thereby the actual impact of PreA on physician workload could be either more pronounced or less pronounced with universal PreA adoption. Despite caring for more patients, patients of participating physicians experienced similar waiting times compared to those of matched nonparticipating physicians (participating 33.54 ± 38.83 min versus nonparticipating 34.65 ± 36.92 min; P = 0.37).

Outcomes here were self-reported by unmasked participants in the RCT (except for physicians masked between PreA-only and PreA-human arms) and measured using the prespecific survey questionnaire based on five-point Likert scales (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Patients and care partners in the PreA-only group reported significantly improved consultation experiences compared to the No-PreA group across the primary outcome, ease of communication: 3.99 ± 0.62 versus 3.44 ± 0.97; P < 0.001; relative increase 16.0%, 95% CI 13.5–18.5) and the four secondary outcomes: perceived physician attentiveness: 3.87 ± 0.85 versus 3.36 ± 1.04; P < 0.001; relative increase 15.1%, 95% CI 12.1–18.1), interpersonal regard (4.02 ± 0.73 versus 3.43 ± 1.05; P < 0.001; relative increase 17.2%, 95% CI 14.4–20.0), patient satisfaction (3.99 ± 0.69 versus 3.41 ± 0.98; P < 0.001; relative increase 17.0%, 95% CI 14.3–19.6) and future acceptability (3.79 ± 1.06 versus 2.81 ± 1.26; P < 0.001; relative increase 34.7%, 95% CI 30.4–39.1; Fig. 3a). No significant differences were found between the masked PreA-only and PreA-human groups across these dimensions (Extended Data Table 2).

a, Agreement analysis between PreA reports and specialist notes. Cases were categorized by level of concordance: agreement (exact match, near-identical content or inclusion of accepted differentials), disagreement or blank (missing physician notes). PreA-assisted group (n = 576) combines PreA-only (n = 291) and PreA-human (n = 285) cases. b, Quality assessment of PreA reports versus specialist notes. The data represent the distribution of expert-evaluated quality across all available cases, including those with blank physician notes. PreA-assisted group (n = 1,152 samples) combines PreA-only (n = 582) and PreA-human (n = 570) samples.

For the primary outcome of referrals in facilitating specialist care, physicians reported a significantly higher value for PreA referral reports compared to the usual one (Care coordination: PreA-only 3.69 ± 0.90 versus No-PreA 1.73 ± 0.95; P < 0.001; Fig. 3b), corresponding to a 113.1% (95% CI 107.4–118.7) relative increase. No significant difference in perceived value was observed between the masked PreA-only and PreA-human groups (P = 0.45). At the end of each working shift, physicians provided feedback on the secondary outcomes, including the usefulness of PreA in their clinical decision-making (Fig. 3c). A majority reported PreA to be useful or very useful (64.9%, 72 of 111); among them, preliminary diagnostic suggestions (87.5%, 63 of 72) and efficient medical history acquisition (77.8%, 56 of 72) were identified as the most valuable features. Furthermore, 77.5% (86 of 111) believed it enhanced patient–physician communication (favorable or very favorable), while 54.1% (60 of 111) of physicians perceived PreA as a tool for reducing workload.

Prespecified subgroup analyses, stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics, demonstrated consistent reductions in consultation duration. Notably, these reductions were observed across age groups, sex, educational attainment, work status, income levels, medical disciplines (medical medicine, surgery, mix of medical medicine and surgery, pediatrics), study sites (Guilin/Gansu) and participant type (patients/care partners), with PreA-only showing significant reductions compared to No-PreA, and no significant differences compared to PreA-human (Extended Data Figs. 2–5).

However, patient experience outcomes exhibited some variability across subgroups. While the PreA-only group generally reported superior consultation experiences compared to No-PreA, this effect was not uniformly observed. Specifically, high-income participants and those attending pediatric departments did not report significant differences in perceived physician attentiveness between the PreA-only and No-PreA groups (Extended Data Figs. 3c and 4).

Concerns regarding automation bias and anchoring, as in experimental contexts21, suggest clinicians may directly adopt LLM-generated assessments, potentially bypassing their clinical reasoning. To investigate this in our real-world trial, we examined whether physicians' clinical notes from the PreA-assisted groups exhibited distinct characteristics from those in the No-PreA group, as per the prespecified analysis.

Classification analysis yielded near-random discriminability (F1 score 0.57; P = 0.81; ΔF1 < 0.02). This absence of systematic separability in the feature space of clinical notes provides compelling evidence against the direct adoption of LLM-generated content in this real-world clinical context. We further investigated this finding across five clinical domains of history-taking, physical examination, diagnosis, test ordering and treatment plans. Consistent with the overall findings, no significant difference was observed between the PreA-only and No-PreA groups (or PreA-only and PreA-human groups) in the five domains (P = 0.10–0.90; Extended Data Table 3). These findings collectively suggest that PreA-assisted medical consultation did not introduce detectable, systematic alterations in physician decision-making, either overall or within specific clinical domains.

We performed a blind post hoc analysis comparing PreA referral reports to the subsequent physician clinical notes among the PreA-assisted groups. PreA-generated reports exhibited substantial agreement (exact match, near-identical content or inclusion of accepted differentials) with physician notes in 65.8% (95% CI 61.8–69.6) of history-taking, 66.7% (95% CI 62.7–70.4) of diagnoses, and 70.7% (95% CI 66.8–74.2) of test ordering recommendations (Fig. 3a). PreA reports show disagreement in only 2.8% to 5.7% of cases, while the remaining physician notes were absent that precluded direct comparison. Among cases exhibiting agreement or where physician notes were blank, PreA reports were rated significantly higher quality than physician notes in terms of completeness, appropriateness and clinical relevance across history-taking (PreA 4.73 ± 0.50 versus physician notes 2.93 ± 1.49), diagnosis (PreA 4.49 ± 0.82 versus physician notes 2.49 ± 1.25), and test ordering (PreA 4.55 ± 0.63 versus physician notes 3.28 ± 1.57; Fig. 3b). Intergroup analysis (PreA-only versus PreA-human) revealed no statistically significant differences in agreement rates and quality scores across all assessed domains.

The choice of a co-designed chatbot for the RCT was informed by a previous simulated experiment that directly compared this approach against fine-tuning with local dialogues. For this experiment, we compiled a de-identified audio corpus of 515 patient–physician scenarios (199,145 Chinese words) collected across rural clinics and urban community health centers within the same 11 provinces as the co-design process. This dataset comprised general medical consultation interactions in geographically and socioeconomically diverse settings, with 51.7% (266 of 515) from rural areas and 77.9% (401 of 515) from the low-income regions. Mean consultation durations ranged from 1.55 to 3.98 min, and interaction lengths spanned 226.90 to 546.00 Chinese words per scenario (Fig. 4a).

Bar height represents the mean value, dots indicate individual data points, and error bars show 95% CIs. b, Quality score distributions for comparing co-designed PreA (n = 300 samples) with its local data-tuned counterpart (n = 300 samples), the same co-designed base model further fine-tuned on the primary care dialogues, across clinical evaluation domains.

The co-designed model achieved significantly higher-quality rating scores than the data-tuned counterpart (the co-designed model further fine-tuned on the primary care dialogues) group across all domains: history-taking (without data-tuned 4.56 ± 0.65 versus data-tuned 3.86 ± 0.81; P < 0.001; Fig. 4b), diagnosis (without data-tuned 4.67 ± 0.55 versus data-tuned 2.47 ± 1.44; P < 0.001) and testing order (without data-tuned 4.23 ± 1.09 versus data-tuned 2.21 ± 1.12; P < 0.001). Notably, the data-tuned model replicated systemic inefficiencies observed in real-world primary care, including omitting guideline-recommended history elements and demographic elements (for example, patient age and sex), and failing to provide appropriate tests and diagnoses (Supplementary Table 3). Mirroring real-world clinician patterns, the data-tuned model exhibited suboptimal adherence to diagnostic guidelines, failing to provide diagnoses (30.0%, 90 of 300) or suggest testing (39.3%, 118 of 300) when needed. Additionally, the data-tuned model mimicked an unfriendly tone similar to that of human clinicians.

We developed and evaluated PreA, a co-designed LLM-based chatbot that streamlines primary-to-specialist care transitions by preparing patients for consultations and generating preconsultation referrals to specialists. In a pragmatic, multicenter RCT in China, PreA improved both operational efficiency and patient-centered care delivery in high-volume hospital settings compared to usual practice. The findings provide preliminary evidence for the clinical utility of co-designed LLMs within time-constrained clinical workflows, suggesting that co-design with local stakeholders is an effective strategy for deploying LLMs into clinical practice.

The trial demonstrated that PreA enhanced both efficiency and patient-centeredness (a dual benefit rarely achieved in previous LLM deployments)20,21,22. Specialist physicians who received PreA-generated referral reports reduced their average consultation time by 28.7%, indicating that the tool enabled faster synthesis of clinical narratives and supported time-intensive decision-making. Indeed, the majority of specialists endorsed PreA's utility for rapid clinical synthesis, particularly valuing its preliminary diagnostic suggestions and medical history acquisition, which aligns with a recent qualitative investigation on physician views37. This efficiency gain, which could expand patient access or improve care quality, is particularly transformative in overloaded health systems where consultation lengths rank among the shortest worldwide38. Notably, this efficiency gain did not compromise (instead enhanced) both the cure-oriented and care-oriented medicine39,40, with physicians reporting improved care coordination and patients perceiving a more patient-centered experience. These efficiency cascades help to address core health system constraints identified in our co-design process, suggesting PreA's potential applicability in other health systems facing similar inefficiencies.

The operational autonomy demonstrated by PreA, as evidenced by the equivalent performance of the PreA-only and PreA-human groups, carries important implications for scalability and cost-effectiveness for resource-constrained health systems41. Our matched-pair analysis revealed increased patient throughput per clinical shift even under partial PreA adoption, suggesting multiplicative system-level benefits when LLMs streamline preconsultation workflows. In resource-limited settings, such efficiency gains may substantially improve healthcare access, enhancing care equity. Additionally, the higher-quality scores of PreA reports position them as patient-specific templates that could alleviate the burden of clinical documentation. Future large-scale studies are needed to validate these potential benefits across diverse health systems.

Our pre-trial ablation studies highlight an essential pathway toward equitable clinical AI: passively training LLMs on simply curated local dialogues risks perpetuating systemic care deficits, whereas participatory co-design could mitigate these risks and better align models with high-quality care objectives. The data-tuned model replication of suboptimal practices mirrors broader concerns that AI models trained on structurally biased clinical data exacerbate inequities in marginalized populations42,43. The co-designed PreA model, refined through input from local stakeholders, including patients, care partners, community health workers, primary care physicians and specialist physicians, outperformed the data-tuned model across all clinical domains. These findings underscore the architectural prioritization of local stakeholder agency through co-design over the passive assimilation of potentially biased natural dialogue data, advancing methodological approaches for equitable AI deployment in healthcare.

Our study, alongside a concurrent trial demonstrating the efficacy of a co-designed chatbot for primary care in low-resource communities36, establishes participatory co-design as a versatile methodology for developing context-specific healthcare chatbots. While both RCTs employed similar co-design approaches, they target distinct clinical needs: while the primary care chatbot prioritized AI health literacy and accessibility for community home use, PreA was optimized for structured referral generation and time-efficient operation within high-volume specialist workflows. The resulting technical architectures and clinical applications consequently diverged, reflecting their distinct co-design processes and stakeholder priorities. These complementary findings demonstrate how co-design principles can be adapted to develop tailored LLM solutions for diverse healthcare contexts, serving various patient populations and clinical objectives.

In contrast to previous research that has often framed LLMs as physician-interaction diagnostic entities22,27,44,45,46, our findings show that a co-design approach, involving the iterative alignment of LLMs with the prioritized needs of local stakeholders, represents the necessary next step, moving beyond technical promise to clinically integrated, equity-focused AI tools28. The streamlined integration of PreA's outputs with specialist cognitive workflows resulted in significant reductions in consultation time and enhanced patient experience across demographic and socioeconomic strata. Critically, these findings challenge the prevailing narrative that medical AI tools inherently depersonalize medicine47, instead positing that co-designed LLM deployments could empower clinicians to prioritize patient-centered care when freed from cognitive burdens. Furthermore, while previous LLM models may have achieved success within narrow, siloed domains22, PreA's demonstrated cross-disciplinary effectiveness, spanning both surgical and medical specialties, underscores its potential to unify currently fragmented care pathways across medical disciplines28.

Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting our findings. The generalizability of our time-reduction findings may be context-dependent, as our study was conducted in high-volume, resource-limited hospital settings. The effectiveness of PreA is intrinsically tied to this environment of high clinical demand and standardized workflows, and validation in diverse healthcare systems is warranted. Furthermore, the single-blinded, pragmatic trial design, while reflecting real-world conditions where patients would naturally know their preconsultation experience, introduces potential performance bias as patients were aware of their group assignment; however, several factors mitigate this concern: the concordance of findings across objective and subjective outcome assessments, the absence of significant differences in clinical documentation across trial arms and the alignment of control group consultation times with established practice patterns.

Although co-design demonstrated advantages over local data fine-tuning for mitigating biases in LLM development, this approach remains constrained by data quality limitations in health resource-limited settings. Future comparative studies should evaluate co-design versus emerging high-quality primary care dialogue datasets to better understand their relative strengths and applications.

The systemic documentation gaps48, evidenced by missing physician notes, represent both a limitation and an important finding. While our analytical methods account for this missingness, future implementations could leverage PreA reports as documentation aids to address this widespread challenge in high-volume settings. Moreover, while PreA demonstrated potential as a primary-to-specialist care transition aid, its transition into home-based use would represent an optimal future direction that requires addressing systemic barriers, including AI health literacy, connectivity limitations and cross-institutional data sharing, as indicated by other work on co-designing LLMs for primary care settings36.

This study provides preliminary evidence for integrating patient-facing LLMs into hospital workflows. While larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up are needed to establish sustained benefits, cost-effectiveness and generalizability, our findings mark a significant step forward. The demonstrated improvements in workflow efficiency and patient–physician experience indicate that co-designed chatbots can reallocate clinician effort from routine data processing toward more nuanced and meaningful patient interactions. This work underscores co-design with local stakeholders as an effective strategy for deploying LLMs to strengthen health systems and enhance patient-centered care in resource-limited settings.

The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College and the local medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University approved the study. The institutional review boards of the Affiliated Hospital of Gansu Medical College approved the study protocol based on their review and the approval from the medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University. The trial followed the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference of Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. We obtained informed consent from all participants in this study. All participants were informed that this was an exploratory experiment, and the results should not be interpreted as direct guidance for clinical interventions at this stage. This study implemented stringent data protection measures, ensuring that all data were anonymized and encrypted to protect privacy. This trial is registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (identifier ChiCTR2400094159).

PreA's architecture, derived from the co-design with local stakeholders, integrates a patient-facing chatbot and a clinician interface (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The patient interface collects medical history via voice or text, while the clinical interface generates structured referral reports. Within the consultation workflow, patients or their designated caregivers interacted with PreA first; it then generated a referral (Supplementary Table 4) for specialists to review before their standard consultation.

Co-design workshops revealed that standard clinical documentation for common conditions often lacks the granularity for personalized care and omits critical patient-specific details like pre-existing comorbidities. As such, PreA referral reports were intentionally designed to bridge this gap by synthesizing comprehensive, patient-specific information to facilitate rapid documentation and diagnostic decision-making. The architecture was also engineered to support both multidisciplinary consultation (prioritized by primary care physicians) and evidence-based diagnostic reasoning (emphasized by specialist physicians).

PreA's consultation logic underwent a two-cycle co-refinement process to achieve broader utility across diverse socioeconomic patient populations and adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for equitable AI deployment (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The first cycle involved adversarial testing with 120 patients and caregivers, 36 community health workers, 15 physicians and 38 nurses from urban and rural areas across 11 provinces (Beijing, Chongqing, Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang). This participatory refinement enhanced real-world contextualization and mitigated potential disparities in health literacy and workflow integration49. The second cycle employed a virtual patient simulation, specifically modeling low-health-literacy interactions to further optimize the model against co-designed evaluation metrics. Subsequent sections provide further methodological details.

The patient-facing chatbot employs a two-stage clinical reasoning model: inquiry and conclusion. During the inquiry stage, the model was trained to conduct active, multiturn dialogues to gather comprehensive health-related information, adhering to standard guidelines on general medical consultation. In the conclusion stage, the model generated 1–3 differential relevant diagnostic possibilities, each with supporting and refuting evidence to enhance diagnostic transparency and mitigate cognitive anchoring risks50,51.

PreA was configured to generate a referral report for primary-to-care transitions. The report included patient demographics, medical history, chief complaints, symptoms, family history, suggested investigations, preliminary diagnoses, treatment recommendations and a brief summary aligned with clinical reasoning documentation assessment tools (Supplementary Table 4).

To ensure accessibility, the platform supports shared access for patients and their caregivers52. An LLM-driven agent performs real-time intention analysis to facilitate empathetic communication and simplify language for low-literacy users, with outputs formatted as JSON for streamlined processing.

To improve clinical utility under time constraints, the model was optimized to balance comprehensive data gathering with clinical time constraints, targeting 8–10 conversational turns based on local stakeholder feedback. Primary care physician input drove the incorporation of high-yield inquiry strategies, which in pilot testing reduced consultation times by approximately half (within 4 min).

In the adversarial stakeholder testing cycle, we employed prompt augmentation and agent techniques to refine the model, aligning the chatbot with WHO guidelines for ethical AI in primary care while preserving clinical validity53. An evaluation panel consisting of community and clinical stakeholders and one AI-ethics-trained graduate student, conducted iterative feedback cycles, focusing on mitigating harmful, biased or noncompliant outputs via adversarial testing.

In the simulation-based refinement cycle, we used bidirectional exchanges between PreA and a synthetic patient agent to enhance consultation quality. We synthesized 600 virtual patient profiles using LLMs grounded in real-world cases; 50% (n = 300) required interdisciplinary consultation to reflect complex care needs. Five board-certified clinicians validated all profiles for medical plausibility and completeness (achieving 5 of 5 consensus).

The patient agent was built on a knowledge graph architecture54, formalizing patient attributes (demographics, medical history and disease states) as interconnected nodes. The agent was further instructed to emulate common consultation challenges identified by community stakeholders in the first cycle. Interactions concluded automatically upon patient acknowledgment or after ten unresolved inquiry cycles. We randomly chose 300 profiles for refinement and reserved the remainder for comparative simulation studies.

The co-design process identified five consultation quality domains for refinement: efficiency (meeting the patient's demanding time lengths), needs identification (accurate recognition of patient concerns), clarity (concise and clear inquiries and responses), comprehensiveness (thoroughness of information) and friendliness (a respectful and empathetic tone).

PreA's performance was rated across these metrics by a panel of five experts (two primary care physicians, two specialists (one in internal medicine and the other in surgical medicine) and one AI-ethics-trained graduate student). Separately, two primary care physicians assessed referral reports for completeness, appropriateness and clinical relevance using a co-designed, five-point Likert scale (Supplementary Table 5). Scores below 3 triggered further iterative refinement.

We collected audio recordings of primary care consultations from rural clinics and urban community health centers across the 11 Chinese provinces. Provinces were categorized as low-income and high-income based on whether per capita disposable income was below or above the national average (National Bureau of Statistics of China). Local co-design team members who live in these areas manually calibrated the transcripts to ensure validity, as the raw data contained noisy, ambiguous language, interruptions, ungrammatical utterances, nonclinical discourse and implicit references to physical examinations. All conversational data collected was rigorously de-identified in compliance with relevant regulatory standards (HIPAA) before data analysis.

We conducted a comparative simulation study to evaluate the incremental utility of integrating these localized dialogues. Two model variants were compared: the co-designed PreA model and a local data-tuned counterpart, created by fine-tuning the PreA model (OpenAI; ChatGPT-4.0 mini) on the processed primary care dialogues. Notably, the data fine-tuning, applied directly to the base LLM, inherently exerted a higher behavioral priority than the agent techniques and prompting strategies co-designed to instruct the model. Consequently, when behavioral cues conflicted, the model would preferentially adhere to patterns learned from the fine-tuning data.

The virtual patient experiment utilized 300 unused patient profiles to evaluate clinical decision impacts (history-taking, diagnosis and test ordering). Referral reports from both variants were blindly evaluated by the same expert panels as in the PreA development, using validated five-point Likert scales for completeness, appropriateness, and clinical relevance (Supplementary Table 5). Inter-rater reliability for these assessments was high (κ > 0.80), and group comparisons were conducted using the two-tailed nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-tests.

In this pragmatic, multicenter RCT, patients were randomized to use PreA independently (PreA-only), with staff support (PreA-human) or not use it (No-PreA) before specialist consultation. The PreA-human arm was included to assess PreA's autonomous capacity. The primary comparison was between the PreA-only and No-PreA arms, with a secondary comparison between PreA-only and PreA-human arms. The trial's primary end points were to evaluate the effectiveness of the PreA in enhancing operational efficiency and patient-centered care delivery in high-volume hospital settings, as measured by consultation duration, care coordination, and ease of communication. The PreA chatbot used in the RCT was frozen before patient enrolment. Examples of patient interaction with PreA are provided in Supplementary Tables 6–8.

Participants must demonstrate a need for health consultation or express a willingness to engage in PreA health consultations. Other inclusion criteria were (1) aged between 20 years and 80 years; (2) visit the participating physicians at the study medical centers; (3) eligible for communicative interaction via mobile phone; (4) eligible to complete the post-consultation questionnaires; and (5) have signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) the presence of psychological disorders; (2) any other medical events that are determined ineligible for LLM-based conversation; and (3) refusal to sign informed consent. No co-design stakeholders participated in the RCT.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: (1) the PreA-only group, independently interacting with the PreA via mobile phone before their physician consultation; (2) the PreA-human group, interacting with the PreA under the guidance of a medical assistant; and (3) the control group, receiving standard physician-only care (No-PreA). In the PreA-human group, participants were informed that PreA's interface was similar to WeChat, which has been used by hospitals for patient portal registries and hospital visit payments, and were offered technical support. Participants in the PreA-only arm used the tool independently without assistance.

For both PreA-assisted arms, a PreA-generated referral report was provided to specialist physicians for review via the patient's mobile phone before any face-to-face interaction. This design was implemented to prevent direct copying of content into clinical notes. Physicians were requested to rate the report's value for facilitating care. In the No-PreA control arm, physicians reviewed routine reports containing only patient sex and age.

Following consultations, patient and care partner experiences were captured via a post-consultation questionnaire (Supplementary Table 1). Physicians provided feedback at the end of their shifts (Supplementary Table 2).

The primary outcomes were consultation duration, physician-rated care coordination, and patient-rated ease of communication. These metrics were selected based on co-design feedback, which identified time efficiency and care coordination as critical for adoption in high-workload settings, and are established proxies for clinical effectiveness and patient-centered care38.

Secondary outcomes included physician workload (measured as patients seen per shift and compared between participating and matched nonparticipating physicians); patient-reported experiences of physician attentiveness, satisfaction, interpersonal regard and future acceptability; physician-reported assessments of PreA's utility, ease of communication, and workload relief; and clinical decision-making patterns, derived from a quantitative analysis of clinical notes.

Consultation duration, patient volume and clinical notes were extracted from the PreA platform and hospital electronic records. Physician-perceived care coordination was measured via a five-point Likert scale rating the helpfulness of the PreA report in facilitating care. Patient-reported and other physician-reported outcomes were collected using prespecified, five-point Likert scale questionnaires (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These instruments demonstrated robust internal consistency (Cronbach's α > 0.80 for all domains) and face validity, established through iterative feedback from 20 laypersons and five clinicians to ensure relevance to outpatient contexts. Clinical notes were extracted from all three trial arms and included five core clinical reasoning domains: history-taking (chief complaint, history of present illness and past medical history), physical examination, diagnosis, test ordering and treatment plans.

The sample size was calculated for the primary comparison between the PreA-only and No-PreA arms. The target minimum sample size of 2,010 participants (670 per study arm) was prespecified based on a power analysis using preliminary data from the pilot study of 90 patients. This minimum target sample size ensured sufficient power (>80%) for the primary outcome at a significance level of 0.05.

The clinical research team approached adult patients from waiting rooms who were scheduled to see the participating physicians. For pediatric patients or adults without a mobile device, their caregivers were contacted. Interested individuals received a comprehensive study description, which emphasized the exploratory nature of the research and clarified that any advice rendered by PreA serves solely as a reference and should not be utilized as a definitive basis for disease therapy. After providing informed consent and having their questions addressed, eligible individuals who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were formally enrolled. Recruitment was conducted from 8 Feb to 30 April 2025.

Participants were allocated to one of the three groups using an individual-level, computer-generated randomization sequence without stratification. Allocation was concealed to prevent selection bias. This trial was single-blinded: while the patients knew their group assignments (PreA-only, PreA-human, or No-PreA), the physicians were uninformed about the PreA-intervention groups (PreA-only or PreA-human). Furthermore, research staff involved in data analysis remained blinded to group assignments throughout the study.

We assessed baseline covariate balance across the three groups using an ANOVA for continuous variables and a chi-squared test for categorical variables. For intergroup comparisons, we evaluated the distribution of scale values; two-sample Student's t-tests with unequal variances were used for approximately normal data, while a nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test was applied to skewed distributions. All tests were two-tailed with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. The relative treatment effect for the primary comparison (PreA-only versus No-PreA) was calculated as the difference in means divided by the mean of the No-PreA group. Secondary analyses evaluated the consistency of findings across demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. Python v.3.7 and R v.4.3.0 were used to perform the statistical analyses and present the results.

We conducted a matched-pairs analysis to assess the impact of PreA on physician workload. Matching criteria included medical specialty, working shift, age group (≤45 years and >45 years), sex, and professional title (chief, associate chief and attending). The outcome is the number of patients seen per clinical shift. A second matched-pairs analysis was conducted to assess the effect on patient waiting times. For this analysis, we matched participating physicians to a distinct control group on the same covariates (replacing working shift with working week to accommodate the matching on patient volume) and the number of patients seen per shift. For both analyses, statistical significance between participating physicians and their matched controls was assessed using two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to account for matched data.

We performed a prespecified classification analysis to detect systematic differences between clinical notes from PreA-assisted arms (PreA-only and PreA-human groups) and the No-PreA arm. A randomly selected subset of notes (PreA-only, n = 291; PreA-human, n = 285; No-PreA, n = 300) was retrieved in compliance with hospital data privacy rules. Notes were partitioned into training and test sets (2:1 ratio). A binary classifier was trained to distinguish PreA-assisted from No-PreA notes, with classification performance evaluated using the F1 score, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall F1 Score=TP/(2TP + FP + FN), where TP, FP and FN denote true positives, false positives and false negatives, respectively. Under the null hypothesis of no intergroup differences, classifier performance would be random. A statistically significant F1 score exceeding this baseline (ΔF1 > 0.02) would indicate distinguishable clinical decision-making patterns attributable to PreA-assisted notes.

The classifier was trained in two stages. First, a Med-BERT encoder generated contextualized embeddings of the clinical notes55. Second, a binary classification layer was trained on these embeddings using supervised SimCSE56, a contrastive learning approach that minimized embedding distance within the PreA-assisted group while maximizing the distance to the No-PreA group. Statistical significance was assessed with one-sided bootstrap tests (1,000 samples).

A prespecified domain-specific analysis further compared clinical decision-making across five domains. For unstructured text (history-taking and physical examination), Med-BERT embeddings were generated and projected into a two-dimensional latent space (UMAP1 and UMAP2) via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for comparative distribution analysis. For structured non-normal count data (number of diagnoses, number of tests ordered and number of treatments), documented counts were compared between groups using nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-tests.

A post hoc analysis evaluated the concordance and quality of PreA-generated referral reports versus physician-authored clinical notes. Agreement was defined as substantial alignment (exact match, near-identical content or inclusion of accepted differential diagnoses). The same expert panel from the comparative simulation studies (two board-certified primary care physicians and two senior residents) performed blinded ratings of report and note quality on a five-point Likert scale for completeness, appropriateness and clinical relevance (Supplementary Table 3). They assessed three domains relevant to primary care referrals: history-taking, diagnosis and test ordering; physical examination and treatment plans were excluded. Each case was evaluated by two experts. The analysis used the same subset of patient cases as the classification analysis. Inter-rater reliability was high (κ > 0.80). Group comparisons were performed using a nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test.

C-heteroaryl glycosides, predominantly in unprotected forms, are common entities in bioactive molecules and have extensive applications in chemistry and biology. However, the chemical synthesis of these glycosides remains challenging owing to the lack of methods that directly leverage naturally occurring (native) sugars as substrates. Here we show that fully unprotected native sugars, capped as redox-active glycosyl sulfide donors, can be merged with N-heteroarenes in the presence of triethylamine and a photocatalyst under mild visible-light irradiation. The C–C coupling transformation proceeds with control over chemo-, site- and stereoselectivities and is compatible with a diverse range of N-heteroarenes bearing acidic and basic functional groups. The utility of this method is highlighted by the glycosylation of nucleosides, as well as by the direct coupling of d-mannose with pentoxifylline to generate a compound exhibiting glycogen-metabolism-inhibitory properties. In contrast to previously established mechanisms, the photocatalytic species is found to trigger the in situ generation of a thiyl radical that promotes hydrogen atom transfer to afford the target product, with triethylamine serving as a reductant through photoinduced charge-transfer complexation with the glycosyl sulfide.

Floquet engineering, in which an intense optical field modifies the electronic structure of a material, offers a route to the control of quantum and topological properties. However, it is challenging to realize this in experiments due to relatively weak light–matter coupling and the dominance of detrimental effects, such as multi-photon absorption and sample heating. Here we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to show that in a monolayer semiconductor, Floquet effects caused by an excitonic field—the time-periodic oscillations of the self-energy of an electron bound to a hole—are two orders of magnitude stronger and persist longer than optically driven counterparts. Our measurements directly capture the hybridization between the exciton-dressed conduction band and the valence band in two-dimensional semiconductors, in agreement with first-principles calculations. The onset of this hybridization with increasing exciton density also correlates with the Bose–Einstein condensation to Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer crossover, extensively discussed in theory for non-equilibrium excitonic insulators. These results establish exciton-driven Floquet engineering as a means for studying correlated electronic phases.

We measured the absorption and the photoemission excitation (PEE) spectra at 100 K from the 1 L WS2 sample. The PEE spectrum was obtained by integrating the photoemission signal from the electron part of the excitons at zero pump-probe time delay. The black arrow indicates the energy of the pump pulse used to access optically driven Floquet physics. The red arrow indicates the pump energy used for the exciton driven Floquet process. We measure the linewidth of our sample to be 8 meV by fitting a gaussian function (solid blue line) to the absorption spectra at 100 K.

a) A 3D dataset showing the 6 K points of the 1 L WS2 sample obtained from ToF MM. The red hexagon marks the first BZ with the red dashed line showing the cut along the Γ-K-M used to obtain the band structures in Fig. 1d,e. b) The E-K cuts like the cuts shown in Fig. 1d,e. The dotted line shows EDCs obtained around the K point for (c). The inset shows the schematic diagram for the cuts. c) The valence band EDC at the K point with the calculated Shirley background, d) Valence band EDC after subtraction is fitted to a double gaussian function to get the peak position for both VB1 and VB2 to calculate the exciton-driven hybridization effect.

a-d) Dispersion of the valence band replica with decreasing exciton densities obtained by single gaussian fitting. e) Dispersion of VB1 and VB2 for no pump case for comparison (f-i) Dispersion of VB1 and VB2 with decreasing exciton densities obtained by fitting a double gaussian function to the Shirley-corrected EDCs.

Energy distribution curves (EDCs) for the exciton replica at selected k positions around the K point (0,0) for a) low exciton density and b) high exciton density. The red solid lines are single gaussian fitting to the EDCs. The center position of the gaussian fitting is marked by the grey triangles. c) Comparison between the dispersion of the exciton replica at low (grey circles) and high (orange circles) with the ground state valence band (dashed line). The valence band dispersion was shifted up in energy by 2.1 eV for comparison. For the low exciton density, we clearly observe a parabolic negative dispersion mimicking the valence band. For the high exciton density case, the replica dispersion shows the distinct Mexican-hat-like dispersion.

a) Difference in the dispersion for VB1 for different exciton densities with respect to the no pump VB1 dispersion showing drastic changes near the K point, b) Difference in the dispersion for VB2 with respect to the no pump VB2 dispersion showing no substantial change in general.

a) Unperturbed bandstructure at the K valley. b) Bandstructure after above bandgap (ℏν = 3 eV) excitation.

The rapid growth of Internet of Things applications has substantially increased the number of connected sensors and data volume, yet conventional digital conversion and transmission systems impose high energy and latency costs. Here we develop a neuromorphic sensing system integrating a flexible piezoelectric haptic sensor array, event-triggered preprocessing circuitry and a memristive system on a chip. The circuitry transforms transient voltage spikes from sensor pixels into decaying voltage waveforms, generating a time surface for event-based analogue in-memory computing within the chip. Our system achieves 87%–92% recognition accuracy for patterns written on the sensor array and reduces the energy-delay product during inference compared with conventional digital platforms. These results highlight the potential of the memristive system on a chip for energy-efficient, low-latency edge processing of analogue sensor data, advancing intelligent sensing technologies.

In my fourth year as a postdoctoral researcher, in 2005, I published ten papers. This was an enormous output for one year. At that rate, I reflected, I could publish 100 papers in a decade. Nevertheless, a century still seemed a remote and unattainable score, something that only the most distinguished professors were likely to achieve before they retired.

Fast forward two decades, and ten papers per year now looks pedestrian when you consider the growing number of hyper-prolific authors who publish more than 60 papers annually1 — one or more papers a week.

I have always felt the pressure to publish more. In 2005, my head of department often exalted a professor who published around 40 papers a year; those of us working in public health were all encouraged to do the same. The target was numbers, and quality was mentioned only in terms of a journal's prestige, never the work itself.

I've decided to push back on the pressure to publish by making a rule for myself: I will no longer publish more than seven papers per year. I've published a median of 15 papers a year for the past five years, so that means I will have to halve my output. 

Seven is my own threshold, and will have no relevance to most other researchers, especially those in other fields or at different career stages. The purpose of setting a number is only to aid the goal of prioritizing quality over quantity.

I am not going to spend less time on research, or contribute to 15 papers per year and then select the best 7, so this change will double the amount of time I spend on each paper. I'll use that time to craft better papers, doing more background reading, more consultation with stakeholders and more model testing, and giving more consideration to what the results mean for public health in practice.

I am making this change because I think the current publication system is a runaway train that is headed for disaster. Publication numbers are ballooning, with more than 1.7 million indexed articles appearing on the PubMed database for 2024, compared with around 1.2 million for 2014. This inflation was recently described as “unsustainable” by Cambridge University Press, UK, which called for “radical change”. The boom in numbers is putting the publication system under enormous strain2, and it is now impossible for scientists to thoroughly read and peer review the literature. Without adequate scrutiny, the overall quality of research seems to be degrading, with a recent explosion in the number of low-quality papers passing peer review3.

As a professor with a permanent contract, it's much easier for me to make radical changes than it is for early-career researchers, who are competing to win jobs and funding. Too many career decisions are based on CV length rather than quality, which maintains the pressure on researchers to publish as many papers as possible. Some researchers have reacted to this pressure by using shortcuts to boost their CVs, including using large language models (LLMs) to write low-quality papers and buying ready-made papers from paper mills.

I'm not the first to suggest that less is more in publishing. In Nature in 2017, there was a call for a lifetime word limit for all scientists, and there is a growing ‘slow science' movement. Alas, speed is still more prized than rigour, because those who publish first get more kudos than do those who publish carefully.

The Great Global Transformation: National Market Liberalism in a Multipolar World Branko Milanovic Allen Lane (2025)

In the past decade or so, the realignment of global markets by politicians has transformed patterns of trade and inequality around the world. Economist Branko Milanovic maps out those changes, and what they might herald, in his latest book.

Beyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now

Beyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now

The Great Global Transformation builds on Milanovic's previous work to describe how inequality between countries has declined globally over the past 25 years. Collating data from the World Bank and other sources in innovative ways, he argues that globalization in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century was accompanied by then-unprecedented growth of income in both previously poor populations (notably in China) and people at the top of the world's income distribution (especially those in the West). By contrast, relative shares of world income stagnated or were thought to have declined for wealthy nations' middle and working classes, including in the United States.

This trend captures effectively what has become part of public discourse in the West: globalization has left behind people in the middle and working classes in rich nations, demonstrating that it is “an illusion to believe that what is good for the world must be good for everybody”.

Milanovic's graph revealing this pattern has become highly influential. Plotted in terms of the change in people's real earnings as a function of where those sit in the global income distribution, it is called an elephant curve because of its shape (a broad hill forms the elephant's back, and a sharp fall and subsequent increase form the trunk). But what the graph actually shows is hotly debated. Several critics argue that the curve suggests but does not prove a causal connection between globalization and the decline in people's wealth in some classes in wealthy nations, and that other elements might be driving the patterns.

The book goes on to note that globalization, in the form of increased engagement with markets and trade, did not lead to geopolitical convergence — contrary to expectations in the 1980s and 1990s. Observers at the time hoped that market expansion would lead authoritarian regimes towards democracy and the global governance mechanisms supported by the West.

But in key countries such as China and Russia, authoritarian regimes have proved resilient and have adapted to globalization. Today, the world remains multipolar, with no single superpower dominating globally. As Milanovic notes: “it is not mutual trade interdependence and its stimulation of sweet virtues of accommodation of other people's wishes that makes the world peaceful but the harsh reality of military balance of power”.

At the same time, opportunities for upward social mobility in wealthy nations have been transformed by an increasing overlap of people who are rich in terms of receiving income both from capital (through investments and assets) and from labour (salaries). In the United States and China, “the top class is now more elitist and its position more impregnable because it has … ‘diversified'”. This constitutes “a new moment in the evolution of capitalism”.

The rise of these new elites, according to Milanovic, ultimately explains the direction of the political shifts seen over the past few years in much of the world. In the United States, this shift has taken the form of the populist movement, led by President Donald Trump, that has identified free trade, China and migration as threats to the country. (Milanovic suggests an alternative path, which the United States hasn't followed: increased taxation to redistribute the gains of world trade from elites to the middle class.)

Meanwhile, in China, Milanovic describes President Xi Jinping's policies as a “purposeful change” from those of his predecessors, in “an attempt to reassert the power of the state over the capitalist sector and the rich”. And, in Russia, too, President Vladimir Putin has reasserted control of the state and security apparatus.

Hence, the emergence of what Milanovic calls national market liberalism. In short, all three regimes “should be seen as part of the same ‘counter-revolution' against global neoliberalism and the excesses of elite enrichment during the 1980–2006 era”, he concludes.

Although there are national differences, these countries have in common several of the elements that were previously encapsulated by neoliberalism and globalization. They are also committed to disciplining wealthy people and regulating free trade through various degrees of state control.

The Great Math War: How Three Brilliant Minds Fought for the Foundations of Mathematics Jason Socrates Bardi Basic (2025)

In the weeks leading up to September 1891, mathematician Georg Cantor prepared an ambush. For years he had sparred — philosophically, mathematically and emotionally — with his formidable rival Leopold Kronecker, one of Germany's most influential mathematicians. Kronecker thought that mathematics should deal only with whole numbers and proofs built from them and therefore rejected Cantor's study of infinity. “God made the integers,” Kronecker once said. “All else is the work of man.”

But Cantor had a proof that he hoped would confound his competitor. Armed with an innovative method, now known as Cantor's diagonal argument, he could demonstrate that some infinities are larger than others and he planned to confront Kronecker with it in public at the inaugural meeting of the German Mathematical Society in Halle. But the showdown never came. Weeks before the meeting, Kronecker's wife was fatally injured in a climbing accident, preventing him from going to Halle, and Kronecker himself died that December.

This tragedy — at once poignant, anticlimactic and painfully human — is one of many vivid digressions in journalist Jason Socrates Bardi's The Great Math War. Bardi provides a lively narrative of the intellectual struggle that transformed the field in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. He uses drama to demonstrate how the long arc of modern maths — from the invention of rigorous analysis to the birth of set theory, logic and topology — was neither neat nor inevitable. The intellectual revolution reshaped ideas about the scope of maths, what counts as a valid proof and whether mathematical truth is discovered or invented. And it was driven as much by temperaments, loyalties, neuroses and sheer chance as by fresh theories.

The Fields Medal should return to its roots

The stakes of this ‘maths war' were immense. Was maths grounded in intuition — the mental constructions that people can build step by step — or in formal symbols and rules that are independent of human insight? Were numbers objective features of reality or useful inventions of the human mind? And could the infinite be incorporated safely into maths, or would it lead to contradiction and collapse? Bardi deftly follows these questions as they ripple across Europe, shaping rival schools, polarizing university departments and fuelling philosophical, professional and, often, personal battles.

The book's central argument — that maths is a human endeavour, shaped by human frailty as much as by formal proof — is made convincingly throughout. Bardi captures the period's ferment with energy and empathy, paying close attention to the psychological states of its protagonists: Cantor's oscillations between visionary triumph and crippling despair; L. E. J. Brouwer's fervent mission to tear down maths and make it all anew; and Bertrand Russell's tortured attempts to reconcile logic, certainty and his own emotional life, confided in anguished letters to his aristocrat lover, Lady Ottoline Morrell.

The feud between Brouwer and David Hilbert in the 1920s was notorious. Hilbert championed formalism: the idea that maths should be reduced to axioms and rules, with meaning set aside in favour of consistency. Brouwer, by contrast, insisted that only proofs that the mind could follow were legitimate. In 1928, Hilbert, who was a chief editor of the leading journal Mathematische Annalen, tried to remove Brouwer from its editorial board. Brouwer refused to resign and was ousted — through dissolution of the entire board. Hilbert then rebuilt it with appointees of his choosing. Albert Einstein, a fellow Annalen chief editor, dismissed the whole affair as an overblown ‘frog and mouse war'.

For many readers who have encountered maths only as a technical tool, the heightened passions behind such debates might be hard to fathom. Yet, when Cantor was being denounced by his contemporaries, including Kronecker, as a charlatan and accused of corrupting the youth with his controversial ideas about infinity, the future of maths truly seemed at stake.

A Black mathematical history

Bardi is at his best when excavating the overlooked corners of history: the petty jealousies of editorial boards, the philosophical fights waged through open letters, the strain on marriages and the toll on mental health. He writes with breathless enthusiasm, occasionally slipping into staccato bursts — “Bereft. Pent-up” — that evoke his characters' emotional turmoil. He brings comic energy to his narrative, for instance, by introducing ancient Greek mathematician Euclid as the “reigning heavyweight champion of math authors” until 1900.

Bardi excels in recounting Russell's life and ideas. An imperialist turned peace activist and advocate of free love, Russell discovered a troubling paradox in maths, similar in its logical form to several others, including the ‘liar paradox': if the sentence ‘this statement is a lie', for instance, is true, then it means the statement is a lie — and therefore not true — leading to a logical inconsistency.

My friend Lilah is the crunchiest person I know.

She refuses to kill bugs and rats. She once made me try her homemade wine (disastrous). A few years ago, she quit her food-justice nonprofit job to live in a yurt, and after that she went to grad school and moved into an attic, where her roommates were squirrels. Against her will, she did own an iPhone for a time. She had no choice: A university administrator explicitly told her she couldn't perform her studently duties without one. Two-factor authentication and all that.

But Lilah's Lilah, so upon graduation, she gifted herself a dumbphone. And boy was that phone dumb. Designed for those weaning themselves off the real thing, it connected to Wi-Fi but not to the internet, and it certainly didn't accommodate apps. Lilah now navigates the world smartphoneless. “I think my main reason for getting rid of it was that I felt like my brain was being consumed,” she recently told me.

Most of my fellow twentysomethings want to go dumb like Lilah. I'm familiar with and sympathetic to the urge: I waste hours a day, and lose hours of sleep, to the tyranny of the scroll. I'm trapped in a shame spiral for spending so much of my precious life watching videos of complete strangers until my eyes sting and my head aches. And, ideologically, I like the sound of withholding personal data from corporations, of not succumbing to ads every time I unlock my home screen.

But I haven't gone dumb, and the reason is simple: I'm terrified! Ditching my smartphone would be completely disorienting. It would significantly reduce my overall competence. It's deeply embarassing—it really makes me feel like a giant baby—but I am certain that my smartphone is a part of me. I mean that literally: The panic I feel when I lose sight of it is visceral, existential, as if pieces of my physical body are missing.

This thought is neither insane nor original. Back in 1998, Andy Clark and David Chalmers introduced their “extended mind hypothesis,” the idea that external tools can extend, in an all but physical way, the biological brain. Checking the Notes app for your grocery list? Using Google Maps to get to a friend's house? That's not just your phone at work, and it's also not just your biological brain—it's a single cognitive system composed of both. Since the age of 14, when I got my first iPhone, my mind has welcomed Apple's increasingly powerful operating systems and, over the years, fused with them. My phone and I are now totally, completely enmeshed.

But is un-enmeshment a worthwhile pursuit? And is it, as dumbphone users seem to believe, even possible?

In 1985, the late psychologist Daniel Wegner published a theory about intimate human relationships called transactive memory. He argued that long-term couples store information in one another and that their collective pool functions as something of a joint memory card, a single “knowledge-acquiring, knowledge-holding, and knowledge-using system that is greater than the sum of its individual member systems.” This is uncannily—maybe humiliatingly—applicable to my relationship with my iPhone.

At the end of my senior year of high school, I went to the Apple store to replace my worn-out device with a new and improved one. In classic irresponsible-teenage fashion, I hadn't backed up my data from recent months, so my photos from that school year disappeared. My memories of that period, it turned out, disappeared along with them—a road trip across the South, a friend's dramatic breakup. I knew, intellectually, that these things had happened. But I had no real feeling for them, no specific images to trigger my recollection.

When one's close partner leaves, Wegner and his coauthors write, “there will be entire realms of one's experience that merely slip away, unrecognized in their departure, and never to be retrieved again.” I've placed blind trust in my smartphone to hold and shape and reinforce my narrative of my past. I've unwittingly given myself permission to forget about the family trips and social milestones it has not preserved for me.

Clark and Chalmers, in their paper, reach a similar conclusion: “If we remove the external component,” they write, “the system's behavioral competence will drop, just as it would if we removed part of its brain.” So it was just as I'd feared: I was most likely beyond help. My brain had spent its formative years, and continues to spend its adult life, making room for the functions of my phone. The enmeshment is in its late stages. At this point, it's hard to understand how I could possibly benefit from going dumb.

Many of us find our reliance on smartphones—external devices that we can leave at a bar or accidentally drop in the toilet—worrisome. But Clark was quick to remind me, when we spoke this past summer, that our brains can break too. “You could have a mild stroke or something,” he said. That bleak reality led me to the (perhaps even bleaker) thought that my smartphone may actually be more reliable than my biological brain. I feel a sense of certainty that my brain will one day decline, that it may actually be in the process of doing so as I write this, but it feels unlikely that I'll one day have to navigate life without a pocket-sized, internet-connected vessel. The quality of the smartphone is moving in the exact opposite direction as my brain—over my lifetime, the capacity of these devices will only grow.

The continued existence and availability of the smartphone, or of the devices that will one day replace them, is also more certain than that of a partner. Our partners leave the house every day to go to work; our partners might even leave us for good; and our partners will, without a doubt, die. My iPhone might shatter into a million pieces, but the software that makes my iPhone uniquely mine lives (in theory) forever. Clark assured me that my feeling of enmeshment is not just normal—it's by design. Tech companies “have a vision of technologies as potentially mind-extended,” he said. “No doubt about that.”

As much as I've fantasized about going dumb, I've also fixated on its downsides, in part as an intellectual exercise, but mostly to justify my continued incessant smartphone use. For one, my relationships might suffer. Plans with friends are often made on the fly—would I be left out of those? Conversations frequently begin with a reference to something I'm expected to have encountered on social media, read in a group chat, flinched at in a New York Times alert. How would I keep up? I use an app to activate the laundry machines in my building's basement—I'd have to start trekking to the laundromat!

It would also, more troublingly, reveal the true capacity of my naked brain. If we truly share a memory system with close, long-term companions, as Wegner argues, and if external tools are just as much a part of the human mind as is the brain, as Clark and Chalmers believe, then the transition from lifelong smartphone user to sudden dumbphone user would result in a profound blow to my mind's operating system. If I get a dumbphone, I'll have to face the rudimentary version of myself. And although the true capabilities of my bare-bones brain are a mystery to me, I do know that the change would be a downgrade—Wegner's description of a breakup between close-knit cohabitating partners sounds similar to how one might describe dementia.

In their original paper, the tool Clark and Chalmers used to illustrate the extended mind was a notebook—they could not have foreseen the omnipresence or multifunctionality of the smartphone. The smartphone has usurped and consolidated power, and its sudden loss could have dire consequences. My next question to Clark was just that: Just how dire? Could it, in a way, be considered a cognitively disabling condition?

Well, yes, he said: “I think that as we move into a future in which the societal norm is very much a kind of mild cyborg of some kind, then to not be that would be to be effectively disabled within that society, or differently abled within the society.” “Interference with my phone,” he added, is “like giving me some brain damage.”

This might help explain why the people who opt into this cognitive state are in a very small minority: In the US, 98 percent of Americans between 18 and 29 own a smartphone. The number only drops a single percent for Americans ages 30 to 49. When enmeshment becomes the norm, where does that leave the un-enmeshed? Most of us are buying into minds that incorporate the smartphone, normalizing this coupled system. Much like someone with a cognitive impairment, dumbphone users are left disoriented by their outsider status. “It's a real worry, the creation of a disempowered class,” Clark said. “Every time there's a potential for something roughly like human enhancement, it has this flip side to it, which is, what happens to people that either don't get it or reject it?”

Many smartphone owners hate—or at least claim to hate—their phones. The internet is full of desperate cries for help from people who “can't STAND” them, call the devices “invasive,” complain that “everything is dependent on apps.”

But my friend Lilah's post-iPhone era hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. When I texted her asking what about the dumbphone inconveniences her the most, she replied: “Im gonna text u on my computer when i get home bc long messages r one of them lol.” This particular difficulty—she later wrote to me in the familiar comfort of her Macbook's iMessage app—often dissuades her from responding to messages altogether, which, she says, has made long-distance friendships nearly impossible to maintain. When she absolutely needs to reply to someone—say, her boss—she's forced to “sit on the phone for nine minutes to text out my grammatically correct message.” She only sometimes receives group messages. And spontaneity is a bit tricky: “I'm not leaving work thinking, ‘Oh, I should go here,'” she told me during a phone call, “because I can't. I actually don't know how to get there, and it's almost impossible for me to do that.”

And, if I'm being honest, Lilah's life isn't even genuinely “post-iPhone.” “I feel like I'm not full feet in,” she admitted, disappointedly. When we recently took a flight together, she flashed the digital boarding pass in her Apple Wallet to the TSA agent and was forced to reveal that she had brought an “emergency iPhone” with her on the trip. Turns out she still needs to own one—her teaching job requires her to use an app to clock in each day.

I'm still jealous of Lilah, though. Assuming her emergency iPhone is only whipped out for true emergencies, she doesn't end her days having lost hours to Instagram or having accidentally spent a walk in the park browsing the internet. And the switch has come with some unexpected perks: “I'm paying attention to how the interstates connect,” she said, “which is actually kind of interesting and led me down some research into city development.” But Lilah was never as enmeshed as I believe myself to be. “I don't think I've ever had the sense of safety or comfort,” she says of her relationship to her smartphone prior to going dumb.

Clark, to my surprise, expressed some opposition to the movement. “I think our self-expectations as a species have changed to take account of the technology, and that's just as it should be,” he said. “I'm a little bit concerned about the move towards dumbphones, because I think it is generally a retrograde step.”

I take some comfort in that. For those of us so far gone, whose extended minds exist largely inside of devices that have distilled thousands of tools into one, the solution doesn't feel clear-cut. I've spent my life integrating the iOS interface into my cognitive system—its impact is there to stay, whether I like it or not. My biological brain has grown like tree roots between the spaces in a pavement pattern. Simply removing the pavement would leave gaping holes in the root system. Any relief I'd feel would come with a cost, the satisfaction strictly ideological.

The term “phone addiction” has wiggled its way into the common vernacular and has become a near-universal self-diagnosis among my cohort. But that doesn't feel quite right to me. I'm not addicted to my phone. I am my phone. Lilah said it best: It's consumed my brain. “Phone enmeshment” feels more accurate. If I ditch the device, part of me will vanish with it. I'll face the unextended version of myself. I'm not sure I care to meet her.

The Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA Array) at Georgia State University has generated detailed images of the early stages of two nova explosions that were detected in 2021. Through near-infrared interferometry, a process that combines light from multiple telescopes, the CHARA Array was able to capture in high resolution the rapidly changing conditions of their early post-explosion phase.

A nova is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs in a binary system when a white dwarf strips its companion star of hydrogen-rich gas, causing a thermonuclear runaway reaction on the white dwarf's surface. The name derives from the sudden brightening that makes it appear as though a new star has appeared in the night sky. However, the ejecta immediately following the explosion are small and a challenge to observe, and until now astronomers could only infer the early stages through indirect methods.

“The images give us a close-up view of how material is ejected away from the star during the explosion,"" explains Gail Schaefer, CHARA Array director. “Catching these transient events requires flexibility to adapt our night-time schedule as new targets of opportunity are discovered.”

Schaeffer and her team observed V1674 Herculis, a nova in the Hercules constellation, and V1405 Cassiopeiae, a nova in Cassiopeia. V1674 was one of the fastest novas ever recorded, reaching its peak brightness less than 16 hours after its discovery and rapidly fading in just a few days. By contrast, V1405 took 53 days to reach its peak brightness and remained bright for about 200 days.

Images taken 2.2 days (left) and 3.2 days (center) after the explosion caused by the nova V1674 Herculis. As indicated by the arrows, two ejecta flows have formed. On the right is an illustration of the explosion image.

The image of V1674, captured just a few days after its discovery, shows an explosion that is clearly not spherical; there are two ejecta flows, one to the northwest and the other to the southeast with an elliptical structure radiating almost perpendicular to them. This is direct evidence that the explosion involved multiple ejecta interacting with each other.

Spectroscopic observations also detected different velocity components in the Balmer series of hydrogen atoms. While the absorption line before the peak was about 3,800 km/s, the component that appeared after the peak reached about 5,500 km/s.

The timing is significant. The new ejecta flow appeared in the image concurrent with the detection of high-energy gamma rays by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The collision of the different velocity streams formed a powerful, gamma-ray emitting shock wave.

The results of V1405 were even more startling. The first two observations during the peak period showed only a bright central light source and few surrounding ejections. The diameter of the central region was approximately 0.99 milliarcseconds, which when converted to distance corresponds to a radius of approximately 0.85 au (au stands for the astronomical unit, the distance between Earth and the sun).

If the accumulated outer layer of hydrogen-rich gas had been ejected at the start of the explosion, it would have expanded over 53 days and had a radius of 23-46 au. This huge discrepancy means that most of the outer layer was not fully ejected after more than 50 days. In other words, V1405's outer layer is thought to have been in the common envelope phase that enveloped the entire binary system until the visible light peak.

During the third observation, the structure had changed dramatically. The central light source accounted for only about half of the total radiation, while the remainder was emitted from the expanded region. At this time, a broad emission component of approximately 2,100 km/s appeared. Subsequently, the release of material generated new shock waves, and high-energy emissions were observed.

This discovery demonstrates that novae are far more complex than a single explosion. Observations over the past 15 years by the Fermi telescope have detected gamma rays in the gigaelectronvolt range from more than 20 novae. Novae can now be regarded as laboratories for studying shock waves and particle acceleration.

The observations of V1405 suggest the possibility that the orbital motion of its binary system acts as a force pushing out the outer layers that have expanded due to the explosion. In slowly evolving novae, the state in which the expanded outer layers envelop the entire binary system continues for several weeks. Such phenomena provide valuable opportunities to directly observe what happens when two stars approach each other so closely, a process believed to occur in more than 10 percent of stars in the universe. However, detailed mechanisms remain unexplained.

Novae, once regarded as simple explosions, are proving to be far richer and more fascinating than when initially observed. Through the new window of direct imaging by near-infrared interferometry, the true nature of some of the universe's most dramatic phenomena is just beginning to be revealed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Search for Alien Artifacts Is Coming Into Focus","https://www.wired.com/story/the-search-for-alien-artifacts-is-coming-into-focus/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

There's no denying the allure of alien artifacts. Science fiction is awash in the material remnants of extraterrestrial civilizations, which surface in everything from the classic books of Arthur C. Clarke to game franchises like Mass Effect and Outer Wilds.

The discovery of the first interstellar objects in the solar system within the past decade has sparked speculation that they could be alien artifacts or spaceships, though the scientific consensus remains that all three of these visitors have natural explanations.

That said, scientists have been anticipating the possibility of encountering alien artifacts since the dawn of the space age.

“In the history of technosignatures, the possibility that there could be artifacts in the solar system has been around for a long time,” says Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester.

“We've been thinking about this for decades. We've been waiting for this to happen,” he continues. “But being responsible scientists means holding to the highest standards of evidence and also not crying wolf.”

That raises some tantalizing questions: What is the best way to search for alien artifacts? And what should we do if we actually identify one? Given that these technosignatures could run the gamut from tiny alloy flecks to hulking spaceships—or perhaps, some material that is unimaginable to Earthlings—it is difficult to know what to expect.

To meet this challenge, researchers are currently working on an array of techniques to search for signs of alien remnants across our solar system—including in orbit around Earth.

For example, Beatriz Villarroel, an assistant professor of astronomy at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, has focused on a largely untapped observational resource: historical images of the sky taken before the human space age.

By studying archival photographic observations captured by telescopes prior to the launch of Sputnik in 1957, Villarroel has produced a portrait of the sky before it was speckled with our satellites. As the lead of the Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations project (VASCO), she had initially been looking for any evidence that stars, or other natural objects, might vanish on these archival plates.

Instead Villarroel found inexplicable “transients” that look like artificial satellites in orbit around Earth, long before the launch of Sputnik, which she and her colleagues reported in 2021.

“That's when I realized this is actually a fantastic archive, not for searching for vanishing stars, but for looking for artifacts,” she says.

Last year, Villarroel and her colleagues published three more studies about the search for near-Earth alien artifacts in The Publications of the Astronomy Society of the Pacific, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, and Scientific Reports that have generated spirited debate among scientists. Researchers have suggested a range of alternate explanations for the transients, which could involve instrumental errors, meteors, or debris from nuclear tests.

The mystery could potentially be resolved with a dedicated mission to search for artifacts in geosynchronous orbit, an environment about 22,000 miles above Earth. However, Villarroel doubts that such a mission would be green-lit by any federal space agency in the near term, due to the controversial nature of the topic.

“There's so much taboo that nobody's ever going to take such results seriously until you bring down such a probe,” she adds.

Frank says he agrees that the stigmatization of the search for otherworldly artifacts—and the search for alien life, more broadly—is counterproductive. But he sees the pushback over research into alien artifacts as a healthy and natural part of scientific inquiry.

“This is how science actually works,” he says. “You publish a paper in a reputable journal, and now we can have the scientific back and forth.”

To that end, we can expect plenty more of this back-and-forth in the coming years. The discovery of the first interstellar object, 1I/‘Oumuamua, in 2017—followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019 and 3I/ATLAS in 2025—has now brought ground truth to the long-standing dream of studying real, tangible material from other solar systems.

Beyond searching for artifacts close to Earth, scientists are also exploring new ways to search for artificial probes or other material detritus made by aliens that might pass through the solar system.

As Frank notes, the search for physical technosignatures has been the topic of scientific inquiry for more than half a century. In 1960, the physicist Ronald N. Bracewell speculated in Nature that aliens might send autonomous robotic scouts across vast interstellar expanses, which came to be known as Bracewell probes.

In a seminal 1985 paper in Acta Astronautica, researchers Robert A. Freitas Jr. and Francisco Valdes dubbed this effort “the search for extraterrestrial artifacts (SETA),” a subset of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), and laid out several reasons why an intelligent species might prefer to make contact via a probe rather than, for instance, an interstellar radio signal.

“An intelligent artifact orbiting a garrulous inhabited world may engage in a true conversation with the indigenous civilization, an almost instantaneous, complex interaction between cultures,” the team said. “Contact via probes provides a potentially richer, deeper interaction than via interstellar radio links.”

The dawn of this new era of interstellar objects has inspired a range of anticipatory research about the best practices for identifying technosignature candidates. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, founded the Galileo Project to search for these artifacts in part due to his interpretations of ‘Oumuamua and ATLAS as possible technosignatures—a stance that has put him at odds with the majority of scientists in this field, who broadly consider all known interstellar objects to be natural in origin.

Researchers in the field are also developing criteria for identifying technosignatures and testing these methods on newly discovered interstellar objects. For example, Sofia Shiekh, a technosignature researcher at the SETI Institute, has published a guide for assessing possible artifacts, and led an effort to search for signs of artificial radio activity on 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar comet discovered in 2025, which did not find evidence of technosignatures.

In another study published last year, scientists led by James Davenport, an astronomer at the University of Washington, synthesized decades of SETA research into a comprehensive strategy to screen interstellar objects for hints that they might be alien artifacts..

In addition to the trio of interstellar objects discovered so far, we can expect many more farflung entities to come into the sights of next-generation telescopes in the coming years, especially the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which began operating from its Chilean desert perch in 2025.

Scientists are eager to spot hints of alien technologies in these observations, such as shiny reflective materials, unusual motions and trajectories, or even active communication signals.

“Since these things are coming from other solar systems, we also expect there's going to be some anomalies and there's going to be some ways it's going to look different from what we've seen,” says Frank, who is a co-author on the study led by Davenport. “You've got to set limits on that and say, this is what we mean when it's more than anomalous or weird—I would say the technical term is, that's freaky.”

Of course, that raises the thorniest question of all: What do we do if we find something really freaky? Is it safe or wise to approach or intercept an artifact from an alien civilization?

Villarroel notes that an active probe might not cooperate with an attempt to study it or retrieve it. Even in the case of alien space trash or other inert artifacts, it would be important to establish some degree of risk mitigation in any attempt to rendezvous with an object.

Even so, if scientists were presented with the opportunity to take a closer look at an alien artifact, they would be hard-pressed to resist, Frank says. “Unless it immediately starts showing activity—like it sends us a message, or it starts dropping drones that are heading at us—if it's passing through the solar system, and it looks like an artifact, of course, we're going to send probes,” he predicts.

Michael Bohlander, chair in global law and SETI policy at Durham University, suggests that, in addition to anticipating possible safety or contamination risks, people need to be prepared for the potential social, cultural, and geopolitical dimensions of discovering an alien artifact or spacecraft.

“Depending on how close things get—from an artifact somewhere out in space to a spaceship found on Earth or maybe in orbit—lots of people would be excited about it, but scared at the same time,” he says. “Mass panics and hysterical reactions could be expected on a large scale. So there are multiple dimensions to the whole thing, and not just a technological one.”

Despite the roiling tensions and fragile alliances that alien arrivals often inspire in science fiction, Frank anticipates that this momentous discovery, if it ever occurs, will unite global scientists rather than dividing them.

“The worldwide scientific community would be totally collaborative on this, and we would be thrilled,” Frank concludes. “This would be the greatest thing that had ever happened in the history of humanity for scientists, if we had this kind of evidence.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Race to Build the DeepSeek of Europe Is On","https://www.wired.com/story/europe-race-us-deepseek-sovereign-ai/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:00:00 GMT","

As the relationship between the US and its European allies shows signs of strain, AI labs across the continent are searching for inventive ways to close the gap with American rivals that have so far dominated the field.

With rare exceptions, US-based firms outstrip European competitors across the AI production line—from processor design and manufacturing, to datacenter capacity, to model and application development. Likewise, the US has captured a massive proportion of the money pouring into AI, reflected in the performance last year of its homegrown stocks and the growth of its econonmy.

The belief in some quarters is that the US-based leaders—Nvidia, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, and the like—are already so entrenched as to make it impossible for European nations to break their dependency on American AI, mirroring the pattern in cloud services. In early January, the head of Belgium's national cybersecurity organization told the Financial Times that Europe had “lost the internet,” and should make peace with a degree of reliance on US infrastructure.

Yet the governments of the UK and EU do not appear ready to give up. Already, they have committed hundreds of millions of dollars to minimizing their reliance on foreign AI suppliers. Meanwhile, buoyed by the success of China-based AI lab DeepSeek, whose breakout last year shattered the dogma that control over the largest fleet of AI processors determines which firm wins out, Europe-based researchers are pursuing alternative methods for developing competitive products built around imaginative model design.

“We have been too gullible to the narrative that innovation is done in the US—that we lost the AI train and should not even think about it,” claims Rosaria Taddeo, a professor of digital ethics and defence technologies at the University of Oxford. “That's a dangerous narrative.”

One possible advantage that European AI labs hold over the large American firms—closed shops that share very little about their training data or the intricacies of their model design—is a willingness to develop out in the open. By publishing models for anyone to use or modify, the theory goes, breakthroughs achieved by European labs will compound as they're further refined by collaborators. “You are multiplying the power of these models,” claims Wolfgang Nejdl, professor of computer science at Germany's Leibniz Universität Hannover and director of the L3S Research Center, part of a consortium developing a large language model for Europe.

In the face of the White House's lukewarm stance toward European leadership—and a nakedly hostile attitude among some allies of US President Donald Trump—those efforts to innovate and become self-sufficient have taken on a new urgency.

“The geopolitical situation has changed the way we should interpret sovereignty…This technology is an infrastructure—and an infrastructure we do not produce,” claims Taddeo. “We have to start moving in that direction. It's not possible to ignore it anymore.”

In recent months, European leaders have found themselves at loggerheads with the Trump administration over a tangle of issues ranging from the sovereignty of Greenland, to tariff policy, to immigration, leading to speculation about a deterioration in the NATO alliance that has set the global order for more than 75 years. The two sides have clashed particularly openly over the approach to policing American tech firms—especially X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk.

After the European Commission fined X the equivalent of $140 million over alleged regulatory violations in early December, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the penalty as “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments.” Later, after a UK regulator opened an investigation into X over a torrent of AI-generated sexualized images of women distributed on the platform, a precursor to a possible countrywide ban, US State Department official Sarah Rogers threatened retaliation.

Against that backdrop, Europe's reliance on American-made AI begins to look more and more like a liability. In a worst case scenario, though experts consider the possibility remote, the US could choose to withhold access to AI services and crucial digital infrastructure. More plausibly, the Trump administration could use Europe's dependence as leverage as the two sides continue to iron out a trade deal. “That dependency is a liability in any negotiation—and we are going to be negotiating increasingly with the US,” says Taddeo.

The European Commission, White House, and UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not respond to requests for comment.

To hedge against those risks, European nations have attempted to bring the production of AI onshore, through funding programs, targeted deregulation, and partnerships with academic institutions. Some efforts have focused on building competitive large language models for native European languages, like Apertus and GPT-NL.

For as long as ChatGPT or Claude continues to outperform Europe-made chatbots, though, America's lead in AI will only grow. “These domains are very often winner-takes-all. When you have a very good platform, everybody goes there,” says Nejdl. “Not being able to produce state-of-the-art technology in this field means you will not catch up. You will always just feed the bigger players with your input, so they will get even better and you will be more behind.”

It is unclear precisely how far the UK or EU intends to take the push for “digital sovereignty,” lobbyists claim. Does sovereignty require total self-sufficiency across the sprawling AI supply chain, or only an improved capability in a narrow set of disciplines? Does it demand the exclusion of US-based providers, or only the availability of domestic alternatives? “It's quite vague,” says Boniface de Champris, senior policy manager at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a membership organization for technology companies. “It seems to be more of a narrative at this stage.”

Neither is there broad agreement as to which policy levers to pull to create the conditions for Europe to become self-sufficient. Some European suppliers advocate for a strategy whereby European businesses would be required, or at least incentivized, to buy from homegrown AI firms—similar to China's reported approach to its domestic processor market. Unlike grants and subsidies, such an approach would help to seed demand, argues Ying Cao, CTO at Magics Technologies, a Belgium-based outfit developing AI-specific processors for use in space. “That's more important than simply access to capital,” says Cao. “The most important thing is that you can sell your products.” But those who advocate for open markets and deregulation claim that trying to cut out US-based AI companies risks putting domestic businesses at a disadvantage to global peers, left to choose whichever AI products suit them best. “From our perspective, sovereignty means having choice,” says de Champris.

But for all the disagreement over policy minutiae, there is a broad belief that bridging the performance gap to the American leaders remains eminently possible for even budget- and resource-constrained labs, as DeepSeek illustrated. “If I would already think we will not catch up, I would not [try],” says Nejdl. SOOFI, the open source model development project in which Nejdl is involved, intends to put out a competitive general purpose language model with roughly 100 billion parameters within the next year.

“Progress in this field will not to the larger part depend anymore on the biggest GPU clusters,” claims Nejdl. “We will be the European DeepSeek.”

It can be tricky to figure out how to clean your Keurig, but it's important work. If your household is like mine, your pod coffee maker runs anywhere from three to seven times per day. All of that use can cause buildup and gunk, which can affect the taste of your coffee and the lifespan of your machine. But with proper maintenance and a dedicated routine, cleaning is a breeze. Here's everything you need to know about light daily cleaning as well as deeper cleans.

Be sure to check out our related buying guides, including the Best Pod Coffee Makers, the Best Coffee Machines, the Best Coffee Subscriptions, and the Best Milk Frothers.

To clean the housing of your Keurig coffee maker or other pod machine, just take a damp cloth and wipe down the outside. You can clean the K-Cup holder and needle by brushing or vacuuming away any loose debris like coffee grounds—be careful near the needle part since, obviously, it's sharp.

Some machines come with a needle cleaning tool that you insert into the top and bottom of the needle, and a few people on various forums have used a paper clip instead. Some machines have removable pod holders that can be soaked in hot water. It's always a good idea to refer to your specific model's user guide, and you'll probably want to unplug your machine beforehand.

To clean your drip tray and water reservoir, remove them and wash them by hand with hot, soapy water (though avoid using too much dish soap to prevent buildup). If your machine came with a carafe, wash it by hand or pop it in the dishwasher if it's dishwasher-safe. Let them air dry or wipe them down with a lint-free towel after rinsing them off. You should be replacing the fresh water in your reservoir often, especially if it's been sitting for a while. If your machine has a water filter in its reservoir, replace it every two to three months. Most machines with these types of filters have maintenance reminders—heed them!

For cleaning out the internal bits and pieces, you can use something like a Keurig Rinse Pod, which helps to flush out any excess oils or flavors that might be lingering. They are especially handy after brewing with flavored K-Cups like hot cocoa or some coffee varieties. You can also just run a hot water cycle every so often, which is a particularly good idea if you haven't used your machine for a few days.

Keep your compatible Keurig water reservoir fresh with these filters, which should be replaced every two months or 60 water cycles.

Some manufacturers recommend using filtered water or distilled water instead of tap water in your reservoirs, but I've always used tap water with the knowledge that I might have to clean my machine more frequently. You should deep-clean or descale your pod coffee maker every three to six months, or possibly more often if you notice hard water stains, calcium deposits, or mineral buildup, or your machine prompts you to deep-clean it.

You can do this a few ways. For the DIY method, fill your water tank with white vinegar and water (about half and half) and run large-capacity brew cycles until the reservoir is empty; Halfway through, consider letting the vinegar solution soak for a while, around 20 to 30 minutes. Follow up with a few rinsing cycles using clean water until the vinegar smell is gone. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated Keurig descaling solution according to the instructions on the bottle. That solution can be used on non-Keurig machines too. Make sure your machine is fully rinsed out before brewing your next cup of coffee.

It's important to perform these deeper cleaning cycles on a regular basis to ensure your machine lasts as long as possible. And that your coffee tastes good, of course.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Jeff Clarke's Mission to Save Dell PCs","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/jeff-clarkes-mission-to-save-dell-pcs-180102.html","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:02:10 GMT","

For years, the technology world has watched with a mix of curiosity and concern as Dell Technologies, once the undisputed titan of the PC market, seemed to drift further away from the hardware excellence that defined it.

The recent news that Jeff Clarke, Dell's vice chairman and chief operating officer, is taking the reins of the PC business to engineer a massive turnaround is both a recognition of the company's current crisis and a sign of hope.

As we enter 2026, Clarke is not just inheriting a division; he is attempting to revive a brand that has spent the last several years suffocating under its own bureaucratic weight and strategic missteps.

Let's talk about Dell's slide, Clarke's challenge, and the path back. Then we'll close with my product of the week, a nearly invisible PC from HP.

To understand why Jeff Clarke's new role is so critical, one must first look at how Dell lost its way. The rot began with the incredible distraction of the EMC merger, a Herculean task that shifted the company's focus toward enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructure.

While that move was financially successful in the long run, it left the PC division — the heart of Dell's identity — starved for the creative oxygen it needed to compete with a revitalized HP and an increasingly innovative Lenovo.

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Dell's decline was its unwillingness to take reasonable risks. Dell spent years teasing the market with Project Luna, a visionary, sustainable, and modular PC concept that could have revolutionized the industry by making hardware as easy to repair and upgrade as building a Lego set.

Instead of bringing Luna to market as a flagship differentiator, Dell kept it in concept purgatory while competitors moved forward with their own sustainability initiatives.



Dell's Project Luna concept highlighted modular design and repairability — but never became a flagship product. (AI-generated image)

The biggest blow to the brand's prestige came in 2025 with the elimination of the premium XPS line. In a baffling attempt to simplify branding, Dell killed off one of the most respected names in computing and replaced it with a generic “Pro/Plus/Premium” naming convention. This move didn't just confuse customers; it signaled that Dell no longer believed in the “halo” product that defined its engineering prowess.

Critics and insiders have pointed to a leadership vacuum at the top as a primary driver of this stagnation. Michael Dell, the company's legendary founder, has increasingly appeared to have “retired in place.” While he remains the face of the company, his attention has seemed focused more on the financial engineering of the broader Dell Technologies portfolio and philanthropic efforts rather than the day-to-day grit of making great PCs.

Without the founder's obsessive drive for hardware perfection, the PC division became a culture of “covering up” issues rather than identifying and addressing them. Instead of fixing thermal problems or stagnant designs, the company focused on marketing pivots and rebranding exercises that obscured the underlying hardware fatigue.

Adding fuel to the fire, Dell's decline was exacerbated by industry-wide headwinds that the company was uniquely ill-equipped to handle.

The rollout of Windows 11 has been widely regarded as a disappointment, with adoption rates lagging roughly 10-12 points behind those of Windows 10 at the same stage of its lifecycle. Microsoft's aggressive push into the AI PC era has only complicated matters.

As Clarke himself admitted at CES 2026, consumers are not buying laptops for the sake of an NPU (neural processing unit) or a Copilot key. They are buying them for build quality, battery life, and performance.

Dell leaned too heavily into the AI hype, neglecting the core hardware fundamentals that buyers actually care about. With social media backlashes against “Microslop” and AI-bloat growing, Dell found itself tied to a sinking software narrative while its hardware brand was already in retreat.

If anyone can pull Dell back from the brink, it is Jeff Clarke. A 30-year veteran of the company, Clarke is known for his operational discipline and a no-nonsense approach to engineering. He is the architect of the “One Dell Way” initiative, a sweeping company-wide overhaul designed to break down silos and standardize processes.

Clarke's background in product development and supply chain management makes him uniquely qualified to fix the “cover-up” culture. He understands that a laptop isn't just a commodity to be marketed; it's an integrated piece of engineering that requires transparency and continuous refinement.

His recent decision to revive the XPS brand at CES 2026 is the first significant step toward acknowledging past mistakes and refocusing on what made Dell great: premium, recognizable, high-quality hardware.

To truly turn the ship around, Clarke must address two looming threats.

First is the massive security gap. HP has dominated the enterprise conversation with HP Wolf Security, a deep, hardware-level isolation technology that has become the gold standard for the “work-from-anywhere” era. Dell has nothing that matches the comprehensive nature of the Wolf Security suite. For Clarke to win back the C-suite, he must invest heavily in a security architecture that goes beyond standard BIOS protection and offers true, isolated resilience against modern threats.

Second, Dell must look at the changing landscape of personal computing. At CES 2026, Lenovo stole the show with the launch of Qira, an ambient intelligence that lives across PCs and smartphones. Lenovo's ability to offer a “single intelligence” across multiple devices — powered by its success in the Motorola smartphone business — highlights a glaring gap in Dell's portfolio.

While Dell famously exited the smartphone market years ago, the rise of agentic AI that follows a user from their desk to their pocket might force a reconsideration. If a PC is no longer an island but part of a personal AI ecosystem, Dell's lack of a mobile presence could become a fatal flaw in the long-term competition against Lenovo and Apple.

Jeff Clarke's takeover of the Dell PC business is a high-stakes gamble for a company that has spent too long resting on its laurels. By recommitting to the XPS name, admitting that AI isn't a magic bullet for sales, and initiating the “One Dell Way” overhaul, Clarke is signaling a return to hardware sanity.

However, the path ahead remains treacherous. Clarke must overcome a decade of “retirement in place” at the executive level and successfully challenge Lenovo's breadth in personal technology and its Qira AI effort while offsetting HP's security dominance.

While the XPS revival is a victory for fans, the ultimate success of this turnaround will depend on whether Clarke can move Dell from being a follower of Microsoft's software whims to an innovator in hardware-led security and cross-device intelligence. If he succeeds, 2026 will be remembered as the year Dell found its soul again. If he fails, the company may find that rebranding can only hide a lack of vision for so long.



For quite some time, I've argued that the traditional desktop tower is a dinosaur waiting for the asteroid. We've seen the “NUC” movement and the rise of high-power notebooks, but at CES this year, HP finally delivered the missing link I've been looking for: The HP EliteBoard G1a.



HP's EliteBoard G1a puts a full Copilot+ PC inside a premium keyboard chassis.

With the PC built into the keyboard chassis, the EliteBoard collapses the traditional desktop footprint. While this form factor might remind some of the Commodore 64 or the Atari 400, the technology inside is purely 2026. HP even built dual mics and speakers into the keyboard body, reinforcing the idea that the PC should disappear into the workspace.

We are entering the era of agentic AI, where our PCs aren't just tools but digital partners. To do that effectively, you need local processing power that doesn't sound like a jet engine taking off on your desk. The G1a is powered by the AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series PRO processors, delivering up to 55 TOPS of NPU performance via the AMD XDNA 2 architecture. This configuration enables it to run complex LLMs and AI agents locally and silently — critical for those of us who value a quiet, focused workspace.

Coming off the HP Security Summit in December, I was particularly impressed by the integration of HP Wolf Security for Business. The G1a features quantum-resistant firmware protection, which is becoming a baseline requirement as we see more sophisticated AI-driven cyber threats targeting identity and session tokens.

Furthermore, HP has finally fixed the “disposable tech” problem. The EliteBoard is remarkably serviceable for its size. You can remove the bottom cover to replace the RAM, SSD, or even the cooling fans in minutes. In an industry that often favors glue over screws, this level of sustainability — combined with its EPEAT Gold registration — is refreshing.



The HP EliteBoard G1a isn't just a PC; it's a statement about the future of work. At just 12 mm thick and weighing 750g, it's compact, powerful, and built to eliminate the clutter that has defined the desktop experience for decades — making the PC nearly invisible.

HP plans to have the EliteBoard G1a available on HP.com in March, with pricing to follow closer to release. For anyone who wants a clean desk environment without sacrificing the power to run the latest AI models locally, the HP EliteBoard G1a is easily my Product of the Week.

When Preeti Suri reached the summit of Mount Rainier, she wasn't just celebrating a mountaineering milestone; she was completing a transformation from burned out investment banker to founder on a mission.

Suri is co-founder and CEO of Bellevue, Wash.-based AdventureTripr, a travel marketplace leveraging technology and AI to help facilitate multi-day outdoor excursions.

Launched just one month before the 2020 pandemic lockdown, the company has scaled today to a profitable platform offering 500 trips across 50 countries, fueled by a lean team and a “tech-first” approach to travel curation.

AdventureTripr has found success in dismantling the economic and social-cultural barriers that often keep people of color and first-time hikers away from the world's most iconic trails and peaks.

The discovery enjoyed by customers started with Puri's own realization about the benefits of the outdoors, which was paved by her exhaustion with the corporate grind. A former CPA and investment banker in London, Suri found herself at a breaking point.

“I was like, ‘This is not what I want to do the rest of my life. I'm just making rich people richer. It's not fulfilling,'” Suri said.

Moving to Seattle as a new mom brought a different challenge: postpartum depression and a loss of physical stamina. She began hiking Washington's trails as a form of therapy, carrying her baby on her back. As her son grew, so did her ambition. She eventually climbed every major Washington volcano, a journey she describes as “absolutely transformational” for her mental health.

She thought to herself: “I want to enable that for others.”

With multi-day adventure trips from major U.S. operators such as Backroads and REI priced as high as $7,000 per person, Suri recognized a gap in the market. And she knew costs could be lowered by working directly with local guides. 

She also understood that many South Asian travelers felt a sense of “intimidation and hesitation” because they hadn't grown up in a hiking culture.

“A lot of the U.S. companies assumed a lot of the people of color either didn't know how to do this stuff or didn't want to do this stuff, whereas my insight was it was a lot of aspiration,” Suri said. “They need a bit more hand-holding.”

While the company's clientele has balanced out over time, roughly 40% of its business still comes from a high-net-worth South Asian demographic — a “sweet spot” of customers who value the personalized training plans and gear guidance AdventureTripr provides.

Alongside co-founder Marat Khabibullin, a longtime software engineer at Microsoft, Suri integrated AI into AdventureTripr's workflow long before it became a mainstream buzzword, scaling more rapidly than legacy adventure companies. 

“It takes us 15 minutes to upload a new trip because we have AI tools built for that and to create our content,” Suri said.

The company is also currently developing AI agents to handle tasks such as answering traveler questions about gear or local tipping customs. But Suri remains skeptical of the “AI travel planner” trend that is popular among many startups.

“People who like to piece things together will continue piecing things together,” she said. “Curation and customization is where the expert knowledge comes into play. … There is so much significance to the human element of human connection.”

AdventureTripr employs about 20 full-time and freelance employees. The company, which generates revenue from bookings, raised approximately $500,000 in pre-seed funding in 2021 from advisors and clients.

Looking back at her banking days, Suri says she works just as hard now but without the looming threat of burnout. Fulfillment comes from seeing clients — ranging from cancer survivors to groups of 40 Indian moms — conquer treks like Machu Picchu or the Tour du Mont Blanc.

“It doesn't feel like work anymore,” Suri said. “It is changing lifestyles, changing people's lives. I wouldn't trade it for anything.”

Meta's enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit's staff — and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It's a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.

Few are going to miss it.

As industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.

In part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z's preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook's digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.

Meta's vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta's Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.

Fast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.

According to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (“Resident Evil 4 VR“), Twisted Pixel (“Marvel's Deadpool VR“), and Sanzaru (“Asgard's Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” Camouflaj, the studio behind the “Batman: Arkham Shadow” VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire. 

And last week, The Verge noted that Meta's program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.

The news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department's budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.

Unlike the news of Meta's rebrand, the deprioritization of the company's metaverse efforts should come as no surprise — the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit. 

In total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you'd have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.

Besides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn't even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the “build in the open” model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.

That model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.

Meta, betting on the “if you build it, they will come” strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers. 

Specifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta's revenue through their app stores.

“This period has…been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we've also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,” Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company's Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. “I've come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.”

He proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting “hundreds of billions” of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.

Meta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren't being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta's size.

Though there's no external visibility into Meta's own VR app store, you can look at Meta's apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.

From a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that's still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.

For comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

Of course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming — not unlike Facebook's early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga — whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends — drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook's 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)

But this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google's standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.

Even before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.

As bad, Meta wasn't building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its “Personal Boundary” feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta's Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to “on” when a user is engaging with “non-friends” in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.

In May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a “safe zone” button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors' behavior.

At the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.

These types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn't exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn't detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would “take action on users.”

Also around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we'd guess there weren't as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it's not a bad bet!)

Another nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta's Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week. 

With an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing “unprecedented demand.” (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)

With other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass. 

Combined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app's growth, and large language models.

Both are precisely true.  It is a better search engine than anything else -- which, while true, is something you won't realize unless you've used the non-free 'pro research' features from Google and/or OpenAI.  And it can perform limited but increasingly-capable reasoning about what it finds before presenting the results to the user.Note that no online Web search or tool usage at all was involved in the recent IMO results.  I think a lot of people missed that little detail.

At this point the only conclusion here is:
The original proof was on the training set. 
The author and Terence did not care enough to find the publication by erdos himself

It looked a bit like someone at Google subscribed to a legal theory under which you can avoid copyright infringement if you take a derivative work and apply a mechanical obfuscation to it.

reply

People seem to have this belief, or perhaps just general intuition, that LLMs are a google search on a training set with a fancy language engine on the front end. That's not what they are. The models (almost) self avoid copyright, because they never copy anything in the first place, hence why the model is a dense web of weight connections rather than an orderly bookshelf of copied training data.Picture yourself contorting your hands under a spotlight to generate a shadow in the shape of a bird.

It doesn't matter if ai is in a hype cycle or not it doesn't change how a technology works.Check out the yt videos from 1blue3brown he explains LLMs quite well.
.your first step is the word embedding this vector space represents the relationship between words. Father - grandfather. The vector which makes a father a grandfather is the same vector as mother to grandmother.You the use these word vectors in the attention layer to create a n dimensional space aka latent space which basically reflects a 'world' the LLM walks through. This makes the 'magic' of LLMs.Basically a form of compression by having higher dimensions reflecting kind a meaning.Your brain does the same thing. It can't store pixels so when you go back to some childhood environment like your old room, you remember it in some efficient (brain efficient) way. Like the 'feeling' of it.That's also the reason why an LLM is not just some statistical parrot.

It's great business to minimally modify valuable stuff and then take credit for it. As was explained to me by bar-certified counsel ""if you take a recipe and add, remove or change just one thing, it's now your recipe""The new trend in this is asking Claude Code to create a software on some type, like a Browser or a DICOM viewer, and then publishing that it's managed to do this very expensive thing (but if you check source code, which is never published, it probably imports a lot of open source dependencies that actually do the thing)Now this is especially useful in business, but it seems that some people are repurposing this for proving math theorems. The Terence Tao effort which later checks for previous material is great! But the fact that the Section 2 (for such cases) is filled to the brim, and section 1 is mostly documented failed attempts (except for 1 proof, congratulations to the authors), mostly confirms my hypothesis, claiming that the model has guards that prevent it is a deus ex machina cope against the evidence.

The infeasibility is searching for the (unknown) set of translations that the LLM would put that data through. Even if you posit only basic symbolic LUT mappings in the weights (it's not), there's no good way to enumerate them anyway. The model might as well be a learned hash function that maintains semantic identity while utterly eradicating literal symbolic equivalence.

Pretty soon, this is going to mean the entire historical math literature will be formalized (or, in some cases, found to be in error).  Consider the implications of that for training theorem provers.

reply

What's more, there's almost surely going to turn out to be a large amount of human generated mathematics that's ""basically"" correct, in the sense that there exists a formal proof that morally fits the arc of the human proof, but there's informal/vague reasoning used (e.g. diagram arguments, etc) that are hard to really formalize, but an expert can use consistently without making a mistake. This will take a long time to formalize, and I expect will require a large amount of human and AI effort.

This particular field seems ideal for AI, since verification enables identification of failure at all levels.  If the definitions are wrong the theorems won't work and applications elsewhere won't work.

But as far as we know, the proof it wrote is original. Tao himself noted that it's very different from the other proof (which was only found now).That's so far removed from a “search engine” that the term is essentially nonsense in this context.

AI is currently great at interpolation, and in some fields (like biology) there seems to be low-hanging fruit for this kind of connect-the-dots exercise. A human would still be considered smart for connecting these dots IMO.AI clearly struggles with extrapolation, at least if the new datum is fully outside the training set.And we will have AGI (if not ASI) if/when AI systems can reliably form new paradigms. It's a high bar.

Instead of addressing any of that you're insisting I'm misunderstanding and pointing me back to a linked comment of yours drawing a distinction between epistemic value of science research vs math research. Epistemic value counts for many things, but one thing it can't do is negate the significance of pure math turning into applied research on account of pure science doing the same.

reply

No, ""so what"" doesn't indicate disagreement, just that something isn't relevant.Anyway, assume hot dogs taste not good at all, except in rare circumstances. It would then be wrong to say ""hot dogs taste good"", but it would be right to say ""hot dogs don't taste good"". Now substitute pure math for hot dogs. Pure math can be generally useless even if it isn't always useless. Men are taller than women. That's the difference between applied and pure math. The difference between math and science is something else: Even useless science has value, while most useless math (which consists of pure math) doesn't. (I would say the axiomatization of new theories, like probability theory, can also have inherent value, independent of any uselessness, insofar as it is conceptual progress, but that's different from proving pure math conjectures.)

Ironically this example turns out to be a great object lesson in not underestimating the utility of research based on an eyeball test. But it shouldn't even have to have any intuitively plausible payoff whatsoever in order to justify it. The whole point is that even if a given research paradigm completely failed the eyeball test, our attitude should still be that it very well could have practical utility, and there are so many historical examples to this effect (the other commenter already gave several examples, and the right thing to do would have been acknowledge them), and besides I would argue they still have the same intrinsic value that any and all knowledge has.

This aligns nicely with the rest of the canon. LLMs are just stochastic parrots. Fancy autocomplete. A glorified Google search with worse footnotes. Any time they appear to do something novel, the correct explanation is that someone, somewhere, already did it, and the model merely vibes in that general direction. The fact that no human knew about it at the time is a coincidence best ignored.The same logic applies to code. “Vibe coding” isn't real programming. Real programming involves intuition, battle scars, and a sixth sense for bugs that can't be articulated but somehow always validates whatever I already believe. When an LLM produces correct code, that's not engineering, it's cosplay. It didn't understand the problem, because understanding is defined as something only humans possess, especially after the fact.Naturally, only senior developers truly code. Juniors shuffle syntax. Seniors channel wisdom. Architecture decisions emerge from lived experience, not from reading millions of examples and compressing patterns into a model. If an LLM produces the same decisions, it's obviously cargo-culting seniority without having earned the right to say “this feels wrong” in a code review.Any success is easy to dismiss. Data leakage. Prompt hacking. Cherry-picking. Hidden humans in the loop. And if none of those apply, then it “won't work on a real codebase,” where “real” is defined as the one place the model hasn't touched yet. This definition will be updated as needed.Hallucinations still settle everything. One wrong answer means the whole system is fundamentally broken. Human mistakes, meanwhile, are just learning moments, context switches, or coffee shortages. This is not a double standard. It's experience.Jobs are obviously safe too. Software engineering is mostly communication, domain expertise, and navigating ambiguity. If the model starts doing those things, that still doesn't count, because it doesn't sit in meetings, complain about product managers, or feel existential dread during sprint planning.So yes, the Erdos situation is resolved. Nothing new happened. No reasoning occurred. Progress remains hype. The trendline is imaginary. And any discomfort you feel is probably just social media, not the ground shifting under your feet.

The problems are a pretty good metric for AI, because the easiest ones at least meet the bar of ""a top mathematician didn't know how to solve this off the top of his head"" and the hardest ones are major open problems.  As AI progresses, we will see it slowly climb the difficulty ladder.

This is bad faith. Erdos was an incredibly prolific mathematician, it is unreasonable to expect anyone to have memorized his entire output. Yet, Tao knows enough about Erdos to know which mathematical techniques he regularly used in his proofs.From the forum thread about Erdos problem 281:> I think neither the Birkhoff ergodic theorem nor the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality, some version of either was the key ingredient to unlock the problem, were in the regular toolkit of Erdos and Graham (I'm sure they were aware of these tools, but would not instinctively reach for them for this sort of problem). On the other hand, the aggregate machinery of covering congruences looks relevant (even though ultimately it turns out not to be), and was very much in the toolbox of these mathematicians, so they could have been misled into thinking this problem was more difficult than it actually was due to a mismatch of tools.> I would assess this problem as safely within reach of a competent combinatorial ergodic theorist, though with some thought required to figure out exactly how to transfer the problem to an ergodic theory setting. But it seems the people who looked at this problem were primarily expert in probabilistic combinatorics and covering congruences, which turn out to not quite be the right qualifications to attack this problem.

Erdos was prolific and many of his open problems are numbered and have space to discuss them online, so it's become fairly common to run through them with frontier models and see if a good proof can be come up with; there have been some notable successes here this year.Tao seems to engage in sort of a two step approach with these proofs - first, are they correct? Lean formalization makes that unambiguous, but not all proofs are easily formulated into Lean, so he also just, you know, checks them. Second, literature search inside LLMs and out for prior results — this is to check where frontier models are at in the ‘novel proofs or just regurgitated proofs' space.To my knowledge, we're currently at the point where we are seeing some novel proofs offered, but I don't think we've seen any that have absolutely no priors in literature.As you might guess this is itself sort of a Rorschach test for what AI could and will be.In this case, it looked at first like this was a totally novel solution to something that hadn't been solved before. On deeper search, Tao noted it's almost trivial to prove with stuff Erdos knew, and also had been proved independently; this proof doesn't use the prior proof mechanism though.

The answer is yes. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an \(\epsilon > 0\) such that for every \(k\), there exists a choice of congruence classes \(a_1^{(k)}, \dots, a_k^{(k)}\) for which the set of integers not covered by the first \(k\) congruences has density at least \(\epsilon\).For each \(k\), let \(F_k\) be the set of all infinite sequences of residues \((a_i)_{i=1}^\infty\) such that the uncovered set from the first \(k\) congruences has density at least \(\epsilon\). Each \(F_k\) is nonempty (by assumption) and closed in the product topology (since it depends only on the first \(k\) coordinates). Moreover, \(F_{k+1} \subseteq F_k\) because adding a congruence can only reduce the uncovered set. By the compactness of the product of finite sets, \(\bigcap_{k \ge 1} F_k\) is nonempty.Choose an infinite sequence \((a_i) \in \bigcap_{k \ge 1} F_k\). For this sequence, let \(U_k\) be the set of integers not covered by the first \(k\) congruences, and let \(d_k\) be the density of \(U_k\). Then \(d_k \ge \epsilon\) for all \(k\). Since \(U_{k+1} \subseteq U_k\), the sets \(U_k\) are decreasing and periodic, and their intersection \(U = \bigcap_{k \ge 1} U_k\) has density \(d = \lim_{k \to \infty} d_k \ge \epsilon\). However, by hypothesis, for any choice of residues, the uncovered set has density \(0\), a contradiction.Therefore, for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(k\) such that for every choice of congruence classes \(a_i\), the density of integers not covered by the first \(k\) congruences is less than \(\epsilon\).\boxed{\text{Yes}}

You could have just rubber-stamped it yourself, for all the mathematical rigor it holds. The devil is in the details, and the smallest problem unravels the whole proof.

Is this enough? Let $U_k$ be the set of integers such that their remainder mod 6^n is greater or equal to 2^n for all 1<n<k. Density of each $U_k$ is more than 1/2 I think but not the intersection (empty) right?

This would all be a fairly trivial exercise in diagonalization if such a lemma as implied by Deepseek existed.(Edit: The bounding I suggested may not be precise at each level, but it is asymptotically the limit of the sequence of densities, so up to some epsilon it demonstrates the desired counterexample.)

Anecdotally, I, as a math postdoc, think that GPT 5.2 is much stronger qualitatively than anything else I've used. Its rate of hallucinations is low enough that I don't feel like the default assumption of any solution is that it is trying to hide a mistake somewhere. Compared with Gemini 3 whose failure mode when it can't solve something is always to pretend it has a solution by ""lying""/ omitting steps/making up theorems etc... GPT 5.2 usually fails gracefully and when it makes a mistake it more often than not can admit it when pointed out.

Personally, I've been applying them to hard OCR problems. Many varied languages concurrently, wildly varying page structure, and poor scan quality; my dataset has all of these things. The models take 30 minutes a page, but the accuracy is basically 100% (it'll still striggle with perfectly-placed bits of mold). The next best model (Google's flagship) rests closer to 80%.I'll be VERY intrigued to see what the next 2, 5, 10 years does to the price of this level of model.

I'm beginning to think the Bitter Lesson applies to organic intelligence as well, because basic pattern matching can be implemented relatively simply using very basic mathematical operations like multiply and accumulate, and so it can scale with massive parallelization of relatively simple building blocks.

The ability to think about your own thinking over and over as deeply as needed is where all the magic happens. Counterfactual reasoning occurs every time you pop a mental stack frame. By augmenting our stack with external tools (paper, computers, etc.), we can extend this process as far as it needs to go.LLMs start to look a lot more capable when you put them into recursive loops with feedback from the environment. A trillion tokens worth of ""what if..."" can be expended without touching a single token in the caller's context. This can happen at every level as many times as needed if we're using proper recursive machinery. The theoretical scaling around this is extremely favorable.

Ie you want to find a subimage in a big image, possibly rotated, scaled, tilted, distorted, with noise. You cannot do that with a pattern matcher, but you can do that with a matcher, such as a fuzzy matcher, a LLM.You want to find a go position on a go board. A LLM is perfect for that, because you don't need to come up with a special language to describe go positions (older chess programs did that), you just train the model if that position is good or bad, and this can be fully automated via existing literature and later by playing against itself. You train the matcher not via patterns but a function (win or loose).

Basically, the boring solution (democracy) gets you boring, middle-of-the-road results, while a monarchy is more likely to get you an outlier. The outlier might be at the top or the bottom of the pack, but because it's not democracy any more you don't have any say, so tough toenails if it's the wrong one.

No one at a gun range is changing their vote.Both parties already know which voters change their votes depending on the situation.

So they don't really need to do more than pay lip service to any others. Because the data's already told them that the others won't change their votes in any case.

I did not bother canvassing or donating to the Harris campaign for this reason, for the same reason I did not help pro vaccine non profits during the pandemic trying to convince antivaxxers.

Mamdani was able to win NYC because young people and women turned out in force and ranked choice voting. The electoral college overweights rural, lower education parts of the country in US voting influence.Based on the above, it will be a long time before enough of the US electorate has turned over before you can run a women presidential candidate imho. 78% of farmers voted for him, and still support him, even as he destroys their way of life, for example. Progress occurs one funeral at a time (Planck).I recommend the recently released book “The Vanishing Church: How the Hollowing Out of Moderate Congregations is Hurting Democracy, Faith, and Us” by Ryan P Burge (ISBN13 9781587436697) as a contributor to understanding this topic, as well as “Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are” by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz (ISBN13 9780062390851).Edit: This comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46681760 touches on this as well.

Remember when Trump was all like Deep State, Democrats and Epstein, let's get those files released! And then it came time to do it, and for some reason he was like... oh that's a bad idea?)No doubt individual state politics play a role, too - an unpopular governor might give the opposing party a boost.But yeah, if the Democratic nominee was a) nominated, and b) a white male, the odds probably would've shifted in their favor enough to flip those few battleground states.

Both parties are quite disconnected from the interests of the ""ordinary people"", and the ""ordinary people"" voting from them are often quite disconnected from the reality; instead they want someone who would approve their preconceptions, and would stick it to ""them"" in the endless political sports match.Which may not be that endless: if the political climate of the US deteriorates enough, some authoritarian populist could just get elected and never leave.

If people stopped spending hours each day scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook feeds, media incentives would change. Journalism would become more thorough and responsible, rather than optimized for outrage and clicks. People's attention spans would recover, making them more capable of listening to opposing views and engaging in meaningful discussion. The overall quality of public debate would improve, and political leaders would be chosen based on objective, long-term policies rather than emotional manipulation.The reinforcement-learning algorithms that drive these feeds are fundamentally unnatural. They represent a massive, uncontrolled social experiment on humanity—one that is far too powerful for our psychological reward systems to handle.What needs to happen is education. Education on how the attention economy works. People must learn to resist becoming social media junkies, because every hour surrendered to these platforms reinforces the very systems that distort public discourse. When we lose control over our attention, we don't just harm ourselves—we actively worsen the societal conditions that enable manipulation, polarization, and poor political leadership.

For that we would need a new funding model for journalism. Local journalism (i.e. local newspapers, radio and TV stations) used to be financed by classifieds and ads. Classifieds are long since gone off to the Internet and ads have been replaced by Google Maps plus Facebook, so there's no monetary stream - and as a result of that, there's barely anyone left holding local politicians and companies accountable. Yes, some places have ""citizen journalists"" and bloggers, but these usually do not have the funds to pay for legal teams and court proceedings, so they usually only target government stuff.Something like taxpayer-paid media is way too easily corruptible by the government, just look at Hungary for the worst possible outcome. ""Mandatory contribution"" systems like the BBC or Germany's public broadcasters aren't that easily corruptible, but it still happens - just watch the shitshow every few years here in Germany when the contribution needs to be raised.It's an all-around mess.

And, if you read the paper, you will find that evidence. How these work depends on initial conditions that vary and exporters will not react in a consistent way.As a specific example, theoretical research in this area tends to make assumptions around the stationarity of margins that are obviously ludicrous in the context of reality in the US. It is quite easy to justify almost any policy with theoretical research in economics so people who have no understanding of economics will find evidence for whatever position they choose. Reality is quite different.

No, it is surprising, as noted in the article, because basic economics suggests that suppliers will adjust pricing, and eat some of the tariff to keep their products competitive. Page 5:This finding was initially surprising to some observers. Standard economic models suggest that the incidence of a tariff depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand. If foreign exporters face highly elastic demand (meaning buyers can easily switch to alternatives), they might be expected to absorb part of the tariff to remain competitive.

ie what happens if global demand exceeds supply and a lot of companies have never tried to find other markets because of the inertia required to do so - but if they are pushed by tariffs they find there are alternative customers out there.As an example - Canada appear to replaced trading food for cars with the US, to food for cars with China.https://www.facebook.com/TechXnew/posts/canada-has-made-a-de...

it also assumes that there are no other alternative markets to sell to or that supplier capacity is equally elastic; the US might be a high margin market to sell to, but if you only have a fixed amount of product to sell then it makes no sense to eat the high cost of a tariff to keep selling a low margin product when you can instead sell your product at a medium margin in europebuilding out more supply for a product is often capital intensive if you want to make it at an economically efficient price point in these times; efficiencies of scale are hard to overcome and a rapid shift of economic policies makes anyone uncertain about future investment so it takes a very long time for these supply chains to rebalance, if they ever do

Exactly: tariffs are taxes in another guise. They only serve to create an (artificial) price advantage of local over imported goods for as long as they're levied.> What were you thinking? What was going through your heads?

Now I'm neither in the US, American nor Democrat/Republican, but as far as I understand their argument, is that they know it means higher costs for those products for them, and it'll eventually lead to companies wanting to produce things within the border, and only after that is in place, will things actually get cheaper (and better?).So I think for these people with that perspective, the idea is: everything cheap -> tariffs to make imports expensive > People buy less imports and companies start selling within the border > Eventually things get cheap.Again, this is just me trying to understand their perspective.

I don't believe it for a second.Here's something that has happened before though. During the American War of Treasonous Aggression, the southern states decided to impose tariffs on the export of cotton to the UK. That caused massive hardship in the UK in the short term as it made the goods that the cotton was a raw material for impossible to sell. UK jobs were lost, UK workers starved etc.So the local UK manufacturing companies found markets to supply them elsewhere in the world. They set up the supply lines, they reached agreements, and life went on. UK jobs were gained again, UK workers stopped starving. Life was good.When the American War of Treasonous Aggression was over, the southern states wanted to drop their tariffs and start supplying the UK again. It didn't happen - there was no need to return to an unreliable partner when everything was set up just fine and dandy as it was, and the US cotton was essentially unsellable. US jobs were lost, US workers starved etc. The cotton industry never recovered from that.Tariffs are a ""fuck you, make me"" slap in the face. Do it to people you don't like, but if you do it to people who are supposed to be ""allies"" (obviously not allies in the above case, but the consequences here were just as real), the consequences can be ... quite concerning for the tariffers.

The real distinction is that tariffs are conditional. Currently, firms can avoid them by changing sourcing. That makes them more behavior-shaping than revenue maximizing.Given that the U.S. never reversed the TCJA corporate cuts from 2020-2024, tariffs are one of the few active levers currently increasing the marginal cost of offshore supply chains.

What you're describing is called ""dumping"", and it's a strategy China has used to varying degrees of success in other markets in order to destabilize foreign industries.  It could be seen as an act of war.Chinese labor is not actually so cheap anymore, many other developing nations are significantly less expensive. But China's secret weapon is total control and coordination across industries.  They use this to subsidize target industries for the export market.  You've highlighted automakers, but they also target steel, aluminum, and others.  To a casual observer it almost appears as if they were targeting industries that could be readily adapted to wartime production.

The headline suggests it was all passed into consumers. So why is inflation still so low? If you add 10-30% to prices (granted, of imports, not of houses, domestic food etc), you'd expect more.If companies were eating it (which apparently they aren't) then their profitability should be down.

Trump and his entire administration admitted there would be short term pain, possibly a recession, but that it would be ""worth it"" to restructure the economy.So the question is: how long does the pain last? And is the economy stronger when it's over (do we get over it)? It's been 9 months so far.From my perspective the policy goals are very unclear since it seems like they're actively wielding tariffs both as a means to reorganize the economy and as a weapon to bully other countries.

If you were going to do that though, it would be more like a 10-20% blanket tariff on all goods. No exceptions, no special deals, and you can't use tariffs as a negotiating tool. So that's not what's going on and the current approach doesn't make any sense economically

The point when Trump was elected was to make americans buy american and to get international companies to move their production to the U.S.In Sweden they did something similar when they thought people were buying too much cheap stuff directly from China instead of from the middlemen paying taxes.

Tariffs make foreign imports more expensive. This dissuades people from buying them. Some of those people will instead buy equivalent American made products, now that the price difference has lessened. I consider that a good thing. There will be pain while local manufacturing ramps up (or forever, if it never does) for products that have no domestic equivalent. That sucks, but sometimes things need to suck before they improve. Paying off the national debt, for example, is something I support, even if we have to slash a lot of useful spending for awhile. I think most rational Republicans are voting for these sorts of things despite knowing they will make things temporarily worse, in the hopes of an eventual better. The left tends to never do this, for they are very attuned to the immediate suffering their plans cause. The right tends to be less sensitive to the short term suffering their plans cause; the right thinks that the alternative, a slow decline, is worth the pain to avoid. Trump has bungled the implementation of the tariffs, but I still support their use in general.Fundamentally it makes no sense to me to support a minimum wage for your countrymen, but also support them importing massive amounts of slave made goods. You are creating rules on the supply side that the demand side does not have to follow, which only harms your own domestic businesses. Your own country's businesses have to compete against slave labor while paying living wages; for most manufacturing this is just not possible. You are incentivizing off shoring, which harms your working class, who have to compete with subminimum wage workers. Workers rights must be paired with tariffs, or every additional worker right is a demerit on his hireability against foreign workers without those rights! If you want your country to produce anything, and to have a strong working class, you either remove minimum wage, or you implement tariffs. We cannot simultaneously support strong domestic workers rights and mass importation of sweatshop goods that were made without them. It hollows out the country.Edit: I am rate limited though I would like to reply to some of my interlocutors. I will reply later.

First, there have been huge numbers of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. that Americans simply didn't want to do, so adding more manufacturing jobs they also don't want to do isn't going to help the economy. It's the proverbial, “Americans don't want to screw tiny screws into iPhones.” situation.Second, for there to be any prayer of the tariffs working to boost local production (whether staffed or automated), they both cannot be capricious nor can they be applied to the goods and services necessary to acquire and deploy in service of increasing that productive capacity. If the tariffs can be waved around randomly like a threat of grounding a child, then they work only as an instrument of short-term extortion, not as a mechanism to expand an economic base. If the goods and services required for expansion are tariffed, then there's a giant margin and time-to-ROI disincentive to make the investment as well.Third, there is absolutely no good reason to apply tariffs to goods and services for which you have no plausible domestic substitute. There's no point in putting tariffs on bananas and coffee in the U.S. unless what you want is to basically put the equivalent of a “sin tax” on bananas and coffee because you're weirdly morally opposed to people eating bananas and drinking coffee or something.Fourth, tariffs don't ever make domestic equivalents cheaper or more affordable for consumers relative to comparable foreign imports. They just drive the price of all available options up to or near the baseline cost of goods plus the tariff. In the absolute best case scenario where everything about tariffs works out as perfectly as possible, you're just adding margin for producers.Trying to be globally competitive economically by using tariffs makes no sense. Trying to improve domestic economic conditions by using tariffs makes no sense. It's a ridiculously shallow, nonsensical approach to attempting to do either of those things even when they're used carefully and responsibly, but they were never going to be used carefully and responsibly.The point of them was always going to be to use them as a means of paying for indulgences and dispensations.Though perhaps that's a preferable policy than to re-shore sweatshops and child labor to the U.S. as you're implicitly suggesting should be done?

They just drive the price of all available options up to or near the baseline cost of goods plus the tariff. In the absolute best case scenario where everything about tariffs works out as perfectly as possible, you're just adding margin for producers.Trying to be globally competitive economically by using tariffs makes no sense. Trying to improve domestic economic conditions by using tariffs makes no sense. It's a ridiculously shallow, nonsensical approach to attempting to do either of those things even when they're used carefully and responsibly, but they were never going to be used carefully and responsibly.The point of them was always going to be to use them as a means of paying for indulgences and dispensations.Though perhaps that's a preferable policy than to re-shore sweatshops and child labor to the U.S. as you're implicitly suggesting should be done?

I can see how this stance can be justified for imports from countries who do not provide a meaningful minimum wage.I do not see how this stance can be justified for tariffs on EU countries (where worker rights are strongly protected), especially when the basis for that tariff is to ""punish"" those countries for not wanting to change national borders against the will of the people inside those borders.

The observation was that the wage boost of a minimum wage can be undercut by importing cheap goods made with slave labor. Workers can't get hired, domestic manufacturers cannot afford to hire.The point is not that snapping phones together is some aspirational career. The point is that a legally mandated wage floor is meaningless if domestic producers cannot hire at all because they are competing with goods made under conditions that would be illegal here.If you support minimum wages and labor standards, you either accept trade barriers that enforce those standards at the border, or you accept offshoring as a structural feature that permanently shrinks the set of jobs available to low-skill workers. You cannot have both.No one is arguing that people should be forced into factory work. The argument is that a living wage should be available to anyone willing to work, and that requires domestic production capacity. Whether those jobs are in manufacturing, logistics, or automated facilities is secondary. What matters is that the price system does not systematically reward labor exploitation abroad while penalizing it at home.I'll respond with a question: why wouldn't you want a living wage available to anyone willing to work? One way to enable that might be to ramp up US manufacturing and production.

However, as evidenced by the current situation, the US economy doesn't support manufacturing all types of consumer goods that it demands.I understand the pressure points you're arguing for but I don't think that the US society will be in a better place once those are enforced.If everybody willing to work doesn't have access to a job that pays a living wage, isn't that a different issue? Maybe the government could have educational programs so everybody has access to getting the education needed for jobs that pay a living wage (those not offshored to China and others) but I guess that's too much socialism for the US.

But what about the other side of the coin - that exports will now become more difficult, because of retaliatory tariffs? How does that help your domestic economy?Trumps solution seems to be to try to bully other countries into accepting tariffs and not imposing tariffs on American goods. But how is this supposed to work? Quite apart from the appalling moral and fairness aspects of this strategy, trashing the economies of other countries is a bad idea, because you want other countries to be wealthy so they can buy stuff from you.Free trade has built the modern Western world, and has already made the US the world's leading economic superpower. I can't even see what Trump is trying to achieve.

The drawings are not about the holocaust, but the fascism which has led to that point. The holocaust started nearly a decade after Hitler taking power. And I don't think anyone believes Trump or his puppet masters are seriously after an actual genocide; everything else and the victims they accept as ""necessary"" for their goals are the problem.History can repeat itself, but never in the same cloths.

Coal probably won't ever recover from being obsolete, etc. I think this mostly won't be controversial a few years down the line.

I paid EUR 510, which means $593. This is with all taxes included, so the price without tax would be about $490.I have searched now the ASUS mini-PC on Newegg, and its cost is $679, around +38.5% more expensive.This is wild, because indeed, until recently the price of electronics devices was significantly lower in USA in comparison with Europe, while now it is the reverse.This is not a ""Made in China"" mini-PC, which might have been affected by worse tariffs.Moreover, I have equipped the mini-PC with 32 GB DDR5 & 1 TB SSD, while cursing the more than triple price of DDR5 compared with last summer, so that now the DRAM has been more than a third of the price of the complete computer.This configuration has cost me the equivalent of slightly less than $900, without taxes. The same configuration has a price on Newegg of almost $1200.

Econ 101 normally covers tax incidence (which side bears the burden of a tax). It has a lot to do with elasticity of both demand and supply. If foreign exporters can easily shift to other markets or adjust production (elastic supply), they'll pass most of the tariff cost to consumers through higher prices. If American consumers have few substitute products (inelastic demand), they'll end up absorbing most of the cost. Of course if the opposite is true, the sellers end up eating the tariff.The reality is that tariffs typically get passed through to consumers as higher prices, not absorbed by exporters. The exact split depends on how flexible each side can be, but empirical evidence shows consumers usually bear most of the burden.

What do you mean by ""pass the cost""? Exporters do not pay tariffs, importers do. The exporter doesn't give a shit because it doesn't affect them at all.This is one of the most fundamental misunderstandings of how tariffs work in the first place. The entity that's picking up the cargo at the port is who literally has to pay CBP for them to release the goods. The middleman (say, Walmart) may pass the cost to customers or whatever, but tariffs are entirely inconsequential and irrelevant to foreign exporters. There's no way to send a bill to a foreign entity demanding a tax for some goods that have arrived at a port, after all.

Simplified: a seller can lower their price by the amount of the tariff. The buyer is responsible for paying the tariff bill, but the seller is the one eating the cost at the end of the day, it is ""passed"" to the seller.Alternatively, the seller can refuse to budge on price. The seller makes the same amount per unit, and the buyer gets the privilege of paying the tariff while not receiving any sort of break on the price. The entire cost of the tariff is ""passed"" to the buyer.

One big problem with arguing about this is that it will take many years for the effects of the tariffs to settle. If there's new opportunity for local competition of goods that we've been importing, new companies can't form and meet that demand over night, it will take longer than the president has to see that succeed, which certainly hasn't stopped him from claiming it already has.

This isn't the first time tariffs have been used in a country to push purchasing preferences. The problem is that it hurts them and it hurts us, it's just a net economic drain and doesn't effectively achieve the local economic boost that some want it to, especially in today's global economy where trade has become so integral that we no longer produce many of the products we buy, and therefore tariffs can't fix. “There is near unanimous consensus among economists that tariffs are self-defeating” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff

Countries geographically closer to the USA might reason differently because close countries usually trade more and they have more to lose. But even in this case, if a Mexican or Canadian company can find other markets or discovers that it can keep selling at the same price, they will not bear any of the burden of the tariffs.Russian like sanctions were applied to Italy about 100 years ago because of colonial wars in Africa. Despite the sanctions lasted only 6 months, Italy discovered that they ended up trading less with the usual partners and more with others. Tariffs are somewhat similar to sanctions as they apply friction to trading.

Such protectionist practices were used by China to bootstrap their own automobile industry, before they became competitive in the global market. Of course, China had surplus capacity of untapped cheap labor, which America does not.Barring an evolution in automated manufacturing, or an overhaul of regulatory policy, I'm pessimistic it's possible to accomplish the same in the US. But, in principle, tariffs have a valid place in supporting an emerging local industry.

First you subsidize and support the creation of currently not commercially viable chip fabs on-shore. Literally handing companies money under some obligation into the future.Eventually the on-shore chips are produced, but they have higher total cost of ownership for the users: Logistics may be cheaper due to less distance, or more expensive because they are not well-trodden paths yet. Production costs like labor, water, energy could be higher. And the chips could just have higher failure rate, because problems in the new processes need to be kinked out.But to get local consumers to switch to these switches, one applies tariffs to other sources of chips so the on-shore chips become more competitive artificially, until they become actually cheaper and competitive.The way it is threatened here isn't in the use case of tariffs at all from my limited understanding.

Out of that price: $3 goes to production cost, $3 goes to tariffs, and $4 goes to profits.Now the taxes/tariffs are doubled. The producer can up their price to $13, meaning $3 to production, $6 to tariffs and $4 to profit.But customers might not accept any price higher than $10. They won't buy.So instead you continue selling for $10 and your costs are: $3 for production, $6 for tariffs and $1 in profit.That's what people mean when they say that companies are paying the tariffs. They're not profiting as much as before.In practice it's usually a mix of higher consumer prices, lower company profits, or even some products not being imported anymore.

The ""Unexpected"" Dryer Rise: Although tariffs only applied to washers, the price of dryers (a complementary good often sold with washers) also rose by an equivalent amount—approximately $92 per unit—as manufacturers increased prices on laundry pairs.
Job Creation Cost: While the tariffs helped domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool, LG, and Samsung shift production to the U.S. and create about 1,800 new jobs, researchers estimated that consumers paid over $800,000 annually for each job created.
Outcome: The tariffs resulted in a 49% decline in imports from 2017 to 2019. They expired in February 2023, after which washer prices decreased.

Suppliers in China are dropping prices to offset the tariff impact - this is what I see in my direct industry and also in many adjacent ones.  This is benefitting other countries that don't have Tariffs on Chinese goods since they can buy cheaper as well.  I suspect this is a significant factor in the GBP/EUR strengthening in relation to USD.  There was a point where there was such a pronounced impact to imported goods that the cost of shipping a container from China to US went from ~$3500 to <$1500 pre/post Tariff.Large manufacturers (automotive certainly, but also raw materials production and component production) are actually moving facilities to the US, which was one of the intended effects.US manufacturers are enjoying some price relief as landed costs of chinese-produced goods are increasing. Hard to quantify what this means but the frustrating part is that they are not reducing their prices just enjoying higher margins.Countries outside the Tariff zone are enjoying more trade - Canada is a very real example of this policy backfiring - they just walked back the Chinese Automotive Tariffs in exchange for relief on agricultural reciprocal tariffs.  Mexico is entering into similar agreements with non-US trade partners. Some products are releasing in non-US markets first and at lower costs than they are in the US.US-sourced chipmaking is accelerating - Intel's new fabs are probably the most prominent example of this (albeit they are slow to pick up volume - I expect this will shift with TSMC rationing production to brands like Apple and Qualcomm).I think the increase in cost to consumers is painful and that the current Tariff rates are excessive + there is a lot of ""cheating"" where Chinese suppliers are declaring lower cost of goods on import to reduce the landed cost of Tariffed goods - there doesn't appear to be enough resources to police this policy fully.All in all an interesting economic experiment and it will certainly take years for any of these realities to have a measurable positive impact domestically.

Consumers are just buying from other sources (domestically or otherwise) or not buying because  it is no longer worth it.There are a lot of reasons why these tariff's are bad, but economically, it is not a bad thing for people not to buy things they do not need, or to buy them from a domestic producer. Consumer spending actually increased last year, and inflation is low.

As a Canadian, I now avoid American products and retailers as much as possible.  This isn't just political (Trump has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada).  This is about filthy lucre too.Anything manufactured in the U.S. with tariffed inputs (e.g. Steel, Aluminum, softwood) is more expensive now.  Foreign goods that merely pass through the U.S. on their way to Canada are not supposed to be tariffed, but many U.S. retailers simply don't do the paper work necessary to make that happen, no doubt because the Trump administration has made that paperwork so chaotic and difficult to do.The upside is that Americans aren't just paying for 95% of these tariffs, they're losing export business from the rest of the world too.  On top of this is the additional cost of unpredictability.  Is the U.S. about to slap additional tariff's on the EU because of Trump's Greenland ambitions?  If you're planning a project in Canada, you'd be wise to avoid any U.S. products that use EU inputs for the foreseeable future too.

Unfortunately (for sellers) tariff decrease trade volume so even if only 4% absorbed by a seller they have much bigger losses from sell volume decline.Economy is not a zero sum game - almost everyone looses from tariffs - consumers no longer can afford the same some things they did buy in the past because tariffs increased prices.  Sellers cannot decrease prices because in many cases it will make their business unprofitable but they still loose on the volume.

In Europe, prices show the price INCLUDING sales tax (VAT, typically 20%). What you see is what you pay at the register.In the US, prices show the price BEFORE sales tax (national average circa 7%). You pay 7% more at the register than what you saw.I wonder if we could update US pricing so that the tariff was collected at the cash register, just like sales tax is, so that people could see that they were the one paying the tax.yes, I see the obvious practical difficulties with this. It is a though experiment, nothing more.

As someone in India, this statement is incorrect. There are no consumer receipts in India that show the import duties (which is what tariffs are) as an amount or as a percentage. There are plenty of goods sold in India that are imported, duty paid, and the costs are passed on to the consumers (with no explicit mention of that in the invoice or receipt).You may be confusing these US tariffs with local taxes in India like GST. In the US, sales tax is shown in the consumer receipts (if or as applicable in the state, county, city, etc.).In India and in the US, import duties are not shown in consumer receipts, except in the case where an individual is importing something and is liable to pay the duties and levies directly. Indians would probably revolt if they actually knew how much customs duty they're paying for all the goods they buy individually.

Most directly, when foreign products become more expensive, people may choose a local product that was previously seen as too expensive.  So it generally has a negative effect on the foreign economy and boosts local production.Unfortunately, it also drives the foreign companies to become more efficient so they can get their prices back down, while giving the local producers a crutch to justify higher prices and stagnate.And there are other side effects, and all of the side-effects have side effects of their own.  Economies are complicated.

First of all, the summary of the article (I did not read the article) clearly states that foreign exporters did not eat the tariffs, instead they held their prices, American consumers paid for the tariffs, and that trade volumes collapsed.""trade volumes collapsed"" - so, Americans did not buy foreign goods that they did not need/want at those prices, or found an alternative (presumably American) product to substitute. American consumer spending increased in 2025 and inflation settled down to a reasonable level. It seems that consumption shifted to domestic products.That does not appear to be a good outcome, economically.
.
Second, tariff's are a tax. No sh-t. But so are VAT taxes, which are very high throughout many countries, and no one seems to believe they are the downfall of these countries. You can argue which is ""better"" or ""fairer"", but from the consumer point of view, VAT makes everything more expensive and tariffs make only foreign goods more expensive. You can say that VAT forces everyone, foreign and domestic to compete and be more efficient, while tariffs penalize foreign production and rewards domestic production, even if some domestic production is less efficient. But both are taxes, and at least the American consumer can choose whether or not to pay that tax.While I disagree with tariffs, and especially disagree with how they are being wielded, the economic effect that they have had on Americans in 2025 is to shift away from foreign imports, buy more domestic products, and they have not increased inflation. Neither did the tariffs on Tr-mps first term on China.If a 20% VAT was instituted, I would think that that would have had a much larger ""tax"" effect, and would have taken away peoples choice on whether or not to pay that tax. Yet, the VAT would be considered ""good"".I think the biggest issue here is the serious negative impact on our relationships with our allies.

Unlike Trump's first term, his cabinet and agency heads are little more than loyalists and yes men. Checks and balances are gone. Independent thinking is gone. The president has long been an incompetent racist and malignant narcissist and the country (and world — for now) are suffering as he unleashes whatever cruel, imbecilic impulses that cross his mind. Add to that the fact that he's quite clearly unwell.

I thought what they'd do is push for a national sales tax (which would be regressive) with the promise of repealing the income tax, but when it came to the last part they'd just kind of conveniently forget about that and we'd end up with a huge national sales tax on top of existing income tax.But this works too.

But here's the hard truth: the US has needed to raise taxes for decades given its inability to reduce spending.Hence they massively inflating runaway deficit. If this is the only way Americans will accept tax increases, and they aren't willing to decrease spending, then this policy will ironically end up being the only way forward to climb out of the financial hole.

There's an argument that domestically produced goods would substitute for imported goods leaving the market, but markets are so global and intertwined now that even domestic goods have imported inputs that are also affected by tariffs, and  there often are no domestic goods or not enough domestic goods produced to act as a price-competitive substitute, and companies are not going to invest a ton of money into expanding domestic capacity, when tariffs are imposed on the whim of a lunatic and will probably be eventually tossed out by the supreme court or congress.

Go actually read the pdf.  Their methodology conflates any and all price increases of foreign goods as being a burden bore upon Americans.

It (I would argue intentionally) does not control for that at all.Pure propaganda from a foreign think tank to convince you to go back to policies where American exports got taxed, but theirs did not.

Otherwise ""broad"" producer price index down primarily due to coal prices getting creamed by renewables, also cheap RU gas. When fossil/input prices drop, PRC PPI always drops. Industrial profit index for manufacturing sectors up 5-10%. Note broad industrial profit index down because it heavily weights state owned / SEO fossil sectors (aforementioned coal+oil dropped by 20-40%). Decompose industrial profits and story is PRC manufactures getting cheap energy and cheap inputs while growing profits more than they lower prices, aka why PRC winning trade game in the first place.

With the proliferation of cheap and available solar energy the trade with US can halt, endure the pain of restructuring came out of the other side with using the produced goods domestically instead of sending them to US and replace the US services with domestic ones.

Also, reduced competition from China does not imply higher wages unless labor has bargaining power and firms pass gains to workers. Historically it has been passed to shareholders not workers.Finally, tariffs mainly protect manufacturing jobs. AI threatens white-collar and service work

This is the conclusion of the saga between the author's guild v. google. It goes through a lot of factors, but in the end the conclusion is this:> In sum, we conclude that: (1) Google's unauthorized digitizing of copyright-protected works, creation of a search functionality, and display of snippets from those works are non-infringing fair uses. The purpose of the copying is highly transformative, the public display of text is limited, and the revelations do not provide a significant market substitute for the protected aspects of the originals. Google's commercial nature and profit motivation do not justify denial of fair use. (2) Google's provision of digitized copies to the libraries that supplied the books, on the understanding that the libraries will use the copies in a manner consistent with the copyright law, also does not constitute infringement. Nor, on this record, is Google a contributory infringer.

Yes but not generating illegal output. These models were trained with intent to generate legal output. The fact that it can generate illegal output is a side effect. That's my point.If you use AI to generate illegal output, that act is illegal. If you use AI to generate legal output that act is not illegal. Thus the point of output is where the legal question lies. From inception up to training there is clear legal precedence for the existence of AI models.

It sounds then like you're saying that scale does indeed matter in this context, as using every single piece of writing in existence isn't being slurped up purely to learn, it's being slurped up to make a profit.Do you think they'd be able to offer a usefull LLM if the model was trained only what what an average person could read in a lifetime?

Scale is only used for emergence, openAI found that training transformers on the entire internet would make is more then just a next token predictor and that is the intent everyone is going for when building these things.

I assume you're expecting that they'll reach out and cut a deal with each publishing house separately, and then those publishing houses will have to somehow transfer their data over to NVIDIA. But that's a very custom set of discussions and deals that have to be struck.I think they're going to the pirate libraries because the product they want doesn't exist.

And yeah, you're most likely right about the first, and the contract writers have with Amazon most certainly anticipates this, and includes both uses in their contract. But! Never published on Amazon, so don't know, but I'm guessing they already have the rights for doing so with what people been uploading these last few years.

One or two books is fair use. Every single book published is not.

So it's understandable that Iodine-129 could be detected as a result of decades-old testing or other releases.

This doesn't indicate that there has been a recent undisclosed accident or other newsworthy event as you might be imagining.

However the fact that only iodine was detected is to be expected, as the other radioactive products of nuclear fission are much less likely to form chemical compounds that are soluble in sea water, so they could be somewhere on the sea bottom.

Recently there has been a big push into geospatial foundation models (e.g. Google AlphaEarth, IBM Terramind, Clay).These take in vast amounts of satellite data and with the usual Autoencoder architecture try and build embedding spaces which contain meaningful semantic features.The issue at the moment is that in the benchmark suites (https://github.com/VMarsocci/pangaea-bench), only a few of these foundation models have recently started to surpass the basic U-Net in some of the tasks.There's also an observation by one of the authors of the Major-TOM model, which also provides satellite input data to train models, that the scale rule does not seem to hold for geospatial foundation models, in that more data does not seem to result in better models.My (completely unsupported) theory on why that is, is that unlike writing or coding, in satellite data you are often looking for the needle in the haystack. You do not want what has been done thousands of times before and was proven to work. Segmenting out forests and water? Sure, easy. These models have seen millions of examples of forests and water. But most often we are interested in things that are much, much rarer. Flooding, Wildfire, Earthquakes, Landslides, Destroyed buildings, new Airstrips in the Amazon, etc. etc.. But as I see it, the currently used frameworks do not support that very well.But I'd be curious how others see this, who might be more knowledgeable in the area.

I think the biggest opportunity is building a knowledge graph based on Wikipedia and then checking against the graph when new edits are made. Detect any new assertions in the edit, check for conflicts against the graph, and bring up a warning along with a link to all the pages on Wikipedia that the new edit is contradicting. If the new edit is bad, it shows the editor why with citations, and if the new edit is correcting something that Wikipedia currently gets incorrect, then it shows all the other places that also need to be corrected.https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1eqohpm/if_some...

A major flaw of Wikipedia is that much of it is simply poorly written. Repetition and redundancy, ambiguity, illogical ordering of content, rambling sentences, opaque grammar. That should not be surprising. Writing clear prose is a skill that most people do not have, and Wikipedia articles are generally the fruit of collaboration without copy editors.AI is perfectly suited to fixing this problem. I recently spent several hours rewriting a somewhat important article. I did not add or subtract information from the article, I simply made it clearer and more concise. I came away convinced that AI could have done as good a job - with supervision, of course - in a fraction of the time. AI-assisted copy-editing is not against Wikipedia rules. Yet as things stand, there are no built-in tools to facilitate it, doubtless because of the ambient suspicion of AI as a technology. We need to take a smarter approach.

No, referencing and discussing it properly whilst retaining the tone and inferred meaning are equally as important. I can cite anything as a source that I want, but if I use it incorrectly or my analysis misses the point of the source then the reference source itself is pointless.

It's not inherently bad, but if something was written with AI the chances that it is low effort crap are much much much higher than if someone actually spent time and effort on it.

How did the two directors of the German digital rights nonprofit HateAid become targets of the Trump administration? Here's how they're continuing their mission.

It was early evening in Berlin, just a day before Christmas Eve, when Josephine Ballon got an unexpected email from US Customs and Border Protection. The status of her ability to travel to the United States had changed—she'd no longer be able to enter the country. 

At first, she couldn't find any information online as to why, though she had her suspicions. She was one of the directors of HateAid, a small German nonprofit founded to support the victims of online harassment and violence. As the organization has become a strong advocate of EU tech regulations, it has increasingly found itself attacked in campaigns from right-wing politicians and provocateurs who claim that it engages in censorship. 

It was only later that she saw what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had posted on X:

For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.Today, @StateDept will take steps toâ€¦

Rubio was promoting a conspiracy theory about what he has called the “censorship-industrial complex,” which alleges widespread collusion between the US government, tech companies, and civil society organizations to silence conservative voices—the very conspiracy theory HateAid has recently been caught up in. 

Then Undersecretary of State Sarah B. Rogers posted on X the names of the people targeted by travel bans. The list included Ballon, as well as her HateAid co-director, Anna Lena von Hodenberg. Also named were three others doing similar or related work: former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who had helped author Europe's Digital Services Act (DSA); Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which documents hate speech on social media platforms; and Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, which provides risk ratings warning advertisers about placing ads on websites promoting hate speech and disinformation. 

It was an escalation in the Trump administration's war on digital rights—fought in the name of free speech. But EU officials, freedom of speech experts, and the five people targeted all flatly reject the accusations of censorship. Ballon, von Hodenberg, and some of their clients tell me that their work is fundamentally about making people feel safer online. And their experiences over the past few weeks show just how politicized and besieged their work in online safety has become. They almost certainly won't be the last people targeted in this way. 

Ballon was the one to tell von Hodenberg that both their names were on the list. “We kind of felt a chill in our bones,” von Hodenberg told me when I caught up with the pair in early January. 

But she added that they also quickly realized, “Okay, it's the old playbook to silence us.” So they got to work—starting with challenging the narrative the US government was pushing about them.

Within a few hours, Ballon and von Hodenberg had issued a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations: “We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they wrote. “We demand a clear signal from the German government and the European Commission that this is unacceptable. Otherwise, no civil society organisation, no politician, no researcher, and certainly no individual will dare to denounce abuses by US tech companies in the future.” 

Those signals came swiftly. On X, Johann Wadephul, the German foreign minister, called the entry bans “not acceptable,” adding that “the DSA was democratically adopted by the EU, for the EU—it does not have extraterritorial effect.” Also on X, French president Emmanuel Macron wrote that “these measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.” The European Commission issued a statement that it “strongly condemns” the Trump administration's actions and reaffirmed its “sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values.” 

Ahmed, Melford, Breton, and their respective organizations also made their own statements denouncing the entry bans. Ahmed, the only one of the five based in the United States, also successfully filed suit to preempt any attempts to detain him, which the State Department had indicated it would consider doing.  

But alongside the statements of solidarity, Ballon and von Hodenberg said, they also received more practical advice: Assume the travel ban was just the start and that more consequences could be coming. Service providers might preemptively revoke access to their online accounts; banks might restrict their access to money or the global payment system; they might see malicious attempts to get hold of their personal data or that of their clients. Perhaps, allies told them, they should even consider moving their money into friends' accounts or keeping cash on hand so that they could pay their team's salaries—and buy their families' groceries. 

These warnings felt particularly urgent given that just days before, the Trump administration had sanctioned two International Criminal Court judges for “illegitimate targeting of Israel.” As a result, they had lost access to many American tech platforms, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Gmail. 

“If Microsoft does that to someone who is a lot more important than we are,” Ballon told me, “they will not even blink to shut down the email accounts from some random human rights organization in Germany.”   

“We have now this dark cloud over us that any minute, something can happen,” von Hodenberg added. “We're running against time to take the appropriate measures.”

Founded in 2018 to support people experiencing digital violence, HateAid has since evolved to defend digital rights more broadly. It provides ways for people to report illegal online content and offers victims advice, digital security, emotional support, and help with evidence preservation. It also educates German police, prosecutors, and politicians about how to handle online hate crimes. 

Once the group is contacted for help, and if its lawyers determine that the type of harassment has likely violated the law, the organization connects victims with legal counsel who can help them file civil and criminal lawsuits against perpetrators, and if necessary, helps finance the cases. (HateAid itself does not file cases against individuals.) Ballon and von Hodenberg estimate that HateAid has worked with around 7,500 victims and helped them file 700 criminal cases and 300 civil cases, mostly against individual offenders.

For 23-year-old German law student and outspoken political activist Theresia Crone, HateAid's support has meant that she has been able to regain some sense of agency in her life, both on and offline. She had reached out after she discovered entire online forums dedicated to making deepfakes of her. Without HateAid, she told me, “I would have had to either put my faith into the police and the public prosecutor to prosecute this properly, or I would have had to foot the bill of an attorney myself”—a huge financial burden for “a student with basically no fixed income.” 

In addition, working alone would have been retraumatizing: “I would have had to document everything by myself,” she said—meaning “I would have had to see all of these pictures again and again.” 

“The internet is a lawless place,” Ballon told me when we first spoke, back in mid-December, a few weeks before the travel ban was announced. In a conference room at the HateAid office in Berlin, she said there are many cases that “cannot even be prosecuted, because no perpetrator is identified.” That's why the nonprofit also advocates for better laws and regulations governing technology companies in Germany and across the European Union. 

On occasion, they have also engaged in strategic litigation against the platforms themselves. In 2023, for example, HateAid and the European Union of Jewish Students sued X for failing to enforce its terms of service against posts that were antisemitic or that denied the Holocaust, which is illegal in Germany. 

This almost certainly put the organization in the crosshairs of X owner Elon Musk; it also made HateAid a frequent target of Germany's far right party, the Alternative für Deutschland, which Musk has called “the only hope for Germany.” (X did not respond to a request to comment on this lawsuit.)

For better and worse, HateAid's profile grew further when it took on another critical job in online safety. In June 2024, it was named as a trusted flagger organization under the Digital Services Act, a 2022 EU law that requires social media companies to remove certain content (including hate speech and violence) that violates national laws, and to provide more transparency to the public, in part by allowing more appeals on platforms' moderation decisions. 

Trusted flaggers are entities designated by individual EU countries to point out illegal content, and they are a key part of DSA enforcement. While anyone can report such content, trusted flaggers' reports are prioritized and legally require a response from the platforms. 

The Trump administration has loudly argued that the trusted flagger program and the DSA more broadly are examples of censorship that disproportionately affect voices on the right and American technology companies, like X. 

When we first spoke in December, Ballon said these claims of censorship simply don't hold water: “We don't delete content, and we also don't, like, flag content publicly for everyone to see and to shame people. The only thing that we do: We use the same notification channels that everyone can use, and the only thing that is in the Digital Services Act is that platforms should prioritize our reporting.” Then it is on the platforms to decide what to do. 

Nevertheless, the idea that HateAid and like-minded organizations are censoring the right has become a powerful conspiracy theory with real-world consequences. (Last year, MIT Technology Review covered the closure of a small State Department office following allegations that it had conducted “censorship,” as well as an unusual attempt by State leadership to access internal records related to supposed censorship—including information about two of the people who have now been banned, Medford and Ahmed, and both of their organizations.) 

HateAid saw a fresh wave of harassment starting last February, when 60 Minutes aired a documentary on hate speech laws in Germany; it featured a quote from Ballon that “free speech needs boundaries,” which, she added, “are part of our constitution.” The interview happened to air just days before Vice President JD Vance attended the Munich Security Conference; there he warned that “across Europe, free speech … is in retreat.” This, Ballon told me, led to heightened hostility toward her and her organization. 

Fast-forward to July, when a report by Republicans in the US House of Representatives claimed that the DSA “compels censorship and infringes on American free speech.” HateAid was explicitly named in the report. 

All of this has made its work “more dangerous,” Ballon told me in December. Before the 60 Minutes interview, “maybe one and a half years ago, as an organization, there were attacks against us, but mostly against our clients, because they were the activists, the journalists, the politicians at the forefront. But now … we see them becoming more personal.” 

As a result, over the last year, HateAid has taken more steps to protect its reputation and get ahead of the damaging narratives. Ballon has reported the hate speech targeted at her—“More [complaints] than in all the years I did this job before,” she said—as well as defamation lawsuits on behalf of HateAid. 

All these tensions finally came to a head in December. At the start of the month, the European Commission fined X $140 million for DSA violations. This set off yet another round of recriminations about supposed censorship of the right, with Trump calling the fine “a nasty one” and warning: “Europe has to be very careful.”

Just a few weeks later, the day before Christmas Eve, retaliation against individuals finally arrived. 

Digital rights groups are pushing back against the Trump administration's narrow view of what constitutes free speech and censorship.

“What we see from this administration is a conception of freedom of expression that is not a human-rights-based conception where this is an inalienable, indelible right that's held by every person,” says David Greene, the civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US-based digital rights group. Rather, he sees an “expectation that… [if] anybody else's speech is challenged, there's a good reason for it, but it should never happen to them.” 

Since Trump won his second term, social media platforms have walked back their commitments to trust and safety. Meta, for example, ended fact-checking on Facebook and adopted much of the administration's censorship language, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling the podcaster Joe Rogan that it would “work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” if they are seen as “going after American companies and pushing to censor more.”

And as the recent fines on X show, Musk's platform has gone even further in flouting European law—and, ultimately, ignoring the user rights that the DSA was written to protect. In perhaps one of the most egregious examples yet, in recent weeks X allowed people to use Grok, its AI generator, to create nonconsensual nude images of women and children, with few limits—and, so far at least, few consequences. (Last week, X released a statement that it would start limiting users' ability to create explicit images with Grok; in response to a number of questions, X representative Rosemarie Esposito pointed me to that statement.) 

For Ballon, it makes perfect sense: “You can better make money if you don't have to implement safety measures and don't have to invest money in making your platform the safest place,” she told me.

“It goes both ways,” von Hodenberg added. “It's not only the platforms who profit from the US administration undermining European laws … but also, obviously, the US administration also has a huge interest in not regulating the platforms … because who is amplified right now? It's the extreme right.”

She believes this explains why HateAid—and Ahmed's Center for Countering Digital Hate and Melford's Global Disinformation Index, as well as Breton and the DSA—have been targeted: They are working to disrupt this “unholy deal where the platforms profit economically and the US administration is profiting in dividing the European Union,” she said. 

The travel restrictions intentionally send a strong message to all groups that work to hold tech companies accountable. “It's purely vindictive,” Greene says. “It's designed to punish people from pursuing further work on disinformation or anti-hate work.” (The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.)

And ultimately, this has a broad effect on who feels safe enough to participate online. 

Ballon pointed to research that shows the “silencing effect” of harassment and hate speech, not only for “those who have been attacked,” but also for those who witness such attacks. This is particularly true for women, who tend to face more online hate that is also more sexualized and violent. It'll only be worse if groups like HateAid get deplatformed or lose funding. 

Von Hodenberg put it more bluntly: “They reclaim freedom of speech for themselves when they want to say whatever they want, but they silence and censor the ones that criticize them.”

Still, the HateAid directors insist they're not backing down. They say they're taking “all advice” they have received seriously, especially with regard to “becoming more independent from service providers,” Ballon told me.

“Part of the reason that they don't like us is because we are strengthening our clients and empowering them,” said von Hodenberg. “We are making sure that they are not succeeding, and not withdrawing from the public debate.” 

“So when they think they can silence us by attacking us? That is just a very wrong perception.”

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged a Venezuelan national, 59-year old Jorge Figueira, with laundering around $1 billion of illicit funds on behalf of criminals. Figueira is alleged to have used multiple bank accounts, crypto exchange accounts, crypto wallets, and shell companies to conduct his money laundering operation.

“The FBI has identified approximately a billion dollars' worth of cryptocurrency that was passed through crypto wallets utilized by Figueira and his laundering operation to individuals and businesses throughout the world,” said FBI Special Agent Reid Davis according to a DOJ press release.

Court documents say Figueira mainly conducted his crypto activities in the stablecoin issued by Tether, known as USDT, on the Tron blockchain. A recent report released by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis found that stablecoins are becoming increasingly used in illicit crypto transactions, now accounting for 84% of such transactions after only amounting to roughly 12% of that activity in 2020. The report also indicated last year's record year of $154 billion in illicit crypto transfers was mostly due to use by nation states, such as Iran and Venezuela, to avoid sanctions.

According to a report in DL News, Figueira is quoted touting the benefits of using USDT for money laundering on a phone call cited in court documents. “Let me be clear with you, [USDT] is used a lot for laundering money,” Figueira is quoted as saying.

Notably, Tron is also the crypto network founded by Justin Sun, who is at the heart of pay-to-play allegations made by House Democrats against the SEC due to Sun's involvement with multiple crypto projects linked to President Trump. Tron is generally viewed as a more centralized little brother to Ethereum; however, it is widely used for USDT transfers due to offering faster and cheaper transactions.

In addition to the $1 billion in illicit crypto processing identified by the DOJ, court documents indicate Figueira was also bragging about processing up to $700 million worth of illicit funds on a monthly basis. The Venezuelan man faces a maximum of 20 years in prison related to the charges.

The heavy use of crypto in Venezuela by both the regime and its citizens is well-documented. Roughly a week ago, Tether froze $182 million worth of USDT around the same time a detailed report on Venezuela's use of the stablecoin to avoid economic sanctions was released in The Wall Street Journal.

Crypto can be a double-edged sword for authoritarian regimes, as another recent report pointed to the massive increase in withdrawals from centralized crypto exchanges to the non-custodial Bitcoin network in Iran are a sign people are opting out of the traditional financial system in an effort to avoid the devaluation of the Iranian rial and potential capital controls amid nationwide protests. In other words, authoritarian regimes use crypto to avoid restrictions imposed by other nations (namely the United States), and the people living under those regimes use crypto to avoid restrictions imposed locally on them.

The crypto industry has become increasingly centralized around stablecoins like USDT, despite their growing use for illicit purposes. The GENIUS Act created a regulatory structure for these dollar-pegged tokens in the United States last year, and the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial has its own stablecoin, USD1, which is at the center of another pay-for-play allegation associated with the pardon of the former CEO of crypto exchange Binance.

Everyone from large tech giants to traditional banks are now interested in launching stablecoins, but whether they'll be allowed to move around freely despite continued criminal use remains to be seen. Then again, legal action like that taken against Figueira indicates there are plenty of eyes tracking the movement of stablecoins on the blockchain anyway, and Tether has made it clear that it's actively working with many law enforcement agencies around the world on a regular basis to guard against criminal activity.

If you haven't checked your Facebook account in a while, fear not, the spam accounts are still doing very well. Now with eerie and ever-advancing AI slop in their arsenal—and, lately, football fans to prey on.

There's a group of accounts on Facebook that claims to be a bunch of fan accounts for various National Football League teams. But a quick scroll through these pages, each sporting a couple thousand followers, reveals misinformation paired with a series of seemingly AI-generated photos. Based on the comment sections of these photos and the amount of likes some of them get, people are fully believing what they post.

“After His Desire To Return To The Steelers Was Not Fulfilled, Instead Of Reacting With Anger Or Resentment, The Former Player Chose To Retire And Join The Pittsburgh Police Department To “Wear Pittsburgh Colors Once Again.” a Pittsburgh Steelers fan account with 11,000 followers claimed in a post earlier this week. The post does not mention the name of the so-called player but is accompanied by a seemingly AI-generated image of former football wide receiver Adam Thielen in police uniform. Thielen recently announced his retirement, and briefly played for the Steelers late last year. He has not shared any plans to join Pittsburgh law enforcement.

Another such account, a Denver Broncos fan account with more than 6,000 followers called “Wild Horse Warriors,” found a victim not in a player, but in Broncos reporter Cody Roark. A post with an AI-generated image of Roark holding a child claimed that he had passed away following a domestic violence incident and left behind a 5-year-old child. Not only was Roark alive and well, he doesn't even have kids to begin with.

“Usually you see that happen to, like, high-profile celebrities,” Roark told The Denver Post. “For that to happen to me was just really weird.”

The account was just created in November and has now been shut down by Meta after The Denver Post reached out for comment. In its two-month existence, the account reportedly disseminated a slew of misinformation posts about Broncos players as well, including a false claim that wide receiver Courtland Sutton refused to wear an LGBTQ+ solidarity armband during a game. But even though “Wild Horse Warriors” is now a thing of the past, similar accounts continue to proliferate on Facebook. One such account, called “Broncos Stampede Crew,” made the same LGBTQ+ armband claim about Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. The phone number attached to that account appears to be based in Vietnam.

What do these accounts have to gain from fake AI-generated news about football players? While it's not certain how these specific accounts operate, the pattern seems to fit what has long been utilized by Facebook spam accounts. Each post by these fake fan accounts links out to an article from a website that pretends to be a reputable news organization like “ESPNS” or “NCC News.”

“Spam Pages largely leveraged the attention they obtained from viewers to drive them to off-Facebook domains, likely in an effort to garner ad revenue,” Harvard researchers wrote in a study from 2024. These websites are usually “heavily ad-laden content farm domains—some of which themselves appeared to consist of primarily AI-composed text.”

Other pages could be trying to accumulate an audience and good standing with the algorithm by using these fake shock-value clickbait news stories first, before completely changing the purpose of the page.

“It could be that these were nefarious pages that were trying to build an audience and would later pivot to trying to sell goods or link to ad-laden websites or maybe even change their topics to something political altogether,” Georgetown researcher Josh Goldstein told NPR in a 2024 interview about AI spam accounts on Facebook.

It's a bad day for both PlayStation Network trophy hunters and fans of inanimate objects with an inexplicable penchant for jumping. Sony appears to have removed the entire catalog of games published by ThiGames, a German company whose output was known primarily for its popularity with gamers looking to flaunt their 100% completion of as many titles as possible.

Nuking ThiGames' catalog meant removing a lot of games. The sudden disappearance of the company from Sony's online store was first noted by Twitch streamer Rob Thanatos, who accompanied his report with a screenshot, apparently from the site TrueTrophies.com, that suggested the publisher had a scarcely believable 1194 PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 for sale. The next day, the site Delisted Games—which catalogs games that are, for whatever reason, no longer available to purchase—goes into more detail about this number, noting that it counts various translations and regional variations as individual titles; when this multiple counting is removed, the number shrinks to a more sensible 150 or so.

In any case, the games in ThiGames' catalog seem to have shared one thing in common: they're what's referred to as “shovelware,” the metaphor being that they are shoveled out the studio's door with no regard for quality. (And in 2026, the advent of vibe coding and AI-generated assets no doubt makes wielding the shovel easier than ever.)

While games like The Jumping Bonbon, The Jumping Strawberry, and The Jumping Onion Ring have a certain outsider-y charm to them, any popularity they enjoyed with PSN subscribers appears to have been largely because they make it easy to earn Platinum Trophies, which are awarded for obtaining all of a game's individual trophies. (For those without a PlayStation, trophies are similar to achievements on other platforms—you obtain them for completing certain objectives within a given game.)

The obvious conclusion here is that Sony decided that it didn't want its store filled with… well, let's say “games of low quality.” Some commentators are describing the removal of these games as a long-overdue exercise in house cleaning and celebrating the fact that their visits to the PlayStation store will involve less time slogging through titles about jumping thingamajigs in search of real games to play.

But ThiGames aren't the only company to cash in on gamers' thirst for trophies; there are many others whose entire output is predicated on the desire for bragging rights. In addition, several users on Twitter have pointed out that it's not clear whether Sony would have the right to just unilaterally ban a publisher's entire catalog based on a decision that those games kinda sucked. This has led to speculation that the publisher must have done something more egregious than just flooding the PlayStation store with unabashed slop.

Neither party immediately responded to a request for comment. We'll update this post when we receive a reply.

HBO's newest George R.R. Martin adaptation takes place in the same world as House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones, but in a different time period—we're long past the Dance of the Dragons, but also long before Daenerys Targaryen returned to Westeros and started clawing her power back.

But don't let the lack of familiar characters turn you away: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms introduces new faces you'll quickly grow to love, loathe, or feel both ways about depending on their unpredictable actions. It also explores Westeros from the point of view of a hedge knight as tall as he is humble.



We open on a grim scene: on a hillside in the driving rain, a very tall man—alone aside from his three horses—digs a grave and lowers the body of a much older man into it. This is Dunk (Peter Claffey) tending to his master, Ser Arlen of Pennytree (Danny Webb), whose passing sets the events of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms in motion.

After many years as a squire, Dunk is ready to figure out the rest of his life; he's not sure what lies ahead. All he knows is what he's been taught by Ser Arlen—the rough life of a hedge knight—mixed with the grit and tenacity baked into him during his early childhood in Flea Bottom, the most perilous part of King's Landing.

First, though, there's a makeshift funeral that must happen. Not knowing what to say, Dunk must improvise: “You were a true knight. You never beat me when I didn't deserve it… except that time in Maidenpool.”

This odd assessment of Ser Arlen's good judgment is accompanied by rapid-fire flashbacks of Dunk at various ages being smacked on many occasions. It's a quick sequence, but it shows us Dunk's resilience and commitment to honesty and truth. It also begins to give us an idea of his relationship with Ser Arlen, a mentor he misses despite all the knocks. “I wish you didn't die, Ser,” he says tearfully, and promises to look after the horses.

He also keeps Ser Arlen's sword, and that's what helps him decide his next move. “There is a tourney at Ashford Meadow,” he says wistfully.

Here, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms does what you'd expect a Game of Thrones show to do: it starts playing that unmistakable Game of Thrones theme music. Dunk looks purposeful. Determined. His hero's journey is taking shape. But then, just as the music begins to swell louder, we cut to Dunk… pooping behind a tree. Like, projectile pooping. Thinking about the life-or-death stakes involved in entering a tournament has, unsurprisingly, made his stomach lurch. But it doesn't deter him: next stop, Ashford.

The title appears onscreen without an opening credits sequence. This isn't the Westeros you're used to seeing on HBO; A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is far more simple and stripped-down. But as we'll come to see, despite its (sometimes crass) sense of humor, it can also be just as brutal as Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon.

It's now dark, and Dunk and his horses approach a country inn. A small boy with a gleaming bald head appears. We know, of course, that this is Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell)—and if you know who Egg is beyond that, HBO would like you to keep that to yourself for now. Ahem. Anyway, the first meeting of this soon-to-be duo is a case of mistaken identity on many levels. Dunk assumes the kid is a stableboy, albeit one with an attitude problem. (For those who've read Martin's source novella, here's where we get our first of many “clout in the ear” threats Dunk makes, but never carries out, across the series.)

Dunk heads into the inn to deal with his hunger. The proprietor explains most folks in the area have headed to Ashford to watch the tourney. She doesn't get it, she says: “Knights are built the same as other men, and I never knew a joust to change the price of eggs.”

The only other customer in the inn is a man passed out drunk—at least, until he pops his head up, blearily stares at Dunk, brandishes a knife, and blurts out, “I dreamed of you. Stay the fuck away from me, you hear?”

A perplexed Dunk watches as the man slaps down a coin bearing a three-headed dragon sigil (hmm, looks familiar) and stumbles out. It's an unsettling encounter and the weirdness increases when Dunk heads back to the stable and finds the bald kid goofing around with his armor and his best horse.

Initially apologetic, the little boy soon turns saucy, sniffing that Dunk sure doesn't look like a knight. Then he has the temerity to beg Dunk to take him to the tourney. A knight needs a squire, after all! Dunk's annoyance softens when he finds out the kid is motherless. This is familiar to Dunk, who grew up an orphan. But he still turns down the offer to take on a pint-sized assistant.

The next morning, we see Dunk riding into Ashford Meadow. A bustling camp has sprung up around the tourney grounds—Dunk pauses to take in the jousting ring—with a modest-sized castle perched on the hill above. Intent on entering the lists, he's directed to the games master, thwacking his head on the door frame as he enters.

The awkwardness continues. The steward of Ashford (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor)—an oily-looking man who pauses to dramatically hock up phlegm while they're talking—gives him a hard time about not looking like a knight, even after Dunk tells him the very earnest story about Ser Arlen knighting him just before he died.

The steward doubts his story—as do we, to be honest—but he pulls the gullible Dunk's leg by describing how Ashford town will torture anyone who pretends to be a knight.

Dunk grows weary of this humiliation. But the games master shows a shred of kindness as Dunk turns to leave. If Dunk can find “a true knight” to vouch for Ser Arlen, and by extension speak to Dunk's good honor, he'll allow him to enter—though he reminds Dunk that anyone who loses in the tourney forfeits their arms, armor, and horse to the victor, and must ransom them back. It's a reality check for Dunk, who has no money for ransom, and he bashes his head again on the same doorframe as he leaves the room.

Intent on finding a knight to support his entry, he heads to the pavilion of Ser Manfred Dondarrian (Daniel Monks), hoping he'll remember Ser Arlen. But Ser Manfred is napping, and Dunk draws some snarky attention from the ladies of the night who're hanging around the tent. “It's a hedge knight, aint it?” one says to the other, and explains, “It's like a knight, but sadder.”

As he walks away, vowing to track down Ser Manfred later, he mutters to his horse about being called “sad.” And anyway, “Ser Arlen always said a hedge knight was the truest kind of knight.” As we'll continue to see, Dunk's chats with his horses—and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' fondness for flashbacks—helps get around the fact that Martin's stories are written as Dunk's internal monologues, without resorting to voiceover.

Dunk's grumbling is interrupted when he sees two men practicing their combat skills in the practice ring. This is Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley) and his younger cousin, Raymun (Shaun Thomas), who's his squire and recreational punching bag. Ser Steffon is very blustery and aggressive, challenging Dunk to fight him next, but Dunk turns him down.

What he really needs is some peace and quiet. He finds it in the nearby forest, where Dunk gets a chance to clean up a bit (you can check “bare butt” off your Game of Thrones bingo card) before venturing back for another crack at Ser Manfred. No dice: he's still asleep, and the snarky ladies take another crack at Dunk.

“Must you mock me? I was only asking for a bit of help,” he complains.

They're sorry, sort of, but there'll be no talking to Ser Marfred tonight. Dunk wanders off into the camp, finding a puppet show in progress.

“Fate has set his lonely path through corridors of chance,” we hear from the stage. “A boy from nothing risks it all, ignoring looks askance.”

The story—which certainly has a double meaning in this context—continues as Dunk draws closer, as an actor playing a knight faces a wonderfully elaborate dragon puppet onstage. It breathes fire and the crowd gasps, but Dunk is more taken with the pretty young woman narrating the performance. As he's walking away, he hears someone call out “Half-man!”

A little Tyrion Lannister callback for Game of Thrones fans, but in this case it's the scrappy Raymun Fossosay making a joke, because Dunk is obviously “half-man, half-giant.” Raymun asks Dunk if he's hungry. “Always,” he admits. He follows Raymun into a tent decorated with antlers: this is Baratheon territory. Here's where we first spy Ser Lyonel Baratheon, “the Laughing Storm,” a charismatic, drunken maniac wearing a crown festooned with more of those giant antlers. It's a colorful, bawdy gathering, and at some point, the Laughing Storm takes notice of the giant stranger in his midst.

Dunk is motioned over, and Ser Lyonel's opening line is an all-timer: “You ever been punched in the face before?” The encounter starts off light (Ser Lyonel chastizes him for slouching and tells him “Be tall”), but it gets more prickly—and Dunk is rightfully intimidated as hell by this wealthy, powerful, eccentric lord who gives him a hard time for crashing his party. But then, the mood lightens again. “Do you like dancing?” Ser Lyonel asks.

Cut to the ridiculous sight of Dunk tearing up the dance floor with Ser Lyonel, who gets more wild-eyed and wasted as the night progresses. Eventually, they're huddled up at Lyonel's table, and Dunk earnestly confides his fears. Sure, he's big and strong, but he hasn't had the training most knights at this tourney have had. “What chance do I have?” he wonders.

“You have no chance,” Ser Lyonel chuckles. “But it's a great honor to test oneself against a worthy foe.”

Dunk points out that it's easy for a rich lord to say that. If Dunk loses, he'll be left with nothing. “What should I do?” he asks. Lyonel has no answer, and stumbles off, leaving Dunk to ponder his choices.

Just then, he spies the elusive Ser Manfred swanning out of the tent. Dunk seizes the moment, earnestly pleading his case. But it's all for nothing. Ser Manfred doesn't remember Ser Arlen and he doesn't care about Dunk entering the tournament. All that effort was for nothing, and Dunk is snootily dismissed.

Defeated, Dunk heads back to his camp to find… that pesky bald kid roasting fish over a cozy fire. He puts up a blustery front, but after the day he's had, the boy just about passes for a friendly face.

“What's your name?” the kid asks.

“Ser Duncan the Tall,” Dunk says, pulling himself up to his full height.

The kid sniffs that he's never heard of Ser Duncan the Tall, then reveals his own name is Egg. After a moment, Dunk reluctantly agrees he can serve him for the tourney.

The smile on Egg's face is everything as Dunk explains he doesn't have much, but he will always share. Plus: “I promise not to beat you, except when you deserve it.” When Egg calls him “M'lord,” he corrects him. “Ser. I'm only a hedge knight.” And there's a small smile on Dunk's face at that.

Lying on their bedrolls, the duo spots a shooting star. Egg says it's good luck, and also points out that they're probably the only ones to have seen it, since all the fancy knights are in their pavilions.

Dunk is still grumpy, and this takes a minute to sink in.

“So the luck is ours alone?” Dunk says, his voice full of genuine wonder, and we see that same smile on Egg's face.

The stage is set. The band of two is together. Will Dunk find someone to vouch for him so he can enter the lists?

Hytale hit Early Access last Tuesday with launch day player numbers of 2.8M, and became an instant Twitch No.1.

Modders have already showcased some stunning achievements in Hytale, the hot new sandbox RPG that hit Early Access last Tuesday. Our headline singles out engineer Sadat Sahib (AKA iamcxv7), who has managed to get Windows 95 to run inside the new game. The Hytale experience and extensive creator toolset have led to some pundits describing it as Minecraft 2.0.

COMMUNITY SHOWCASE: A community member ran Windows95 in Hytale! This was made by @iamcxv711 pic.twitter.com/mon88oDFnsJanuary 18, 2026

The above video shows Windows 95 seemingly running without any major hiccups. Interaction seems laborious, but we feel that's because of a joypad being used as a controller. If a PC mouse and keyboard could be used instead, we'd see greater potential.

Sahib's social media feed reveals that he's been busy doing more than just shoehorning Microsoft's legendary OS into this sandbox RPG. Earlier today, this pioneering Hytale modder managed the inception-worthy feat of running Hytale in Hytale…

Hytale in Hytale, we did it boys. #HytaleModding @Simon_Hypixel by @iamcxv711 pic.twitter.com/iNM93dQZ6mJanuary 18, 2026

The same modder has also managed to get Minecraft running in Hytale, delivering a fatal wound to its spiritual predecessor, perhaps.

What about Doom, we hear you ask? It seems like emulating Doom is such a pushover nowadays that a modder managed to get it to run inside this sandbox RPG even before it was released.

With all of these amazing modding achievements under its belt, within one week of Early Access launch, there are surely many great things to come.

Hytale is one of the hottest games of 2026, with obvious parallels between the sandbox RPG experience and Minecraft. It came about from efforts of the Hypixel Minecraft team, with roots stretching back to 2015. The development has been through some peaks and troughs, with the project even being cancelled in June 2025, but its subsequent revival by the original creator was clearly a canny move.

There is already a thriving Hytale modding community, and this is not by accident. Hytale has been built from the ground up for modding, with “creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.” That's in addition to the more traditional fun of “exploration, responsive combat, and robust building.” The game developer's modding strategy was outlined last November.

Hytale made an almighty splash when it entered Early Access last week. Reports say there were 2.8 million Hytale players on launch day, and 420,000+ Twitch viewers made it the global No.1 watched game, too. The aforementioned cancellation/revival drama helped kindle the hype on the way.

The Silicon Heartland is coming along nicely.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Back in 2022, Intel announced its Ohio One project, originally pitched as America's biggest fab complex at one point. Since then, plans have been scaled back, and the project has faced multiple delays amidst internal shakeups — but it was never abandoned. A few months ago, Intel confirmed that Ohio One is still alive and kicking after the company was probed by a U.S. Senator. Today, new job listings posted by the site's contractor hint toward the project finally picking up steam.

Intel Ohio One is back! Bechtel posts loads of new jobs over the last few days looking for managers, welders and electricians to work on the New Albany project. 14A is GO!https://t.co/IgjV07lfDK$INTC pic.twitter.com/UbAZZThbpsJanuary 18, 2026

Bechtel Group's Manufacturing and Technology unit, the construction firm responsible for building the Ohio One, has put up new recruitment offers on its website. At least eight of them directly mention New Albany, the city in Licking County serving as the location for Intel's ""Silicon Heartland."" Clicking on some of these listings reveals a project overview which says Bechtel is designing and building the first phase of Ohio One, spread across 2.5 million square feet, housing ""as much steel as eight Eiffel Towers"".

 




Ohio One will start with two fabs, Mod 1 and Mod 2, but the space can accommodate up to eight in the future. The current timeline indicates that these factories will be up and running by at least 2030-2031, which marks a significant delay from the admittedly generous 2025 estimates set at the time of the original announcement. Mod 1 will be ready for production first, with Mod 2 likely follow in a year. By that point, Intel might've already moved past even its next-gen 14A process.

Intel's latest Panther Lake lineup of mobile CPUs is built in the U.S. at its Arizona and Oregon facilities using the company's new 18A node, a major breakthrough for domestic chip manufacturing. But 18A doesn't have big external clients beyond the Blue Team's own needs, something that it desperately wants to change with 14A. Ever since his appointment, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been rather bearish about the node, but just a few days ago, the executive made a sharp reversal in his sentiments.

Ohio One had been long prophesied as the birthplace of 14A, but as things stand right now, that window has likely slipped since 14A is tipped to be production-ready by 2027. Its derivatives, like 14A-E, will have already become a large part of Intel's portfolio before Ohio One even opens its doors. That being said, the project was always intended as a leading-edge logic campus, so any new processes can be taped out in the future. We don't need to speculate that far ahead; let's stick with the present.

The White House released $8.9 billion worth of the remaining CHIPS Act funding to Intel in exchange for a 10% stake in the company last year. Add to that a budding Nvidia partnership worth $5 billion, and we see a revitalized Intel that finally seems competitive again (especially in its Foundry business), accelerating work on Ohio One after years of stagnation. Now, only time will tell exactly who will cut the ribbon at Mod 1 in a few years from now.

Among patients newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), higher work-related physical strain was linked to more severe joint inflammation at diagnosis in those positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), but not in those negative for these antibodies, and this link weakened after treatment began.

""While our findings suggest that mechanical strain may play a role in exacerbating joint inflammation in ACPA-positive RA, these do not imply that patients should stop working or change profession,"" the authors wrote.

""Occupational therapy is a potentially helpful treatment option for individual RA patients who experience difficulties with daily activities, including work,"" they added.

This study was led by Dennis A. Ton, MD, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands. It was published online on January 08, 2026, in Rheumatology.

The assessment of physical strain was based on job categories and did not capture differences at an individual level. Some patients may have moved from high- to low-strain jobs because of symptoms, causing potential misclassification. The findings mainly applied to younger working patients; effects in retired or unemployed patients were not assessed.

This study received funding from the Dutch Arthritis Foundation and the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Dr Rob Hicks

 January 19, 2026  

NHS England has given the green light for abiraterone to be used to treat men with prostate cancer that has not metastasised. 

It is the first time the drug will be available for these patients in England, bringing the country into line with Wales and Scotland, which approved the treatment in 2023. 

Around 2000 men diagnosed in the past 3 months with non-metastatic disease will be eligible if the drug is clinically appropriate, NHS England said. A further 7000 men a year are expected to be diagnosed with the same condition and will now be able to access the drug.

Prostate Cancer UK, which has campaigned for wider access to the drug, said the “cheap, yet lifesaving” treatment would save 3000 lives by 2030. 

NHS England said thousands of men would be offered abiraterone on the NHS within weeks.

Abiraterone blocks testosterone production by inhibiting the CYP17 enzyme in the testes, adrenal glands, and tumour tissue, depriving cancer cells of the hormones they need to grow. While it is not curative, it can slow disease progression.

Evidence from the STAMPEDE trial  in 2022 showed that a 2-year course of abiraterone in men with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer reduced the risk of recurrence and death.

Professor Nick James, of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the study showed that 2 years of abiraterone halved the risk of prostate cancer returning and cut the risk for death by 40%.

The drug's patent expired in 2022, reducing its cost to the NHS from thousands of pounds to less than £2.50 per day. Scotland and Wales subsequently approved its use in this group of patients.

The decision for men in England is “momentous,” said Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.

The charity said it would “continue to push” for men in Northern Ireland to be offered the treatment on the same basis.

""Even for men whose cancer does recur, this treatment gives them more healthy years,” James said, adding that fewer relapses would also save the NHS money in the long term.

Carlos  Sierra, PhD

 January 19, 2026  

With a few exceptions, women have been systematically erased from the history of nearly every field, and research and medicine are no exception. Anyone who disagrees with this assertion should honestly ask themselves: How many women do I know who have practiced medicine in past centuries? How did I learn about them? Were their contributions discussed in textbooks or taught in medical schools?

Against this backdrop, in a recent article in The BMJ, general practitioner trainee Becky Cridford, specialized foundation doctor Marina Politis, and general practitioner Jenna Chambers, all from Newcastle University and/or Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, contend that the profound contributions of women throughout medical history have been forgotten and must be reclaimed.

From Hippocrates to Harvey, collective memory tends to focus almost exclusively on the so-called founding fathers of medicine. Women physicians of the 19th century, from Elizabeth Blackwell to Sophia Jex-Blake, are often celebrated as pioneers, when in reality they should be seen as a bridge between early modern and contemporary practitioners and the many women healers who passed on knowledge and practices rooted in the real world from one generation to the next.

However, the reality is more disheartening than simple historical neglect. The healing practices of these women were not only forgotten but also actively sidelined by a frequently hostile medical establishment, a phenomenon that intensified from the 16th century with the professionalization of medicine.

From that moment, practicing medicine required university training, which, unsurprisingly, was available only to men, as well as a licence granted by a court or the Church. Consequently, women, along with men who could not afford the fees or did not conform to the dominant religious beliefs of the period, were excluded from formal medical practice. When women, who were often trusted practitioners in their communities, continued to provide healthcare, the medical establishment, composed exclusively of men, deemed their work illegitimate through persecution and punishment of women practitioners.

Recent historical analysis has not found sufficient evidence to support the once-popular theory that female midwives and healers were specifically targeted by European witch hunts. Nonetheless, the Scottish witch trial archives show that for some, healing was a risky practice: Among almost 4000 witchcraft accusations, 118 women and 24 men were persecuted for practicing folk healing or midwifery.

“The idea that science has no ideology and is neutral because it relies solely on proven facts is another widely accepted statement that is, in fact, false.” While good science is grounded in evidence, it is also shaped by politics and ideology, like any human endeavor.

By the 19th century, as women fought for the right to study and practice medicine professionally, medical science itself was used by male doctors to prevent the inclusion of women. In 1874, psychiatrist Henry Maudsley argued that any attempt to educate women in medicine after puberty would injure their reproductive functionality, and members of the General Medical Council also reported concerns that women were not suited to the so-called exertion of medicine. Women relied on allyship and the ability to conform to pre-established exclusionary standards to obtain a foothold in professional medicine, which meant that wealthier women, supported by their families and male connections, were more likely to be successful.

Looking retrospectively helps us see how scientific authority and sociopolitical ideas became entangled, keeping medicine closed to women in the past. Fortunately, these ideas have now changed, but the original ideology can still be found in persistent structures and inequalities. Currently, in the UK, the majority of people in medical occupations are women, but gender equity remains elusive as women face pay gaps, sexism, and training barriers.

Looking carefully at the history of medicine helps move beyond simplistic thinking and reminds us that we often repeat the behaviors we criticize in our ancestors. Professionalization delivered major advances, but it also restricted who could practice, which counted as valid knowledge, sidelining women and men who could not afford a university education. Persistent inequalities in patient outcomes and medical careers reflect these factors.

Seeking a full understanding of medicine's past is not about ascribing blame through rigid categories of wealth, gender, or conformity. This means acknowledging the breadth of knowledge that could contribute to medicine, re-examining what was lost, and imagining what might be restored. This could be a greater recognition of the healing power of the environment and the real world, or the benefit of care structures that value relationships and community, not just efficiency.

As with all history, medicine has unheard voices and untold stories that we should explore; filling these gaps in knowledge may provide new ways to meet the social, climate, and demographic challenges that lie ahead.

If women had developed medicine on equal terms alongside their male contemporaries, what different structures and practices might have existed today?

There is no definitive answer, but medicine would almost certainly have been stronger at both scientific and human levels.

In a retrospective study, Hispanic patients developed a second cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) less frequently and later than non-Hispanic patients.

“Our findings suggest that Hispanic patients develop a second cSCC less frequently and later than non-Hispanics,” the authors wrote. “Surveillance remains essential for both groups, with particular vigilance warranted for immunosuppressed Hispanic patients,” they added.

The study was led by Kelly E. Owens, MD, Department of Dermatology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, and was published online on January 6 in JAAD International.

The study's limitations included its retrospective nature, single-institution design, small sample size, and potential missing data from outside diagnoses. The matching process could have resulted in a non-Hispanic cohort that is not fully representative of typical study populations.

The study was funded by the Department of Dermatology at Duke University School of Medicine and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Most cases of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) would not occur without the contribution of a single gene, apolipoprotein E (APOE), making it a prime target for future prevention and treatment strategies.

In a study of 470,000 people of European descent, researchers discovered that the vast majority — up to 90% — of AD cases may be driven by variations in the APOE gene. While the APOE4 variant is a well-known risk factor, investigators found that the common APOE3 variant also significantly increases the risk. Combined, these two variants are associated with nearly half of all cause dementia cases.

These findings position APOE as a central driver of AD risk, at a time when most drug development efforts have concentrated on removing amyloid plaques and tau tangles — the hallmark proteins that accumulate in the brains of patients with AD.

“The results of our study indicate that some aspect of APOE function is a necessary component for a large majority of late-onset Alzheimer's disease,” lead author Dylan Williams, PhD, a genetic epidemiologist at University College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News. “This highlights a powerful but under-recognized target for prevention and treatment,” he added.

The study was published online on January 9 in npj Dementia.

APOE has long been implicated in AD, which represents roughly 60%-80% of all dementia cases and affects more than 7 million Americans aged 65 years or older. Individuals inherit two copies of the gene, one from each parent, resulting in combinations of three common variants: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. The APOE4 variant confers the highest individual risk, APOE2 is relatively protective, and APOE3 — the most prevalent — has historically been treated as neutral.

Prior estimates of APOE's contribution to AD have varied widely, in part because many studies focused narrowly on APOE4. In contrast, the current investigators examined how much disease arises across populations when both APOE3 and APOE4 are considered.

To conduct the analysis, researchers compared AD risk across APOE genotypes and designated individuals with two copies of the protective APOE2 variant as a low-risk reference group. The approach enabled them to estimate overall disease burden rather than individual relative risk alone.

The investigation showed that although APOE4 confers greater individual risk, much of the overall AD burden is driven by the APOE3 allele, which is carried by a far greater proportion of the population.

A key aspect of the study, the investigators noted, was treating APOE3, the most common variant, as a risk allele relative to the protective APOE2 variant, rather than as a neutral baseline.

For the study investigators drew on data from four large cohorts. These included electronic health record data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen, which together captured AD and all-cause dementia diagnoses in nearly half a million older adults.

In addition, they analyzed amyloid PET data from participants in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease study, along with neuropathologically confirmed cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium.

The researchers combined clinical diagnoses, brain imaging, and postmortem pathology to capture AD and dementia using different criteria, ranging from medical records to biological markers. This approach clarified why previous studies have produced widely divergent estimates of APOE's impact.

The researchers argue that APOE-related risk, particularly mechanisms linked to the APOE4 variant, has been underprioritized as a therapeutic target relative to its apparent importance in AD biology.

“The extent to which APOE has been researched as a drug target has not been proportionate to its importance,” Williams said.

He added that the findings point to multiple potential therapeutic strategies, including approaches that directly target APOE-related pathways or aim to mimic the protective effects of the APOE2 variant.

However, the investigators noted that APOE is not the sole driver of AD. Carrying APOE risk variants does not make dementia inevitable as genetic susceptibility interacts with aging, lifestyle, cardiovascular health, and environmental factors.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Scott Small, MD, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Columbia University, New York City, said the study reinforces prior genetic and experimental evidence without changing current clinical practice.

“Among the many genes linked to Alzheimer's disease risk, APOE4 stands out as the most strongly associated,” said Small, who was not involved in the study. “But based on human genetics and mouse models, APOE4 is not a deterministic gene.”

For a gene to be considered causative, Small explained, it must be present only in affected individuals and shown in experimental systems to independently trigger key features of the disease, criteria that APOE does not meet. As a result, routine APOE testing remains unjustified in most clinical settings.

“There is no point in testing unless there is an APOE-based intervention,” he said. “For diagnosis, we already have much better biomarkers.”

Several experts also weighed in on the research in a statement from the UK-based nonprofit and independent Science Media Centre.

Timothy Frayling, PhD, a professor of human genetics at the University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland, said the estimates align with prior research but could be misleading if interpreted too literally.

“People should not worry if they have the risk versions of the gene because 99.4% of us do,” Frayling said, likening the finding to saying that most road traffic deaths would not occur without the contribution of cars.

Richard Oakley, PhD, associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer's Society in the UK, emphasized that genetic risk does not amount to a diagnosis and that people can still take steps to reduce dementia risk. “We must not lose sight of the risk factors that remain within our control,” he said.

This study was supported by funding from the UK Medical Research Council. Williams reported being supported by an Alzheimer's Research UK Senior Fellowship. Other co-authors were funded by grants from the Norwegian Research Council, UK Research and Innovation, the Research Council of Finland, the Sigrid Juselius Foundation, and the University of Eastern Finland.

Given the dramatic and, in some ways, momentous events that marked the beginning of 2026, it may seem out of place to worry about the fate of an online service. But PubMed Central (PMC) is not just another search engine. It is the main gateway to scientific literature for doctors, researchers, and students around the world. It is a free source of information that has been considered neutral precisely because it is published under the aegis of a government, the US government. And despite the ups and downs of its history and regardless of the mistakes and misdeeds of administrations on both sides of the political spectrum, the US government has always been consistent on one point: the priority of defending and supporting scientific research, including as a means of development, wealth, and international soft power.

For a year now, however, this has no longer been the case in the White House. In recent months, we have seen competent and experienced people replaced by television personalities or influencers who are sympathetic to the president. We have witnessed surreal debates within the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the inclusion of scientifically unfounded statements on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, until now an undisputed touchstone for the state of the art in epidemiology and medicine.

Some are therefore beginning to fear that even a search engine such as PubMed, provided by the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — and as such ultimately under the control of the White House — could be bent to an ideological agenda that has little respect for scientific evidence. And one wonders whether it might be possible to try to free oneself from what is, in fact, almost a monopoly on biomedical knowledge today.

It is not easy. PubMed, active since 1949 and online since 1996, now provides access to nearly 40 million citations of scientific articles and online books published worldwide, in dozens of different languages, providing links to the original content and, where possible, to the full text. For anyone studying or working in medicine, pharmacology, epidemiology, and all branches of biomedical research, it is an everyday tool, essential for research, consultation, training, and continuing education. It is a strictly technical tool, one might say, unrelated to the political leanings of those in power. But the second Trump administration, if there were still any need, has made it clear to everyone how political everything is, and how even science does not escape this definition.

Within hours of taking office as the 47th president, Donald Trump signed executive orders of great significance in terms of global health, such as the US withdrawal from the World Health Organization, but also and above all in terms of rights, he wiped the slate clean on initiatives marked by the acronym DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). The measure had an immediate impact on the renewal possibilities and evaluation criteria for grants with which the NIH funds a huge portion of public biomedical research, not only in the United States. 

After a legal battle lasting almost a year, a federal judge in Boston ordered the government to reconsider its decisions on hundreds of millions of dollars of funds frozen, withdrawn, or denied to studies related in some way to these issues, but without being able to guarantee that, after review, the new choices will go in the opposite direction.

In this confrontational climate, when PubMed crashed for a few hours in early March last year — alongside suspicions that it was not just a technical glitch — scientists around the world began to realize how much their work depended on the algorithms developed within the Bethesda complex by the National Center for Biotechnology Information and how relying on that single search engine represented a major vulnerability for global biomedical research.

Alternatives do exist, but they have their own critical issues. There is a European infrastructure, Europe PMC, supported by a long list of nonprofit organizations and charities, and managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory — more than 110 research groups in six sites across Europe, one of which is in Rome. Born from an initiative that started in the UK (UK PMC) and then spread to about 30 countries, it works in close collaboration with the US PubMed Central, from which it takes its name (PMC) and from which it receives all the abstracts of published articles. In addition, it hosts preprints and other documents, amounting to over 47 million citations. However, its close link with the US structure does not allow it to be considered a redundant element capable of securing the system. Embase is another rich database, but it is managed by a private company, a huge scientific publishing group such as Elsevier. It is not the same thing.

Therefore, in my opinion, the initiative of the German National Library of Medicine, which in May announced a plan to create a structure similar to PubMed, is welcome. Credit for the work goes to ZB MED, an advanced bioinformatics facility with a center in Cologne focused on health and medicine, and one in Bonn, which deals mainly with agriculture and nutrition. The search engine developed by German researchers is called LIVIVO. It is free and accessible to everyone, and above all, it is completely independent from its overseas counterpart, ensuring greater system resilience once it is fully operational.

Some may argue that duplicating an existing service may be a waste of resources, but the stakes are too high not to have a backup system. We know how much work needs to be done on the rigor of scientific production — combating sloppiness, malpractice, and outright fraud — but even the pursuit of higher quality will not achieve its goal if it is not adequately communicated, first and foremost to the rest of the scientific community. The channels through which it passes must therefore be protected, even at the cost of a certain amount of redundancy. Above all, they must be kept as sheltered as possible from the geopolitical storms in which we are immersed.

As chief of ophthalmology at a Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center, Ankit Shah, MD, mentors trainees who might be thinking about going into private practice. But he has seen those opportunities dry up — first as private equity (PE) firms began buying ophthalmology practices, and, in the past year, publicly traded corporations have begun buying out the PE ventures.

“I've had a lot of colleagues and residents who have either been caught off guard by joining a practice that ultimately got bought out by private equity, or a lot of the places they're interviewing at are already owned by private equity,” said Shah, who is chief of ophthalmology at the VA in Salem, Virginia, and on faculty at the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“Young MDs don't want to join these groups,” said David Browning, MD, PhD, an associate professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Browning was a co-author of a 2025 study that reported about 80% of trainees in ophthalmology would not work at a PE-owned practice.

Will they change their minds as PE sells practice groups to publicly held corporations? At least three such deals occurred in 2025. More may be in the works. “Private-equity firms, by definition, invest with goal of exiting investments or reselling investments in a relatively short time period,” said Yashaswini Singh, PhD, MPH, an assistant professor at the School of Public Health at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and an advisory board member of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project who has studied the effects of PE in ophthalmology.

PE has made inroads into medical practices well beyond ophthalmology. An analysis by the American Medical Association found that 6.5% of physicians in 2024 said they were working in practices owned by PE, up from 4.5% in 2020 and 2022. In ophthalmology, the percentage is higher: KFF Health News reported in 2022 that 8% of ophthalmologists work in practices owned by PE. In the retina subspecialty, the share is even greater; nearly 30% of retina specialists are affiliated with PE-run practices, according to a 2025 study in Health Affairs.

Shah co-authored a paper in the Harvard Medical Student Review last August that called on medical students and trainees to educate themselves about the influence PE is having on ophthalmology practices and called for more research into the long-term consequences of such investment.

PE acquisitions of private ophthalmology practices peaked in 2019 to 2021, when 245 practices with 614 offices and 948 ophthalmologists were acquired by PE, a 2023 cross-sectional study reported. According to Browning, the peak year was 2021, when 75 PE deals were done, dropping to 39 in 2022. No data are available for 2023 onward. S&P Global Ratings reported that PE investment in healthcare fell by 59% in 2023, mostly thanks to higher interest rates and tighter credit markets.

PE companies “operate in healthcare without any effective oversight” and do not report to antitrust or financial regulatory authorities, according to a report by the American Antitrust Institute.

“Private equity in many ways is exploiting some inherent flaws in the American healthcare system,” Singh said. The primary issue with retina practices, she said, is a “quirk” of Medicare payment policy that ties physician reimbursement to the sale price of the drug administered, which provides an incentive to push patients getting ocular injections into more expensive drugs.

A 2024 study by Singh and her group confirmed this trend. Medicare reimbursements for the three dominant age-related macular degeneration drugs, according to National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, are $90 for bevacizumab (Avastin), a cancer drug use off label; $1186 for ranibizumab (Lucentis); and $1797 for aflibercept (Eylea). The study found the use of higher-priced medications increased by 6.5 injections per quarter, resulting in a 21% increase in Medicare spending on aflibercept.

A number of studies have found PE ownership increased healthcare expenses and altered the types of services practices provide. Singh led a 2022 study that found such practices had an average increase of $71 charged per claim and $23 in the amount allowed per claim compared with other practices.

Singh also conducted research that found PE-owned practices decreased the number of retinal detachment repairs they do by almost 20% after they were acquired. Retinal detachment repair is not as profitable as other procedures, she said. In fact, Singh said, Medicare reimbursement “doesn't quite cover the cost of surgery.”

Nonetheless, repairing retinal detachment is a critically important procedure for a retina practice. “If you don't get retinal detachment repair within days of the diagnosis, you can go blind permanently, so timely care is very critical for patient well-being,” she said.

For PE, “it's a game of numbers,” Shah said. “They don't practice medicine through a clinician microscope,” he added. “When you look at it from a numbers standpoint, you lose the beauty of practicing medicine.”

Corporate owners are attracted to ophthalmology practices because of an aging population's growing demand for cataract surgery and retinal injections to treat age-related eye disease, Singh said. “From an investor standpoint you are facing a predictable and sustained if not growing consumer demand,” she said.

These investors are also attracted by the traditional ophthalmology model of a multitude of independent practices in a region, Singh added. “A big part of the private-equity model relies on platform-and-add-on consolidation,” she said. Firms invest in an initial platform practice and then gradually acquire smaller surrounding practices and then roll them up into a larger entity.

The typical play is for PE firms to acquire a large share of a practice, between 60% and 80%, Singh said. This strategy gives the selling physicians some equity and interest in the group's growth, so they can benefit from a future sale, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City reported in Health Affairs.

In 2025, publicly traded corporations started to acquire those organizations that PE had rolled up, Singh said.

In January 2025 Cencora, the pharmaceutical distributor and healthcare support provider formerly known as AmerisourceBergen, paid Webster Equity Partners$4.4 billion for an 85% stake in Retina Consultants of America, a group of 38 retina subspecialty practices with 291 offices in 23 states.

A few months later, McKesson Corporation paid Quad-C Management $850 million for an 80% stake in PRISM Vision Holdings, a group with 96 ophthalmology clinics, eight ambulatory surgery centers and more than 200 physicians. On an international level, EssilorLuxottica , a company that started out making eyeglass lenses and frames before branching into practice ownership, acquired two groups in Europe comprising 85 practices.

Whether this shift in ownership will disrupt physician autonomy and patient care in the way PE has done remains to be seen. A spokesperson for Cencora said Retina Consultants of America's ownership model aims at “preserving clinical autonomy” and the company does not get involved in clinical decision-making. “Practice physicians and clinicians retain full autonomy and their patient-centric approach,” the spokesperson said.

McKesson itself does not own physician practices and does not influence clinical decisions, according to a statement from the company. “Through PRISM Vision Group, McKesson provides operational support that enables independent ophthalmology practices to remain autonomous,” the statement read.

Singh led a 2025 Health Affairs study of that found physician turnover quadrupled to 20% a year after practices were acquired by PE. “If a fifth of your practice is turning every year that doesn't bode well for patient continuity of care,” she said.

Another Health Affairs study Singh participated in found PE-owned practices in dermatology, ophthalmology, and gastroenterology significantly increased the number of nonphysician advanced practice providers.

Today, ophthalmology trainees have limited career options because “it's almost impossible for someone to graduate and start their own practice,” Shah said. The start-up costs in ophthalmology, which Shah estimated to run between $500,000 and $700,000 — are “astronomical” for young physicians already burdened by education loans.

The jobs that are available are increasingly with PE-backed groups, he said. Their starting salaries may be on par with independent practices, “but there's no opportunity to buy in, there's no opportunity to practice ‘independently' — I say that with quotes because everything is set up for them when it's owned by private equity,” he said. And young ophthalmologists have little leverage for negotiating these conditions, Shah said.

“There's loss of MD autonomy,” Browning said. “Younger MDs lose access to equity and become employees.” These tend to shift clinical care to non-MDs “because they cost less,” he added.

PE may not be all doom and gloom. About 2 years ago, Jai Parekh, MD, MBA, brought in PE-backed ReFocus Eye Health as a partner in his five-doctor practice in northern and central New Jersey and he has no regrets. He is also the chief innovation officer for ReFocus.

“Not all cars are the same and not all restaurants are the same,” Parekh said. “I would say that not all private-equity arrangements are the same.”

He said he's been able to preserve the doctor-patient relationship and practice as he did before, without anyone looking over his shoulder to see if he meets numbers. The parent entity handles many business aspects of the practice, namely human resources. “They are a bigger entity that offers better benefits than I ever could have as a small-business owner,” he said.

Parekh said he fought the notion of private equity for years but now called the transition for his practice “seamless.” He is still in charge of many facets of the practice, including the business-side, marketing, clinic schedules, operating room days — and even the holiday parties. “Our culture has not changed, and we actually feel even stronger now,” he said.

With PE, “There have been some good stories and some not-so-good stories,” he said. But physician autonomy and patient care come down to how the owner-physician structures the alliance. “As long as you keep the doctor-patient relationship buoyant and you want to be center stage like you were before the deal, you're going to be fine,” he said.

The multitude of ophthalmology trainees looking to join practices may be the ultimate judge and jury to determine if PE and the publicly held companies that have bought up ophthalmology practices can deliver that sense of physician autonomy.

Shah and Browning reported no relevant financial relationships. Singh reported receiving research grants from the Commonwealth Fund, the National Institute for Healthcare Management, and Arnold Ventures, and serving on the advisory board of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. Parekh reported being an officer of ReFocus EyeHealth.

Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a widely used and prominent class of targeted therapeutics, especially in cancer treatment.



Image Credit: ACROBiosystems

These complex biomolecules are specifically engineered to selectively deliver therapeutic agents to target cells by linking them to monoclonal antibodies. The safety profile and effectiveness of ADCs are impacted by the selection of their components, such as the antibody, therapeutic agent, and linker. They are also significantly affected by the chemical method used for their conjugation.

ADC development currently utilizes two primary strategies for the attachment of therapeutic agents to antibodies: site-specific conjugation and random (stochastic) conjugation.

The selected method considerably affects the resulting ADC's stability, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, homogeneity, and overall therapeutic index.

The random conjugation method uses naturally occurring reactive residues on the antibody to streamline ADC preparation and reduce technical barriers to a considerable degree.

Its key features of rapid reaction kinetics, native compatibility, and controllable efficiency are in close alignment with the core demands of early-stage ADC development, including fast iteration, the availability of multiple batches, and low cost.

Random conjugation methods have been widely adopted in commercial ADCs like Adcetris and Kadcyla as a result of their robustness for manufacturing. These methods generally target naturally occurring amino acid residues.

Lysine conjugation uses the epsilon-amine groups of lysine residues. There is an abundance of these residues on the antibody surface. Amide bonds are formed via this approach, but the large number of potential conjugation sites can lead to a heterogeneous mixture with variability in the Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR).

Cysteine conjugation targets free thiol groups (-SH) produced by reducing the antibody's interchain disulfide bonds. This approach offers more control over the DAR versus lysine conjugation, but conjugates formed using maleimide chemistry at these sites may be susceptible to deconjugation in plasma as a result of thiol exchange reactions with albumin. This can limit the ADC's stability.

Site-specific conjugation strategies, on the other hand, produce a more homogeneous ADC population with a defined attachment point and a precise DAR. This approach is typically anticipated and expected to result in more predictable PK profiles, enhanced stability, and potentially a wider therapeutic window.

Engineered Cysteine (THIOMABs) involves the use of genetic engineering to introduce defined cysteine mutations at carefully selected sites on the antibody. This approach allows precise control over the location and number of conjugation points.

Enzymatic methods utilize enzymes, such as microbial transglutaminase (mTGase), which can recognize specific engineered peptide sequences on the antibody to catalyze conjugation at defined residues.

Non-Natural Amino Acid (nnAA) incorporation is a sophisticated technique that uses genetic code expansion to incorporate distinct chemical handles (for instance, azides) into the antibody structure. These handles can then be used for extremely efficient, bioorthogonal ""click chemistry"" conjugation.

Site-specific conjugation boasts reduced off-target toxicity and high homogeneity, making it ideally suited to large-scale manufacturing and late-stage development.

Non-site-specific conjugation, on the other hand, emphasizes flexibility, speed, and broad applicability, addressing the key need for scenario adaptability and efficiency in early-phase research.

Each of these methodologies offers specific benefits that make them better suited to distinct stages of ADC research and development.

Employing the most appropriate conjugation technology is key to ensuring successful ADC design and development, whether this involves initial high-throughput screening or later-stage clinical optimization.

ACROBiosystems has introduced its ADC Conjugation Kit, which delivers a precise, rapid, and robust ADC preparation process. These kits, based on interchain cysteine conjugation technology, are designed to accelerate the research cycle within this evolving landscape.

The ADC Conjugation Kit reduces antibody disulfide bonds to generate reactive cysteine residues for non-site-specific maleimide conjugation. This classic approach facilitates rapid, controlled ADC preparation, requiring just three hours to acquire ADC conjugates with homogeneous DAR.

Conjugates created via this approach exhibit significant cytotoxicity, making them a robust tool for mechanistic studies and ADC screening.

A new study examines the potential impact of the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan (M3P) - an opt-in policy implemented in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act that allows beneficiaries to spread out of pocket (OOP) costs over the calendar year - on Medicare Part D beneficiaries with cancer who face high out-of-pocket (OOP) prescription drug costs. Many cancer patients enrolled in Part D incur thousands of dollars in OOP expenses at the start of the year to quickly reach the catastrophic coverage threshold, after which cost-sharing drops to zero. For patients living on fixed or limited incomes, these large upfront payments can be unmanageable, contributing to delayed treatment initiation, medication nonadherence, financial distress and poorer health outcomes.

Using Medicare 2022 claims data from a national sample of beneficiaries with cancer, the researchers analyzed when patients typically reach the catastrophic cap and modeled how M3P could alter payment patterns. The analysis found that nearly half of Medicare Part D beneficiaries with cancer are projected to reach the annual OOP cap, with about one-third doing so as early as January 2025. Under current structures, this results in highly front-loaded costs. Enrollment in M3P - which allows beneficiaries to spread OOP payments evenly across the year - substantially reduced monthly payment volatility, particularly for those who reach catastrophic coverage early, and could help mitigate cost-related nonadherence.

Importantly, the study highlights that awareness and uptake of M3P remain extremely low, limiting its potential benefits. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that 2.4 million (6 %) of Part D beneficiaries could benefit from enrolling in M3P. Aryana Sepassi, PharmD, MAS, assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of California San Diego Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and colleagues conclude that making the program automatic, rather than opt-in, could significantly expand its impact, reduce financial burden for vulnerable patients, and support more consistent adherence to life-sustaining cancer therapies.

The study was published Jan. 15, 2026, in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

A comprehensive review of nearly 130 studies shows the strongest evidence to date that “forever chemicals” are associated with gestational diabetes, while underscoring uncertainty around other diabetes outcomes and the need for more prospective research.

Study: Associations of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances with markers of glycaemic control, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and diabetes risk: a systematic review and meta-analyses. Image credit: Reshetnikov_art/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in eClinicalMedicine, researchers assessed associations between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and diabetes outcomes.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease in which the body cannot efficiently use insulin or the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin. Its prevalence has increased since the 1990s, and is currently estimated to affect more than 828 million individuals worldwide. Beyond lifestyle and genetic factors, exposure to environmental chemicals can contribute to the etiology of DM.

PFAS are persistent and ubiquitous chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and increase the risk of DM. They are referred to as forever chemicals due to their pervasiveness and long half-lives. PFAS have been linked to metabolic syndrome and its components, and may promote insulin resistance, induce cellular stress and inflammation, or alter pancreatic function and homeostasis.

In the present study, researchers characterized associations between PFAS exposure and markers of glycemic control, pancreatic β-cell function, insulin resistance, and diabetes risk. First, a systematic literature search was conducted to identify human studies from the Medline and Embase databases. Eligible studies were population-based observational studies that analyzed associations between diabetes and PFAS.

Title, abstract, and full-text screening of eligible studies was performed, and relevant information was extracted. For each outcome of interest, the number of studies reporting at least one significantly positive or negative association with individual PFAS was summarized. A qualitative synthesis was conducted as an exploratory analysis for studies examining multipollutant or mixture PFAS associations.

Further, random-effects meta-analyses were performed between PFAS and gestational DM (GDM), type 2 diabetes (T2D), homeostatic model assessments of β-cell function (HOMA-β) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting glucose. The risk of bias of studies and the quality and strength of the evidence were assessed using the Navigation Guide.

Of the 738 records identified through database searches, 129 records were included after screening. Most studies were conducted in the US (54) and China (30) and were cross-sectional in design (70). Across studies, 45 different PFAS were quantitatively measured, with the most common being perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA).

Most studies examined PFAS exposure in adulthood (75), the gestational or prenatal period (42), adolescence (22), and childhood (16), highlighting potential differences by exposure timing. The most common diabetes outcomes were T2D, GDM, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR. Study populations were predominantly the general public. Nearly one-third of studies examined outcomes in pregnant individuals.

Only three studies examined type 1 diabetes, and their findings were inconsistent. The meta-analyses, which included 79 studies assessing 18 distinct PFAS, showed that several PFAS were associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes. Specifically, each doubling of PFOS and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) levels was linked to increased GDM risk in prospective studies.

Nested case, control studies reported positive associations for several long-chain and emerging PFAS, including PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFBS, perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), while cross-sectional or case, control studies found positive associations for perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) and PFOA, as well as a negative association for perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA).

For T2D, the associations were insignificant, although PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS showed a positive overall direction in prospective studies. In homeostatic model assessments, several significant associations were observed: higher β-cell function and insulin resistance with each doubling of PFAS levels. Specifically, HOMA-IR was positively associated with PFOS and PFNA in prospective studies.

HOMA-β was associated with PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA in cross-sectional studies and PFNA in prospective studies. For fasting insulin measures, positive associations were observed with PFOS and PFNA in prospective studies. There were generally no significant associations with HbA1c in the main analyses. However, sensitivity analyses restricted to studies with a lower risk of bias identified a positive association between PFOS and HbA1c in cross-sectional studies.

Associations with fasting glucose were limited and inconsistent across PFAS and study designs, with mixed or largely null findings, particularly in pregnancy-specific analyses. Most studies were classified as having a low or probably low risk of bias regarding outcome and exposure assessment, study population, baseline differences, and confounding.

Sixty studies examined multiple PFAS or jointly with other chemicals. Of these, 35 included PFAS as part of an exposure mixture, and six also considered other chemicals beyond PFAS. Most mixture studies assessing GDM or T2D reported positive associations, whereas studies using summed PFAS measures often reported inconsistent or null findings.

Finally, the evidence was of moderate quality for some long-chain or legacy PFAS and selected outcomes, but low quality for short-chain or emerging PFAS and for outcomes such as T2D, fasting glucose, and HbA1c, and was limited or inadequate to determine with certainty the associations between PFAS exposure and diabetes outcomes in humans.

The most consistent finding was the association between increased PFAS exposure and greater odds of GDM. Evidence on PFAS, T2D associations is yet to be explained, while that on type 1 diabetes remains scarce. Meta-analyses revealed positive associations between PFAS and HOMA-IR, and limited associations with fasting glucose, HOMA-β, and fasting insulin.

Effect sizes for continuous metabolic markers were generally small, and many findings were derived from cross-sectional studies, limiting causal inference and raising the possibility of reverse causation. Overall, the evidence suggests that exposure to some PFAS is associated with an increased GDM risk and modest changes in insulin sensitivity and secretion in the general population.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study exposes a targetable vulnerability in acute myeloid leukemia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260119/New-study-exposes-a-targetable-vulnerability-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia.aspx","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:27:00 GMT","

New research co-led by Indiana University School of Medicine scientists has exposed a vulnerability in acute myeloid leukemia by identifying the blood cancer's reliance on a specific signaling pathway involved in the body's inflammation response. Their preclinical evidence suggests that blocking this pathway with a new drug compound can weaken acute myeloid leukemia during critical stages, paving the way for more effective and targeted treatments for this hard-to-treat disease.

According to the National Cancer Institute, the five-year survival rate for AML is only 32.9%, and about 22,000 new cases were reported in 2025. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is known for being treatment-resistant and having a high relapse rate. 

AML is a challenging blood cancer because a small population of cells, known as leukemia stem cells, can survive chemotherapy and later regenerate the disease. Our research goal was to understand the critical mechanisms these leukemia stem cells rely on at both diagnosis and relapse, and to identify potential therapeutic targets.""

Tzu-Chieh (Kate) Ho, PhD, assistant research professor of pediatrics at the IU School of Medicine and a lead author of the study

In the study published in Leukemia, the researchers examined leukemia stem cells from AML patients during their diagnosis and relapse. They discovered that an inflammatory signaling pathway involved in the body's immune system response - known as Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling - is significantly elevated at both stages. When the team used genetic approaches to reduce this signal in human AML cells, the cells formed fewer colonies and showed a diminished ability to reestablish leukemia.

The researchers also developed a new drug-like compound, UR241-2, designed to block the key proteins found in the IL-1 signaling pathway. In preclinical models, the compound impaired leukemia stem cells while largely sparing healthy blood-forming cells and significantly reduced leukemia levels in the mice. Their findings suggest that targeting this pathway could strengthen current AML treatments like chemotherapy and reduce the risk of relapse. 

""Our studies indicate that IL-1 signaling is not a random feature, but rather a fundamental survival mechanism that persists across different stages of AML and can be targeted,"" said Reuben Kapur, PhD, director of the IU School of Medicine Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research and co-author of the study. ""This opens up exciting possibilities for developing therapies that are more effective and more precise.""

UR241-2 is still in early preclinical development, but similar drugs are already being tested in clinical trials for other cancers and immune-related diseases, suggesting a promising path toward eventually evaluating this compound for AML.

""Future AML treatments may incorporate our strategy alongside standard chemotherapy as an approach to reduce relapse risk,"" Ho said. ""We hope these approaches will ultimately help improve treatment outcomes and long-term prognosis for patients with AML.""

Ho and Kapur are also researchers in the Wells Center's Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Biology Program and the IU Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center. 

IU School of Medicine's Baskar Ramdas, PhD, is a co-author on the study. Other authors include Mark W. LaMere, Hiroki Kawano, Daniel K. Byun, Elizabeth A. LaMere, Chunmo Chen, Laura M. Calvi, Jane L. Liesveld, Rakesh K. Singh and Michael W.

A major UK study shows that commonly used home pulse oximeters can overestimate oxygen levels in people with darker skin, increasing the risk of undetected hypoxemia and raising urgent questions about device standards, regulation, and clinical interpretation.

Oxygen in blood is primarily transported by the red cell pigment hemoglobin. The fraction of total hemoglobin that is oxygenated hemoglobin in arterial blood is the arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2), which is measured directly from an arterial blood gas sample and used to detect and assess hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen concentration. Pulse oximetry is often used to noninvasively estimate saturation by measuring light absorbance in the tissue vascular bed. However, its accuracy is far from uniform, especially in darker skin tones.

A recent study in The British Medical Journal examined how skin color affects the accuracy of hypoxemia diagnosis by pulse oximetry.

Pulse oximeters began to be commercially sold in the 1980s, with subsequent striking advances in design, convenience, and portability. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a significant increase in the use of fingertip pulse oximeters at home. These are inexpensive, battery-powered, and suitable for home use.

Pulse oximeters can enable remote monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and detection of early hypoxemia. The NHS England exploited this with the rollout of the COVID Oximetry @home scheme. However, some cheap pulse oximeters produce inaccurate readings, emphasizing the need for regulation.

Darker skin is also associated with an increased risk of a false negative, leading to delayed or missed diagnosis of hypoxemia. Earlier studies used race or ethnicity to stand in for skin tone. Others used the Fitzpatrick skin tone or other color comparison charts to determine skin tone.

Both methods lack the objectivity of spectrophotometry, leading to major flaws in these studies. Spectrophotometry measures light reflection over different wavelengths and calculates the skin color accordingly. The results are used to calculate the individual typology angle (ITA), derived from objective lightness and colour measurements.

The ISO, which certifies pulse oximeters and other devices for safety and basic performance, does not require accounting for skin tone variations. The performance metric for measurement accuracy is the accuracy root-mean-square (ARMS), which combines bias (systematic error) with precision (random error or noise).

The FDA has published a draft to improve oximeter accuracy evaluation by increasing both the number of participants and the range of skin tones. It considers not only ARMS but variation in bias over a 100° range of ITA.

In response to NHS concerns, the NIHR launched the EXAKT study to assess how skin tone affects measurements and diagnostic accuracy of five fingertip pulse oximeters used in the home oximetry scheme.

The study used data from patients recruited or screened for the UK-ROX trial, designed to assess various approaches to oxygen therapy. This included 903 critically ill patients in 24 intensive care units in England between June 2022 and August 2024, a setting chosen to enable paired arterial blood gas sampling and to capture a wider range of oxygen saturations, including lower SaO2 values.

The five oximeters were used to measure SpO2, and the readings were compared with the SaO2 measured simultaneously by co-oximetry, the gold standard. Skin tone was objectively measured using a handheld spectrophotometer.

The researchers aimed to evaluate pulse oximeter performance in terms of its overall accuracy, precision, and bias. Both false positive and false negative rates for SpO2 ≤92% and ≤94% were evaluated against a reference SaO2 threshold of ≤92% to examine how often SpO2 fails to identify hypoxemia. They used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to measure overall testing performance across different cutoffs.

In particular, they looked for occult hypoxemia (SaO2 below 88% but SpO2 >92%).

The study included 11,018 pairs of SpO2–SaO2 measurements. All five pulse oximeter types in the study showed reduced precision across all SaO2 levels. Overall accuracy was also reduced, largely due to substantial imprecision rather than systematic bias alone. At lower saturations, SpO2 measurements were too high, and at higher saturations, too low.

All five pulse oximeters overestimated the saturation with darker skin tones. Median dark skin was associated with an average increase of 0.6–1.5 percentage points in mean SpO2 values compared to lighter tones.

At lower saturations, darker skin tones exacerbated the bias towards falsely high SpO2 readings, thereby increasing the risk of missing hypoxemia. At higher saturations, the underestimation error tended to partially offset the higher SpO2 associated with darker skin tone, reducing the bias.

As a result, the accuracy of pulse oximeters varied with skin tone, though the direction and magnitude of the bias depended on saturation levels and the oximeter model. The devices showed a reduced ability to distinguish true hypoxemia in darker-skinned individuals.

The ARMS predominantly varied with measurement precision rather than skin tone-associated error. However, despite their small size, their effect on diagnostic accuracy was significant.

At both SpO2 thresholds, false negatives increased in darker-skinned individuals, while false positives decreased. False negatives increased by 5–35 percentage points at higher SpO2 thresholds in darker-skinned individuals.

While cases of occult hypoxemia were rare and estimates imprecise, they occurred more often in individuals with darker skin tones. Overall, hypoxemia was more frequently missed in this group.

These findings align with prior research but are limited to low-cost pulse oximeters supplied under the COVID Oximetry @home scheme. Results may not apply to critical care oximeters used in hospital settings.

A smaller American study of critical care oximeters using the same spectrophotometry approach also found significant overestimation of saturation in darker-skinned patients.

This large prospective study used objective skin-tone measurements and advanced statistical modeling, thereby strengthening its conclusions. However, unmeasured confounders such as reduced peripheral perfusion in critical illness may limit generalisability to home use.

SpO2 values tended to be higher in people with darker skin, potentially resulting in clinically significant differences in diagnostic accuracy.

Clinicians should interpret pulse oximetry cautiously, especially in darker-skinned individuals. Manufacturers should ensure robust pre- and post-market testing across skin tones.

Current standards do not adequately address these issues. SpO2 trends are more clinically informative than isolated values and must be interpreted in context. Updated guidelines are needed to support optimal hypoxemia care where confirmatory testing is unavailable.

Further research should incorporate objective skin tone measurement and explore alternatives to spectrophotometry to improve accessibility.

A national study of Australian undergraduates suggests that spending more than 10 hours a week gaming is associated with poorer diet quality, higher body weight, and disrupted sleep, highlighting the need for healthier gaming habits rather than less gaming altogether.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition, researchers conducted a cross-sectional study to examine associations between video gaming and health-related behaviors among university students (n = 317) in Australia. Study findings revealed that students who game >10 hours per week demonstrated poorer diet quality, higher Body Mass Index (BMI), and worse sleep than their peers.

These findings suggest that high-frequency (high-intensity) gaming may displace health-promoting behaviors, highlighting a potential need for targeted public health interventions designed specifically for the university gaming community.

Video gaming is a ubiquitous pastime, particularly amongst students, yet its physiological and behavioral correlates in young adults remain understudied. In parallel, studies suggest that the university years represent a critical developmental window during which young adults establish lifelong lifestyle habits.

In Australia, 92% of households reportedly play video games. While gaming offers established cognitive benefits and stress relief (e.g., catharsis), the relatively novel ""displacement hypothesis"" suggests that time spent gaming may crowd out health-promoting activities (e.g., cooking, sleeping, and exercising).

Previous research has suggested that high-frequency gaming is linked to suboptimal health behaviors, such as mindless eating, sedentary behavior, and disrupted circadian rhythms, due in part to exposure to blue light. However, the specific interplay between gaming frequency and diet quality remains complex and not fully established.

The present study aimed to address this knowledge gap by conducting a cross-sectional observational study to explore relationships between gaming frequency and multiple health indicators. The study involved 317 Australian undergraduate participants (median age = 20.0 years) recruited through social media platforms and university systems.

The study required enrolled participants to complete a comprehensive online survey using validated tools to assess various health domains:

Gaming Habits: Students were categorized into three groups based on weekly, self-reported gaming hours: Low (0–5 hours), Moderate (6–10 hours), and High (>10 hours).

Diet Quality: The Diet Quality Tool (DQT) was used to assess adherence to prescribed nutritional guidelines, scoring participants on their intake of key food groups, including vegetables, fruits, and high-fat snacks.

Physical Activity: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) was used to calculate Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) minutes per week to gauge participants' exercise levels.

Sleep and Stress: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep disturbances, while the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was employed to measure subjective stress.

Eating Behaviors: The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18) was leveraged to evaluate cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating.

Statistical analyses comprised multiple linear regression models to isolate the independent associations between gaming and health outcomes. These models controlled for sociodemographic variables, including gender, ethnicity, and smoking status.

Study analyses revealed several contrasts between high-frequency gamers and their low-frequency gaming counterparts, the most significant being deterioration in nutritional habits among the former. High-frequency gamers (>10 hours/week) had significantly lower diet quality scores (median 45.0) compared to low-frequency gamers (median 50.0) (p < 0.001).

Regression analysis further quantified these observations, revealing that for every additional hour of gaming per week, diet quality scores dropped by 0.16 points (p = 0.02), after adjustment for multiple lifestyle and demographic factors, representing a modest but statistically significant association.

Anthropometric and sleep-related outcomes showed similar patterns:

BMI and Weight: High-frequency gamers were found to have a significantly higher median Body Mass Index (BMI) of 26.3 kg/m² compared to 22.2 kg/m² in the low-frequency group (p < 0.001). Notably, the prevalence of obesity was nearly five times higher in the high-frequency group (24%) compared to the low-frequency group (4.9%).

Sleep Quality: High-frequency gamers scored a median of 7.0 on the PSQI, compared to 6.0 for low-frequency gamers (p < 0.001). Notably, a PSQI score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep, suggesting that, while high-frequency gamers reported poorer sleep, the Australian student population as a whole struggles to maintain optimal sleep quality.

Physical Activity: The study identified a weak but statistically significant inverse correlation (r = -0.13, p = 0.03) between gaming frequency and physical activity. However, total physical activity levels did not differ significantly between gaming groups.

The study also found that high-frequency gamers were more likely to be male and prefer PC gaming. Surprisingly, this cohort reported consuming less alcohol than the low-frequency group (p = 0.02). Additionally, high-frequency gamers reported a preference for video games with higher violence ratings, a characteristic discussed in relation to existing literature on stress and arousal, rather than as a direct finding of elevated stress levels.

The present study elucidates important associations between frequent video gaming and several health-related behaviors among university students, providing evidence that higher gaming exposure is independently associated with poorer diet quality and higher BMI.

While the study is limited by its cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported data, its findings suggest that universities should consider integrating ""healthy gaming"" education into their wellness programs. As digital entertainment continues to dominate student life, balancing time spent gaming with positive health behaviors may represent a pragmatic public health goal rather than an indication of causality.

Autoimmune drug development increasingly recognizes that the Fc-FcR axis is more than an effector mechanism; it is a controllable immunological node that bridges humoral and cellular responses.

This axis is responsible for two complementary regulatory tasks: Fc gamma receptors mediate effector functions by maintaining a dynamic balance of intracellular ""activation"" and ""inhibition"" signals.

The Fc-FcR axis activates Fc gamma receptors (most notably, FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa) via ITAMs to signal through the Src/Syk pathways. It also drives phagosome formation, actin remodeling, oxidative burst, and transcriptional programs that underpin ADCC, ADCP, and pro‑inflammatory cytokine release.

The inhibitory FcγRIIb also transmits ITIM‑dependent brake signals able to limit B‑cell activation and the responsiveness of effector cells. The functional or genetic loss of FcγRIIb shifts this balance toward pathogenic activation.

At the same time, the Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) binds to IgG in endosomes' acidic environment, protecting it from lysosomal degradation and recycling it back into the bloodstream. This function effectively extends the half-life of IgG.

The excessive retention of pathogenic IgG is a key driver of pathology in many antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, meaning that blocking the FcRn-IgG interaction accelerates pathogenic antibody clearance, creating an efficient and rapid path toward the treatment of autoimmune diseases.



Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) biology. Image Credit: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-025-00708-2

Therapeutic approaches tend to be centered around three complementary aims: the rapid reduction of pathogenic IgG, the recalibration of FcγR‑mediated effector function, and the induction of antigen‑specific tolerance.

FcRn inhibitors exemplify the first of these aims, accelerating IgG catabolism and quickly reducing the number of circulating pathogenic antibodies. Clinical validation in antibody-mediated disorders has shown that IgG depletion has the potential to translate into rapid symptomatic benefit when disease activity correlates with antibody burden.

Fc engineering addresses the second of these aims by tuning both pharmacokinetics and effector function. This results in half-life-extending mutations (for instance, YTE or LS) that improve FcRn affinity to prolong exposure.

Engineered Fc variants able to preferentially engage the inhibitory FcγRIIb can potentially blunt B‑cell activation and downstream autoantibody production without significantly impairing host defenses.

Antigen–Fc fusion constructs and glycoengineering are targeted strategies able to induce tolerance or bias effector phenotypes. For example, MOG Fc-style constructs have the capacity to direct antigen delivery to tolerogenic pathways, while sialylation or galactosylation patterns on Fc glycans can shift antibodies toward anti- or pro-inflammatory outcomes, respectively.

The ideal strategy from a translational standpoint depends on successfully mapping dominant disease mechanisms to the simplest effective intervention.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG), Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), and other conditions characterized by acute, antibody-mediated tissue injury can often be effectively addressed by FcRn antagonism. This sees the rapid reduction in circulating IgG (validated via regulatory approval from Efgartigimod for MG), translating directly into clinical improvement.

Diseases like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), which exhibit more complex immunopathology, generally require combination approaches that can both restore inhibitory signaling and reduce pathogenic IgG load.

SLE's pathology is driven by ICs activating TLR7/9 (typically exacerbated by defects in the inhibitory Fc gamma RIIb), which means that engineered Fc constructs able to improve Fc gamma RIIb engagement are a sensible part of ensuring immune ""signal reset,"" working alongside FcRn inhibitors.

The early incorporation of mechanism-relevant biomarkers (for example, circulating pathogenic IgG levels, Fc gamma R expression or genotype, Fc glycoform profiles, and downstream signatures such as type I interferon) is key to enabling patient stratification across all indications, as well as delivering early evidence of target engagement.

The Fc–FcR axis offers a range of complementary levers, such as rapid IgG depletion, antigen-specific modulation, and selective signaling recalibration, that can be applied selectively or combined to match disease biology.

Programs beginning with a mechanism-to-indication map before embedding clear biomarker and PD plans, and employing functional assays and validated Fc/FcR reagents are best positioned to efficiently translate these approaches while sufficiently managing immunocompetence and safety risks.

Psychiatrists and neuroscientists are taking a major step toward objective mental health diagnosis by launching a central reference database for the classification and communication of mental health biomarker research.

Psychiatry is almost unique in the medical sciences in not relying on biomarkers (measurable physiological tests) to diagnose psychiatric disorders, instead using patient-reported symptoms, behavioral observations, and standardized diagnostic manuals. Research on biomarkers is ongoing, but fragmented. Now psychiatrists and neuroscientists are setting up a structure to create a central resource to categorize and coordinate biomarker research. This work, to be launched today, 16th January, is initiated by the ECNP, and funded by Wellcome.Heading the initiative on behalf of the ECNP, Professor Martien Kas (University of Groningen, The Netherlands) said:""Precision psychiatry is an approach to mental health care that integrates biological, behavioural, and clinical data. It moves us beyond the current symptom-based diagnosis of mental illness towards a more comprehensive approach, which incorporates more quantitative data, more based on the underlying mechanisms. In short, diagnosis based on the cause of the illness, not just the symptoms. It aims to continuously refine diagnosis and personalize treatment by identifying biologically meaningful subgroups and targeting the underlying mechanisms of illness, and is perhaps the hottest topic in mental health today.There's a lot of research, but we need to build a structure which enables researchers to understand how their work fits into the broader picture, who is doing related work, and what the findings (or problems) have been. So we are building a database to systematically review and communicate all the biomarker work in the field of anxiety disorders, depression, and psychosis. All this will become freely available online"".As part of the process the ECNP will organise a series of stakeholder meetings and workshops, to bring together the researchers in the field. The ECNP has already staged several workshops, with representatives from most of the major bodies in the field, such as the GAMIAN-Europe patient organisation, the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the European Psychiatric Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry.Professor Kas continued, ""Wellcome has recognised the importance of the initiative by funding mapping and consensus-building around biomarkers in mental health in a 30-month project. We see this as the start of the process to put precision psychiatry on a firm footing. Ultimately, we believe this will change the way we look at mental health, and make diagnosis psychiatric diagnosis and treatment really testable"".Niall Boyce, Head of Knowledge and Measurement in Mental Health at Wellcome, said ""This exciting new project is an important step towards providing people experiencing mental health problems with the right treatment at the right time. ECNP's biomarker map will not only help researchers to orientate themselves in an increasingly complex and fast-moving field, but will chart the way towards much-needed transformation in the precision and quality of mental health care.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Super agers' resilience against Alzheimer's disease linked to protective gene variant","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260119/Super-agers-resilience-against-Alzheimers-disease-linked-to-protective-gene-variant.aspx","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:28:00 GMT","

The gene variant posing the greatest genetic risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is called APOE-ε4. A different variant of the same gene, APOE-ε2, is thought to confer protection against AD.

A comparatively large study reported Jan. 16 in Alzheimer's & Dementia, The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, led by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, measures the frequency of APOE-ε4 and APOE-ε2 in so-called super agers - people ages 80 or older whose cognitive function is comparable to people 20 or 30 years younger.

Super agers were 68% less likely to harbor the gene nobody wants, APOE-ε4, compared to individuals with AD dementia in the same 80+ age group.

Most notably, super agers were 19% less likely to harbor APOE-ε4 than were cognitively normal participants in the same age group. 

""This was our most striking finding - although all adults who reach the age of 80 without receiving a diagnosis of clinical dementia exhibit exceptional aging, our study suggests that the super-ager phenotype can be used to identify a particularly exceptional group of oldest-old adults with a reduced genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease,"" said Leslie Gaynor, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine, who led the study with Alaina Durant, BS, statistical genetic analyst in the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center. 

Super agers were also found for the first time to have higher frequency of the variant you'd want, APOE-ε2: They were 28% more likely to carry APOE-ε2 than were cognitively normal controls ages 80+, and 103% more likely to carry the variant than were participants with AD dementia aged 80 or older. 

The observational study, which includes the largest sample of super agers to date, uses data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC), led by another member of the study team, Timothy Hohman, PhD, professor of Neurology. The study included 18,080 participants from eight national aging cohorts.

Super-ager status was defined in part as people ages 80+ whose memory performance was above the average scored among cognitively normal participants ages 50 to 64. The study included multiple race/ethnicity groups, including 1,412 non-Hispanic white super agers, 211 non-Hispanic Black super agers, 8,829 participants with AD dementia, and 7,628 cognitively normal controls. APOE-ε4 frequency worldwide is 13.7%; in the study it was 43.9%. 

""With interest in super agers growing,"" Gaynor said, ""our findings notably encourage the view that the super-ager phenotype will prove useful in the continued search for mechanisms conferring resilience to AD.

""This is by far the largest study to date to identify differences in APOE-ε4 allele frequency based on super-ager status, and the first study to find a relationship between APOE-ε2 allele frequency and super-ager status. We would expect these findings to lend continued interest to questions of how these variants may influence development of clinical dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the super-ager phenotype more generally.""

Others from VUMC on the study include Angela Jefferson, PhD, Logan Dumitrescu, MS, PhD, and Derek Archer, PhD. They were joined by 32 researchers from 15 universities. The study was funded in part by National Institutes of Health awards U24 AG074855, U01 AG068057, and R01 AG059716.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","The evolution of anti-Aβ therapeutics: Beyond plaque clearance","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260119/The-evolution-of-anti-Aceb2-therapeutics-Beyond-plaque-clearance.aspx","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:22:00 GMT","

The development of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has faced repeated hurdles over the past decade.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) have exhibited the capacity to reduce plaque load in the brain in recent large-scale clinical trials, demonstrating a trend toward slowing cognitive decline in some patients with early-stage AD. This development marks a significant step forward in the clinical validation of the anti-Aβ therapeutic strategy.

The 2025 Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference saw discussions on this treatment gradually shift from questions around whether the strategy is effective to more nuanced discussions around systematically improving the treatment's safety and implementation efficiency based on its established efficacy. This helps ensure the needs of long-term clinical practice are better met.

Multiple clinical studies have highlighted how the sustained reduction of cerebral Aβ levels can slow disease progression in some patients. These findings have become the foundation for AD-related drugs' clinical application.

A number of presentations at CTAD 2025 examined the challenges that current anti-Aβ therapies still face in the real world, most notably in terms of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), such as microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) and cerebral edema (ARIA-E).

ARIA occurrences influence antibodies' dosing selection and administration strategies while considerably increasing the complexity of clinical management and radiographic monitoring.

As the efficacy of anti-Aβ strategies continues to be validated, the field is beginning to enter a new research phase focused on determining how to better balance therapeutic benefits and safety while maintaining plaque clearance capability. This work has become a core issue that requires urgent resolution.

Conventional anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies typically rely on passive diffusion to enter the central nervous system. High peripheral dosing is often required to achieve sufficient brain exposure and plaque-clearing efficacy, but this can contribute to an increased ARIA risk.

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) shuttle technology has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Most notably, mechanisms using transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated transcytosis represent a novel antibody delivery pathway.

The use of engineered antibody molecules with optimized BBB shuttle modules can improve distribution efficiency within the brain parenchyma, achieving this without significantly increasing systemic exposure.

Current research suggests that these BBB-shuttled antibodies accomplish higher brain exposure while simultaneously demonstrating comparatively lower binding to cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (CAA) versus traditional antibodies.

It is theorized that this distribution profile, which favors parenchymal delivery over vascular binding, can help lower the likelihood of vessel-related injury and reduce the risk of ARIA.

Data presented by Dr. Ronald DeMattos from Eli Lilly at the CTAD 2025 conference compared Trontinemab (a next-generation antibody based on gantenerumab that has been fused with a TfR shuttle module) against traditional gantenerumab.

The data presented showed that Trontinemab attained a higher plaque clearance rate within a comparatively shorter treatment period. ARIA-E incidence associated with Trontinemab was lower within the disclosed data range than historically reported rates for traditional gantenerumab studies. This represented a more promising overall benefit-risk profile.

Several pharmaceutical companies worldwide are currently developing next-generation anti-Aβ antibody pipelines, exploring a range of BBB shuttle technology platforms, including CD98, TfR, and INSR.

In vivo distribution characteristics and delivery pathways are becoming increasingly important considerations in the design of differentiated anti-Aβ therapies.

The overarching message from CTAD 2025 is clear: the research focus of anti-Aβ therapeutics is gradually shifting from ""plaque removal"" to ""optimizing delivery pathways and in vivo distribution.""

BBB shuttle technology represents a promising new direction for exploring the potential to reduce ARIA risk and improve brain delivery efficiency. This technology is already impacting design strategies for the next generation of anti-Aβ antibodies.

It is anticipated that future differentiation and competition in this field will depend more on attaining a superior balance between safety and efficacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Medicare telehealth: Study shows no visit increase, informing policy debate","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260119/Medicare-telehealth-Study-shows-no-visit-increase-informing-policy-debate.aspx","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:20:00 GMT","

With another Congressional deadline looming this month for most telehealth coverage under Medicare, a new University of Michigan study adds more data to the debate.

It shows that the total number of patient visits hasn't gone up since most patients gained the ability to see doctors and other health care providers virtually.

In fact, among non-surgical medical specialties and mental health providers, the total number of visits stabilized and even declined slightly through June 2024, the most recent period available to analyze. The data come from more than 60 million people who had nearly 539 million appointments during a five-year period.

The findings could help inform policymakers who must vote by January 30 to either temporarily renew or permanently extend Medicare telehealth coverage standards that have been in effect since March 2020.

If they don't meet that deadline, older and disabled Americans with traditional Medicare coverage could find themselves receiving messages like they did last fall, when there was a lapse in telehealth coverage during the government shutdown that began October 1.

Such letters told them that if they had a telehealth visit during that time, they may be responsible for paying the entire cost, or that their appointment was being converted to in-person or being canceled or rescheduled.

Just before Thanksgiving, Congress authorized retroactive payment for telehealth visits that patients with traditional Medicare had decided to keep during the shutdown.

But the budget agreement only provided for coverage of future care under current standards through the end of January 2026.

The new findings, published in the peer-reviewed publication Health Affairs Scholar by a team from the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, build on findings that the researchers published as a preprint nearly a year ago during a prior period of uncertainty about Medicare coverage of telehealth.

The new analysis includes data from January 2019 through June 2024 and breaks down telehealth and in-person visit trends for surgical, non-surgical and behavioral (mental) health care.

Telehealth was possible only under very limited circumstances in Medicare before March 2020. That month, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid emergency pivot to virtual care. Since then, such care has become routine for most people. In fact, the study shows that telehealth now accounts for 44% of all behavioral health visits and 9% of primary care visits among beneficiaries in traditional Medicare.

However, despite this sustained adoption, the study finds that overall healthcare visits have remained stable or declined over time. The researchers used a special type of statistical analysis to look at visit patterns among specialties with high, medium and low telehealth use.

They found that even in fields where telehealth was widely adopted, the total number of visits, including in-person and virtual visits, stayed steady or even declined over time. Contrary to some predictions, overall visits didn't climb higher as telehealth became more popular.

Lead author James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., said that it's important to look at the overall trajectory of both telehealth and in-person visits in order to inform policymakers who want to balance care access and flexibility with budgetary responsibility.

One of the things that is paralyzing the policy debate is uncertainty and concern about whether covering telehealth in parity with in-person care would be associated with runaway utilization. But we don't see that here.""

James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., National Clinician Scholar at IHPI and Clinical Instructor in the U-M Medical School's Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Medicine

Lee and senior author Chad Ellimoottil, M.D., M.S., led the analysis. They did not include asynchronous patient portal messages, which providers can bill Medicare for under a separate code if they spend a substantial amount of time addressing the patient's concern.

They also cannot include any visits that patients had with providers who did not bill traditional fee-for-service Medicare, such as mental health providers who patients may have paid for out of their own pocket.

Because half of Medicare beneficiaries have chosen Medicare Advantage plans, which bill Medicare differently, their data aren't included either.

The fact that the new analysis shows a declining trend for total visits for behavioral health and primary care is also of interest, Lee said. This may reflect the well-known shortage of primary care and behavioral health providers in the United States, including reduction in capacity as burned-out providers reduce the number of appointments they offer. 

In addition to Lee and Ellimoottil, the authors are Elena Chun, M.S., Chiang-Hua Chang, Ph.D., Hechuan Michelle Hou, M.S., former NCSP scholar Terrence Liu, M.D., M.S., Rodney Dunn, Ph.D., Jeffrey McCullough, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D.

The study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the support that Lee receives for his National Clinician Scholars Program fellowship from IHPI and the VA Office of Academic Affiliations.

After increasing for more than 25 years, lung cancer death rates are finally levelling off among women in European Union (EU) countries apart from Spain, according to predictions of mortality rates from the disease for 2026.

In the UK, death rates from lung cancer have been falling among women for several years, although from a higher peak than those seen in the EU, but they have continued to rise among EU women during this time.

Now, in a new study published in the leading cancer journal Annals of Oncology today (Monday), researchers led by Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Milan (Italy), predict that age standardized death rates (ASR) from lung cancer among EU women will stabilize at around 12.5 deaths per 100,000 women in 2026. This represents a fall of just over 5% since 2020-2022. The only exception is Spain, where female lung cancer death rates will continue to rise by 2.4% in 2026, with around 10 deaths per 100,000 women.

In the UK, lung cancer death rates among women are predicted to fall by 13.4% compared to 2020-2022, with 14.85 deaths per 100,000 women.

However, these improvements will only be seen in women aged 64 years or younger. Lung cancer death rates will continue to rise among older women.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death for both sexes in the EU, with mortality rates continuing to decline among men although they will remain nearly twice as high as the rates seen in women in 2026. In most countries, the previous upward trends in death rates among women appear to be stabilizing except in Spain where an increase is expected, albeit from a low baseline.

The reason for this pattern is that men everywhere started smoking earlier than women. In the US and UK, women started smoking earlier than women in most EU countries, but they also started to stop earlier. Now, smoking prevalence for both sexes is lower in the US and the UK, below 10%, than in the EU. Spanish and French women started smoking later than women in other EU countries, but have also stopped later. The same applies to Italian women, but they never smoked much to start with.""

Carlo La Vecchia (MD), Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Milan, Italy

The researchers analysed cancer death rates in the EU 27 Member States as a whole and separately in the UK. They looked at the five most populous EU countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain) and, individually, for stomach, intestines, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus (including cervix), ovary, prostate, bladder and leukaemias for men and women. They focused specifically on lung cancer for 2026. Prof. La Vecchia and his colleagues collected data on deaths from the World Health Organization and United Nations databases from 1970 to 2022 for most of the EU-27 and the UK. This is the sixteenth consecutive year the researchers have published these predictions, which have proved to be reliable over the years.

The researchers predict that in the EU there will be approximately 1,230,000 deaths from all cancers in 2026, corresponding to an ASR of 114 per 100,000 men (a decline of 7.8% since 2020-2022) and 74.7 per 100,000 women (a decline of 5.9%). In the UK, there will be approximately 172,000 deaths from all cancers, corresponding to an ASR of 98 per 100,000 men (a decline of 11.25%) and 80 per 100,000 women (a decline of 7.25%).

Death rates from most cancers are predicted to fall in most countries, except for female deaths from pancreatic cancer in EU countries (up by 1%) and female deaths from colorectal cancer in the UK (up by 3.7%).

Co-leader of the research, Professor Eva Negri from the University of Bologna (Italy), said: ""We estimate that, since a peak in 1988, a total of around 7.3 million deaths from cancer have been avoided in the EU and 1.5 million deaths in the UK, assuming that death rates had remained constant at their 1988 levels. Among men, a total of 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer have been avoided over that time period, but no deaths were averted among women.""

Due to the increasing numbers of elderly people in the population, the actual number of deaths from cancer will rise from 666,924 between 2020-2022 to 684,600 in EU men in 2026, and from 534,988 to 544,900 women. However, in the UK the numbers of deaths will remain relatively stable for both men and women: around 91,400 deaths in men in 2026 (up from 91,000) and 80,500 in women (up from 79,980).

Prof. La Vecchia concluded: ""Our findings underline the persistent importance of smoking on cancer mortality. Tobacco control remains the cornerstone of lung cancer prevention, and also plays a role in preventing other cancers, such as pancreatic cancer. Policies to limit the use of tobacco have averted millions of smoking-related deaths, but enforcement remains uneven across Europe.

""Overall, cancer death rates remain generally favourable, and pancreatic cancer mortality rates have levelled off, which is encouraging as they had been increasing previously. This probably reflects the improvement in occupational and environmental carcinogens.

""Colorectal cancer mortality is now increasing in the UK and most of northern Europe among people aged younger than 50 years, likely due to overweight, obesity and diabetes.

""Disparities in cancer death rates persist between different countries and genders. In several countries, cancer screening, diagnosis and management can and should be improved to match recent advances. This applies mainly to central and eastern EU countries.""

The authors of the Annals of Oncology paper conclude: ""Strengthening taxation, implementing advertising bans, creating smoke-free environments, and providing cessation support are essential to closing regional and socioeconomic gaps, and achieving sustained reductions in cancer mortality across Europe. Additionally, controlling overweight and obesity, improving dietary habits, controlling alcohol consumption, and extending and improving the implementation of population screening for the early detection of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers remain key strategies in cancer prevention.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","What are the benefits of lab sustainability?","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260119/What-are-the-benefits-of-lab-sustainability.aspx","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:56:00 GMT","

Sustainability is a widely discussed topic, and for good reason. Long-term environmental responsibility is essential for future generations, and sustainability has been a core principle at Air Products for many decades.

From a practical perspective, sustainability is critical when planning, designing, or managing a cryogenic laboratory. Improving sustainability raises important questions: how can laboratories become more sustainable, why does it matter, and what benefits can be achieved?

One of the main benefits of sustainability is improved operational efficiency. Actions such as upgrading aging equipment or performing routine checks can reduce liquid nitrogen consumption, lower operating costs, streamline workflows, and improve sample security.

In addition, organizations seeking funding for laboratory improvements or expansion may find that a clear commitment to sustainability is a requirement within funding proposals. When forming partnerships, many organizations now expect collaborators to demonstrate similar environmental values.

For laboratories associated with universities or the National Health Service, sustainability targets must be met. In the case of the NHS, these expectations are outlined in the Sustainable Supplier Assessment. As environmental concerns continue to grow, additional regulations are likely to be introduced, making compliance increasingly important.

This raises an important question: why are more research facilities not making these changes? Beyond limited awareness and a tendency to rely on familiar practices, the primary barrier is often the perceived upfront cost. However, improving sustainability does not necessarily require significant investment and can lead to meaningful cost savings.

As a leading supplier of liquid nitrogen and cryogenic freezing equipment in the United Kingdom, Air Products frequently observes the consequences of poorly designed cryogenic rooms and unsuitable equipment choices.

Having the correct equipment in place is one of the most impactful steps a laboratory can take. Sustainable equipment is generally easier to operate, requires less energy and liquid nitrogen, enhances sample security, and delivers greater long-term value.

The most effective approach is to consider the entire installation and ensure it is appropriately matched to operational needs.

For example, one customer experienced an increase in liquid nitrogen top-ups and initially considered installing a larger external tank. This would have required additional space, increased rental costs, and more frequent deliveries.

Air Products instead recommended addressing the issue at the freezer level by upgrading to the equipment that consumed less liquid nitrogen. This allowed the customer to retain the existing tank, reduce delivery frequency, and improve sample protection.

For laboratories able to specify new equipment or plan upgrades, several options are available, including models from the MVE range:

MVE HEco™ series: High-efficiency, environmentally friendly cryogenic freezers designed for vapor storage at –190 °C. These systems maximize storage density, enhance sample security, and significantly reduce liquid nitrogen usage.

MVE Vario™ series: A widely used alternative to ultra-low temperature freezers, suitable for cryogenic storage and offering extended hold times of up to 96 hours. These freezers provide stable temperature performance and meaningful cost savings compared with mechanical systems.

When evaluating freezers, it is important to consider both storage capacity and liquid nitrogen consumption. Similar to evaluating a vehicle based on fuel efficiency, the same principle applies to cryogenic freezer performance.

This chart illustrates how one customer, a national blood transfusion service, reduced liquid nitrogen consumption by more than 50 percent. The number of deliveries required was also significantly reduced.

Even if upgrading equipment is not currently possible, forward planning is essential. Selecting the right equipment in the future can lower operating costs and support compliance with evolving environmental regulations.

There are additional ways to reduce liquid nitrogen consumption and improve sustainability, such as optimizing cryogenic room layout or reducing the distance between freezers and liquid nitrogen storage.

If these changes are not feasible, several other measures can still deliver meaningful improvements.

Sustainability improvements often result from a series of small, consistent actions. Many of these align with best practice recommendations, and when applied regularly, they can significantly reduce liquid nitrogen usage. This leads to fewer tanker deliveries and lower fuel consumption.

Examples of routine checks and actions include:

Understanding how much liquid nitrogen equipment consumes is essential. Support is available from the Air Products team if assistance is needed.

Damaged seals and ice buildup are common causes of excess liquid nitrogen loss and should be addressed promptly.

Braided hoses experience greater stress due to temperature fluctuations. If replacement is required, vacuum-insulated hoses offer improved pressure stability and reduced losses.

SIVL lines may occasionally require re-vacuuming. Condensation on the line indicates reduced vacuum performance.

Frost on external surfaces can indicate leakage or vacuum loss and should be investigated.

How you fill your freezers can greatly affect how much LN2 is wasted. Filling freezers individually requires repeated cooling of the pipeline. Using a sequential filling approach, known as the daisy-chain method, minimizes liquid nitrogen waste.

Frequent use of pipeline decant systems increases cooling losses. Filling a 50-liter dewar and decanting from it can be a more efficient alternative.

While each action may appear minor on its own, collectively they can result in substantial savings over time and support long-term sustainability goals.

Although sustainability may not be the highest priority for every laboratory, following the steps outlined above or consulting with a specialist can make it an integral part of cryogenic operations.

From reducing liquid nitrogen consumption and improving efficiency to meeting regulatory requirements, sustainability offers both operational and financial benefits.

Even if major investments are not currently possible, early planning is essential. Sustainability-related upgrades will eventually be required, and delaying preparation can result in suboptimal decisions.

The Air Products team brings extensive experience in sustainability, efficiency improvement, and the supply of high-quality, safe equipment and gases. Air Products is also the only manufacturer in the United Kingdom offering MDR-certified liquid nitrogen.

Autistic and non-autistic people express emotions differently through their facial movements, according to a new study, which may help to explain why emotional expressions are sometimes misinterpreted between the two groups.

In a landmark study mapping facial expressions among autistic and non-autistic individuals, researchers at the University of Birmingham used detailed facial motion tracking to create an extensive library of facial expressions linked to major emotions such as anger, happiness and sadness, with more than 265 million data points.

The study, published in Autism Research, involved 25 autistic and 26 non-autistic adults, who produced nearly 5000 expressions in total. Each participant produced angry, happy and sad facial expressions in two ways – in synchrony with some sounds, and while speaking. The team found differences in angry, happy, and sad facial expressions between the groups, with autistic participants also producing more unique expressions:

The team also found that alexithymia – a 'sub-clinical' condition commonly found in autism that involves difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions – also shaped facial expressions. Alexithymia was linked to less clearly distinct angry and happy expressions, making them more likely to appear ambiguous.

Dr Connor Keating, who conducted the research at the University of Birmingham and is now based in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford said: ""Our findings suggest autistic and non-autistic people differ not only in the appearance of facial expressions, but also in how smoothly these expressions are formed. These mismatches in facial expressions may help to explain why autistic people struggle to recognize non-autistic expressions and vice versa.""

Autistic and non-autistic people may express emotions in ways that are different but equally meaningful - almost like speaking different languages. What has sometimes been interpreted as difficulties for autistic people might instead reflect a two-way challenge in understanding each other's expressions. We are currently investigating this idea, so watch this space for updates.""

A comprehensive review weighs the promise of bamboo shoots as a nutrient-rich, sustainable food against limited human evidence and unresolved safety concerns, underscoring why preparation methods and better trials matter.



Study: Bamboo consumption and health outcomes: A systematic review and call to action. Image Credit: Hanasaki / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the journal Advances in Bamboo Science, researchers assessed human consumption studies and in vitro investigations using human cell models, alongside laboratory studies relevant to food processing, to evaluate the health effects of consuming bamboo shoots and derived products.

Based on available evidence, they concluded that, while human data remain limited, properly prepared bamboo products may offer several health benefits, including improved digestive, antioxidant, and metabolic outcomes. However, each reported benefit is supported by a small number of individual studies rather than a broad clinical evidence base.

Bamboo is a fast-growing, highly versatile plant belonging to the grass family, with more than 1,250 species worldwide. Although found across most continents, bamboo is most abundant in Asia, accounting for around 80% of global coverage.

Its rapid growth, high biomass yield, and adaptability have made it valuable not only for construction and environmental applications but also as a food source. Bamboo leaves and shoots are commonly consumed, particularly in Asian cuisines. They are nutritionally attractive due to their high protein content, moderate fiber levels, low fat content, and presence of essential amino acids and minerals such as potassium and selenium.

Previous research suggests that compounds derived from bamboo may have several health benefits. However, bamboo consumption also carries risks, as some species release cyanide from cyanogenic glucosides if not properly processed, posing serious health hazards. Appropriate preparation, such as boiling, is therefore essential to reduce potential toxicity.

Despite growing interest in bamboo as a functional food, it had not previously been systematically evaluated. Researchers searched Medline (via PubMed) and Web of Science, assessing study quality using standardized risk-of-bias tools. The systematic search identified 1,052 potentially relevant records. After title and abstract screening, 19 full-text articles were evaluated; 16 met the inclusion criteria.

These comprised four human studies, four in vitro studies using human cell lines, and eight laboratory-based studies examining bamboo components with relevance to nutrition and food processing. All but one were set in Asia. The overall methodological quality of the in vivo human studies, assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, was moderate.

The four human studies involved a total of 4,934 participants and examined diverse health outcomes. One large cross-sectional study in schoolchildren reported a high prevalence of goiter (31%) despite adequate iodine intake, suggesting a possible association with frequent consumption of bamboo shoots rather than established causality.

Supportive evidence from an experimental rat component within the same study showed altered thyroid structure and reduced thyroid hormone levels following bamboo shoot intake, reinforcing concerns about potential goitrogenic effects.

In contrast, other human studies reported beneficial effects. A randomized trial found that flavonoid-rich antioxidants from bamboo leaves reduced internal exposure to glycidamide and acrylamide by altering toxicokinetics and increasing urinary excretion of related biomarkers, with sex-specific differences observed.

A study in people with diabetes showed that cookies fortified with bamboo shoots significantly lowered postprandial blood glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner.

Another small dietary intervention in healthy women demonstrated improvements in lipid profiles, including reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, along with increased bowel movement frequency and increased stool volume, indicating improved bowel function.

Four studies investigated bamboo extracts using human cell models. These consistently showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, including reduced reactive oxygen species production, inhibition of inflammatory markers, improved cell viability, and low cellular toxicity.

Bamboo leaf and shoot extracts also reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis under high-glucose conditions, supporting a potential but not yet clinically established protective role against metabolic and inflammatory damage.

One study assessing heavy metal content found elevated lead levels in some bamboo shoots; however, simulated intestinal digestion did not induce toxicity in intestinal cells, suggesting that conventional risk assessments may overestimate health risks when bioaccessibility is not considered.

Eight studies explored bamboo-derived ingredients for nutritional and technological applications. These demonstrated potent antioxidant activity and prebiotic-like effects in laboratory-based studies, through stimulation of beneficial gut bacteria and the production of short-chain fatty acids, but lacked direct evidence from human gut studies.

Bamboo extracts reduced harmful compounds such as acrylamide and furan during food processing without compromising sensory quality. Other studies highlighted the high nutritional value of bamboo shoots, including fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals, and showed that processing methods and harvest stage influence nutrient composition and functional properties.

Overall, the findings suggest that properly prepared bamboo products may offer multiple health benefits, including improved glycemic control, lipid profiles, bowel function, antioxidant capacity, and reduced exposure to food-processing toxins. Importantly, these outcomes are derived from distinct, mostly small studies, and should be interpreted individually rather than as a unified body of clinical evidence. These effects are likely linked to bamboo's rich content of dietary fiber, bioactive compounds, and micronutrients.

However, concerns remain regarding potential goitrogenic effects, particularly with frequent consumption of inadequately processed bamboo shoots. Importantly, appropriate preparation methods such as boiling are thought to substantially reduce cyanogenic compounds, although human evidence remains limited.

The main limitations include the limited number of human studies, substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and study designs, and a lack of high-quality trials, which precluded meta-analysis. Despite these constraints, the evidence supports bamboo's promise as a sustainable, nutrient-rich food. Further well-designed human intervention studies are needed before firm dietary recommendations can be made.

Caregiving in the modern era is challenging for even the most prepared adults. So, what happens when this burden falls on children?

As Japan's population ages, the number of children and young people responsible for caregiving is increasing. However, the impact of this on their health and daily lives remains not well understood.

To gain better insight, Professor Bing Niu and Dr. Ziyan Wang from Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Economics conducted two rounds of surveys, one in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic and another in 2024 after the pandemic. The surveys targeted 1,581 young carers aged 15 to 19 across Japan to clarify how caregiving burdens affect the psychology and emotions of young carers.

The survey incorporated the Kessler 6-Item Psychological Distress Scale and the Positive and Negative Outcomes of Caring questionnaire as indicators to measure the degree of psychological stress and subjective responses, such as feelings and thoughts, toward caregiving. It then analyzed the actual state of the caregiving burden and its impact on carers' psychological and emotional well-being.

Results revealed that young carers with greater care responsibilities tend to experience higher stress levels, with approximately 20% of young carers in our surveys falling into the high-risk group. However, they also possesspositive emotions, such as a sense of accomplishment and pride. In particular, the 2024 survey revealed that both positive and negative emotions stemming from caregiving experience were more pronounced than in 2021.

Both positive and negative emotions were strongly expressed in the 2024 survey, which suggests that even as the burden of care persists, societal understanding and support for young carers have grown, and they themselves have begun to embrace their roles more positively.""

Dr. Ziyan Wang, Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Economics

Professor Niu concluded, ""It is suggested that while both positive and negative aspects exist in the caregiving experiences of young caregivers, it is crucial to develop support tailored to each individual's specific circumstances.""

The findings were published in Scientific Reports.

U.S. Men's National Team striker Haji Wright came off the bench for Coventry City to score the match winner in a 2-1 win over Leicester City, midfielder/forward Tim Weah put one in for Marseille in their rout over Angers, and midfielder James Sands helped FC St. Pauli claw back from two down scoring the first in an eventual 3-2 loss to Borussia Dortmund in matches involving the top candidates for the U.S. Men's National Team roster for the 2026 FIFA World Cup this summer. Along the way, 14 players started and 17 players saw time for their European clubs.

The first match of the FIFA World Cup on June 12 is approaching somewhat rapidly for the U.S. Men's National Team. A strong showing as one of the three host countries with Mexico and Canada is a must. Anything else is unacceptable. Coach Mauricio Pochettino will be faced with whittling the roster down to 23-26 players for the three group stage matches… and beyond. Maybe, just maybe, the USMNT will end up in Kansas City for a quarterfinal.

Thus, we will be following the top 32 players (at the moment) who are the strongest candidates for the final roster per the latest callups and history. How much playing time is each seeing? Are they being productive? Will a strong show of form mean a surprise addition, and subsequent subtraction, from the roster?

Consider this weekly column your reference.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Road to World Cup 2026: USMNT's Four Best Players of the Week—Ranked","https://www.si.com/soccer/road-to-world-cup-2026-usmnt-four-best-players-week-ranked-1-19-26","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:00 GMT","

In years past, the U.S. men's national team coaching staff would have the chance to assess players during a January camp, often with friendlies for North American-based players. In 2026, though, manager Mauricio Pochettino and U.S. Soccer opted otherwise, prioritizing European club form and focused MLS preseasons. 

While some of the top USMNT players like Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun struggled to produce over the weekend, several fringe players stood out as they sought more significant opportunities in the national team picture. 

As the European focus remains, the week also saw MLS teams begin preseason, and several will play preseason matches of varying intensity over the next several weeks before the league opens on Feb. 21. 

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top four performances of the week from American players across the globe. 

Aidan Morris has started to round into form with Middlesbrough and kept his consistency with a 90-minute effort in a 3–2 win over West Bromwich Albion on Friday.A former Columbus Crew academy player, Morris stood out in the American-heavy matchup, which saw him take on George Campbell and Darryl Dike, who both played in West Brom's first match under former Minnesota United manager Eric Ramsay.Continuing his blossoming partnership in a 4-4-2 midfield pivot with Hayden Hackney, Morris created two chances and made 20 passes into the final third, while also making six recoveries.Not likely a World Cup starter, his form through 2025–26 could put him in contention to play a key depth role this summer.

Another product of an MLS academy, former New York City FC midfielder James Sands netted his first Bundesliga goal in FC St. Pauli's 3–2 loss to Borussia Dortmund.Saturday's loss marked the 16th start in 16 appearances for Sands with St. Pauli this season, but his first goal or assist in a season that sees his side sitting last in the table after 17 matches.Outside of the goal, the 25-year-old created a pair of chances and made six defensive contributions in a comeback effort that fell short.While not likely a contender for the 2026 World Cup squad, given his 14 previous caps, any sustained production would certainly have him on Pochettino's radar.

The striker battle for the USMNT continues to heat up, and 2025 Gold Cup starter Patrick Agyemang is ensuring he stays in contention as a backup to presumed top choice, Folarin Balogun.The former Charlotte FC attacker found the back of the net for Derby County in a 1–0 win over Preston North End on Saturday, pushing his side up to 12th in the English Championship.With seven goals and four assists in 23 appearances this season, he has been one of the more consistent American players in the attack, outshining a player like Norwich City's Josh Sargent, who was demoted from the Canaries' first team as he looks for a transfer to Toronto FC.While not included among his 89-minute effort, Agyemang led the post-match celebrations between Derby's players and fans, showcasing just how quickly he has embedded himself in the club after joining in the summer. 

Tim Weah was central to Marseille's dominant 5–2 win over Angers in Ligue 1 action on Sunday, finding the back of the net for the second time in 2025–26.His goal came as Marseille's fourth before half time as he made a late run into the box, before rising for an aerial cutback from Hamed Traore, which he headed past the goalkeeper to cap off an outstanding first half for the squad from southern France. The 25-year-old played a key transitional role, providing vital linkups to Mason Greenwood, playing slightly inside and in front of him in the 3-4-2-1. Greenwood's goal to make it 2–0 came from Weah's skillful delay on the right side, before he lay off to the former Manchester United striker, who played a quick give-and-go with Emerson before finishing. With three goal contributions in 1,067 Ligue 1 minutes, Weah will look to maintain his form as a likely lock for the World Cup roster, vying for valuable minutes to showcase his skills in the USMNT's final four friendlies.

Patrick Agyemang and Haji Wright celebrate their winning goals in the Championship this weekend Barrington Coombs/PA Images via Getty Images; Jacob King/PA Images via Getty Images

Big tournaments can often hinge on late drama. Success can depend upon having the players who can find that vital edge when everyone else is gassing. The remarkable finale to AFCON over the weekend proves as much.

So when Mauricio Pochettino is considering his striking options for this summer's World Cup, he may keep in mind two forwards who are regularly proving capable of providing that critical cutting edge in England's Championship.

Both, in different ways, have had to show resilience this season. And both have been rewarded.

First there is Haji Wright who, in coming off the bench to grab table-topping Coventry's late winner against Leicester City, ended a run of 17 league games without a goal stretching back to October.

Frank Lampard's side had trailed against their Midlands rivals, but made it 1-1 just after half-time on Saturday before Wright's 85th-minute strike kept their title hopes well on track.

Afterwards Lampard was full of praise for the 27-year-old's determination to end his dry streak through sheer hard work.

“In my job, there are times to talk to players and times to leave them be a little bit,” he told the BBC. “I played as a goalscoring player and I had (dry) periods, and there's only one way out of it. That's to work really hard.

“The problem for Haji and the team was that we haven't had training time so this week was a competitive training week, and when you train and things aren't dropping for you on the pitch, my only belief is that you work, work, work and stay positive and things will happen for you.

‘The thing that happened for him today is a tap-in and I'm not belittling it because that's the way it goes.

Wright place. Wright time. 🦅 pic.twitter.com/FdftBZlT1J

— Coventry City (@Coventry_City) January 18, 2026



“Now it's for him to continue in that vein. He was such a problem for Leicester when he came on: running in behind, holding it up, tracking back, giving fouls away because he's trying to make tackles on the halfway line to see out the game for us. That's what we needed from everyone, but when Haji can do it, he's a special player for us.”

On that note, Patrick Agyemang said ‘hold my beer' — and in Derby's game went one better by scoring the only goal of a nail-biting victory at promotion hopefuls Preston North End.

The 25-year-old from East Hartford, Conn., scored his seventh of the season in the league in the 82nd minute, after earlier missing two good chances. He celebrated like it meant an awful lot to him, too, soaking up the acclaim from a jubilant away end at Preston's Deepdale stadium.

Later, he told his club website about how he was winning his striker's mental battle. “I had a chance I would normally put away and I didn't, but I had to regroup and think: ‘We're on the front foot still and the boys need me to score. I can't let it dwindle my game,'” he said.

“It's tough because, as a striker, you want to score every chance you get. We're all human, so nobody is always going to score every chance, but for me it's most important when I hear the fans backing me and my boys on the team cheering me saying: ‘Pat go again, next one.' You keep going.

“On a personal note, I've been working on this mental battle in terms of being a striker and those opportunities and knowing things won't go well all the time, but it's always about the next one and I was able to show that today.”

The goals come as an obvious contrast to the situation currently facing Josh Sargent, the Norwich City striker banished to train with the U-21s after taking himself out of contention for an FA Cup match over a transfer wish. Time is ticking until the U.S.'s last window before the World Cup squad is chosen, and as the jockeying for a place behind the more-entrenched Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi intensifies, Sargent's out of commission while his chief competition has found success.

It wasn't quite so upbeat for Chris Richards and Crystal Palace.

This time last year, things were going so well for the USMNT defender and his Premier League team as they embarked on what would be a historically successful FA Cup campaign, and qualification for UEFA competition.

Richards was loving playing as part of an ultra-dependable, three-man band of brothers at the back, alongside captain Marc Guehi and Maxime Lacroix.

But fast-forward to the present day and things are starting to unravel.

Holders Palace were dumped out of the cup at the third-round stage by a non-League team — sixth-tier Macclesfield beat them 2-1 — Guehi is joining Manchester City, and manager Oliver Glasner is off in the summer, too.

Then on Saturday, perhaps predictably given the turmoil and uncertainty surrounding the Londoners, they lost 2-1 to Sunderland. Richards, who was voted 2025 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year last week, came back down to earth with a hefty bump and would be forgiven wondering what can go wrong next.

In Serie A, it was a low-key weekend for USMNT stars Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie.

The former was at least part of a key victory for Milan on Sunday evening, as they edged past Lecce with a 1-0 win that kept them in the title race and three points behind rivals Inter at the top.

Pulisic had a quiet game by his standards, and has now gone five games without a goal after an otherwise blustering individual start to the campaign.

At least his team won. McKennie, who conversely has been in fine personal form, started but could not prevent Juventus dropping points on Saturday as they lost 1-0 to 15th-placed Cagliari.

In the Italian second tier, though, it was a thoroughly positive weekend for American Gianluca Busio.

The Venezia midfielder scored his fourth goal of the Serie B season to start the ball rolling on a 3-1 win over Catanzaro on Saturday. The victory means Venezia are now second in the table and only a point behind Frosinone at the top.

Busio's former midfield team-mate in Venice, Tanner Tessmann, may have departed last year for bigger things at Lyon in France's Ligue 1 — he started as they won on Sunday — but the 23-year-old still in Italy is still playing an integral part in Venezia's hopes of getting back into the top flight.

In Tessmann's current league, Tim Weah was on the scoresheet with Marseille's fourth in a 5-2 rout of Angers, ending a nine-match goalless run with his third score in all competitions this season.

Last but not least, also in Ligue 1 and on the still-U.S.-eligible front, Connecticut-born Luca Koleosho made a winning impression on loan with Paris FC. The 21-year-old joined Paris earlier this month after briefly spending time on loan from Burnley with Espanyol, and made it a fairytale start by netting the winner in their 2-1 victory at Nantes. (Koleosho is currently an Italy youth international with eligibility for the U.S., Canada and Nigeria)

One shot, one goal — he will hope for more like this.

It's Champions League time again, so all eyes are on the USMNT contingent in action this week.

Balogun will be hoping for better fortune with Monaco. The USMNT striker missed two chances and was taken off injured in their 3-1 home defeat by Lorient on Friday.

See if he recovers in time to face Real Madrid (Tuesday, 3pm, Paramount +).

Also in Madrid, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso was back in Diego Simeone's first team at the weekend as Atletico beat Deportivo Alaves 1-0. He will hope he can make the cut again, after a spell on the sidelines, as Atletico take on Galatasaray (Wednesday, 12:45pm, Paramount +).

In the Eredivisie, Sergiño Dest missed out as the Dutch defending champions won again at the weekend. He will be hoping to get fit enough to be involved against Newcastle on Wednesday (3pm, Paramount +).

Meanwhile, on Thursday, Auston Trusty will try and help Celtic overcome Bologna in their Europa League clash (12:45pm, Paramount +).

However, the Blues are refusing to stand still, accelerating plans to sign a £60m-rated replacement this month to address the defensive crisis that contributed to Enzo Maresca's mid-season exit.

The England international, who has been sidelined since sustaining a serious knee injury during pre-season, is making impressive strides in his rehabilitation. According to BBC Sport, Colwill's recovery is ""progressing well,"" leading to a growing sense of optimism within the medical department that he will feature for the first team later in the current campaign.

The loss of Colwill was a hammer blow to Chelsea's preparations for the 2025-26 season. Viewed as the cornerstone of the club's long-term defensive project, his absence left a void in the backline that the squad has struggled to fill. His ability to break lines with his passing and his composure in possession were seen as vital to the tactical setup, and his unavailability was a primary factor in the team's defensive instability during the first half of the season.

However, the club remain adamant that Colwill's long-term future is secure. He remains central to the hierarchy's vision for the next decade, and there is no desire to rush him back unnecessarily. Yet, the prospect of having him available for the crucial run-in fixtures could provide a psychological and tactical lift as Chelsea look to salvage their season. While a precise return date remains fluid, the fact that a return this season is being discussed as a realistic possibility is a testament to the player's dedication to his recovery.

Despite the positive news on Colwill, the Chelsea board has taken an internal decision to stop waiting for the summer and address their centre-back issues immediately. The club have brought forward their recruitment plans by six months and opened talks to sign Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet during the current winter transfer window.

The Blues have reportedly held discussions with both the French club and the 20-year-old's representatives. Jacquet, a France Under-21 international, is understood to be keen on the switch to Stamford Bridge. However, the deal is far from straightforward. Rennes are determined to keep hold of their prized asset mid-season and are currently quoting a fee in excess of £60 million to sanction a sale this month.

Chelsea are aware that there is ""substantial rival interest"" in Jacquet, which may be forcing their hand to move now rather than risk a bidding war in the summer. The desire to recruit a ball-playing centre-back specifically mirrors the profile of Colwill, suggesting the club wants to ensure they are never left this short of distribution quality from the back again.

If the valuation for Jacquet proves prohibitive, Chelsea have identified alternative targets to bolster their ranks. The club are monitoring Como defender Jacobo Ramon, a rising star in Serie A following his move from Real Madrid. Closer to home, Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi has emerged as a potential cut-price solution. The Argentine defender is out of contract at the end of the season, meaning he could be available for a reduced fee in January. Senesi brings Premier League experience and the ball-playing ability Chelsea crave, though they face stiff competition from Juventus for his signature. As of now, Chelsea have yet to make formal contact with the South Coast club, but Senesi remains a viable contingency plan should negotiations with Rennes hit a dead end.

The urgency of Chelsea's January activity is heavily influenced by the ghost of the summer transfer window. Former manager Enzo Maresca, who was sacked this month, had identified the centre-back position as a priority area for reinforcement. His key target, Dean Huijsen, eventually opted to join Real Madrid, leaving Maresca short of options when Colwill suffered his injury. The club's failure to secure a suitable alternative was a source of major frustration for the Italian coach and played a contributory role in the friction that led to his exit.

Looking ahead, the summer promises further upheaval. There is a growing expectation that both Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo will reach a ""crossroads"" in their Chelsea careers. With both players entering the final two years of their contracts, the club will likely force a decision: sign an extension or face being sold to preserve transfer value. This looming uncertainty makes the successful recruitment of a centre-back in January all the more critical, ensuring the squad is not left exposed again as they attempt to transition into a new era","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss Senegal's walk-off after a late penalty decision for Morocco. (2:53)

Senegal leaving the field to protest referee decisions before winning the Africa Cup of Nations title amid shocking chaos was ""unacceptable,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on Monday.

Infantino criticized the Senegal coaches, players and some fans for their behavior at the end of regulation time against host nation Morocco that was astonishing for the final of an international competition.

""The ugly scenes witnessed [Sunday] must be condemned and never repeated,"" the FIFA leader posted on his Instagram account after attending the game in Rabat.

""I expect that the relevant disciplinary bodies at CAF [the Confederation of African Football] will take the appropriate measures,"" Infantino wrote.

CAF also described the incidents as unacceptable in a later statement, and said it is ""reviewing all footage and will refer the matter to competent bodies for appropriate action to be taken against those found guilty.""

Senegal coach Pape Thiaw faces severe sanctions for his part leading this players back to the locker room when Morocco was awarded a stoppage-time penalty, forcing the game to stop for almost 15 minutes.

The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) on Monday said it will initiate file complaints before FIFA and CAF (Africa football confederation).

The federation said on its website that the withdrawal was ""accompanied by incidents"" after a penalty was awarded to Morocco and ""disrupted the normal course of the match and the performance of the players.""

It is unclear if any ban imposed on Thiaw would apply just in future African competitions or at FIFA's World Cup in North America. Senegal starts its World Cup playing France on June 16 at MetLife Stadium near New York, where it also plays Norway six days later.

Senegal's team and fans were angered by being denied what shaped as a title-winning goal early in stoppage time of a 0-0 draw when the referee called a foul to rule out the goal.

Minutes later, Morocco was awarded a penalty after a video review which judged star forward Brahim Díaz had been pulled to the ground by a Senegal defender when a corner was taken.

The controversial decision further fueled a feeling by Morocco's opponents that the team was getting favorable decisions at a tournament which has been a showcase for co-hosting the 2030 World Cup for FIFA.

Thiaw encouraged his players to leave the field and so prevent Díaz taking the penalty kick that could decide the title. Senegal fans clashed with police at the other end of the stadium.

""It is unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner, and equally, violence cannot be tolerated in our sport. It is simply not right,"" Infantino wrote.

""We must always respect the decisions taken by the match officials on and off the field of play,"" the FIFA president added. ""Teams must compete on the pitch and within the Laws of the Game, because anything less puts the very essence of football at risk.""

Morocco coach Walid Regragui later called the incidents a ""shameful"" image of African soccer for the rest of the world to see.

When the players returned, and in the remarkable 24th minute of stoppage time, Díaz took one of the worst penalties in soccer history.

The Real Madrid  forward's slow chip shot -- known as a Panenka, after the Czech player who did it 50 years ago to win the European title against West Germany -- was weak, low and easily saved by Senegal goalkeeper Édouard Mendy.

The game went into extra time and Senegal won it four minutes in with a powerful shot by Pape Gueye.

""My best wishes as well to Abdoulaye Fall, president of the Senegalese Football Association, and to everyone involved in this success,"" Infantino wrote.

""It is also the responsibility of teams and players,"" he said, ""to act responsibly and set the right example for fans in the stadiums and millions watching around the world.""

During the suspension of the match, outraged Senegal supporters jumped over barricades and landed in photographers' positions behind one of the goals, where they threw chairs onto the field and battled with stewards before police arrived to try and restore order.

The federation said it would ""resort to legal procedures with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA)"" asking them to ""rule on the withdrawal of the Senegalese national team from the field during the final against the Moroccan national team, as well as on the events that accompanied this decision, following the referee's announcement of a penalty deemed correct by all the experts.""

Also on Monday, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) condemned in a statement the ""unacceptable behavior"" of some players and officials during the AFCON final.

The statement did not explicitly name the Senegal delegation but said that CAF ""firmly"" rejected any inappropriate conduct, especially that directed against the refereeing team or the organizers.

After the match, Morocco coach Regragui was critical of Thiaw's decision to pull his team from the field and defended Díaz on his missed penalty.

""I think a lot of time passed before [Brahim] was able to take the penalty, and this put him off,"" Regragui said. ""The match we had was shameful for Africa.""

Díaz issued a statement on Monday about the missed penalty, saying: ""My soul hurts. I dreamed of this title thanks to all the love you all gave me, every message, every show of support that made me feel I wasn't alone. I fought with everything I had, with my heart above all else.

""Yesterday I failed and I take full responsibility. I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

""It will be hard for me to recover, because this wound doesn't heal easily... but I will try. Not for myself, but for everyone who believed in me and for everyone who suffered with me.

""I will keep going forward until one day I can give you all this love back and become a source of pride for my Moroccan people.""

Zohran Mamdani and U.S. President Donald Trump shake hands during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House Yuri Gripas / Abaca / Bloomberg via Getty Images

The New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said he intends to raise the impact of travel bans on this summer's FIFA World Cup with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying it is “something (he) hopes will change” ahead of the tournament.

On Sunday, Mamdani hosted a Manhattan watch party for the Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal, taking over New York City Surrogate's Court for fans to congregate and watch the game, which was eventually won in controversial circumstances by Senegal.

Since Trump returned to power last January, the U.S. has imposed a string of travel bans on nationals from designated countries, including four countries (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Iran, and Haiti) that have qualified for the 48-team World Cup. The tournament will take place across the U.S., Canada and Mexico this summer.

A December proclamation by Trump suspended entry into the U.S. for nationals of Ivory Coast and Senegal, both as immigrants and non-immigrants, including in the visitor category for business and tourism, with the administration citing overstay rates from nationals from the two countries. Exemptions are carved out for players, coaching teams, federation officials, and immediate relatives of players, but not for fans.

In June, Trump signed off on another travel ban in which Haiti and Iran were among 12 countries impacted, a step Trump described as essential to “protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.”

In November, the Trump administration took a step towards facilitating global access for fans when it announced the creation of the FIFA PASS. However, the FIFA PASS is not a visa in itself; it merely provides a prioritized visa appointment system for those who have purchased tickets to attend the tournament. Applicants will still face the same rigorous security and screening processes, and there has been no indication that nationals of countries facing travel bans will be able to enter by buying a FIFA ticket.

On Sunday, members of New York City's Senegalese diaspora were brought together by Mamdani in one of the city's most iconic courthouses, which was built 119 years ago.

In an interview with The Athletic, Mamdani said: “For a long time, a love of this game, of these countries, of this tournament, is one that New Yorkers only got to experience in their own homes or in specific neighborhoods. It hasn't been one that's been recognized by the city at large. And this is a chance to not only look at the incredible Senegalese community, the Moroccan community, and the larger African community we have in the city, but also as a chance to say that this is the city of the world and this is the world's game.

“It's time for those two things to be linked. And just five months away from bringing the World Cup to New York City, this is a chance for us to show what it can look like to repurpose the spaces of the city into ones where we celebrate the game.”

Eight World Cup matches will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final, but FIFA's host-city agreement is with both New York City and New Jersey, lending Mamdani a seat at the table.

While the Senegalese diaspora brought the noise to a Manhattan courthouse, those in their home country may be unable to travel to the tournament.

“It's something that I hope will change,” Mamdani told The Athletic, in an interview which took place just as the final began. “And I will always make the case not only for our city as the world's city, but also a city that the world can visit.

“I think that for this tournament to be the experience that we want it to be for so many, we have to think about the previous World Cups that came before it. One of them, I was lucky enough to go to (in 2010), South Africa. We have to allow the world to be here in order to fully experience the world. We also appreciate the fact that we have such incredibly strong diaspora communities in the city as well.”

Asked if it is something he can raise with Trump, Mamdani said: “I think it's part of a number of things that I will make clear about what the city is hopeful for.”

Mamdani, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, came under significant fire from Trump during his campaign to win the New York City mayoralty, but the pair had an unexpectedly warm first public meeting in the Oval Office in November, in which Trump described Mamdani as a “rational person” and added that he would be “cheering” for him.

During his campaign to become mayor, Mamdani also turned his ire on the World Cup organizers, FIFA, over its ticketing strategy. Mamdani launched a “Game Over Greed” petition that called on FIFA to abandon its plan to use dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, impose a cap on ticket resales, and set aside 15 percent of tickets for local residents at a discount.

Mamdani previously told The Athletic he had received complaints from New Yorkers over the cost of World Cup tickets and the “mess” of a ticketing system, as well as “absurd” resale prices. Since then, FIFA has rolled out prices for the World Cup that brought condemnation from supporter groups and some federations, but the governing body also claims it has received 500 million ticket requests for the competition.

On Sunday afternoon, Mamdani reiterated his concerns about FIFA's approach, saying: “I continue to think that the right approach here is to end dynamic pricing, cap resale prices, and to have 15 per cent of tickets set aside at a discount for local residents. This is in keeping with prior World Cups. We are only asking for what we have seen (before), and I will continue to make that case now as the mayor of New York City, as opposed to just a candidate.”

Mamdani said he has started to hold conversations on the matter with the New York/New Jersey host committee, but he has not yet met directly with the FIFA officials who are overseeing the ticketing process.

Mamdani is also in the process of hiring a World Cup czar to streamline local services ahead of the competition, with a focus on promoting tourism, encouraging access and affordability, and ensuring that public services scale capacity to accommodate the games and the arrival of tourists.

Mamdani said: “There are a number of different factors that would make the person who holds that position successful. They need to obviously have a passion for the game, a fluency in the different government agencies that you have to engage with and interact with to make events like this possible. What we want to do is to ensure that this is a seamless experience that is sensational, and that requires logistics, passion, ambition, imagination, all in equal parts.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Canada's co-hosting the FIFA World Cup — and preparing for a potential surge in health emergencies. Here's how","https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/fifa-world-cup-canada-health-care-resources-9.7049376","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:08:36 GMT","

As Toronto and Vancouver gear up to co-host FIFA World Cup games this summer, an emergency doctor worries that Canada's overburdened health-care system won't be able to handle any extra demand that could result.

In an editorial published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) Dr. Catherine Varner points out that Canada's health-care system is already in a ""constant state of surge capacity."" Add in hundreds of thousands of visitors, she wrote, and it could be a recipe for disaster. 

""Speaking from working right now in the middle of our flu season, where we haven't been able to handle a surge in acute care need anywhere in Canada it seems, I would be concerned going forward about having a surge in need for hospital resources,"" said Varner, CMAJ's deputy editor and an emergency doctor in downtown Toronto, in an interview with CBC News.

Her concern is supported by years of research showing that health issues — like infectious disease outbreaks, food-borne illnesses and alcohol overconsumption — can strain emergency rooms during or after mass gatherings. 

For example, researchers found that a strain of measles was introduced to Vancouver during the 2010 Olympic Winter Games and resulted in an outbreak of 82 cases three months after the event. 

Researchers have also noted that during the Calgary Stampede, there is an increase in emergency department visits related to trauma, substance-abuse and minor injuries. And research has also found that World Cup matches could trigger an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies.  

There's also the possibility of large-scale attacks that can send many to hospital, like the one that took place early last year at Vancouver's Lapu-Lapu festival. 

Varner started looking into these sorts of examples after working at a Toronto hospital during the Toronto Blue Jays' World Series run this past fall.

""We had one ICU bed available and I could not imagine what we would do if we faced an event downtown where we needed to see a lot of patients quickly,"" she said of the hospital she works at.

And while Varner says she knows that in extreme cases there's a process in place to quickly move patients and free up the emergency department, she questions how that would work given the current state of health care in Canada. 

""The challenge is execution of those plans in a health-care system that does not have enough hospital beds on any given day,"" she said. 

Canada is co-hosting this year's FIFA World Cup along with the United States and Mexico. And with six games scheduled in Toronto and seven in Vancouver, the country could see hundreds of thousands of visitors over the course of four weeks. 

Crowds of fans interacting with each other before, during and after matches is the perfect breeding ground for various infectious diseases, specifically respiratory or food and water-borne ones, according to a report from Public Health Ontario. 

Following a months-long risk assessment, the provincial health agency determined that measles, COVID-19 and food and water-borne outbreaks like food poisoning or hepatitis A, are ""likely"" during the World Cup games.  

Dr. Brian Conway, the medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, says he's most concerned about measles, given the recent outbreaks across Canada that have caused the country to lose its elimination status.

""Measles is so contagious,"" he said. ""It will spread potentially like wildfire. And that'll put a strain not only on the health-care system … but the public health system will be doing contact tracing amongst a lot of people."" 

Conway, who is not part of any health-care planning for the World Cup, said people should make sure they're up to date with their vaccinations. 

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),  some of which are on the rise in Canada, are another key concern for Conway, who says condoms and treatment for STIs should be easily available. 

He says he hopes existing disaster and surge plans will ""be enough to deal with anything that comes forward."" 

Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, the deputy chief medical officer of health with Vancouver Coastal Health, is also confident that the city will be able to handle any sort of public health emergency. 

""The health system does respond to issues like this with some regularity and does have mechanisms in place,"" said Lysyshyn, who is part of public health planning for Vancouver's FIFA games. 

""Although the health-care system operates at pretty much capacity, it does have a lot of mechanisms to get extra capacity."" 

And while Lysyshyn acknowledged that it's not ideal to have to cancel surgeries or move people around, he says that's how the system here works.

""We have to prioritize the system to deal with the problems that are most urgent."" 

St. Michael's Hospital trauma surgeon Dr. Andrew Beckett says all hospitals have robust plans to accept a large number of people in need of immediate medical attention. 

""The Taylor Swift concert, we had plans in place,"" said Beckett, who is also the medical director of the hospital's trauma program.

When it comes to the World Cup, Beckett says he's part of a planning group alongside leadership from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and Sick Kids. 

""We're looking at ways of being able to surge capacity within the hospitals by shutting down some elective surgeries if needed. Also recalling [staff] that may be in the area and available to help out in a crisis,"" said Beckett. 

He also said they would triage patients to hospitals depending on the severity of their injuries and the level of care needed. 

Beckett says the province has provided additional funding to support emergency resources during the World Cup games, though he couldn't say how much.

Ontario's Ministry of Health didn't respond to questions about extra staffing or resources available to support an increase in demand, nor did it confirm whether additional funding is available for hospitals. 

In an email last week, a spokesperson said the government will work with all health-care partners to ""ensure they have the tools they need to deliver high-quality care."" 

In a report to city council, Toronto Public Health (TPH) listed several ways it's preparing for various health emergencies, including launching a food safety portal to keep track of inspections and more easily share information about possible illnesses with the public. 

As for extreme heat or wildfire smoke, the health unit says it will amp up its communication to visitors and will have misting stations and water trucks available.

The city is also launching a wastewater testing program for the stadium and fan zone areas, which can be an early indicator of circulating infections.

A FIFA spokesperson has issued a strong statement after calls for Donald Trump to be stripped of the 2025 FIFA Peace Prize, which the US President was awarded before the FIFA World Cup draw in December 2025.

Trump was presented with the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize before the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on December 5.

The 79-year-old was given a golden trophy, medal, and certificate by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who stood alongside Trump as he made a speech to the crowd in Washington D.C.

During his speech, the US President claimed that he had saved “tens of millions of lives” through interventions and that he had “stopped wars happening just before they started”.

Advert

FIFA has described the award as something that rewards “individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world”.

However, since receiving the medal, the Trump administration has been heavily criticised for taking military action in Venezuela.

On January 2, Trump announced that US forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro along with his wife, Cilia Flores, after a covert operation.

Advert

Trump has also issued threats that the US will take military action against Iran, Mexico, Colombia, and Greenland.

The 79-year-old claims that the US “needs Greenland” for security purposes and has urged the Danish government, which rules the country, to hand the territory over to the US.

European allies have since pushed back against Trump before the US President announced plans to impose tariffs on the UK and the allies until a deal is struck for the US to take over Greenland.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the plans as “completely wrong”.

Advert

Meanwhile, in a statement to The Guardian, FIFA has doubled down on its stance to give Trump the peace prize despite the threats to take over Greenland and take military action in several other nations.

A spokesperson said: “FIFA strongly supports its annual peace prize, an award to recognise exceptional actions for peace and unity. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado] has given her medal to President Trump.

“FIFA has strong relations with President Trump, along with leaders from fellow co-hosts Canada and Mexico. This has resulted in good working relationships leading to, for example, in the US, the formation of the White House Task Force for the FIFA World Cup.”

Advert

But the Guardian also reports that there is a growing sense of embarrassment among officials within FIFA about the awarding of the peace prize to Trump.

SPORTbible has contacted FIFA for comment.

Steve Clarke is looking forward to a return to Hampden

Scotland have confirmed friendlies against fellow World Cup finalists Japan and Curacao as final home warm-up matches for this summer's tournament in the Americas.

Steve Clarke's side will face Japan on Saturday, 28 March (17:00 GMT kick-off) before taking on Curacao on Saturday, 30 May (13:00 BST).

Clarke told the Scottish FA website he is delighted to face a top-20 side as Japan visit Hampden for the first time.

""We're also looking forward to welcoming Curacao to Glasgow, which should give us a feel for the CONCACAF federation before our game against Haiti,"" he said.

It will be a first-ever meeting with the side from the Caribbean island nation, who are currently ranked 82, two places above a Haiti side who are in Scotland's World Cup group.

The Dutch islanders are currently under the guidance of former Rangers and Netherlands boss Dick Advocaat.

Hajime Moriyasu's Japan are currently 18th in the world, 18 places above Scotland, who say ""we will shortly be in a position to confirm the details for two away friendly fixtures"".

Scotland have played Japan three times, the latest being a 2-0 win for the Samurai Blue in a Yokohama friendly in 2009, having had two previous goalless draws.

Clarke is looking forward to his squad returning to Hampden for the first time since November's thrilling 4-2 win over Denmark that sealed World Cup qualification.

""It will be great to meet up with the squad for the first time since that crazy, momentous night, when they took us back to the World Cup after such a long time,"" he added.

""We can spend the first day reminiscing but then it's back to the serious business of preparing for the summer.""

I think the fans will want to give them a rousing send-off.

I think it is a good game against the Japanese, I have to say. If you look at their record at World Cups, they have been fantastic.

They are usually a joy to play against because they are an open and attack-minded side.

I advise Scotland fans to get along for that one because they have a lot of good players. Definitely a good test. 

What you usually do is try to find teams that are going to mirror the teams you are going to be playing against - and, unfortunately, that's not Japan. They don't mirror Brazil, Haiti or Morocco.

But it is about getting belief again and if you can get any sort of result against a Japanese side with the talent they've got, their players are playing around Europe and at some of the big clubs as well, and they've got real depth in their squad as well.

That will be mostly a get-together. Oddly enough, the real one is the Curacao one. For Stevie Clarke, this is a serious build-up game.

You had to get a team that were like one of the teams in our group.

Haiti are Concacaf as well and Curacao won their group, Haiti won their group, so you will look at it and say 'if we manage to win that one, it is a good bar'.

And, if you get three points from the three games, that might be just enough [to qualify from their group], so that's why that's why we've got this game.

It's an eye-catching idea, says Simon Walters, but any European leader thinking about pulling out of the summer sporting showpiece would have to contend with a backlash from fans at home

Removed from bookmarks

As a well known football fan, and one who at 63, still plays the game, Keir Starmer is among the many Britons eagerly anticipating the football World Cup in America which starts in June. With England and Scotland already having qualified, possibly to be joined by Wales and Northern Ireland, he is far from alone in this country.

Nor is Starmer the only political leader looking forward to the event. Golf fanatic Donald Trump has never expressed much interest in football – until now. As a master self-publicist he was quick to spot the huge opportunity presented to him by the fact that his presidency coincides with the World Cup taking place in America.

He has cultivated a close, some would say unhealthily so, friendship with the head of Fifa Gianni Infantino, ensuring Trump will be centre stage when the tournament kicks off.

So imagine how embarrassing it would be to Trump if some countries pulled out in protest at his threats over Greenland. How much more damaging would such a boycott be if, for example, the nation involved was one of the World Cup giants? That is the notion that has been raised by German politician Jürgen Hardt of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's ruling CDU party.

Noting the close interest Trump had taken in the event, Hardt suggested Germany, four times World Cup winners, could consider boycotting it to pressure the White House regarding its threats to annex Greenland. Such a ploy could be used “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense”, said Hardt.

Clearly, the idea of a mass World Cup boycott is far-fetched, yet there is nothing new about such sporting boycotts – or of them being supported by Britain.

There have been five boycotts of Olympic Games, including Hitler's Berlin in 1936. Widespread global support for the sporting boycott of South Africa from the 1960s to 1990s was seen as a significant factor in the demise of apartheid.

The American government itself led one of the biggest sporting boycotts of all time when it refused to take part in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. The reason? The Soviet Union had illegally invaded another country: Afghanistan.

Margaret Thatcher, then British prime minister, supported the Moscow 1980 boycott, though left it to individual sports and athletes to decide whether to take part.

Yet never mind Keir Starmer's own love of football: with his poll ratings in the equivalent of the relegation zone, it seems unlikely that he would wish to make additional enemies of millions of British football fans by joining a World Cup boycott.

Would it even work as Herr Hardt seems to think? It is true that it a 2026 World Cup without the 16 European teams due to take part, including England, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Scotland, is almost unimaginable. The winners would be world champions in name only.

Equally, Trump's supporters would doubtless argue that if Europe withdrew from the World Cup it would merely add sport to the continent's increasing economic, cultural, diplomatic and military irrelevance.

Starmer and his fellow European leaders are currently in a desperate search for some means of applying pressure to the US over Greenland. A variety of means, mainly trade reprisals have been proposed.

It will not stop calls for other ways of hitting Trump where it hurts. If the president matches his chilling threats to Denmark and Europe over Greenland with deeds, by the time he attends America's first match in the competition, against Paraguay on June 12 in Los Angeles, US troops may have taken over Greenland.

Little Denmark could still qualify for the World Cup if they win in the forthcoming play-offs.

Could they, or any other self respecting nation, take part if Trump has raised the Stars and Stripes over Greenland by then?

Manchester United have dealt a blow to Roma's hopes of signing Joshua Zirkzee, with the Italian club's director confirming Old Trafford chiefs have issued a firm ""no"" to any deal. Despite the injured Dutch forward's desire to leave in search of regular game time to boost his international prospects, United are refusing to sanction an exit, leaving caretaker boss Michael Carrick with an unhappy player as he prepares for a crucial trip to Arsenal.

United's hierarchy appears to have drawn a definitive line in the sand regarding the future of Zirkzee, leaving Roma frustrated in their pursuit of the Dutch forward. The Serie A giants have made no secret of their admiration for Zirkzee, identifying him as a key target to bolster their attacking options for the second half of the season. However, speaking to the Italian media ahead of his side's recent 2-0 victory over Torino, Roma director of football Frederic Massara conceded that a deal is now highly unlikely due to United's stubborn stance.

Massara revealed that the dialogue between the two clubs had essentially reached a dead end weeks ago. ""Manchester United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago and they have not changed their minds,"" Massara stated, painting a bleak picture for any deadline-day drama. The clarity of the rejection suggests that United are unwilling to weaken their squad depth mid-season, even for a player who is currently on the fringes of the starting 11.

For Roma, the public admission serves as a signal that they may need to move on to alternative targets. For United, it is a statement of intent that players will only leave on the club's terms, regardless of interest from elite European rivals. The decision locks Zirkzee into the squad at Old Trafford for the remainder of the campaign, forcing him to fight for his place once he returns to full fitness.

The forward is currently sidelined with an injury, a setback that saw him watching United's emphatic derby victory over Manchester City from the directors' box rather than contributing on the pitch. While his teammates celebrated a morale-boosting win, Zirkzee's personal focus has reportedly been on securing a pathway to regular first-team football.

The Dutchman is reportedly desperate to leave Old Trafford to further his international ambitions. With the Netherlands national team selection remaining highly competitive, Zirkzee knows that bench-warming duties at United will do little to impress coach Ronald Koeman ahead of the World Cup. A move to Roma, where he would likely have been offered a more prominent role, was seen as the ideal solution to reignite his season and stake a claim for an international spot.

Instead, he faces the prospect of reintegrating into a squad where competition is fierce and the manager's position is in a state of flux. Carrick, in charge until the end of the season, will now be tasked with managing the morale of a player who has been explicitly told he cannot leave, despite making his desire to exit clear.

While the door remains shut for Zirkzee, speculation continues to swirl regarding potential arrivals at Old Trafford. Reports have intensified over the weekend suggesting that a deal for former Wolves skipper Ruben Neves could be edging closer, adding fuel to the fire that United are looking to add experience to their midfield engine room. Neves, a player long admired by the Old Trafford faithful, would bring a proven Premier League pedigree to Carrick's squad.

However, club sources have repeatedly sought to dampen expectations of a busy January window. The official line from the red half of Manchester is that signings will only be sanctioned if they align with a ""long-term plan"". This cautious approach has already seen them miss out on other targets, most notably Antoine Semenyo.

The Semenyo situation serves as a painful reminder of United's current transfer market struggles. The forward turned down a move to Old Trafford in favour of joining rivals Manchester City, a decision that stung even more when he featured against United in Saturday's derby.

Amidst the transfer noise and boardroom posturing, Carrick must keep the squad focused on matters on the pitch. United fans have enjoyed an excellent weekend following the victory over City, a result that has injected a much-needed dose of optimism into the fanbase. The win at Old Trafford was a tactical triumph for Carrick, proving that this squad still possesses the quality to compete with the very best when properly motivated.

However, the challenges for Carrick do not get any easier as he prepares his side for a daunting trip to face Arsenal on Sunday. The Gunners are a formidable prospect on their home turf, and United will need to replicate the intensity and discipline shown in the derby to take anything from the game.

Carrick's ability to insulate his players from the transfer speculation surrounding Zirkzee and Neves will be vital. With the squad settled for now, the interim manager can now demand total focus. The ""No"" given to Roma regarding Zirkzee may have been a headache for the player, but for Carrick, it ensures he retains his depth as he attempts to navigate a defining run of fixtures for the club.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

It has been revealed that Tottenham midfielder Pape Matar Sarr was rushed to hospital after falling ill during the Africa Cup of Nations final. The 23-year-old had been named among Senegal's substitutes for a meeting with hosts Morocco. He never made it onto the field and missed post-match celebrations, following a chaotic contest, after requiring medical assistance.

It is claimed that Sarr complained of feeling unwell during the half-time interval. Just minutes prior to that, he had been sent out to warm up on the touchline, with Senegal's coaching team considering changes after Monaco star Lamine Camara picked up a knock.

He was eventually cleared to continue and Sarr never made his way back to the bench. Senegal lost Krepin Diatta and Ousseynou Niang prior to a ball being kicked, with head coach Pape Thiaw seeing his pre-game plans disrupted.

Video footage has emerged of Diatta hunched over the advertising hoardings at the side of the field, while Niang had to be physically carried and escorted back to the dressing room by his international colleagues after taking a turn for the worse.

The wellbeing of their close friends and team-mates provided an unwelcome distraction for Senegal as they sought to capture a continental crown. Camara did, however, tell reporters when asked for an update on Sarr, Diatta and Niang: “They're in the hospital, but I hope they're doing well.”

Senegalese news outlet Taggat went on to report that: “The three players are doing well, according to the doctor, at Mohammed VI Hospital in Rabat. Ousseynou Niang will return to the hotel. Krepin Diatta and Pape Matar Sarr are still being kept at the hospital for further observations.”

Belgian outfit Royale Union Saint-Gilloise, who are competing in the Champions League this season, confirmed that Niang - who is contracted to them - had been well enough to join in with wild celebrations. They posted online: “Ousseynou Niang is an AFCON winner! After extra time, the Lions of Teranga defeated Morocco 1-0 in the final. Niang felt unwell before the game and was taken to hospital along with two team-mates. It has since been confirmed he is doing well and has rejoined the Senegalese squad.”

Senegal defender Ismail Jakobs said during his discussions with members of the assembled press in the mixed zone: “A lot happened before the match. I think a lot will come out afterwards. It wasn't just this situation. Plenty happened before the match too. But you'll find out. A lot happened to Krepin, Ousseynou, and Pape Matar Sarr at half-time.”

Everton star Idrissa Gana Gueye paid tribute to those that missed out on the chance to savour a joyous occasion for their nation: “This victory is for them; we had that in mind.”

Senegal prevailed 1-0 on the night, with Villarreal midfielder Pape Gueye netting what proved to be the decisive goal in the 94th minute - with extra-time required in order to determine a winner.

A controversial contest saw Crystal Palace forward Ismaila Sarr have a late goal chalked off for Senegal following a supposed foul on Paris Saint-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi. Morocco were then awarded a penalty deep into stoppage-time.

Another soft call there led to some Senegal players storming off the field in protest, led by head coach Thiaw. They were, however, beckoned back by Sadio Mane - with the former Liverpool star, who is now with Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League, displaying commendable leadership skills as captain of his country.

He eventually got his hands on the trophy as Brahim Diaz fluffed his lines from the spot. The Real Madrid winger bizarrely chose to clip a Panenka effort straight down the middle, and saw ex-Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy catch his shot with ease.

Senegal are said to be planning a trophy parade when returning to their homeland on Tuesday, with it yet to be determined whether Sarr will form part of those celebrations in Dakar before he heads back to north London.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Kylian Mbappe has sought to defend Real Madrid team-mates Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham from the brutal boos that have come their way. Restless natives at the Bernabeu took to jeering their own players during a La Liga clash with Levante, with certain individuals considered to have contributed to club legend Xabi Alonso losing his job as manager.

World Cup winner Alonso lasted just seven months at the helm, having returned to familiar surroundings during the summer of 2025. He clashed with several prominent figures in a squad that is loaded with ‘Galacticos'.

Vinicius, Bellingham and Fede Valverde are among those who are said to have butted heads with a coach who did not always bow to their demands. As a result, Madrid locals took to jeering the superstar performers during a 2-0 win that took them to within a point of Clasico rivals Barcelona at the top of La Liga.

Mbappe was spared abuse from the stands, as he continued his return from injury, but can appreciate why fans are feeling frustrated. He is, however, of the opinion that everybody should be given the same treatment if there are any grievances to iron out.

He told reporters ahead of a Champions League reunion with his former employers at Monaco on Tuesday - with that contest also set to take place in the hostile surroundings of the Bernabeu: “The whistling… I think I understand it. I get it. Before I was a footballer, I was a young man, and when I wasn't happy, I'd talk badly about the players, and if I was at the stadium, I'd whistle. I understand it because we're not doing things right.

“What I didn't like was that if they're going to whistle, it should be the whole squad. You shouldn't single out one player. We're doing poorly as a team, and we have the character to change this on the pitch. I don't see the Real Madrid fans as being against us. They're angry, and I'm sure they'll come back to support us.”

Mbappe went on to say of Brazilian winger Vinicius being singled out across Real's last three home games: “Of course, it's not Vini's fault. It's the fault of the entire squad. That's all I have to say to the fans. Let them boo the whole team. We have to accept it, it's our job. We know that. But we can't single out a few and say it's their fault. It's everyone's fault. At Real Madrid, there are moments like this, and we have to change that.

“I'm not Vini. If you want, I'll find him. I don't have to give advice. I'm nobody to give advice. My only responsibility is to take care of him, to protect him… When he's happy, it's different.”

The Frenchman added on Vinicius getting emotional amid taunts from the crowd: “Vini, like you, like her, like everyone. He's a human being. He's a fantastic player. He's an incredible guy, I'm lucky to know him and I'm very fond of him. We have to protect him better. So he's not alone against everyone. He's not alone at Real Madrid. We're all with him. If he's at his best, he's one of the best in the world.”

Mbappe said of England international midfielder Bellingham also becoming a target for disgruntled fans, having once been lauded as a superhero: “No one doubts Bellingham's quality. He has so much potential. When he's fit, he's one of the best in the world. 

“It's tough, for everyone. We can accept that the fans aren't happy. But they should boo everyone, it's not about Jude's fault or one player in particular. It's our job to change the situation. We won in the league and now we have to keep going in the Champions League. If the fans see that we're putting in the effort, that we're playing well, they'll be back with us.”

Real head into a meeting with Monaco sat seventh in the Champions League table. They have just two games left in which to secure a top-eight finish and automatic qualification for the last 16.

Having everybody pulling in the same direction, on and off the pitch, will be imperative as more major honours are chased down at home and abroad. In the wake of Alonso's shock dismissal, Alvaro Arbeloa remains in interim charge of first-team affairs.

Penalty kick technique, how to do it & players who used it after Brahim Diaz's Africa Cup of Nations disaster","https://www.goal.com/en-ca/news/what-is-the-panenka-penalty-kick-technique-how-to-do-it--players-who-used-it/1esy8dk0ur6x31r1t4g1j6bzsi","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:00:00 GMT","

GOAL takes a look at the history of a move that has revolutionised the way that spot kicks are taken since coming to prominence in 1976

The Panenka is an ingenious but simple way of taking a penalty kick, which sees the taker chip the ball down the centre of the goal.

Brahim Diaz was left red-faced after his failed attempt in the Africa Cup of Nations 2025 final, while Achraf Hakimi successfully executed an outrageous panenka to help Morocco secure a historic quarter-final berth with a penalty shoot-out victory against Spain at the 2022 World Cup.

Karim Benzema made headlines in the 2021-22 Champions League semi-final as he pulled off a Panenka penalty in a high-pressure situation to score Real Madrid's third goal in their 4-3 first-leg defeat to Manchester City.

So what is the Panenka penalty and who else has tried it? GOAL takes a look!

The Panenka was invented by Antonin Panenka and shot to fame in 1976, when the Czechoslovakian star used it to outfox legendary Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Sepp Maier during the European Championship final.

The Czechs had squandered a 2-0 lead during 90 minutes of that encounter and were forced into extra-time and subsequently penalties.

After the first seven kicks were scored, Uli Hoeness missed for the Germans, giving Panenka the opportunity to win the tournament.

The following seconds, which saw Maier dive off to his left as the ball simply floated into the middle of the goal, would go down in footballing history as the birth of a new skill, a revolutionary manner from which to score from 12 years.

Pele described it as the work of “either a genius or a madman”, while the Czech has been forced to defend himself from accusations of showboating on one of the game's biggest stages.

“I suspect that Maier doesn't like the sound of my name too much. I never wished to make him look ridiculous,” Panenka told UEFA.com.

“On the contrary, I chose the penalty because I saw and realised it was the easiest and simplest recipe for scoring a goal. It is a simple recipe.”

Since the skill was first performed back in 1976, it has been used with increasing regularity by some of the game's greatest players in some of the biggest moments.

Perhaps the most famous Panenka came in the World Cup final of 2006, when Zinedine Zidane gave France a 1-0 lead over Italy by lifting such a penalty into the goal of Gianluigi Buffon. Of course, the match ended in disappointment for Zizou as he was sent off and France lost via a shootout, but it remains a moment etched in the folklore of the game.

Andrea Pirlo is another to have successfully used the penalty, with the Italy great notably converting during a Euro 2012 shootout against England.

“I made my decision right at the last second, when I saw Joe Hart, the England goalie, doing all sorts on his line,” he explained.

“As I began my run up, I still hadn't decided what I was going to do. And then he moved and my mind was made up. It was all impromptu, not premeditated. The only way I could see pushing my chances of scoring close to 100%.”

In the modern game, Argentine icon Lionel Messi has pulled the skill off on numerous occasions, while Eden Hazard, Memphis Depay and Raheem Sterling have all used the technique but the man himself seems to prefer those taken by legendary Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.  

“Ramos is undoubtedly one of the best in the world,” he told AS the day after the centre-back had clipped home an effort against Celta in La Liga.

“I remember that the first ones he took were not the prettiest ones, but all have gone in, and that is the important thing in the end.

“The kick was one of the most elegantly executed Panenka penalties I've ever seen him do. I really enjoyed it and I appreciated it. A great goal, without a doubt.”

Ramos' former Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema has also pulled off a perfect Panenka, with the striker showing nerves of steel to deceive Ederson and pull the Blancos back to a 4-3 scoreline against Manchester City in the first leg of their 2021-22 Champions League semi-final tie.

Sebastian Abreu is possibly the most prolific taker of such kicks, but given that he is nicknamed ‘El Loco', that is to be expected. It is a not a tag that he necessarily appreciates, though.

After netting in the 2014 World Cup for Uruguay against Ghana in a shootout using the method, he said: “What adjective did you use to describe Zidane's penalty? Crazy? No, magic. So why not Abreu?”

He can even claim to have scored two Panenkas in one game, doing so twice as Botafoga came back to beat Fluminense 3-2 away from home in 2011.

Of course, the nature of the technique and the high-pressure situations in which it is often used makes it a risky option and not all have been as fortunate as Ramos to see their shots find the net.

“I was watching Memphis Depay score one yesterday and decided at the last moment. I am stupid!” Aleksandar Mitrovic lamented as putting too much elevation on his chip during an international between his Serbia side and Montenegro.

Gary Lineker also famously fluffed an effort in a 1992 friendly for England against Brazil, missing his opportunity to equal the goal-scoring record for his nation as he scuffed his effort, which resulted in a straightforward save.

Perhaps the costliest failed attempt, though, came from Frenchman Yann Kermorgant while playing for Leicester in a 2010 play-off semi-final against Cardiff, which could have seen the Foxes promoted to the Premier League. He did not get enough height or power on his effort, which resulted in an easy save for Bluebirds keeper David Marshall.

Real Madrid's Brahim Diaz made the humiliating error of putting too little power into his Panenka attempt in the final of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, while earlier that season, Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher gave Enzo Le Fee an ironic thumbs up after the Sunderland forward chipped the ball neatly into his hands in a Premier League game.

As the whole technique is based upon the assumption that the goalkeeper will dive to one corner or another, disguise is crucial to making a successful conversion.

It is, therefore, important that there is no difference between your usual run up and the one you use when taking a Panenka. Only when the ball is struck should the difference become evident.

Try striking the ball with the area of your boot roughly where the inside of your big toe is. It can also help to keep a straight leg when trying the technique and it is important to lean back slightly – but not too much – to get elevation on the shot.

Staying relaxed is important, which makes the execution of the kick on a bigger stage all the more impressive.

Remember, like everything, practice makes perfect and this tricky skill should come to you in time.

Jurgen Klopp says he ""doesn't expect"" to change his mind and go back into management amid links with Real Madrid. The German hasn't been in the dugout since leaving Liverpool in 2024, and despite showing no signs of returning to coaching, the managerial links keep coming. Now, Red Bull's global head of football has addressed his future, and whether or not he considers himself ""world class"".

Following Xabi Alonso's Madrid sacking last week, Klopp has once again been linked with that highly-coveted post, despite working at Red Bull and Alvaro Arbeloa now being in the Los Blancos dugout. In light of Alonso's departure, which Madrid say was a ""mutual"" decision, the Spanish giants thanked him for his service, despite being in the role for just over half a year.

""Xabi Alonso will always have the affection and admiration of all Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has always represented the values of our club. Real Madrid will always be his home,"" they said in a statement. ""Our club thanks Xabi Alonso and his entire coaching staff for their work and dedication throughout this time, and wishes them the best of luck in this new stage of their lives.""

Not long after, Alonso released a classy response of his own on social media.

""This professional stage concludes, and it has not turned out as we would have liked. Coaching Real Madrid has been an honour and a responsibility,"" Alonso wrote on Instagram. ""I thank the club, the players and above all the fans and Madrid fans for their trust and support. I leave with respect, gratitude, and pride that I did my best.""

Such is Klopp's pedigree, and the fact that he did so well at Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool, he is always likely to be linked with top managerial jobs. Over the weekend, the German was asked about the Santiago Bernabeu hotseat, something he playfully dismissed. 

As custom, Klopp belted out his trademark laugh in response to the remark, before politely adding: ""Yeah, it's great. Maybe some of them [at Real] watched the [basketball] game (between Orlando Magic and the Memphis Grizzlies) tonight.""

On Monday, Klopp went a step further, saying he has no real desire to get back into management for the foreseeable future. In fact, he may not return to management at all.

""I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know,"" Klopp said. ""We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room. There was another small room and I said, 'This is enough because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any.' It might sound arrogant but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.""



Despite leading Liverpool to Champions League and Premier League glory during his Anfield tenure, as well as doing wonders at Dortmund, Klopp downplayed his achievements as a manager. He certainly does not feel that he was one of the best coaches in the world.

""I never considered myself a world-class coach because I still had so many questions when I finished,"" Klopp told reporters in Leipzig. ""I was like, 'How can I be world-class with these questions still?' I never watch the goals back because I want to understand the game to the left and the right of the result. I want to understand why it happened... Results are the result of the performance. So we worked on the performance and the results came later.""

For the time being, it seems Klopp is more than content in his role at Red Bull. If a high-profile job does become available in the coming years, it is up in the air whether the German will be tempted to coach a team again or if he has bowed out for good.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Sources: Premier League interest in USMNT star Ricardo Pepi remains despite injury after PSV reject Fulham's $35m bid","https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/sources-premier-league-interest-in-usmnt-star-ricardo-pepi-remains-despite-injury-after-psv-reject-fulham-s-usd35m-bid/blt195b4a5a377ff21f","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:06:13 GMT","

Fulham have made a $35 million (€30 million) offer for U.S. men's national team star Ricardo Pepi, GOAL can confirm, and, despite seeing that bid rejected, several English clubs remain interested in the forward. The offer comes despite Pepi's recent arm injury, which hasn't prevented Premier League clubs from making a push to sign the striker this January.

GOAL can confirm that Fulham are among the teams looking to sign Pepi this January. The Premier League club is among several sides in England interested in Pepi, who commanded similar interest last summer before suffering a knee injury. 

This January, the American striker is dealing with a broken arm suffered in a recent match for his current club, PSV. The injury occurred as Pepi slid to fire home a goal in a 5-1 win over Excelsior. PSV has since confirmed that Pepi has undergone surgery and that he is expected to miss two months of matches.

Prior to the injury, Premier League clubs were already monitoring Pepi closely during the January window, and that interest has continued despite the expectation that he would not be available until March. Fabrizio Romano first reported that clubs remain interested despite the setback, while The Athletic previously reported that PSV rejected an initial $35 million bid from Fulham.

The Premier League interest comes after Pepi was the subject of similar discussions last January after a breakout at PSV. Sources confirmed to GOAL last year that Pepi was the subject of a $20.7M (€20M) bid from a Premier League club, although his knee injury and PSV's reluctance to sell ended any possibility of a move. Sources also confirmed that PSV rejected a loan-to-buy offer from West Ham last year.

After initially earning his Eredivisie stripes during a 13-goal loan spell at Groningen, Pepi joined PSV in 2023 in a $9.8 million transfer. He largely came off the bench for his first season-and-a-half, scoring nine goals during his first campaign with the club. However, he broke into the XI in the final months of 2024 by scoring 17 goals in all competitions before a knee injury sidelined him in January. 

After building fitness to start this season, Pepi has once again earned his place in the XI and has 11 goals in 22 appearances this season. That includes eight goals in just 716 Eredivisie minutes as well as goals against Napoli, Olympiacos, and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, all off the bench.

With Pepi out of action, PSV will look to maintain the club's stranglehold on the Eredivisie, which they currently lead by 16 points. Pepi, meanwhile, will face a race to recover in time for the next USMNT camp, which comes in March.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 The rejuvenation of Daniil Medvedev showed little sign of slowing down on Monday at the Australian Open. 

 The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings eased past Jesper de Jong 7-5, 6-2, 7-6(2) to book his second-round spot at the hard-court major and improve to 6-0 for the 2026 season. Medvedev, who began his year by lifting the trophy at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ, converted seven of 13 break points he earned against De Jong, according to Infosys Stats. 

DANIIL DELIVERS 📮He moves past de Jong 7-5 6-2 7-6(2) ⚡️#AustralianOpen pic.twitter.com/m9YKNzBUPe

 Medvedev twice let slip a break lead in the opening set but still claimed it, and he carried that momentum into the second to take complete control in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with World No. 73 De Jong.  Medvedev then twice failed to serve out for the match in the third set, at 5-4 and 6-5, but he dominated the subsequent tie-break to seal his two-hour, 53-minute victory. 

 After a largely difficult 2025 season in which he won just one Grand Slam match (at the Australian Open), Medvedev finished the year well and lifted an ATP 250 title in Almaty. He will hope to continue his success under coaches Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke when he takes on Quentin Halys in the second round in Melbourne. Frenchman Halys defeated Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-2, 7-6(2) to advance. 

 “Today was not easy. First match, different tournament, a Grand Slam,"" said Medvedev in his on-court interview. ""Last year, I lost almost [each major] in the first round, except here actually, so I'm happy to win in straight sets, even if some of them were up and down. The conditions felt slow, so we were both breaking each other's serve a lot. The most important [thing] is to win and hopefully I can play better next round.” 

 Home favourite Alex de Minaur wasted little time joining Medvedev in the second round. The World No. 6 raced to a 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 triumph against Mackenzie McDonald inside Rod Laver Arena to improve to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP  Head2Head series. 

 ""It feels great to get started here at the Australian Open,"" said De Minaur in his post-match press conference. ""Happy with the performance. It's never easy first match coming in. It was a tricky opponent, and I navigated my way through and did what I needed to do. Yeah, overall happy with the performance and ready for the next challenge."" 

 De Minaur reached the Australian Open quarter-finals for the first time in 2025. His next opponent at this year's edition of his home major will be Hamad Medjedovic, who held off Mariano Navone for a 6-2, 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 first-round win. 

 Tommy Paul, Andrey Rublev and Reilly Opelka were among the other players to advance early on Monday. The 19th-seeded Paul downed his fellow American Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, while 13th seed Rublev overcame Matteo Arnaldi 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Opelka fired 23 aces in his 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory against #NextGenATP star Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.

Seventh seed Felix Auger-Aliassime retired due to cramp during his first-round match at the Australian Open on Monday. Portugal's Nuno Borges led 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 when the Canadian could not continue.

Auger-Aliassime, 25, reached the semi-finals of last year's US Open and was seeking to begin the 2026 major season in similar form. But struggling with his upper left leg, Auger-Aliassime called a medical time out late in the third set and again received treatment before the start of the fourth set. After playing two points in the fourth set, Auger-Aliassime retired.

""I'm okay, but I just started cramping at the start of the third set,"" Auger-Aliassime said. ""It became very difficult to be competitive at this level.
I tried for a set, but yeah, wasn't possible today.""

“I feel for him,” Borges said of Auger-Aliassime. “I know how he feels to struggle physically and it is part of tennis. I hope he gets better quickly and back to his best level.


“It's a great win for me either way. I thought I competed well. Maybe if he was 100 per cent, it would've been a different score, but I'm really happy to push through this one and get another opportunity on Wednesday.”





Borges, who reached the fourth round in Melbourne in 2024, will next meet Juan Manuel Cerundolo or Aussie wild card Jordan Thompson. The 28-year-old Borges made the third round last year before falling to Carlos Alcaraz in four sets.

Auger-Aliassime believes he began cramping in the third set, but admitted it is tough to recall. 

""Obviously you don't panic. You think, 'Oh, maybe it was just one bad movement or one jump that didn't feel right',"" Auger-Aliassime said. ""But then as I started moving left and right, having to sprint, and every time I cramped, you know what's happening.""

It is not the first time Auger-Aliassime has cramped, so he was aware of what was happening. But that did not make it any less disappointing.

""I want to be on the court winning. I want to be on the court competing with my opponent,"" Auger-Aliassime said. ""I don't want to be just standing there like a punching bag. So there's no point, and you know to move on.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Djokovic celebrates 100th Australian Open win as title quest begins","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-martinez-australian-open-2026-monday","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:56:15 GMT","

Novak Djokovic marked a triumphant return to his most successful event on Monday at the Australian Open, where he added another historic milestone at the hard-court major.

The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings delivered a near-flawless display to defeat Pedro Martinez 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, sealing his 100th career victory at Melbourne Park. The record 10-time Australian Open champion, Djokovic will now set his sights on surpassing Roger Federer's all-time mark of 102 match wins at the tournament.

Feels just like home 🇦🇺@DjokerNole defeats Martinez 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the second round for the 19th time.@AustralianOpen | #AO26pic.twitter.com/zEyX7ORiOh

“What can I say? I like the sound of it… Centurion is pretty nice,” Djokovic said. “It's nice to be a centurion in these numbers. History making is a great motivation, particularly in the last five, 10 years of my career. Once I got myself in a position to create history, I was even more inspired to play the best tennis.

“I was very fortunate early on to encounter some people that taught me and guided me to play the long shot with my career: not to burn out too quickly, and try to have the longest career possible. I'm blessed to still be playing at this level.”

Djokovic has now recorded 100 or more victories at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and is the only player to achieve that feat at three different major tournaments. 

Djokovic's record at Grand Slam tournaments (prior to AO R2)



Advancing to the second round in his 19th consecutive Australian Open appearance, Djokovic will next face 23-year-old Italian qualifier Francesco Maestrelli. The debutant fought past Terence Atmane 6-4, 3-6, 6-7(4), 6-1, 6-1 to earn his first main-draw victory at a major. 

Amid lingering questions surrounding his fitness, particularly during last year's run to the semi-finals in New York, Djokovic looked extremely sharp and mobile. In his first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Martinez — and first match since winning the Athens title in November — Djokovic controlled play from the baseline and struck more than three times as many winners as the Spaniard (49-14).

The 38-year-old Serbian reached the semi-finals at all four Grand Slams last season, and his pursuit of an 11th Melbourne crown could hinge on a potential semi-final showdown with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner.





Casper Ruud also safely advanced to the second round by defeating Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 for his 50th major win. The 27-year-old, who is expecting a daughter alongside his wife, Maria, will next meet Jaume Munar after the Spaniard battled past Dalibor Svrcina 3-6, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5, 6-3.

“It was a perfect start to this tournament and this court is probably one of my favourites in the world,” 12th seed Ruud said of Margaret Court Arena. “It's a really good atmosphere and a great way to kick off. I'm excited to be back here in a couple of days. I have to thank Maria for letting me [come] in the first place. I know she's back home resting, getting ready.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Djokovic jokes about Alcaraz's new serve: 'We have to speak about copyrights'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-reaction-australian-open-2026-monday","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:50:01 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz's new-look serve has been the hot topic around the tennis world this past week and the Spaniard himself admitted in Melbourne that there might be a familiar influence behind it.

That influence? Novak Djokovic.

On Monday night at the Australian Open, Djokovic was finally asked about the resemblance and he didn't miss the chance to have some fun with it.

“As soon as I saw it, I sent him a message. I said, we have to speak about the copyrights,” Djokovic said with a smile. “Then when I saw him here, I told him we have to talk about percentage of his winnings. Every ace I expect, you know, a tribute to me. Every ace that he makes here. Let's see if he's going to stick to the agreement.”



Djokovic, who could only meet Alcaraz in the final in Melbourne, was doing plenty of damage on his own serve in his first-round win at the Australian Open on Monday.

The record 10-time champion won 93 per cent of his first-serve points and did not face a break point en route to victory against Pedro Martinez. Djokovic has now won 100 matches at the hard-court major, moving to within two wins of Roger Federer's all-time mark of 102.

The 38-year-old Serbian was pleased with how he started.

“It felt good tonight. Let's see how it's going to feel in a few days' time,” Djokovic said on how his body and mind are feeling. “Performance-wise, the feeling on the court, it was great. I couldn't ask for more. Obviously a great serving performance. Just overall felt really good on the court that has made me feel good on it for so many times throughout my career.”

The No. 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic will next face Italian Francesco Maestrelli in what will be a first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting between the two.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Wild card Wawrinka rallies into Australian Open R2","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/wawrinka-djere-australian-open-2026-monday","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:08:00 GMT","

Stan Wawrinka rode a wave fan support to notch his first Australian Open win in five years Monday.

The 40-year-old Swiss, who is playing his final year on Tour, rallied from a set down to defeat Serbian Laslo Djere 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(4) to charge into the second round.

Despite only a light smattering of Swiss flags and red shirts in the crowd on a packed Kia Arena, the 2014 Australian Open champion received overwhelming support as he snapped a four-match losing streak at the majors to take his first Grand Slam match win since Wimbledon 2024.

“It has been a long journey. It has been amazing, so many memories here, it has been incredible. The only reason I come back is because of the love you give me, it was amazing today,” Wawrinka said in his on-court interview. “It is my last year. The passion is still intact. I am not young anymore, so I have to be careful.

“Today was amazing, so special to be on court and at a Grand Slam. It is the reason I train hard every day with my team, to be here competing with the best players in the world. I am so happy I won and have a chance to play one more match here. I am trying to enjoy but I am also a competitor, so I am always going to fight and hopefully I will play another good match.”








Resorting to many defensive slices when his 40-year-old legs were stretched into the corners, Wawrinka hung with Djere in longer rallies, winning 58 per cent of points of nine or more shots according to Infosys Match Stats

The Swiss was also dominant on serve, winning 86 per cent of first serves and 64 per cent of second serves. He earned 18 break points in the match, converting three, including a boomerang break in the fourth set after he fell behind 2-4.

“I've been working again more on my serve, especially to get more free points, to serve better. I'm happy it helps me in matches like today,” Wawrinka said. “I had many opportunities to break… That's when I start to be a little bit late or a bit passive, and I let the other opponent play much more aggressively than me.

“At the end, it was great to get through a match like that, even with many opportunities to stay with him, to break back in the fourth, and to win with the tiebreak.”

Wawrinka, who also won Roland Garros in 2015 and the US Open in 2016, will next play the winner of 17th seeded Czech Jiri Lehecka and 21-year-old French qualifier Arthur Gea.

A former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Wawrinka is making his 20th Australian Open appearance and 75th start overall at the majors.

Damian Kust, a respected tennis journalist who was cherished for his unmatched coverage of the ATP Challenger circuit, passed away on 6 January at the age of 26.


Kust constantly highlighted lower-ranked players who might otherwise have gone unheralded. As he wrote in his bio on social media, Kust covered the “unsung heroes”.

“Damian Kust's passing is a huge loss for the tennis world, especially for the Challenger circuit he followed so closely,"" said tennis journalist and commentator José Morgado. ""His passion for the sport was rare and deeply genuine — he didn't just report results, he told the stories of players, tournaments and moments that often go unnoticed.


“The sadness felt across the tennis community speaks volumes about the impact he had. Damian gave visibility, respect and voice to a level of tennis that thrives on dedication and perseverance, much like his own work. He will be remembered not only as a journalist, but as a true lover of the game.”


Every week, Kust posted on X a list of the champions across the Challenger circuit, and during the four majors he offered insightful breakdowns of the qualifiers who fought their way into the main draw. Kust's work was expansive, deeply informative and always accessible.

“Damian was a really special person,"" said commentator Mike Cation. ""Aside from being just an incredible resource for both fans and media alike, his passion for a level of the sport that is under-publicised and under-loved was crystal clear. He got involved because he loved it, and his work made all of us love Challenger level tennis even more.


“I know there were many times when I might not have known something for certain about a player or tournament, and I knew I could count on him having that information, which he shared with all of us freely. Our Challenger eco-system suffered a major, major loss with his passing, and he will be greatly missed.”

Credit: Rafał Jagielski/Kozerki Open 2025


Kust's wide-ranging expertise and dedicated attention to all levels of tennis helped others develop greater appreciation and interest in the sport, especially ATP Challenger events, which he frequently visited. And if Kust was not there in person, he was certainly following online. Each week, he engaged fans by posting a poll inviting them to vote on the best Challenger match of the week.


Kust will be deeply missed by the tennis community. He left a lasting impact on the sport he loved and those who came to know him.

“If you were to ask me the best part about working in tennis, I wouldn't hesitate to say it's the people — and Damian was the best of us,"" said reporter Blair Henley. ""He tirelessly covered this sport for the love of the game, and shined a light on players who may not have had their stories told otherwise. 


“It can be challenging for analysts who aren't former pros to enter the tennis media space, and the fact that Damian was able to do so seamlessly and garner so much respect from every corner of the tennis world speaks to his work ethic, knowledge base and most importantly, his kindness. He'll be sorely missed.”


Robbie Koenig, tennis commentator, added: “Damian was such a great supporter of the sport, and his informative insights and covering of the Challenger Tour with such vigour, really helped highlight how great those players are. The sport of tennis has lost a good one… RIP DK”

No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek came in the clutch winning three of the final four games and the tiebreak in the first set to spearhead a 7-6 (5). 6-3 win over Yuan Yue. The six-time Grand Slam champion defeated the qualifier behind 24 winners and taking 72% of the points on her first-serve.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Iga Swiatek advanced to the second round of the Australian Open on Sunday, defeating Yuan Yue 7-6(5), 6-3 after being pushed to a first-set tiebreak.

Swiatek had been far more comfortable in their previous meeting, dropping only three games, but Yuan raised her level this time by extending rallies and holding serve, pushing the first set to a tiebreak before Swiatek closed out the match in two hours.

Swiatek's composure showed late in the opening set. Yuan served for the set at 5-4 and stayed level through the tiebreak, but Swiatek began to take control of the exchanges, finishing the night with 24 winners. Several landed so close to the lines that Yuan hesitated, a reflection of Swiatek's precision under pressure.

""There were some moments where I felt great, but the start of the match wasn't that perfect,"" Swiatek said in press afterward. ""I'm happy that I worked through this and could, yeah, finish in two sets as you said. Also during tiebreak play more aggressively and more precise.""

Swiatek carried that momentum into the second set, winning the first three games. She won 72% of points on her first serve and took advantage of Yuan's second serve, capturing 21 of 34 points (62%).

At 4-3 in the second set, Swiatek took the final two games with one more break -- she won nearly half (40-of-82) of receiving points, compared to Yuan's 36% -- and earned her 25th straight Grand Slam first-round win on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. 

Yuan, who won three qualifying matches to enter the first round, jumped out to an early lead with a break of Swiatek and a hold in the first set. She often matched Swiatek's power in their rallies, and Swiatek racked up 21 unforced errors to Yuan's 13 in the first set. Compared to their first meeting where Yuan had just one break point opportunity, she converted 3-of-7.

Though Swiatek tied the first set at 3-3, Yuan's next two games followed a similar pattern with a break and hold, setting herself up with two games to close the first set. Swiatek bounced back winning three of the next four games to force the tiebreak, which Yuan managed to win five points. 

In the second set, after falling 3-0 and taking a medical timeout for a lower back issue, Yuan won three of the next four, including a 16-point, 10-minute game to cut the deficit to 4-3. 

""I think she played well,"" Swiatek said of her opponent. ""She used the opportunities that I gave her a bit. Yeah, was kind of playing pretty strong from the forehand side. She was for sure going for her shots, playing fast. Yeah, she played good.""

In the first set tiebreak, Yuan and Swiatek alternated points up until Swiatek led 5-4. During the the 10th point of the tiebreak, Yuan kept traded strong shots back-and-forth, but an incidental net cord forced Swiatek to come to the net. 

The World No. 2 had several backhand winners, but none more momentous than this one. Despite the net cord, Swiatek's quick adjustment allowed her to smash home a backhand winner -- she had 15 winners in the first alone -- and create a double set point opportunity. Though Yuan saved one with an ace, another Swiatek backhand winner ended the set.

No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek came in the clutch winning three of the final four games and the tiebreak in the first set to spearhead a 7-6 (5). 6-3 win over Yuan Yue. The six-time Grand Slam champion defeated the qualifier behind 24 winners and taking 72% of the points on her first-serve.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Alycia Parks overcame a 0-6 first set and an energetic Court 6 crowd to defeat Alexandra Eala in three sets to advance to the second round of the Australian Open. Behind 12 aces, Parks regrouped and stayed 'in the zone' to pull off the win.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- From the first-set bagel to the pro-Alexandra Eala crowd, Alycia Parks had her back against the wall.

All signs initially pointed to a straight-sets victory for Eala, but Parks came back and pulled off a stunning 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 win in the Australian Open first round. Parks said she finally started hitting her spots, converted more first serves and became more aggressive in the final two sets, and that was the key to overcoming the rowdy audience.

""It was very difficult,"" Parks said to reporters. ""I was expecting it, but I (also) wasn't. She definitely has a good crowd. I just kept telling myself to stay in the zone.""

To set the scene, the queue to watch Alexandra Eala's match on Court 6 at Melbourne Park on Monday afternoon was unbelievable. Hundreds of people organizing in a line that extended all the way back, adjacent to Rod Laver Arena, waiting for a spot to watch the 20-year-old's main draw debut at the Australian Open. It was also Parks' second time in main draw in Melbourne.

""It was so heart-warming,"" Eala said. ""That's one of the things that makes a loss like today a little bit harder is I know a lot of people were rooting for me. Then again Alycia played really well. And you know I just hope that the support continues with the losses along with the wins.""

Philippine flags decorated the stands in all directions, ‘Let's go Alex' chants transcended every few games and roars -- even in what might be considered an inconsequential point -- overpowered the Melbourne Park grounds initially. 

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

The fanbase the rising star -- who stayed to sign autographs even in defeat -- has developed over the last year on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz was in full force.

From the court's designated fan seating to the bar that overlooks the sideline and the ledge that faces the baseline, Eala had essentially brought in a maximum capacity crowd, and, frankly, there were no empty seats. Yet, Parks found a way to conquer that barrier, one that she said she was too focused on in the first set.

""I was starting to think I wasn't focused on the game plan, which is why I played better in the second and third set,"" Parks said. ""I was just so focused on the crowd in the first set, which is why it went the way it went.""

Eala delivered to begin the match. An opening game that lasted 20 points and ended with consecutive missed smash volleys by Parks foreshadowed how the afternoon would turn out. Eala got the early break. She was off and running, winning eight of the next nine points to take a 3-0 lead and ultimately closed the 34-minute first-set with a bagel.

Parks regrouped and settled into the match in the second set. Sprinting out to a 3-0 lead with the early break, the American seemed to find her groove. Though Eala leveled at 3-3, Parks remained calm and collected, taking the final three games – a pivotal break to go up 5-3 allowed Parks, who relied on 12 aces in the match, to serve for the set.

""I was starting to think I wasn't focused on the game plan, which is why I played better in the second and third set.

It was now a new match. One set to decide who would advance to the second round to face Karolina Muchova or Jaqueline Cristian, and pendulum had shifted into Parks' favor and the crowd had slowly started to simmer down.

Parks struck first with the early break and hold to jump to a 2-0 advantage. That break proved crucial as Eala and Parks traded holds up until Parks led 4-2 in the set.

The American had grasped control of the match fully, and once Eala's backhand down the line went out, Parks' second break of the set gave her a comfortable three-game lead with a chance to serve for the match.

Eala saved two match points, but Parks serve proved too strong for an exhausted Eala, as the American successfully rallied to advance to the second round and did receive an ovation and applause.

""I don't know what my record is with crowds against me,"" Parks said laughing. ""It definitely puts a fire on me. I would say I'm good when the crowds are against me.""

Alycia Parks overcame a 0-6 first set and an energetic Court 6 crowd to defeat Alexandra Eala in three sets to advance to the second round of the Australian Open.

“Yeah, I like it,” Swiatek said, holding firm after a straight-sets victory at the 2026 Australian Open. “Honestly, people are going to criticize everything, so... I think it was great. I mean, it's kind of short. It's not like you're going to find some surprising things on it after you listened to it couple of times.“The songs are catchy. That's what she wanted. That's what she said from the beginning. She achieved the goal she wanted. Every song is a hit on this album. But yeah, I guess you can find different stuff in art and music.

The American admitted the standing-room only Court 6 crowd of Filipino fans took some getting used to before winning in three sets.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 19, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 19, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Alexandra Eala made a high-wattage debut at the 2026 Australian Open on Monday but was unable to channel the energy of a jam-packed Court 6 crowd and ultimately bowed out, 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.“That's one of the things that makes a loss like today a little bit harder is I know a lot of people were rooting for me,” the 20-year-old Filipina No. 1 said in her post-match press conference.Eala became the breakout star of the 2025 season when she stunned world No. 2 Iga Swiatek en route to the Miami Open semifinals, and became the first from her country to win a Grand Slam main draw match at the US Open last summer.Playing on an outer court that belied her growing star power, Eala appeared poised to score another win when she blanked Parks in the opening set but the big-serving American eventually steadied to secure the win.“It was very difficult,” a smiling Parks said after the match. “It was like, I was expecting it, but I wasn't. She definitely has a good crowd. I was just telling myself to stay in the zone and that I got to do what I got to do.”

Parks made her own major breakthrough at this tournament back in 2024 when she reached the third round against Coco Gauff, but has struggled with consistency since. The crowd left Parks visibly rattled early on as she netted two overheads in her opening serve game to get broken.“It definitely wasn't the worst,” she said of the crowd's general decorum, “but in between first and second serves and the clapping when you miss, that's just something I had to ignore and get used to the whole match.”Having played in similarly partisan environments at Roland Garros, Parks credited that experience with what ultimately got her over the finish line.“I don't know what my record is with crowds that are against me, but it definitely puts a fire under me!” she laughed. “I would say I'm good when crowds are against me.”

For Eala, the match was the culmination of an at-times overwhelming week playing the at the Asia-Pacific Grand Slam event, describing large crowds even for her practices.“I didn't expect that many people to be there,” said Eala. “So it's a learning process, like anything.Her online presence is even greater; a video of her pre-tournament press conference boasts views in the six figures, dwarfing those of even the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.“I like to think that I have a following for a reason. I like to think that the impact that I've had and the platform that I've built has a positive effect on a certain demographic and my demographic.“Yeah so, I mean, I guess this is one of the moments that I can reflect on what this means for Philippine tennis.

So there are positives to take away.”While Parks booked a second-round singles clash with No. 19 seed Karolina Muchova, Eala will be back on court on Tuesday for her first round of women's doubles with Brazilian partner Ingrid Martins.

Back on track in Melbourne, the former world No. 1 isn't over-analyzing his 2025 slump after a strong start to the season.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 19, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Between the tennis court and the press room, tennis fans typically see two sides of Daniil Medvedev. One side openly battles through emotional upheaval, the other, more calm and circumspect.For all his struggles in 2025, the former No. 1 never appeared particularly worried about the long-term state of his game. While some mused that his days competing at the top of men's tennis were over, Medvedev was eager to look at tomorrow as another day.Tomorrow finally came for the 2021 US Open champion at the end of last season, and the day has only gotten longer in 2026 as Medvedev remains unbeaten through six matches Down Under. Already a champion at the Brisbane International, the No. 11 seed overcame Jesper de Jong in three sets to reach the second round of a Grand Slam tournament for the only the second time in his last five outings.Asked the secret to his ability to leave his frustrations on the court, the endlessly quotable Medvedev opined in classic style:

Asked the secret to his ability to leave his frustrations on the court, the endlessly quotable Medvedev opined in classic style:

Q. Going back to last year, I feel like when things are maybe not going as well for you, you would maybe be frustrated on the court, but you would come to press and maybe not seem as concerned with where things were going. I feel like now, looking back, things are going well, were you more concerned than you were letting on? How do you find that sort of optimism?DANIIL MEDVEDEV: It's a tough question, for sure. In general, outside of the court, I try to be more optimistic than when I am on the court. That's just the way I am, the way a lot of tennis players are.It's just that they show their frustrations differently. A lot of tennis players are negative on the court. Like you miss a forehand, Oh, my God, my forehand is not going well. Yeah, man, but you're up 6-3, 5-3.That's me, as well. Again, I had a long preseason. Last year was tough. I'm feeling great with my new team, so I don't really go too much into the past. What happened last year happened, and it's okay. It's part of career, part of life. I managed to finish the year like 12 or 13, which is, to be honest, it's great for many players.Of course I was not happy. It was first year I was not in Turin maybe after 7 or 8 years. It was still not that bad, and end of the year was better than the year itself.I made a big push to try to be more positive on the court. So far I'm doing it well, but I'm never the guy to say, okay, now, not anymore. We don't know what's coming, but just trying to be positive on the court as I am in life, actually.It might be tough for someone to come from a Daniil Medvedev match and imagine him seeing the glass as half full, but playing the long game has appeared to pay off for the three-time Australian Open finalist. He'll next face Quentin Halys for the chance to reach his first Grand Slam third round since the 2024 US Open.

Like you miss a forehand, Oh, my God, my forehand is not going well. Yeah, man, but you're up 6-3, 5-3.That's me, as well. Again, I had a long preseason. Last year was tough. I'm feeling great with my new team, so I don't really go too much into the past. What happened last year happened, and it's okay. It's part of career, part of life. I managed to finish the year like 12 or 13, which is, to be honest, it's great for many players.Of course I was not happy. It was first year I was not in Turin maybe after 7 or 8 years. It was still not that bad, and end of the year was better than the year itself.I made a big push to try to be more positive on the court. So far I'm doing it well, but I'm never the guy to say, okay, now, not anymore. We don't know what's coming, but just trying to be positive on the court as I am in life, actually.It might be tough for someone to come from a Daniil Medvedev match and imagine him seeing the glass as half full, but playing the long game has appeared to pay off for the three-time Australian Open finalist. He'll next face Quentin Halys for the chance to reach his first Grand Slam third round since the 2024 US Open.

Throughout the season-opening United Cup, Stan Wawrinka showed he could still go toe-to-toe with the ATP's Top 50—and a returning-from-injury Hubert Hurkacz—over a five-match stretch to kick off his farewell season.During Switzerland's runner-up finish to Poland, the 40-year-old was awarded the final men's wild card into the Australian Open main draw. On Monday, the 2014 champion made good on Tennis Australia granting him the opportunity to play at Melbourne Park one last time.

During Switzerland's runner-up finish to Poland, the 40-year-old was awarded the final men's wild card into the Australian Open main draw. On Monday, the 2014 champion made good on Tennis Australia granting him the opportunity to play at Melbourne Park one last time.

In all five of his United Cup contests, Wawrinka found himself playing from behind—winning once over 27th-ranked Arthur Rinderknech. Taking a spirited Kia Arena, a prepared Wawrinka rallied past Laslo Djere for a 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory after three hours and 23 minutes.“I've been working really hard to stay in shape, to push myself. I think also the week in United Cup helped me a lot because I played over three hours back-to-back, plus a lot of tennis on the court, high level,” Wawrinka reflected in his press conference.“It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.”

“It got me a lot of confidence into what I'm able to do.”

The three-time major winner celebrated his first win at the Happy Slam in five years, and first overall on the Grand Slam stage since 2024 Wimbledon. Wawrinka shared while he still feels the nerves on the match court, those butterflies—more than anything—are a driving force behind his passion.“That's always been positive for me. That means I really care. That means I really want to do well. I'm really pushing myself,” he commented.“That's when you need to be really disciplined with yourself, with your brain, with what you have to do during the match.”​

Against Djere, Wawrinka produced 14 aces and won 75 percent of his total points on serve.

I know I'm not physical and tennis-wise as I was before. That's normal,” he said. “I'm getting old.

Djokovic had never played Martinez before, but it looked like he knew exactly what to do from start to finish on Monday night, breaking the No. 71-ranked Spaniard in his opening service game and riding that break to the first set. He then stepped on the gas, breaking twice in each of the next two sets to cruise to victory after exactly two hours on court.The numbers told the story—Djokovic had more than twice as many winners as errors, 49 to 21, including 14 aces to no double faults.And not only did he never face a break point in 13 service games, he never even lost more than one point in any of his service games—he held eight times at love and five times at 15, and that was it.It's now been 20 years since Djokovic last lost in the first round of a major, to American Paul Goldstein at the 2006 Australian Open.

Red Bull and Racing Bulls unveil new cars

Their progress so far has been incredible, but Red Bull will head to the season opener having never run their power unit in a Grand Prix before. There's no doubt that they know the scale of the challenge that lies ahead of them.

Red Bull's powertrain project, in conjunction with American car giant Ford, had a lot of airtime during the Formula 1 team's impressive launch event in Detroit – and that's because it's a very big deal for the energy drinks firm.

Back in 2022, Red Bull took the step to create their own power unit facility from scratch after engine partner Honda, with whom they had enjoyed success, opted to withdraw from Formula 1 (before later deciding to return with Aston Martin in 2026).

Red Bull threw everything at the project, building a bespoke set-up on their Milton Keynes campus and recruiting heavily – including tempting several members of staff from Mercedes, who had enjoyed unprecedented success in the turbo-hybrid era.

Christian Wallace answers The Hollywood Reporter's burning questions after that surprising season two ending.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from the Landman season two finale, “Tragedy and Flies.”]


Landman is headed for a reset in season three.




	In the season two finale of co-creators Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace‘s mega-hit Paramount+ series, Billy Bob Thornton‘s Tommy Norris decides to go out on his own after he's fired by Cami (Demi Moore) from the company, M-Tex Oil, that Tommy was appointed president of after the death of his friend, Monty (Jon Hamm). But in order to launch his family-run company — titled CTT Oil after the Norris men of son Cooper (Jacob Lofland), grandfather T.L. (Sam Elliott) and Tommy (Thornton) — Tommy makes a deal with the devil: cartel boss Gallino (Andy Garcia). Gallino warns Tommy that if their partnership goes south, he will take what he loves most in this world.

	Below, Wallace says they are in wait-and-see mode as Sheridan sets out to write season three. “There's a great level of trust there that whatever Taylor decides will be the right move,” he tells The Hollywood Reporter. But what he is sure of is that season three will be a reset for the West Texas-set oil drama, as the Paramount+ series will follow Tommy and co. as they get CTT Oil up and running. Read his season two finale explanation and predictions for next season, below.


	***


I'm nervous about what a happy ending means for season three, because I don't think we get consecutive happy endings in the Sheridan-verse.












	I think you've watched enough TV to have pretty good instincts.


This season does seem to set up what we spoke about at the start of the season, around your long-term, multi-season Landman plan.


	It's kind of a reset [for season three]. We have these characters entering into different dynamics with one another, and now we have T.L., Tommy and Cooper all working at the same company, but not under the auspices of this larger corporation. It's now family-run, very small, starting from almost scratch. That's a whole new dynamic for them. Along with these other characters from M-Tex who are taking a pretty big gamble. 


	Gambling is kind of a motif this season. You have Angela in the casino, but you have Cami gambling on this as well, and now Tommy is kind of gambling on himself, which he has been reluctant to do. When we meet him in the pilot, he's talking about how things didn't work out for him, so he ended up with nothing and working for M-Tex for his buddy Monty. A lot has changed in his life. We've seen him grow a lot over the course of season two, and with his family dynamics. Now he's kind of going back to the roulette wheel and betting on himself. So, it's exciting and also a little nerve-racking.


What excites you about a reset? Do you feel like you will reinvent the wheel for season three, or do you already have a clear picture of where you guys are going?


	At the end of the day, it is Taylor's plan and we're all just waiting on what he decides to do. There's a great level of trust there that whatever Taylor decides will be the right move. There are a lot of possibilities, but I'm not sure myself exactly how it's going to play out. So, we'll see.

	











From what I understand, you are sticking with the timeline — you go back into production in May and season three will release at a similar time next year. Do you feel like you're in a groove now?


	Oh, definitely. We're in a groove. We are a little bit later than we were the last two seasons, but that only matter for us because of the heat in Texas. When we get back into production this year, it's going to be pretty full on, and just getting hotter. That's the big struggle from a production standpoint for us being on set every day. We have so many exteriors, and that's a good thing because this show thrives in the dust and the heat and the reality of that gritty, hot world. But it is hard on the crew and cast, and on everybody. Twelve-hour days in 100-plus degree weather is no joke. But that is our cross to bear, not the audiences'. I'm excited about the schedule and I think the rhythm we're in right now works really well.


You don't know what Taylor has in store, but when you think about filming that final season two scene — both Tommy and Angela's conversation and Tommy's face off with the coyote — how worried should Tommy be about this threat from Gallno that if he messes up this deal, the cartel boss is coming after everyone Tommy loves?


	We ended season one with the reality of how violent and real that threat can be. Tommy knows it better than anybody. He's the one who had a nail in his thigh; that level of reality was being doused in gasoline [in the season one finale]. So he knows that these are not idle threats. But also, Tommy is a survivor and also a predator himself. The symbolism of that coyote can mean so many different things, but I do think it is great that we get to have a couple of those moments where Tommy is present and has absorbed the lessons from T.L. throughout this season.

	











	“Look, man, your life is going to pass you by; this is your life, and your life doesn't suck as bad as you make it out to be. You have all these people around you who are insane, but they love you, and they love each other. Enjoy that. Don't forget that is also as real as the blowouts you're dealing with in the patch.” We see Tommy in a few of those moments actually take that in, and those, to me, are some of the really nice moments in this season.


Is there a role for Cami in season three? Do you think Demi Moore will return?


	I think there are so many different opportunities and ways this can play out. At the end of the day, I'm putting my trust in Taylor and his decisions for all of these characters' storylines. That one is above my pay grade.


This season, viewers went wild for Billy Bob Thornton's full-frontal nudity scene.


	To clarify, it wasn't an actual full frontal. We had an on-set intimacy coordinator, and the original prosthetic she brought in made everyone laugh. We were like, “No.” So we went with a more humble alternative. (Laughs.) That was a hilarious day on set. But it is surprising to me that people think that was actually Billy doing full-frontal nudity. So I should say props to our intimacy coordinator for making it extremely realistic, and to the props team. They had a whole rig, as Billy called it: “Got my rig on.”


Another storyline that sparked a reaction was with Ainsley's nonbinary roommate, Paigyn (Bobbi Salvör Menuez). Some viewers say this is Taylor speaking to the conservative audience. Did this feel like a hot-button storyline when you were filming, and would you say Taylor likes to make some noise and push some of those buttons?












	I think there are moments in both seasons of Landman that do press some buttons, and they start interesting conversations. A lot of the time, they're portrayed as more one dimensional than they actually are. A lot of times, these hot-button issues that are pressed, those little pokes, are more nuanced than they're portrayed. I think we all kind of knew it would elicit some reaction, but if you follow the storyline, it's not as one dimensional as it's made out to be by a lot of outlets.


These two seasons have taken place across 10 to 15 days, with some time in between seasons. So the entire Landman story is only over a couple of months. Do you anticipate season three would be similar, and that you would pick up not long after and it would play out in a condensed time period?


	Yeah, I don't think we're going to depart too far from the storytelling template we've put forth so far. It feels right for this story, and we'll continue to operate within that format we've established.


Now with CTT Oil, will season three spend more time in the oil fields? Will there be more action; will the show still spend time with Ainsley in college? Does Angela have a role in CTT?


	You can definitely expect that we'll continue to see the range of dynamics that is embedded in this show. The show is Ainsley and Dale [James Jordan[ and Cooper and Ariana [Paulina Chávez]. It really is this conglomerate of crazy, diverse storylines. But that's a modern family. They're all over the place, and I think we can expect more of that. As a West Texas guy myself, I'm always going to want to push more storylines in the Permian Basin and that kind of gritty oil and gas. I love those characters. I love that setting. So anytime we can get more of that into the show, I'm all for it. This definitely presents more opportunities for that, with them starting the small independent company. It's really exciting for me to see what we can do and play with there.

	











And this confirms Sam Elliott will return for season three?


	I think Sam has said it on the record that he's coming back!

Even as Gov. Gavin Newsom adds tax incentives to keep Hollywood in Hollywood, more projects are heading to other U.S. states, where studios are building new bases.


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	When Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in to law a doubling of California's tax incentives for film and TV projects from $330 million to $750 million annually in July, the move sent a signal that the state was finally taking runaway production seriously. Yet that piece of legislation may just be the first step needed to keep more of Hollywood in Hollywood, if the latest U.S. production figures are any indication.


	In the fourth quarter of 2025, California saw a 20 percent decrease in movie and TV projects filming in the state year-over-year, with production spend from those projects similarly down 22 percent, according to the Q4 report from industry tracker ProdPro released Jan. 16. Total production spend in the quarter amounted to $1.35 billion.

					50 Cent's Studio Plans $124 Million Investment In Louisiana Complex		
			









	The Golden State, where all the major studios still have HQ lots, still claims bragging rights as the top destination overall for film and TV shoots, but double digit declines even after the state's latest incentives took effect are another cautionary sign. One slight silver lining: In Los Angeles, overall filming days in the fourth quarter were up about 6 percent from the prior quarter, permitting office FilmLA disclosed on Jan. 15. But L.A. shoot days overall throughout the year were down 16 percent from 2024.




			Related Video		







	The message from FilmLA vp Philip Sokoloski: hold tight, “although our overall numbers remain low, there are dozens of incentivized projects that have yet to begin filming,” the exec said in unveiling the latest figures. To that point, the California Film Commission revealed a slate of 28 titles on Dec. 17, including projects from NBCUniversal, Sony, Amazon, 20th Century and Apple, to receive tax credits to shoot in California, with the state forecasting $562 million in total economic activity from the shoots.

	











	While California is losing ground, its biggest rival, New York, saw a 31 percent increase in filming count and 23 percent increase in production spend year-over-year. With $1.07 billion in total spend in Q4, New York is not too far off from eclipsing California's total production spending.


	Two other states are emerging as notable production players as projects increasingly seek incentives outside of California. One of the major beneficiaries has been New Jersey, where filming count in the fourth quarter was up 75 percent year-over-year and production spend grew 12 percent, per ProdPro. (New Jersey's annual tax incentive for film and TV projects is $430 million, lower than New York at $800 million and California's bulked up $750 million program.)


	Notably, that healthy growth for the Garden State arrives before key studio lots are completed in the state. Netflix is investing $1 billion to build its East coast base with 12 soundstages at the former site of Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The David Ellison-owned Paramount inked a 10-year lease in October to occupy 85,000 square feet of the in-construction 1888 Studios in Bayonne, while Lionsgate is set as the anchor tenant of Great Point Studios in Newark.


	Meanwhile Illinois, home to Dick Wolf procedurals on NBC (Chicago Fire, P.D. and Med) along with FX's The Bear, saw film count in the fourth quarter increase 70 percent year-over-year while production spend increased 46 percent. Prior indicators — namely major year-over-year growth in background actors' jobs booked, per one payroll firm's estimate — had suggested that Illinois was poised to be a bigger production hub, and in the latest quarter it appears to be closing the gap with a more established state, Georgia, that saw year-over-year declines in projects shooting and in spend.

	











	Overall production in the U.S. fell across all states by 4 percent in the fourth quarter and production spend overall fell 8 percent to $4.2 billion, a sign that film and TV shoots are increasingly a global hunt by producers to seek out the best incentives and locations. Both the United Kingdom and Canada, per ProdPro's tally, saw double digit filming count and production spend growth in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Sphere Entertainment says it plans to build its first smaller-scale version of the Sphere at National Harbor in Maryland.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	America is going to get a second Sphere, and it's coming to the Washington D.C. metro area.


	Sphere Entertainment, the company behind the Las Vegas landmark, says that it has inked a deal with the state of Maryland, Prince George's County, and Peterson Companies to develop and build a second Sphere venue at National Harbor, a major tourism destination in the area.




	Notably, Sphere says the plan is to create what it is calling its first “smaller-scale” design, with plans for a 6,000 seat venue, compared to the 18,600 seats at the Las Vegas Sphere. The project will be financed with public and private funding, including approximately $200 million in state, local, and private incentives.

	While it will be smaller than the original Sphere in Las Vegas, the company says it will still have the distinct “Exosphere” that defines the exterior of the original, while the interior theater will have what it says will be “the world's highest-resolution LED screen.”




			Related Video		







	A rendering released by the company showed the Sphere close to the Potomac near the existing MGM Grand.


	“Our focus has always been on creating a global network of Spheres across forward-looking cities,” said James Dolan, executive chairman and CEO of Sphere Entertainment. “Sphere is a new experiential medium. With a commitment to bringing innovative opportunities to residents and visitors, Governor Moore, County Executive Braveboy, the State of Maryland, and Prince George's County recognize the potential for a Sphere at National Harbor to elevate and advance immersive experiences across the area.”

	











	“Maryland has a long history of providing world-class entertainment and we could not be more excited to work with Sphere Entertainment to bring this cutting-edge project to life,” added Governor Wes Moore. “This will be one of the largest economic development projects in Prince George's County history – proving once again our state is the best place in the country to bring dreams to life. We're excited for what this means for our people, and how it will showcase the best of what Maryland has to offer to everyone who visits.”


	Sphere has become a major tourist attraction in Las Vegas, a city with no shortage of them. While the venue is best known for its concerts and residencies, it also has daily programming, most notably a remastered version of The Wizard of Oz, and the original documentary film Postcard From Earth. It's safe to assume that the Maryland Sphere will follow the same strategy, albeit on a slightly smaller scale.


	National Harbor is home to The Capital Wheel, a giant ferris wheel with views of D.C., as well as an MGM Grand casino and other tourist attractions.


	The National Harbor Sphere is the third planned version of the venue, after the Las Vegas original and another under construction in Abu Dhabi.

The Duke of Sussex arrived at the British capital's High Court on Monday, where he alleges ""grave breaches"" of his privacy.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Prince Harry‘s legal war with the British tabloids continues.


	The Duke of Sussex's case against the Daily Mail formally kicked off on Monday with a legion of stars by his side at London's High Court — among those also suing the outlet's publisher are Elton John and husband David Furnish, actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, as well as U.K. political figures Doreen Lawrence and Simon Hughes.




	They allege “grave breaches of privacy” and more illegalities, including the interception of voicemails, tapping of landlines, paying off police officers “with corrupt links to private investigators,” faking medical records, and bugging celebrity homes by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.

	Publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has repeatedly denied the “lurid” and “preposterous” allegations, maintaining that the lawsuit is an affront to the hard work of their journalists. Key figures connected to the country's bestselling newspaper, such as long-serving editor-in-chief Paul Dacre, are expected to give evidence.


	Things kicked off at the High Court with Harry's lawyer, a media barrister popular with the stars named David Sherborne, claiming ANL “knew they had skeletons in their closet” and therefore instigated “mass destruction” of thousands of documents related to the case. The trial is expected to last several weeks here in London.

	











	It's been a long time coming, and is indicative of Prince Harry's anger at the British press. The royal family member, son of King Charles and brother to William, has been vocal about wanting to wrangle an apology out of the tabloids for the way he, his wife, Meghan Markle, and his mother, the late Princess Diana, have been treated.


	“The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,” Prince Harry told a press event in 2024. Such is the strength of his conviction, the prince wrote in his 2023 memoir Spare, that his public rift with other members of the royal family derives from their unwillingness to stand up to the tabloids.


	In January 2025, Harry settled his case against the publisher of the Rupert Murdoch-owned The Sun newspaper, who offered the Duke a “full and unequivocal” apology. Harry had brought the case to publisher NGN, claiming his privacy had been violated by alleged phone hacking and unlawful information gathering carried out by journalists and private investigators working for The Sun and the defunct News of the World between 1996 and 2011.


	The tabloids aren't the only ones facing royal legal action. In May last year, Harry lost a legal challenge over the level of security he is permitted while in the U.K.


	He'd appeared in court the month before to appeal the decision to downgrade his taxpayer-funded security arrangements while in Britain, describing the country as “central to the heritage” of his children with Markle, Archie and Lilibet.

	











	The arrangement means that the Sussexes would instead receive a cheaper, “bespoke” security service, necessitating that they give 30 days' notice of any plans to come to the U.K. and that each visit be assessed for threat levels.

'Avatar' wasn't the only Disney winner at the holiday box office. 'Zootopia 2' is now the top-grossing animated film of all time globally, and the ninth-biggest of any film.



		By Aaron Couch, Pamela McClintock 

	January 19, 2026 9:06am	




	Despite all the hype, Nia Costa's elevated horror-sequel 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple came in behind expectations at the long Martin Luther King Jr. holiday box office as Avatar: Fire and Ash won the four-day session with an estimated $17.8 million, including $14.5 million for the three-day weekend proper.


	Sony's The Bone Temple is estimating a four-day debut of $15 million, including $13 million for the three days. That's far behind the first 28 Years, which posted a three-day opening of $30 million in June, as well as behind the $20 million projection for Bone Temple headed into this weekend.

	James Cameron's Avatar wasn't the only Disney release making headlines. Thanksgiving  juggernaut Zootopia 2 became the top-animated film of all time globally of the MLK weekend after passing up Disney and Pixar's Inside Out 2. It is also the ninth-highest film among  all times with global receipts north of $1.313 billion.




			Popular on THR		







Avatar 3, now in its fifth weekend, easily stayed iin first place as it races toward the $400 million mark domestically. So far, the film has collected an estimated $358 million domestically and north of $1.23 billion globally.


	The 28 Years Later franchise hails from director Boyle and writer Alex Garland, who brought the film series to Sony after a heated bidding war. Filmmaker Nia DaCosta is in the director's chair for Bone Temple, the second part in a planned trilogy, with Sony saying last month that it will make a third installment with Cillian Murphy — star of the original 28 Days Later — with Boyle returning to direct. It is not known how this opening weekend could change that calculus.

	











	Sony insiders remain hopeful that word of mouth could give Bone Temple legs. The feature earned strong reviews (94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), an A- CinemaScore (a rare high grade for a horror film) and a 4.5 PostTrak rating. Bone Temple stars Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams, Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry.


Zootopia came in third with an estimated $12 million fo the four days and an estimated $9.2 million for the four-day frame.


	 Lionsgate's The Housemaid continued to clean up for Lionsgate, falling just 21 percent in its fifth weekend to an estimated $8 million for the three days and roughly $10 million-plus for the four-day frame as it jumped the $100 million mark domestically.


	Filmmaker Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme landed in fifth place after winning several top Golden Globe wins last weekend. From A24, the specialty pic has been an overperformer since its Christmas release, and observers were correct in predicting it  would get a bump following Timothée Chalamet's best actor win at the Globes. It looks to bring in around $6.4 million to $6.8 for the four-day frame, which would bring its d domestic total to a winning $80 million.


	Focus Features' Chloé Zhao's Hamnet, produced by Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes, expanded after it took home best drama at the Golden Globes Jan. 11, with Oscar contender Jesse Buckley winning the actress prize. The film, which opened in limited release over Thanksgiving, upped its count to 718 theaters this weekend and is expected to bring in $1.6 million or more for the four-day frame, bringing its domestic total to $15 million. Focus plans further expansion after Oscar nominations are announced.

	











More to come.

The honor arrives just in time for Parton's 80th birthday.

	Ashley Iasimone



	Dolly Parton Day will officially be observed on Jan. 19 in the state of Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee has announced.


	Gov. Lee proclaimed the tribute to Dolly Parton — honoring “her lifetime of achievement, service, and positive impact” — in coordination with the country music legend's 80th birthday, which falls on Monday, Jan. 19.


	“Dolly Parton, born on January 19, 1946, in Sevier Country, is a native Tennessean whose extraordinary life and career have brought pride to the State of Tennessee,” reads the state leader's official notice of Dolly Parton Day, published by the Tennessee Department of State.Gov. Lee's proclamation highlights the star's accomplishments, both professional and philanthropic, and how she's affected the lives of Tennesseans.

	











	“Dolly Parton is an acclaimed singer, songwriter, musician, actress, producer, and entrepreneur whose body of work embodies the spirit of Tennessee; and throughout her remarkable career, Dolly Parton has earned numerous awards and accolades and is widely regarded as one of the most influential and beloved artists in the history of American music; and in addition to her artistic accomplishments, Dolly Parton has demonstrated an enduring commitment to philanthropy and service, most notably through the Dollywood Foundation and the Imagination Library, which began in Tennessee and has provided hundreds of millions of free books to children around the world, helping to promote early childhood literacy and educational opportunity; and Dolly Patton's generosity, humility, and dedication to improving the lives of others exemplify the values of the Volunteer State and serve as an inspiration to Tennesseans and people worldwide,” the proclamation says.


	The proclamation issued through the Tennessee Department of State can be read in full here.


	Jan. 19, 2026 marks a milestone birthday for Parton, the legendary singer-songwriter and performer whose 25 No. 1s on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart have spanned a career across four decades (and counting).

	











	Parton's latest musical release is a new rendition of her 1977 hit “Light of a Clear Blue Morning,” featuring colleagues/collaborators Lainey Wilson, Reba McEntire, Queen Latifah and Miley Cyrus. Net proceeds from the song benefit the pediatric cancer research program at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt in Nashville.

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Legendary Italian Fashion Designer Valentino has died at the age of 93, his foundation announced on Monday.


	The foundation said the designer, whose full name was Valentino Garavani, died in his home in Rome on January 19. 


	Across his career, Valentino dressed a host of stars including Sharon Stone, Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbra Streisand, Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, and Monica Vitti.


	His other famous clients included Jackie Kennedy for whom he designed the wedding dress for her second marriage to Aristotle Onassis in 1968.

	The designer was born in the Northern town of Voghera in 1932 to a well-off bourgeois family. His mother named him after the 1920s Italian-born Hollywood film star Rudolph Valentino, and from a young age he obsessed with Hollywood glamor. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	He enrolled at the L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne fashion school in Paris at the age of 17, and then secured apprenticeships in the workshop of fashion houses Balenciaga, Jean Dessès and Guy Laroche.


	After a close to a decade living and working in Paris he returned to Rome and with the support of his parents set up his own fashion house close to Piazza di Spagna in 1960.


	That same year, he met Giancarlo Giammetti who would become his lifelong partner and the business brains behind the Maison Valentino fashion house.


	Valentino began to gain international fame in the early 1960s following a commission from Kennedy for six haute couture dresses in black and white, which she wore during her year of mourning following President John F. Kennedy's assassination.

	











	She became  a life-long client with the wedding dress he would later design for her wedding to Onassis hailed as groundbreaking for the shortness of its length. 


	The fashion house would become synonymous with glamour and a jet-set life-style which Valentino embodied himself, splitting his time between statement luxury homes in Rome, New York, London, and Gstaad as well as France where he owned the Château de Wideville outside Paris. 


	His star-studded parties at the A-list festivals such as Cannes and Venice were also legendary.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Emmy-nominated The Last of Us director Peter Hoar has launched a production outfit and is working on a reboot of cult British sci-fi classic Blake's 7.


	Hoar has opened “genre-based” indie Multitude Productions with A Good Girl's Guide To Murder exec Matthew Bouch and West End producer Jason Haigh-Ellery. The trio have snapped up a wealth of IP including Blake's 7, which last aired on the BBC 45 years ago. 


	Hoar, who directed the critically-acclaimed “Long, Long Time” ep of HBO's The Last of Us, plans to direct the Blake's 7 reboot, which will go out to buyers soon. Bouch would “love it to go to the BBC” and will likely seek co-pro funding from the American streamers and European players like RTL.

					Why Disney Ditched 'Doctor Who': Sources Say Ratings, Big-Ticket Budget & MAGA Politics Were Factors In BBC Deal Failing To Regenerate		
			








	Created by Terry Nation, the man credited with inventing the Daleks, Blake's 7 aired for four seasons on the BBC from 1978 to 1981. The show, which exhibited numerous tropes of the traditional space opera, followed the exploits of political dissident Roj Blake (Gareth Thomas), who leads a small group of rebels against the forces of the totalitarian Terran Federation that rules the Earth and many colonized planets. There have been several reboot attempts down the decades but none have caught fire. Multitude struck the deal with Nation's estate and casting and writing conversations will commence in due course.




			Watch on Deadline		







	With genre shows like Doctor Who stuck in something of a rut and less money around in high-end scripted, Hoar and Bouch believe that now is the time to set up shop. They have been joined at Multitude by exec producer Lizzie Worsdell, whose credits include Amrita Acharia's indie pic The Carer.


	“The Blake's 7 story is legendary because they were given the [British police show] Softly, Softly slot that was intended for police drama with a budget intended for one big set and a few location shoots,” said double-BAFTA winner Hoar, whose credits include It's a Sin and Umbrella Academy. “At the time it felt like it meant something. Those shows got into my veins. I could tell they didn't have money but I was able to compartmentalize and enjoy the ride knowing that the sets wobbled.”

	











	Hoar compares Blake's 7 to Disney+ hit Andor, which he thinks is a success not because of its circa-$25M per hour budget but “because of the integrity, wit and sophistication.”


	He said Doctor Who, which Disney+ has just exited after only two seasons of one of the biggest co-pro deals of the decade, is a cautionary tale.


	“I don't think anybody would doubt the skills at the front line of that show but something went wrong,” he added. “I think there were lots of areas you could point fingers at but ultimately it wasn't a better show with more money. And that's a good thing, because we haven't got the money anymore, nobody has.”


Multitude Productions: genre-based British IP


	This, according to Bouch, will be Multitude Productions' raison d'être.


	Bouch said: “We're driven by our passions but also seeing that there is a gap in the market in the UK – particularly with the well-publicized dropping off of Doctor Who – for genre-based British IP.


	“We look back at when we were young with a degree of nostalgia but also thinking about the 70s and 80s as we were growing up and the amount of genre material that was available, whether it was Blake's 7 or the Narnia adaptation. We are looking to the international market and seeing if there is a way of dovetailing that British low-budget sensibility with international markets. We know in the U.S. there's a big contraction and we all need to think about finding ways to make things more economical.”


	With this in mind, Multitude is working on a TV series version of Luke Rhinehart's The Search for the Dice Man, the sequel to the cult classic Dice Man novel for which Paramount owns the rights. An A-list star is attached, Bouch said, with Danny Wallace (Yes Man) aboard to write and Tim Kirkby (Fleabag) directing. 


	The indie has also optioned Patrick Carman's Skeleton Creek book series, which is being adapted by Phillip Morgan and was described by Hoar as a “British Stranger Things crossed with Skins.” 


	The team is also working on an adaptation of a well-known video game and a sci-fi series, the latter in development with UK broadcaster ITV, although no more details were disclosed on those. Hoar and Bouch are keen to find new sources of funding and are developing a version of Rikako Akiyoshi's The Dark Maidens Japanese novel, which is seeking external funders, along with a crime series, Scammers, made with fraudster-turned-content-maker Tony Sales and his Underworld TV outfit.


	Hoar and Bouch, who have worked with Britain's biggest showrunners including Russell T. Davies and Jack Thorne, are championing a multi-writer model to get scribes back to work.


	“We've never really had a showrunner model in the UK and I think it is full of problems because it doesn't necessarily speak to that collaborative nature,” added Bouch. “Russell [T. Davies] is Russell but I think those people are relatively few and far between.” 


	Taking this “collaborative” approach, Bouch is confident that Multitude's model is the right one to create success in a tricky market that has seen lots of traditional drama companies shut up shop.


	“We're very aware that it feels counterintuitive to launch something at this point but equally we feel there is a gap in the market in terms of what we are doing,” he added. “Our expertise straddles both international and British lower budget material. Obviously the proof will be in the pudding.”

Shouldn't need a huge budget, just great writers and cast. Hopefully involving as many as the surviving cast from the original in cameos. 

Also I like to put myself up for role of Vilia; I'm just enjoying a quick Adrenalin and Soma as I write

Unknowns only, please. No stunt casting. No Cavill, Hiddlestone or Fillion. And keep it British otherwise it'll just turn into a crass Firefly. And I wasn't keen on Firefly.

Blake's 7 was the anti-Star Trek and the anti-Star Wars of its time, a singular dark vision that may be impossible to replicate in the modern media environment.

Nathan Fillion for the main role

Let me guess… you want Gina Torres to play Cally…

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


Mara Wilson, the star of Danny DeVito's 1996 movie Matilda, has revealed how she worried about the cast of Stranger Things getting caught in the “deepfake apocalypse” after she herself was a victim of child sexual abuse material.


	In an op-ed for The Guardian newspaper, the actress and writer wrote that, if unchecked by safeguards and regulation, artificial intelligence will lead to child stars and other young people being exploited on the internet. She said her own experience of being “used for child sexual abuse material” led to anxiety about other actors, including the stars of Disney films and Stranger Things.

	“Before I was even in high school, my image had been used for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). I'd been featured on fetish websites and Photoshopped into pornography,” Wilson wrote. “Grown men sent me creepy letters. I wasn't a beautiful girl – my awkward age lasted from about age 10 to about 25 – and I acted almost exclusively in family-friendly movies. But I was a public figure, so I was accessible. That's what child sexual predators look for: access. And nothing made me more accessible than the internet.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	She continued: “It was a painful, violating experience; a living nightmare I hoped no other child would have to go through. Once I was an adult, I worried about the other kids who had followed after me. Were similar things happening to the Disney stars, the Strangers Things cast, the preteens making TikTok dances and smiling in family vlogger YouTube channels?”

	











	Wilson's fears became a reality when X/Twitter users asked AI tool Grok to remove the clothing from images of 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher, who played Holly Wheeler in Stranger Things. Elon Musk‘s company later said it would stop the Grok account from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”


	“Generative AI has reinvented stranger danger,” Wilson said. “And this time, the fear is justified. It is now infinitely easier for any child whose face has been posted on the internet to be sexually exploited. Millions of children could be forced to live my same nightmare.”


	The Miracle on 34th Street star added: “Boycotts aren't enough. We need to be the ones demanding companies that allow the creation of CSAM be held accountable. We need to be demanding legislation and technological safeguards. We also need to examine our own actions: nobody wants to think that if they share photos of their child, those images could end up in CSAM. But it is a risk, one that parents need to protect their young children from, and warn their older children about.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


Sentimental Value filmmaker Joachim Trier, fresh from the film's triumph at the European Film Awards, told Deadline that a “European coalition of the willing” had ensured the picture got made.


	The Norwegian director said that he was “very proud to see also a lot of local European support for the film.” Echoing themes similar to those reported over the weekend from Germany by Melanie Goodfellow, my Deadline colleague, Trier realized when he was at the awards ceremony that “this is a Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, French, German, British co-production. Who would have thought Europe united in the movies?”

	Following the film's wild reception at the Cannes Film Festival last May, where it received a 19-minute ovation, I remember queuing up for the after-party with Eva Yates, director of BBC Film, who seemed thrilled that she and her team had backed the film.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“They were very supportive,” Trier said of BBC Film's involvement. “Very, very smart people when it comes to script and editing and creative input, and really also very generous and respectful. So I found that collaboration very valuable and it made it possible for us to have more money and work more with the actors and have more on the screen.”


	Trier said that Sentimental Value has done tremendously well “beyond what we had dreamt of and we're so grateful for that,” marking a lot of that down to “local distribution, that each country has someone that says, ‘We'll fight for this one.'”

	











	He continued: “Yesterday, I felt this embrace from a community outside of Norway. And my joke is that Norway is the suburbs of Europe. So for me, I've learned from this.”


	We were chatting at London's Soho Hotel following an awards Q&A session attended by Trier and Stellan Skarsgård, moderated by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, who described himself as the “fan of fans” of Trier's sublime film.


	Trier and Skarsgård had been in Berlin, where Sentimental Value won European Film Awards for Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenwriter for Trier and Eskil Vogt, Best European Actor and Best European Actress for Skarsgard and Renate Reinsve respectively, and Best Score for Hania Rani.


	 With aplomb, Cranston cited scenes from the movie and it was clear that he was indeed the “fan of fans” in a big way, and how struck he was by the film's story about Gustav Borg, a once storied Norwegian filmmaker played by Skarsgård, a proud Swede, who attempts to re engage with his two adult daughters; Nora an actor, payed by Reinsve; and Agnes, an academic historian played by Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, following the death of their mother, from whom he was divorced.


	The film delves deep into the generational trauma that troubles the wounded father and his psychologically injured offspring. The family drama is underpinned by the vicissitudes inherent in moviemaking. 


	Trier has suggested that perhaps a background of trauma is a requirement for making movies.


	Addressing the audience, Cranston likened Sentimental Value to “one of those Russian dolls that you open it up, and there's another thing inside another. It's like a film of a film of a film. And there's so many personal and intimate items to it that I related to being in this business and my father being in this business and my daughter being in this business. So it was multi-generational,” he said. Cranston was referring to his late father, actor Joe Cranston and to daughter Taylor Dearden, who plays Dr. Melissa King on The Pitt.


	Cranston was eager to know how Trier and Vogt had come up with the storyline.


	Trier told Cranston that he'd had an idea about two grown-up sisters negotiating narratives. Trier's fond of quoting Joan Didion's famous observation that  “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” He explained: ”I think there's something fundamental about having a story to try to understand yourself. The sense of identity is a story. It's a narrative. Who am I because of this and that? 


	“And it changes and grows and changes again. And now I've become a father, I have two daughters that are very young. And so I feel responsible…I've been a child in a film family and I know how much it takes out of your parents to make movies. And I'm asking that question, why did I have children quite late in life and my anxiety of kind of being Gustav Borg?


	“And then I start by thinking he's kind of like a difficult asshole, but then I thought I actually also love something. [“He's a lovable asshole,” Cranston chimed]…And how do I make that work? Then I knew I had one man in the world,” he said pointing to Skarsgård seated on his left. “So I flew to Sweden,” to visit with him.


	The'd never met or spoken before, although Trier had seen the actor at a party but was too shy to approach him. Skarsgård said that he'd been waiting a long time for Trier to call him. ”It took some time,” Skarsgård said, mocking at being affronted.

	











	“Finally, he called,” but the actor said he was a little coy in responding. “'Oh yeah, so what do you want?' But eventually we sort of … We have two versions of this, but my version is that we were sort of like dogs sniffing each other,“ he said as his nose drifted upwards.


	Trier did a double-take and exclaimed, “That's Stellan's version!”


	Skarsgård revealed that he didn't have to read Trier's script in the same way that he would never read a screenplay by Lars von Trier or Martin Scorsese, his reason being that “good directors, they're really rare…even if the role isn't that good, I mean, you get a good experience from it.”


	Cranston asked Skarsgård if he'd needed to research the role or was it just like slipping on “a pair of comfortable shoes?”


	Not necessarily, Skarsgård said. ”I knew things about the [movie] business and stuff, but he could be a painter, he could be a musician. The problem is that he's an artist and he's trying to combine art with a private life. It didn't take much imagination to do him, but the hard thing is always to find the life in him, to find the nuances, and to find the irrational moments that you can't plan that bring him to life.”


	Cranston's currently starring in a critically acclaimed revival of Arthur Miller's drama All My Sons at Wyndham's Theatre with an ensemble that features Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Glynn-Carney, and Hayley Squires, all on top form.


	On the topic of live theater, Cranston had “a bone to pick” with Trier about Gustav Borg's disdain for the stage. He wanted to know if that was Trier's “own personal feeling?”


	Trier admitted that “I'm a film guy 100%,” but said that he attended theater shows regularly with his wife, who is an architect who sometimes works as a stage production designer. “So I know that world quite well and adore it. I wouldn't know how to direct anything without a camera being present. So I'm very restricted. Forgive me. But I'm also the person that weeps at the end even of a bad play because I love actors getting on stage,” Trier told Cranston in mitigation.


	A bemused Skarsgård said that he “loves” theater but admits that it can “be difficult.” Then he added: “Theater…when it's good, it's the best thing in the world. It's amazing, and it so rarely is. It's very hard to do.”


	During a conversation I had with the actor after the Q&A, he clarified that he's a supporter of the stage, having spent 18 years early on in his career playing all the classics from “Shakespeare to Strindberg and all the plays in between.”


	Back on stage at the Soho Hotel, Cranston asked whether Skarsgård's own personal life, as the father of eight children, had shaped his performance as Gustav Borg in any way?


	Skarsgård said it had no bearing on how he played Borg. In fact, he noted that since 1989, he has cut down the number of months he works in a year to spend time helping to raise his children. “So I've been changing diapers and wiping asses,” he said. 


	“But the thing is, I also brought my family on locations, if I could, and I took the kids and somebody to teach them school or whatever, put them in school when I was traveling. So they saw a lot of places and missed a lot of school,” Skarsgård added.

	











	Cranston asked Skarsgard for his thoughts about awards season and what it has meant for Sentimental Value and himself.


	Skarsgård said: “It has two sides of it. I mean, on one hand you appreciate the love of your peers and of the audiences and everything, and especially when you're with a film like this, because it gets very warm response and it gets interesting discussions. But on one side, as an actor, you're a whore. You sell yourself to a director and you go all the way in and you go, ‘Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm down. I'm that guy.' But you're more whore than ever when you're doing publicity and that is a little painful.”


	There was much nodding of agreement onstage and off with at least one of Skarsgård's sentiments.


	The three men on stage then engaged in a conversation about the film's “beautifully delicate ending,” as Cranston put it, that offers a sense of reconciliation. No spoilers from me because the film's still out there in theaters – Neon released it in the U.S., while MUBI, who hosted the screening with DDA Global, has the film in UK cinemas.


	  Wrapping up the Q&A, Cranston borrowed a line that Elle Fanning's character, a Hollywood star, utters. “After she saw Gustav's film she says, ‘Oh, they just don't make movies like this anymore.' And the same could be said for Sentimental Value. They don't make movies like this anymore, but yet they do.”

	A member of the crowd at the Memphis Grizzlies and Orlando Magic NBA game in London heckled Vanessa Williams as she performed the Star-Spangled Banner, shouting, “Leave Greenland alone.” 


	A video of the interruption was widely circulated on social media sites on Sunday night.

	President Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland hit a new point last week as he threatened a 25% tariff on multiple European countries, including the United Kingdom, if the U.S. isn't allowed to purchase Greenland. Trump said in a Truth Social post this week that the tariff would begin on February 1.

	“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” Starmer posted. 


	“We have also made clear that Arctic Security matters for the whole of NATO and allies should all do more together to address the threat from Russia across different parts of the Arctic. Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”

I want to puy that person a drink.

The NBA is the ultimate Karen organization

A society that, because of the weaknesses of its laws and the stupidity of its citizens, allowed this character to reappear and make the lives of all the world's inhabitants miserable again… deserves to be ostracized.

The Trump authoritarian regime is threatening to take over other countries and threatening our greatest allies with punitive tariffs if they don't go along with it. Meanwhile at home, he's sending in masked thugs who are terrorizing communities (primarily in blue state cities he doesn't like) and protest is breaking out. He's threatening to use military force against Americans who don't agree with his barbarism.

Do people just think it's going to be business as usual? Do they think people aren't going to speak up about it both domestically and abroad?

She put the bob back in Millie Bobby Brown.

The actress looked like she's entering a new era on the Joy Awards 2026 red carpet Saturday.

Attending the event in Saudi Arabia, Brown, 21, showed off a brand new chin-grazing bob haircut. She also went back to her roots, dyeing her previously red-tinged locks a more natural brown shade.

The “Stranger Things” actress went all-out for the red carpet, too, shimmering in a Tamara Ralph Couture fall 2025 gown covered in sequins and floral appliqués. She added even more sparkle with enormous Chopard diamond drop earrings.

The Netflix show, which premiered in 2016, concluded with the fifth and final season last month. Over the course of a decade, Brown has tried out many different looks, including shaving her head for the first season as her supernatural character, Eleven.

After trying out a platinum blond bombshell color, she went back to brunette in March 2025.

Accepting the Joy award for personality of the year, she slipped into a second gown from the same designer's spring 2024 couture collection, this one featuring voluminous feather-covered sleeves, a sequined corset waist and a thigh-high slit.

“Ever since I was a little girl, I knew I wanted to be in the creative world,” she began her emotional acceptance speech. “Pursuing creativity and becoming an actor at eight years old wasn't a dream I chased on my own. It was encouraged and supported by my parents who never doubted me for a second.”

She concluded with a special shoutout to her loved ones, including her daughter, whom she and husband Jake Bongiovi welcomed via adoption last summer.

“I'm so honored to have my own unit in my life. My family are my anchor, my husband is my sail, my team are my engine, and my daughter is my North Star,” she said. “I wouldn't be able to do any of this without them.”

Sharna Burgess is opening up about her fraught relationship with food.

“I struggled with binging and restricting mostly,” the “Dancing With the Stars” alum admitted during a candid Instagram “Ask Me Anything” on Sunday, after a fan asked, “Have you ever struggled with eating disorders?”

Burgess, 40, added that she “had a super complicated relationship with food” as a teen and into her 20s, but that habits “changed” once she hit her 30s.

The Australian-born performer previously spoke about the added pressures she's faced with her weight as a professional dancer.

“I had a real struggle with my body because of dance,” she told Australia's Good Health & Wellbeing magazine in a 2021 interview.

“I remember being 15 and put on the scale every two days by my teachers and we were told whether we needed to lose weight or not. Every week I was told that I needed to lose more weight — and I certainly wasn't overweight.”

Burgess said that dance “instilled a negative body image,” which carried on to the way she ate.

“It also started a negative pattern of eating whereby I'd binge one day, and then starve the next. I struggled with that throughout the years,” she explained. “Even in my 20s, I'd look in the mirror and see the 15-year-old that was told every week she needed to lose more weight.”

However, things began to change when she joined the cast of “DWTS” in 2011.

“It was seeing just how much the celebrities on the show transformed and ended up loving their bodies through being able to move and dance that really shook my perspective,” she explained. “I thought, ‘Wow, I've been doing this my whole life.' 

“I started to see something else in the mirror, I started to see a body that had gotten me through some incredibly difficult times, that had created some beautiful moments, that had won championships, that had landed me a life I never ever thought possible.”

Burgess' last season as a “DWTS” pro was in 2021, when she was partnered with her now-fiancé, Brian Austin Green. She left the following year after welcoming their son, Zane. 

However, that's not to say the dancing pro has ruled out returning to the long-running show in the future.

“It's never a no,” she said during her Instagram Q&A on Sunday. “I was supposed to do something with them last season, but I was already working on a play in NYC and couldn't commit. I love [the cast and crew], the show and am always going to want to be there.”

This week's Industry plays like a funhouse mirror of the events in the third-season finale. Another birthday is the centerpiece at Sir Henry Muck's (Kit Harington) ancestral home. But instead of a celebratory dinner announcing an engagement, relative newlyweds Henry and Yasmin (Marisa Abela) are already coming apart at the seams. It doesn't help that Yas isn't even allowed to open the drapes in her husband's bedroom as he staves off another hangover. “You have to let her fulfill her function,” is Henry's directive about letting the housemaid attend to said curtains. Everyone in this stately home lacks purpose, so what better time to throw a decadent, Versailles-themed costume party for Henry's fortieth? 

Similar to how the premiere jumped in as Harper's (Myha'la) fund fell apart, Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay waste no time building to the Mucks breaking point. There is zero drag in the storytelling, and this breakneck pacing is part of what makes Industry a deliriously compelling option amid wheel-spinning streaming slogs. And like the premiere, Kay and Down wrote and directed the excellent “The Commander And The Grey Lady,” and the time jump here isn't a cheat code to circumvent plotting for fireworks. 

Instead, all the groundwork was laid last season, first in an intimate swimming pool in Switzerland, where Henry first confided in Yasmin about his father's suicide and his own suicidal ideation. In this week's episode, we learn that Henry didn't share how the events actually unfolded on the morning of his father's 40th birthday. The rewritten version speaks to how this trauma is reshaped to be more palatable without factoring in the permanent damage to Henry's psyche. There's nothing quite like the British stiff upper lip and its unique ability to brush the worst moment under an heirloom carpet. 

It would be easy to cast Yas in the Lady Macbeth role, whispering in her husband's ear to benefit her own ambitions. While this archetype isn't entirely off the mark, her scheme to get Henry a position within Whitney Halberstram's (Max Minghella) “bank killer” Tender is as much about dragging Henry out of his debilitating funk as it is getting Yas back into the game. 

Yas has tried myriad approaches, including leaning into the Tory-wife cosplay in the opening flashback. Abela and Harington are both on top form, capturing desperation and loathing (in Henry's case, self-loathing). First, there's the saddest handjob perhaps ever committed to television, where we hear rhythmic splashing before Henry cuts it short. He has already stood to attention in his proverbial birthday suit for his wife when she asked him to stand in the bath. Yasmin just wants them to look at each other again properly, but Henry struggles to meet her eye and maintain an erection. She's trying to give him a confidence boost before his pre-party meeting with Whitney. However, this only makes Henry feel like more of a “fraud touched by success.”

Whitney is eager to find a partner who can open doors that money can't buy. “Longevity in Britain is about access,” he tells Henry. What Whitney needs is connections that come from centuries of titles. Given that Yasmin told Whitney he could put his silver tongue to work on Labour MP Jennifer Bevan (Amy James-Kelly) in the last episode, he turns his attention to Henry, with Yasmin providing that particular entry point. It is this meeting that Henry views with suspicion, and the drugs in his system add to this notion.

A subtle callback to “happier” times for the couple comes in the shade of blue sash worn by Henry that matches his bow tie when he announced his engagement to Yas at his uncle's birthday dinner. Of course, that color links to King Louis XVI, but this visual tether to the past doesn't read like a coincidence. Costume designer Laura K. Smith decks Yas out in a chartreuse and peach Marie Antoinette-inspired frock with an elevated, contemporary twist: stacked Vivienne Westwood platforms that cause Yas to tower over Henry. That doesn't go unnoticed, with Henry clocking her altered height in sweet bemusement that will soon sour. 

The appearance of Yasmin's aunt, Cordelia (Claire Forlani), also underscores Yasmin's urgency to shed her current role as a spectator and caregiver. The pointed juxtaposition of Cordelia telling Yas to get off her knees and Yas later witnessing Cordelia on her knees giving Otto a blowjob is a reminder that Yasmin's family tree is equally thorny. Daddy issues course through Yas and Henry's veins. But Henry has to battle his demons alone rather than turn to his wife, who knows a thing or two about this topic. 

Henry leans hard into his “poor little rich boy” mythologizing when it comes to a head. Shooting this on a handheld camera makes the fight feel more fluid and intimate, giving us a front-row seat. Yas cuts to the core of the romanticizing with precision and cruelty, suggesting it would be procedural, boring, and small if he died by suicide. She knows that Henry lied about the circumstances of his father's death, and later, we learn why Henry's construction involves his dad walking out onto the moor alone. It is far more disturbing that Henry witnessed it all. Even more alarming is the suggestion that his father orchestrated his son's spectating.  

Henry is no match for Yasmin, who has been in numerous screaming bouts before, whether with her father or Harper (who is on the receiving end of Yasmin's spiky mood in this episode). He tries to use her family's tainted reputation to bring his wife to heel, but Yas holds all the cards due to the clause in their pre-nup about his drug use. Earlier, Henry told Yas she could sleep with other people, which she now reads as a clumsy, calculated move due to an adultery clause. He cowers in the corner of the room, looking even smaller than he did earlier when Yas threatens to hit him. Instead, she grabs him by the balls to emphasize her point about drugs castrating him.

Paranoia is another side effect, and the camera's often unsteady journey throughout the opulent setting adds to the fracturing of reality whenever Henry is onscreen. Candlelight and twinkling Christmas decorations add to the otherworldly visuals, amplifying the stately homes' grandiose patina. Kay and Down turn the sprawling location into a Kubrickian nightmare, throwing in technical and thematic nods to Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining. One of these is Henry playing Purcell's “Funeral Of Queen Mary” on the harpsichord, which Kubrick used in Orange. (The moog version was in the credits last week.) This piece of music also accompanies Henry's solo walk home across the fields as he prepares to take his own life. 

Cutting from Henry in the same position at the harpsichord in his robe to dressed for his meeting with Whitney, as if someone clicked their fingers, is as destabilizing for us as it is for Henry. Industry excels at distorting or compressing time. It is something that comes up later when Henry's memories overlap with the present, as he watches his father's suicide, standing alongside his childhood self. Like Jack Torrance in The Shining, Henry is haunted by ghosts. 

While I didn't catch it on first viewing, watching any of the scenes back when Henry is interacting with the Commander (Jack Farthing) makes it clear that no one else can see this hallucinated version of Henry's father. But Henry is so wasted that no one questions his chatting to thin air. Tight close-ups ensure we are as focused on the Commander as Henry is. The coincidental encounter with the parish priest (played by Roy Sampson), who not only married Henry's parents but also buried Henry's father, leads to one of the most haunting and poignant sequences in the series so far. Rather than the Bible, the priest recites a passage from Cormac McCarthy's All The Pretty Horses. His Scottish accent adds an extra emotional punch to what looks like a self-fulfilling prophecy: “The first person the coward deserts is himself. Courage ceases to be courage if it wavers. We choose to be ruined rather than change.” 

But Henry doesn't die by suicide, and those words are to offer comfort in the dark. Hearing Yasmin's voice saying his name is his savior, and Henry has a renewed sense of purpose and libido. He will take Whitney's job offer, and everything is looking up for the Mucks. Henry's bloody hands from the pub brawl are not a turnoff for Yasmin; she kissed the broken knuckles and left the blood on her lips. Rather than a Lady Macbeth “out damned spot” moment, Yas keeps this unorthodox lipstick until a gleeful Henry says they should have a baby. Only then does she subtly lick it clean. Motherhood is not the purpose she seeks.

In MIO: Memories In Orbit, only the machines are left. These aren't Terminator-esque monstrosities, but robots built to help humanity on an interstellar journey to a new home. The humans, whom the robots call Travellers, are long gone. The system that governs The Vessel—a network of AI clusters known as Pearls, with their own specific functions and personalities—are flickering out. And MIO, an android designed to support and defend the Pearls, has to figure out why they're powering down, and do whatever they can to preserve The Vessel. It might seem like a lot to ask of a small robot, but MIO and their four cybernetic tentacles are up for the task.

Escaping the Earth is in vogue. Last week The A.V. Club reviewed another game set on a cosmic ark, Code: Violet, which is about as different from MIO as a game could be. Last month we looked at Interstellar Arc, an interactive VR exhibit in Las Vegas about a future mission to an Earth-like planet lightyears away. Looking at this world we've created, it's not hard to see why this idea is popular right now. Ecological disaster, endless violence, a widespread lack of empathy, the global rise of fascism and authoritarianism… who wouldn't want to fuck off to space these days?

MIO is unique for this trend in that it barely factors humanity into its equation. We're just gone—cosmic toast before the title screen even hits. We're not even drifting through space in a diabetic coma, like in the bad second half of WALL-E. Our fingerprints remain visible throughout, scattered remnants of whatever human culture launched this ship, but the memories in the title aren't even entirely about us. MIO is deeply in debt to Metroid in a myriad of ways, but here the defunct civilization barely visible on the game's fringes is our own.



MIO doesn't foreground that widescale loss. It's not even clear at first if humans ever played a role here at all. Details about how The Vessel reached this state slowly unspool throughout the game, but are revealed environmentally, or through short bits of text on public plaques. It's not even clear how long we've been dead or how the ship came to be abandoned, but it's clearly been ages; vegetation runs wild through certain sectors, others are frozen over with thick layers of ice, machinery is all busted or haywire, and almost half The Vessel is flooded with a deadly liquid. Sounds like the kind of obstacles you'd find in a video game, doesn't it?

MIO is a fairly traditional side-scrolling search action game in a few key ways. Its assortment of physical obstacles and aggressive enemies have direct parallels back to the lava and deadly critters of the original Metroid. MIO unlocks crucial new skills after major milestones, unlocking areas they've known about but couldn't access. MIO doesn't shoot, but the reach of their tentacles lets them attack from a slight distance, like the short range of Samus' arm cannon before she upgrades it. 

MIO's action establishes its own distinctive rhythm through its fluid, expansive range of motion. Most of the abilities you'll unlock are movement-based. Initially limited to a double jump, MIO will eventually be able to float, fling themselves by grappling onto certain nodes, scurry across walls and roofs like a spider, and more. All these abilities tap into the same small reserve of energy which is only restored in two ways: by standing still on solid ground for a beat, or by striking an enemy or one of a handful of other sources of energy. A good chunk of the game is trying to move through treacherous territory by keeping MIO airborne, bouncing off enemies or energy-restoring flowers without touching the deadly turf that surrounds them. You basically have to become a master juggler, using MIO's skills to keep them in the air until they finally reach a safe spot. You'll need crack reflexes, a good memory, and an almost endless reservoir of patience to make it through the game's trickiest platforming sequences, of which there are many. It can be deeply frustrating to hurl yourself at the same long, intricate passage again and again, dying with the slightest misjudged jump and restarting over from the very first step; when you do make it through one of those sections, though, it feels like a genuine, pump-your-fist-in-the-air triumph. That reliance on airborne maneuvers and clockwork precision can be found in many of the game's boss battles, too.



Despite its obvious love of Metroid, MIO is a game of its time, fully aware of Hollow Knight's massive impact. It runs at a fast pace, MIO can only take a few hits before dying, there's a currency that's lost whenever they do die, and there are a number of optional, equippable modifiers that can be found or bought that boost MIO's defense or offense. Team Cherry's most obvious inspiration is difficulty, though: MIO's boss battles are brutal. Most of them are rapid-fire chaos, with a large variety of attacks that are cycled through randomly and require instant recognition to avoid, and invariably a second phase where everything gets faster and more complex. If you enjoy this genre for its sense of exploration and discovery, and aren't particularly adept at split-second action, these battles (of which there are many) will serve as frequent brick walls to your progress. 

Fortunately MIO offers a few options that help moderate that challenge. In the settings you can pick a “pacifist” mode where none of the regular enemies attack you first—although that won't help with the boss battles, which, outside of some long and complicated platforming sections, are the only extremely tough moments in the game. There's also an option that will grant MIO a one-hit shield if they stand still on the ground for five seconds. That's also not particularly useful in a boss battle, as you'll constantly be on the move in all of them. The most genuinely useful one of these accessibility options is also guaranteed to be the most controversial. You can choose to “erode” the bosses over time, marginally weakening them every time they kill you. With that option on, boss battles become a form of endurance test: throw yourself at them over and over, and inevitably they'll get so weak that you'll finally beat them. It's an option that certain types of player will dismiss out of hand, but without it many who would appreciate MIO's world and general aesthetic would no doubt drop out of it at the very first boss.

That would be a shame, because that world and aesthetic are fantastic. Evoking the intricate details, subdued colors, and surreal flourishes of comic artist Moebius, MIO looks like a Euro sci-fi comic come to life. It even uses various sequential art techniques for dramatic effect like comic artists would, crowding out certain spaces with extreme detail to create a sense of claustrophobia or entrapment, or blanching other areas and leaving backgrounds unsketched to emphasize the foreground action. And although its story deals in some familiar sci-fi concepts, it's approached from a different angle than you'd expect from American creators; the developers at French studio Douze Dixièmes clearly hold cultural influences and inspirations not shared by American studios, visible not just in the game's art but in its understated focus on the emotional impacts of this mechanized system losing its sole reason for existing.

Search action, as it's known in Japan, is a crowded field. For a game to break through it has to be not just good, but unique. It has to marry smart, proficient design with a legitimately interesting and distinctive story and aesthetic. It's a high bar and MIO: Memories In Orbit sails right over it. There are no humans in its sci-fi, but sci-fi is rarely this human—the hands of its designers rarely this evident in a game.



MIO: Memories In Orbit was developed by Douze Dixièmes and published by Focus Entertainment. Our review is based on the PlayStation 5 version. It's also available for PC, Switch 2, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.

Robert Buckley just celebrated his rom-com ratings slamdunk in the most Robert Buckley way possible — by cracking up his fans and colleagues. 

On January 16, 2026, the Hallmark star posted a hilarious photo of himself in a tight tank top, loud 80s-style shorts, house slippers, and a mustache to boot, striking a sarcastically sexy pose. On the screen behind him was a still shot of himself in the 2025 Hallmark movie “An Unexpected Valentine,” which was just added to Netflix. 

“Unexpected Valentine is the #3 movie on Netflix today,” Buckley captioned his pic. “Jenny told me to stop wearing her tank tops, but you can't tell someone this famous what to do.”

The success of “An Unexpected Valentine” on Netflix is just the latest ratings win for the movie, which stars Buckley and Lacey Chabert. Even after Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas movie lineup, the rom-com was the network's most-watched movie of the year and the highest-rated movie across all of cable TV in 2025. 

Buckley's post was flooded with comments from fans, famous friends, and even his wife — actress Jenny Wade, who amusingly wrote of his tank top, “I didn't say to stop wearing it, I said to take it off. 😈🔥”

Hallmark screenwriter Russell Hainline — one of the writers behind Buckley's “Merry Christmas Ted Cooper,” also weighed in on the skin-tight top. Approving of Buckley repping Carpinteria, a popular California surf town, he wrote, “Carpinteria tanks and mustaches are IN” 

Buckley's “Christmas House” co-star Jonathan Bennett called him a “legend” and their mom in the movies, Sharon Lawrence, cutely commented, “As your TV Mom, I feel a bit responsible and I don't know how to process this…”

Hallmark's Andrew Walker chimed in with, “Unleashed star power,” and tons of fans commented too, including one who wrote of the movie's Netflix popularity, “I'm just waiting for what happens when it hits #1.”

When “An Unexpected Valentine” premiered in early February 2025, Buckley said on the “Deck the Halls” podcast that it was an easy yes for him when he learned Chabert was involved. 

He recalled, “When they said Lacey Chabert, I threw my elbows up, I was just like ‘this is so great!' and ‘I've made the big leagues! I've made the big leagues!' So I opened up my trunk of wigs and I pulled out my best wigs and I flew up to Canada and I gave them 15 days of my best.” 

Hallmark's synopsis of the movie says, “A chance encounter on Valentine's Day brings Hannah and Finn together as they race through New York City to return a lost engagement ring and save one couple's special day.” 

In addition to being available to stream on Netflix and on Hallmark+, the movie will re-air on Hallmark Channel on January 20 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, February 2 at 6 p.m. Eastern time, and on Valentine's Day at 6 p.m. Eastern time.

On Saturday, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles presented the world premiere of a new 4K restoration of George Stevens‘ “The Greatest Story Ever Told” (1965), one of the most ambitious and experimental of all Hollywood epics. Director Martin Scorsese, whose Film Foundation was instrumental in restoring the film (and whose “The Last Temptation of Christ” is the only biblical epic that rivals “The Greatest Story” in its audacity and complexity), provided a video introduction in which he celebrated Stevens' masterpiece as the summation of his work.

 










“ The film was shot in Ultra Panavision 70 with lenses that yielded an aspect ratio of 2.76 to 1, and it was breathtaking,” Scorsese said. “But it wasn't just the size of the image, it was the imprint of the man behind the camera who knew how to fill that frame, how to compose it. And composer seems like the right word to describe George Stevens and the extraordinary level of artistry he reached at that point in his life and career.”

Scorsese explained that when Stevens came back from World War II, his work took on a new sense of purpose and urgency in powerful works like “A Place in the Sun,” “Shane,” “Giant,” and “The Diary of Anne Frank.” “He began to pay very close attention to evil, to the greed and the hatred and the raw murderous violence that can overtake us all if we don't all pay attention,” Scorsese said. “Those pictures are grand cinematic canvases, but they're also urgent warnings to take care of our goodness and our love.”

Although Stevens was not a particularly religious man, he saw in Jesus Christ a way to explore those themes on their grandest scale. “‘The Greatest Story Ever Told' is the summation,” Scorsese said. “It's the final movement of Stevens' multi-picture symphony. Stevens chose to enact the story on a scale of mythic grandeur and timeless immensity. This picture was years in the making at a cast of thousands.” It also felt of a piece with Stevens' Westerns thanks to the unusual choices the director made when it came to locations.

“It was set against the backdrop of the American West in locations that we normally associate with Westerns,” Scorsese said. “Death Valley, Moab, Utah, Pyramid Lake in Nevada. It's an extraordinary idea and it was really controversial because most biblical epics up to that time been shot somewhere near the Middle East or in the Middle East.” Scorsese noted that the film was part of a trend that included Nicolas Ray's “King of Kings” and Pier Paolo Pasolini's “The Gospel According to St. Matthew” that brought a new immediacy to the story of Jesus Christ. “They turned away from the conventions of the period.”

 










Scorsese added that the production encountered “one calamity after another” and ultimately didn't fully realize Stevens' vision. “ Nevertheless, Stevens put everything he had into the telling of the story of Jesus and you could feel it from the first frame to the last,” Scorsese said. “He wanted to embody the tragedy and the redemption of humanity on every level. In a way, his ambitions were so grand that it wasn't possible to realize them fully, but the sheer intensity and artistry of the picture is moving all on its own. There's nothing else quite like it.”

Stevens' son, filmmaker George Stevens Jr., supervised the Film Foundation's restoration and appeared in person at the Academy Museum to introduce Guillermo del Toro, a lifelong Stevens enthusiast and Film Foundation board member who was present to deliver a 20-minute lecture on “The Greatest Story Ever Told” before the film. As a Catholic raised in Mexico, del Toro estimated that he had seen “The Greatest Story” over 20 times — and he sat with the audience in the Academy Museum to watch it again in its exquisite new restoration.

Del Toro provided rich historical context for the film, describing Stevens' path through several epochs of filmmaking. “He lived through every era of cinema,” del Toro said before exploring Stevens' innovations during the silent period, his wartime documentary work, his seminal post-war American epics, and the influence he had on the New Hollywood. This last topic was where del Toro's lecture was most revelatory, as he explained why the perception of Stevens as a staid classical filmmaker is dead wrong, and that in fact Stevens was a modernist who influenced one of the most groundbreaking films of the 1960s, “Bonnie and Clyde.”

 










“I want to make the case today that this man influenced the New American Cinema,” del Toro said. “He influenced Martin Ritt, Warren Beatty, Terrence Malick and many more.” Del Toro gave the example of Warren Beatty studying the sound mix of “Shane” and applying its principles to the climactic shoot-out in “Bonnie and Clyde.” “Beatty was the first man that noticed ‘Shane' was a modern film by a modern master. Stevens insisted that the percussion, the brutality of a gunshot overpowers with its violence, and Beatty understands that this is a bold decision, a bold technique.”

In discussing “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” del Toro insightfully drew parallels between Stevens' age and our own, both in terms of world politics and upheaval in the film industry. “ His canvas became Ultra Panavision 70, with a spherical system that gave him extra space,” del Toro said. “When he shot this movie, there was a battle between TV and cinema — we're there again — and the battle was how to get people into theaters. One of the things was spectacle. The larger formats were getting people into theaters, but very few directors really knew how to use it and how to use it expressively.”

Del Toro added that Stevens used the vast potential of the Ultra Panavision 70 frame as a tool to examine his themes with sweep and intensity. “You can find out more about an artist by their art than by sharing space and time with them,” del Toro said when explaining that “The Greatest Story Ever Told” expressed Stevens' profoundly humanistic point of view. “This is a time and a generation that didn't signal virtue, they practiced it. They didn't tell you who they were, they demonstrated who they were.”

 










“The Greatest Story Ever Told” represented a demonstration of all that Stevens had learned and felt about good and evil since liberating Dachau concentration camp during his time in the service, an experience that informed the film he made right before “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” “The Diary of Anne Frank.” “One of the questions he was trying to grapple with was that no one group crucified Jesus,” del Toro said. “We all crucified Jesus. Stevens said there was no them, it was us.”

Yet for del Toro, what stands out about “The Greatest Story Ever Told” and the rest of Stevens' body of work is its hopefulness and faith. “He realized that art and narrative have such a high calling to tell us what we are and who we are, and that compassion and decency are our superpowers,” del Toro said. “Don't let them lie to you that hatred is our superpower. It diminishes us, and Stevens understood this.”

Stevens only made one film after “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” the Warren Beatty vehicle “The Only Game in Town,” which got made due to Beatty's reverence for the master director. “What would George Stevens have done after this film if given another chance at the canvas he was grappling with?” del Toro asked before closing his lecture with the memory of watching “The Greatest Story Ever Told.” “If you grow up Mexican, every Easter you saw this movie. It's Saturday, but let's have Easter together.”

 










“The Greatest Story Ever Told” premiered at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, where Guillermo del Toro presented this year's “George Stevens Lecture on Directing”— the museum's ongoing lecture series about the art of filmmaking. For information on future museum events, visit their website.

Last night (January 17), Bruce Springsteen made an unannounced appearance at New Jersey's Light of Day WinterFest — a regular haunt, as far as his “surprise” performances go. While joining headliners Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers onstage at the non-profit's event, Springsteen strongly denounced the ongoing ICE raids in Minnesota and dedicated his 1978 song “The Promised Land” to Renee Good, the mother recently killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Watch a fan-shot video of the moment below.

“This next song is probably one of my greatest songs,” the Boss said before playing “The Promised Land.” “And I don't want to be out of water tonight, but I wrote this song as an ode to American possibility: both to the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be. Now, right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it has never been in modern times. Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now.”

Springsteen continued: “So as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy, in liberty; if you believe that truth still matters, and that it's worth speaking out, and it's worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed, masked, federal troops invading American cities, and using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest; then send a message to this president. And as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis. So this song is for you, and the memory of the mother of three and American citizen Renee Good.”

Last year, Springsteen kicked off one the E Street Band's shows in Manchester, England, by giving an impassioned speech about President Donald J. Trump and his “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.” As far as political outspokenness goes, Springsteen has called out Trump and his policies for the better part of a decade, and voiced his opposition at the ballot box by proudly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent, in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Springsteen also released the fabled Electric Nebraska sessions last year as part of the box set Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition. Plus, the Boss sat down with Jeremy Allen White on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to discuss his new biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.

	Three days after releasing their seventh mini album, The Sin : Vanish, on Friday, ENHYPEN are back with a remix album that was released earlier today. Actually, make that seven remix albums, each one spearheaded by a member of the septet. You'd think that creating extra work for themselves would be exhausting, but ENHYPEN collectively view it as an artistic opportunity. 


	“I actually loved working on my remix album, The Sin : Vanish (Sunoo ver.),” Sunoo tells Rolling Stone over a Zoom chat. “I feel like this was a great way to expand my own engagement in recording, so I loved the experience.” 


	At this point, his bandmates nod their approval as they huddle together in a conference room at HYBE's Seoul office. They are all dressed casually (T-shirts, baseball caps, beanies, and a parka or two), with none of the stage makeup they wear for photo shoots and music videos. Sunoo, Sunghoon, Jay, and Jake sit in the front, with Heeseung, Jungwon, and Ni-ki seated in the back. They are polite, waiting for their turns to talk about their respective remix albums, which all share the same title — The Sin : Vanish, with the parenthetical inclusion of each member's specific name. 

	











	As the interview continues, they clap and make finger hearts to show their appreciation, and are vocal about looking out for each other. For instance, when Sunoo inadvertently disappears from view, Sunghoon gently pulls him back into the frame. Since their November 2020 debut, ENHYPEN have cultivated a sexy vampire lore. But during this exclusive interview with Rolling Stone, they exude more of a golden retriever-style vibe than that of the sullen undead.

	











	ENHYPEN's digital remix albums contain all 11 tracks from the group's mini album — six songs, including the lead single, “Knife,” plus four theatrical narrations courtesy of professional actors, and a skit — as well as their own remixes of “Knife,” an English version of “Knife,” and individual vocal notes.

	Hailing from a country that doesn't have a gun culture, ENHYPEN chose a knife as the central image in their lead track — reflecting not only on South Korea's use of knives as the weapon of choice in K-dramas, but also how a normal knife isn't strong enough to kill a vampire. The group's vampire stories run deep, depicting the symbiotic relationship between the seven members and their loyal fandom, ENGENE. Which raises the question, if ENHYPEN are the vampires, how do ENGENE fit in?


	“You know how there are always female characters that we include on our albums and trailers?” Sunghoon asks. “We are always mindful of ENGENE as we're producing our work. So they could be equated to those female characters and could be our friends. Vampire friends.”


	Ethnomusicologist Donna Kwon applauds ENHYPEN's commitment to the vampire lore, which has traditionally been tied to Eastern European culture. “With their ‘Bite Me' video from 2023, I think they also challenged K-pop conventions a little bit,” Kwon — a professor at the University of Kentucky and the author of Music in Korea: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture — tells Rolling Stone. “The presence or development of lore is one of a number of strategies that a group can employ to gain fans, stand out, and be competitive. For those fans who really like lore, they often link to other members of the fandom to figure out the various meanings and details.”


	Asked how many songs ENHYPEN discussed before deciding that “Knife” would be the one they all remixed, Sunghoon says, “It was ‘Knife' all along. From the beginning, we were all on the same page about that. We just worked on it in our different ways.”


	For instance, group leader Jungwon blended industrial and metal for his remix. “My version is in the nu metal genre,” he says. “We do a lot of live shows, so obviously I had that in mind from the get-go. The original track ‘Knife' itself has a really punchy sound, but I knew that the band sound goes really well with the hip-hop and trap undercurrent, so I wanted to mix that band sound to make it even punchier.”

	“The remix began with Jungwon's vision for the stage, where he wanted a track that radiates strong, playful energy for live performances,” adds producer Armadillo, who worked with him. “Since artists often perceive music differently from producers, we felt his initial idea was compelling and began shaping the track around that concept. During production, we worked together on the main guitar riff. Jungwon already had a clear idea of the drum patterns in mind. With virtual instruments set up with kick and snare, he performed the drum parts on the master keyboard, producing a rhythm and energy that exceeded expectations. The session felt less like formal production and more like a collaborative jam.”


	Meanwhile, Heeseung's remix has a hypnotic vibe that's dance-driven, with an echoey backbeat. The vocalist also recorded additional vocals not on the original track.


“I collaborated with Apro, who's a close friend and producer, on this electronic boom-bap remix,” Heeseung says. “I wanted to work with the BPM so that people can really enjoy it in a laidback, kind of chill manner. I wanted the song to have a catchy charm, so we mixed in a lot of effects, like the dice-rolling sound, to give it a dynamic touch. The reason why I did [some new vocals] was because I wanted to stick to bringing out the original charm, while adding a fun and exciting touch. I played the synthesizer myself in some parts. I'm really happy with how it turned out.”


	“For the vocals, Heeseung's input was central to the process,” Apro adds. “We reworked the arrangement around short, repetitive phrases to enhance catchiness, while newly recorded doubling and chorus pad layers were added to increase density and create a richer, more expansive vocal texture.”


	Seattle native Jay had a clear vision for his “Knife” remix. That the guitar-driven banger sounds stadium-ready is intentional.


	“I made this remix with my really close producer friend, Frants, who I made a lot of my recent music with,” Jay says. “He knows how I work and my style, so the progress was really easy and smooth to get kind of an aggressive metal vibe. I thought it would sound really good when we play this onstage or as an encore somewhere in the States or a country that really loves metal.”


	“Jay had a clear vision of the remix's overall direction from the very beginning, not only sonically, but also in terms of how it would unfold onstage at scale,” Frants says. “Rather than altering the essence of the original track, we focused on amplifying its energy and sense of scale, carefully shaping the sound to align with the powerful imagery and musical direction Jay had envisioned.”

	











	For Korean Australian Jake, tapping into old-school Memphis hip-hop resulted in a song that sounds both retro and fresh.


	“I feel like Memphis-style beats are very popular and hot right now,” Jake says. “There are a lot of young artists over in the U.K. and Europe who are making this type of music. I listen to them a lot and feel like it's going to get loved even more from now on. I've always wanted to try making music with this type of beat. I feel like it's very minimal. There are less sounds and sources in my track, but I feel like that's the key to these types of beats.”


	“While Jake naturally carries a soft, romantic image, he possesses a distinctly grounded core as an artist,” adds Ca$hcow, the producer he collaborated with. “He shows a high level of concentration in the studio and isn't afraid to strip away anything unnecessary, which gave me the impression that he aims to convey presence and charisma through his music. To best reflect that mindset, we gravitated toward a minimal, loop-driven Memphis hip-hop style built on tension and repetition, which aligns perfectly with Jake's controlled, understated energy.”


	Sunghoon remembers contemplating which direction he wanted to go in before leaning into a vibrant baile funk sound. The former competitive figure skater says he hopes fans will enjoy his version, and shyly adds that it would be fun if his “Knife” remix went viral.  


	“I was inspired by Brazilian funk,” Sunghoon says. “If you look at the challenges and the sounds that are really blowing up on TikTok, I noticed that baile funk was really popular as a genre, so I wanted to try it out, too.”


	“Before working on this remix together, I had briefly met Sunghoon on another occasion, and he shared the vision he had been developing for a long time,” Armadillo adds. “His main focus was creating music that could be used for short-form content, making it interactive and engaging for fans rather than just a listening experience. As a producer, I found this approach both refreshing and unconventional. He was thinking more about how the music would be used than about the genre itself. Thanks to this clear direction, the track naturally took shape as high-energy baile funk. With the goal so well defined, when we finally met to work together, the main loop track was completed in under two hours. The energy, catchiness, and all the elements of the genre came together in a way that felt incredibly exciting and fun.”

	











	While Sunghoon tackled baile funk, Sunoo opted to record a digi-pop version of “Knife” that's optimistically upbeat, but with a dramatically tense side that belies the artist's sunny disposition.


	“My producer and I had a lot of conversations about what kind of direction we should go down,” Sunoo says. “The name of the genre officially is glitch pop. It gives a lot of heavy video-game vibes, which is something I've always wanted to try. It was a great experience and in terms of the storytelling, it's very powerful. So, I just had a great time, overall.”


	“Sunoo's remix was initiated from his unpredictability and broad emotional spectrum,” says Ca$hcow. “At its core is his bright, uplifting energy, but we felt that his real charm lies in the delicate tension created by the anxiety and sensitivity that coexist within it. To capture that duality, we leaned away from overly polished sounds and instead used fractured textures to add character and edge. Sunoo tends to resonate more with tracks that openly reflect instinct and personal taste, rather than music with a clearly defined formula. With that in mind, we avoided locking the structure into something too rigid and focused on intuitively layering elements we felt he would connect with.”Youngest member Ni-ki, who hails from Japan, had very specific ideas about how he wanted his remix to sound. His “Knife” starts off fast with vocal effects that give the song an urgent vibe. It's an energetic and intense boom-bap song intended to get people dancing.


	“I've been a dancer for a long time, ever since I was a trainee up until now,” Ni-ki says. “And the thing is, we listen to a lot of sped-up boom-bap-type tracks when we warm up before practice. So I did have in mind that I wanted that retro kind of old-school hip-hop vibe. There are some fun elements and details that we added, like the glitching sound of the radio when it starts out, which was intentional. I feel like at the end of the day, we have a great track to dance to.”


	“For the opening vocals, which feature a fully resampled choir layer, we aimed for an old-school, vintage texture by using cassette-style plugins from Wavesfactory and vinyl-inspired processing with RC-20,” says producer BreadBeat. “While we initially considered both tech house and hip-hop, Ni-ki suggested starting the production in a sped-up format and allowing the genre to take shape naturally. That idea became a key turning point, and his innately heavy, groove-driven energy ultimately led us toward a boom-bap–style remix. As a strong dancer, Ni-ki gravitates toward rhythms with clear groove and momentum, and his input played a big role in shaping the arrangement and dynamics of the sped-up vocals.”

	











	As the interview draws to a close, the group reflect on how much they've grown as artists in the past five years. I ask them, if they could go back in time and meet their 10-year-old selves, what would they tell them?


	“I'm going to tell little me to fill your heart and be true to your emotions,” Ni-ki says. “Just do what you want to do, or what your heart wishes, and visualize your dream. And one day, you will meet a lot of great older brothers.”


	Sunghoon smiles at the group maknae — or youngest member — and says, “I kind of struggled when I did figure skating. I had a tough time because of keeping track of the scores and how well I was doing. I just want to tell him to be confident and don't obsess over the numbers and scores.”


	“I want to tell myself to visualize your future,” Jay says. “What you think and how much you work will become your future, so try your best. You don't have to be upset with your life path.”


	“We had a tour called Fate in the past,” Jake says. “I believe in fate and that everything is done for a reason. So I would tell my younger self to just do what you've got to do.”


	Jungwon says he doesn't want to say anything specifically to his child self, except, “Trust yourself and have faith in yourself.”

	Smiling, Sunoo says, “I wish I had exercised more when I was a child, because I think I could've gotten taller if I had worked out more, but I didn't. So I'd like to encourage him to be an athletic kid.”


	Heeseung contemplates the question, before answering. “I don't think I'll say anything [to him], because my MBTI is a T [thinking], and I'm a logical, rational person. I know that 10-year-old me has to follow the exact same route to get where I am today.”

	The first trial in the Riverside Church youth basketball sex-abuse scandal is winding to a close, with final witness testimony to be heard Tuesday in lower Manhattan before the case is handed to the six-person jury for deliberations.


	Riverside is scheduled to call Dr. Steven Fayer as an expert psychiatric witness in its defense against 64-year-old former player Daryl Powell's lawsuit, the first of 27 suits against the church to go to trial under New York's 2019 Child Victims Act. As detailed in a joint investigation by Rolling Stone and Sportico, all 27 men have claimed they were sexually abused as children by Ernest Lorch, the multimillionaire corporate attorney and finance executive who directed and coached the powerhouse Riverside Hawks youth program for 41 years until his ouster in 2002. Lorch died in 2012. 


	The plaintiffs accuse the church of negligence in allowing the coach free rein to abuse children. Powell, a former Marist College star, specifically alleges Lorch regularly groped his genitals as a teen during “jockstrap inspections” and routinely paddled and fondled his bare buttocks, ostensibly to discipline the player.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Fayer examined Powell last October and will provide expert testimony, likely about his exam and the conclusions of Powell's expert witness, Dr. Anthony Charuvastra, who also examined the former player and testified last week.


	Last week' proceedings in State Supreme Court Judge Alexander Tisch's courtroom saw Powell's final witness, a deceased former player whose video deposition excerpts were played for the jury, and three witnesses called by Riverside.

	











	Michael McDuffen, who filed his own lawsuit against Riverside in 2021 but died of cancer in 2024 at age 65, told of how Lorch allegedly abused him. “It started the first time I came out of the shower,” said McDuffen, who was in hospice and at times during the deposition would nod off due to his medications. He said Lorch asked to look at the player's arms “to see if I'm a drug addict” and then began smelling him “all over.” That echoed testimony from Powell, who alleges Lorch would smell his body to check if he'd showered.

	Another time, McDuffen said on the video, Lorch took him to his Upper East Side apartment, had him shower, and then beckoned him to his bedroom, where the coach was on his bed “butt naked” and told the player, “You know what to do.”


	In his lawsuit, McDuffen alleges Lorch frequently abused him, forcing him to perform oral sex at his apartment and molesting him in a swimming pool at Lorch's house in rural Vermont. That testimony was not heard by the Powell jury.


	In addition to Powell and McDuffen, four other players suing Riverside gave testimony about experiencing Lorch's abuse. One of them, Ellis Williams, died last year, so portions of his deposition were read to the jury.


	Throughout the trial, Riverside has put forth the case that the church had no notice of Lorch's behavior and should bear no responsibility. On Thursday, the defense called Ramon Ruiz, who worked as a custodian at the church from 1973 until his retirement last year. He said he never saw any inappropriate behavior by Lorch in the church basement, which harbored the basketball court, locker room, office space, and equipment rooms where Powell and others allege abuse took place.


	Ruiz testified he cleaned the basketball facilities every day and sometimes observed the Hawks teams practicing. Riverside defense attorney Phil Semprevivo asked him whether he ever saw players paddled, touched inappropriately, or ever heard any complaints from players about Lorch. He answered no to all three questions, saying he rarely spoke to players.

	The jury heard similar testimony from the current Riverside Hawks program director, Anthony Hargreaves, who played for the church in the late 1970s and early eighties. He said Riverside offered him “a way out” of his gang-infested South Bronx neighborhood, helping him land a Division I basketball scholarship to Iona College, where he rose to captain of the team and earned a degree that helped him launch a career in finance at Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan.

	











	Hargreaves said he earns a $40,000 annual salary as Riverside's program director but that it didn't affect his testimony. He testified that he never saw Lorch inappropriately touch anyone while he was playing for the program, nor did he see anyone getting paddled by Lorch.


	Powell's side tried to downplay the importance of Hargreaves' and Ruiz' lack of knowledge of misconduct, attempting to show that they may simply not have been around at the right times to witness wrongdoing. Hargreaves testified that while he “knew of” the paddle from players having conversations about it, he never actually saw it and didn't know it belonged to Lorch.


	Under cross-examination from Powell attorney Paul Mones, Hargreaves said he was a “Dudley Do-Right” with a “limited amount of friends” who went straight from Hawks practices to his home, under strict orders from his mother.


	He said he never took a shower at the church, and that while he never experienced “a jockstrap” inspection, he had heard about them. Several witnesses, including Powell, have said Lorch required players to wear jockstraps, would frequently check by looking and feeling if they were wearing them, and would punish them, often with a paddle, if they didn't.


	Under further questioning from Mones, Hargreaves seemed to soften his blanket assertion about the inspections, saying: “I don't recall whether I got in trouble for wearing ‘tighty whiteys.' … I don't recall a jockstrap inspection.”


	Under cross-examination from Powell attorney Lawrence Luttrell, Ruiz said that while he never saw anything in the gym or locker rooms, he cleaned those facilities from approximately 7 to 7:30 a.m., when neither Lorch nor the Hawks players were around.

	When players were showering, Ruiz said, he was working elsewhere in the massive church. Semprevivo then elicited testimony that the custodial offices were in the basement not far from the facilities the Hawks used, so maintenance people would have had opportunity to witness wrongdoing, had there been any, at other times of day.


	Riverside also recalled to the stand the church's chief operating officer Natalie Fein, who described for the jury the progressive, Rockefeller-funded institution's community programs. Under questioning from Luttrell earlier in the week, Fein testified she could find no records of supervisory guidelines or rules for the basketball program during Lorch's tenure in the church's two floors of archives.

	Goodbye, Park City, and thanks for all the memories. 


	Back in 1978, when Robert Redford first established what was then known as the Utah/U.S. Film Festival, this modest little affair was based in Salt Lake City; the initial idea was simply to attract more filmmakers to the region. Then, in 1981, Redford moved the fest to Park City, a quaint little ski-resort town where he owned property. And for the past 45 years, that's where this event — which would eventually be rechristened the Sundance Film Festival, after one of the actor's most famous roles, in 1991 — took place. Film lovers, industry bigwigs, indie-cinema movers and shakers, A-list celebrities, wannabe auteurs, and legions of corporate sponsors and lookieloo tourists and paparazzi flocked to this small hamlet in the snowy Utah mountains every January to make deals, establish careers, debate the future of the art form and, above all, to see movies. Lots and lots and lots of movies.


	Now, with a relocation to Boulder, Colorado, on the horizon, Sundance is ready to say farewell to its longtime home. When the 2026 edition of the festival kicks off on January 22nd, it will be its final go-round in Park City, and its first without its late, great founder. We'd be lying if we said we weren't a little misty-eyed about bidding adieu to the place where we'd seen so many memorable, occasionally lifechanging films. But damned if Sundance is not exiting its former base of operations without one last big bang. This year's lineup looks to be one of its strongest in years, and we'll be reporting on the highs and lows of the fest throughout its 11-day run. But here's a look at some of the hotter, buzzier titles that seem poised to set Park City on fire (metaphorically speaking). From Charli XCX's white-hot meta-fiction about Brat Summer to a white-knuckle Ethan Hawke survivalist thriller, a warped midnight movie from an Adult Swim legend to a doc about the life, times, and comeback of Courtney Love — here are 22 movies we can't wait to see at Sundance 2026.


	Everyone has some sort of opinion on Courtney Love — her history, her artistry, her marriage, her persona, her problems, and the undeniable force of the music she made with her seminal 1990s band Hole. Ms. Love is well aware of what folks might think about her — and she's ready to set the record straight on a few things. Documentarians Edward Lovelace and James Hall give the former girl with the most cake a stage in which to tell her own story in her own words, covering everything from her tumultuous youth to her early brushes with fame to everything that happened after. We've been waiting for this for a long time.


	It was the summer of '95, and Australian music promoter Stephen “Pav” Pavlovic was putting together a traveling down-under music festival he dubbed “Summersault.” The lineup included the Beastie Boys, the Foo Fighters, Sonic Youth, Bikini Kill, Rancid, Pavement, Beck, and a host of James Lavelle's Mo' Wax crew. Fresh off of directing the cinéma du Sandler classic Billy Madison, Tamra Davis was following the traveling circus, camera in hand; she'd end up recording a number of performances, along with a handful of interviews with the musicians. Cut to January 2025, when Davis was evacuating her house during the Palisades fires. She happened to come across a box of tapes filled with her old Summersault footage — and now we get this oral history-cum-mixtape of a once-in-a-lifetime fest that captured a moment of Nineties live music in full feedback-soaked bloom.


	When we were forced to bid farewell (on this plain of existence, at least) to Marianne Faithfull in January of last year, it wasn't just one more cascade of tears going by — the loss of both a Sixties icon and a genuinely timeless iconoclast felt like a true end of an era. Documentarians Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (no strangers to iconoclasts, having made the Nick Cave portrait 20,000 Days on Earth) revisit the life and times of the singer via something called the Ministry of Not Forgetting, where Tilda Swinton interviews the lady herself and digs into the who, what, where, and when of it all. Nick Cave, Courtney Love, Beth Orton, and Suki Waterhouse occasionally drop by to sing a song or three. Having played festivals in Venice, London and Taipei, this singular take on the music doc makes it's U.S. premiere here at Sundance. The Faithfull faithful on these shores may now commence rejoicing.


	The program note for this festival selection consists of a single sentence: “A brave girl and her friends must escape a kids' television show.” Pretty vague, amirite? And yet! There may not be another movie in Sundance's Midnight sidebar that we're looking forward to seeing more than this one, due to the fact that thias comes courtesy of writer-director Casper Kelly, the gent who gave usthose demented Adult Swim Yule Loge videos, the instant classic “Too Many Cooks,” the TV show Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell, and a number of other brain-melting, psychotronic shorts. Also check out the cast: Cristin Milioti, Michael Shannon, Patton Oswalt, Keegan Michael-Key, Topher Grace and If I Had Legs I'd Kick You‘s Delany Quinn. Something tells us this one is going to generate some chatter. And probably some vomiting.


	Noah (Chris Pine) is a doctor, a divorcé, and a dad who's determined to make a modest medical practice in Cleveland enough to sustain both a close proximity to his daughter and his sense of well-being. He's content to be on his own. Then an old high-school flame named Rebecca (Jenny Slate) returns, and suddenly, his carefully constructed life is upended. We're fans of filmmaker Rachel Lambert's previous Sundance entry, the oddball Daisy Ridley vehicle Sometimes I Think About Dying (2023), so we're excited to see what she does with a similar story of self-imposed isolation and second chances.


	Comedian Iliza Shlesinger wrote and stars in this dramedy about a woman who, having found herself unexpectedly single and unemployed, retreats to her hometown in Texas. Once back in the Lone Star state, she finds her past catching up to her and naturally gets caught up in a host of angst-fueled shenanigans. Personally, you had us at “Iliza Shlesinger” — her stand-up specials are a hoot, and if you've seen her supporting turn in 2020's Pieces of a Woman, you know she has chops — but add in the fact that she's enlisted Jospehine Decker (Madeline's Madeline, Shirley), and you've got something that sounds like more than just another millennial coming-of-age story.


	From the moment that heard the Wu-Tang Clan's seminal debut album Enter the 36 Chambers, Tarik Azzougarh became an instant ride-or-die fan. The Dutch-Moroccan kid quickly put together his own hip-hop crew in his hometown of Tilburg, and ended up slinging verses onstage next to Ol' Dirty Bastard when the group played in Amsterdam. Taking the name Cilvaringz, Azzougarh would become a Wu “affiliate” and end up booking a world tour for RZA. He'd also began conceiving and producing a project that would eventually be called Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, and, well… you know what happened next. Oscar-winning filmmaker Joanna Natasegara chronicles how a kid obsessed with the Staten Island collective ended up collaborating with heroes — and how what was supposed to be a major addition to the Wu legend ended up becoming one of the most controversial album “releases” of all time.


	We remember catching Cathy Yan's debut Dead Pigs at Sundance 2018 and immediately pledging our allegiance to this sui generis filmmaker (not even a detour into superhero I.P., 2020's Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn, could dampen her sharp wit or her idiosyncrasies). So we're especially jazzed that she's back at the fest with one of the most buzzed-about screenings of this year's edition — it nabbed the prime Saturday-night-at-the-Eccles slot — about a gallery owner (Natalie Portman) trying to catch the attention of an art-world tastemaker (Zach Galifianakis) before Art Basel Miami kicks into full gear. Let's just say that a corpse becomes a key part of the equation. It's fair to call this particular satire “star-studded”: In addition to Portman and Galifianakis, the cast includes Jenna Ortega, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Sterling K. Brown.


	No surprise that A.I. is a hot doc topic at this year's fest, with not one but two different nonfiction takes on the tech that's causing a lot of deserved existential dread among us flesh-and-blood types. There's the Premieres section's The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, Daniel Roher and Charlie Tyrell's big-picture look at the ins and outs of artificial intelligence as filtered through the lens of fatherhood. And then there's this entry in the fest's more experimental, odds-and-sods NEXT sidebar from documentarian Valerie Veatch (Love Child), which takes a more essayistic approach about the history of human advancement through technological advances, and how the combination of utopian ideology, dystopian nightmares and good old-fashioned exploitation are playing into what could happen next with AI.  


	If you've seen John Wilson's brilliant HBO series How to With John Wilson, then you know this one-of-a-kind documentarian has a knack for turning the mundane into the magnificent, not to mention mining B-roll footage for maximum irony. His feature debut picks up where his TV show left off, with Wilson asking a simple question: what is the history of that substance that paves our sidewalks and provides our structures with a strong foundation? His attempt to find an answer will lead him everywhere from a screenwriting class that teaches you how to write a Hallmark movie to a marathon that requires runners to run around a block for 3100 miles. To say “we can't wait to see this,” per our list's headline, is severely underselling our excitement.


	He (Cooper Hoffman) is a young Angeleno who just scored a plum gig as an artist's assistant. She (Olivia Wilde) is his new boss, who's also decided that her new hire will become her “sexual muse.” Considering this cockeyed explored of intimacy, consent, power dynamics and hot ‘n' heavy kink comes to us courtesy of director, cowriter and New Queer Cinema icon Gregg Arraki (The Living End, The Doom Generation, Mysterious Skin), we expect a post office's worth of envelopes to get pushed before the end credits roll. Charli XCX, Daveed Diggs, The Studio‘s Chase Sui Wonders and Scream‘s Mason Gooding costar.


	Pixar legend Andrew Stanton (WALL-E, Finding Nemo) has spent the last decade directing episodes of top-shelf TV series (Stranger Things, Better Call Saul, For All Mankind). Now he steps back into the world of live-action features — his first since 2012's John Carter —  with this trilogy of tales that spans the prehistoric era to the present day to our distant future. A family of cave dwellers fight to survive the harsh terrain. An anthropology grad student (Rashida Jones) starts a relationship with a peer (Daveed Diggs) while studying the remains of early humans. And an astronaut (Kate McKinnon) roams the galaxy many, many light years from now, trying to ward off a threat to the ship's in-house ecosphere. Chances are good that there will be numerous similarities between all of these tales, which will lead folks to believe that time sure passes… well, see the title.


	Olivia Wilde isn't just at the festival as an actor for hire (see: I Want Your Sex). The hyphenate is also bringing her new directorial effort, the first since 2022's Don't Worry Darling — yeah, yeah, we know, quiet down now, people — which centers around two couples gathered together for what's supposed to be a nice, civil dinner party. Quicker than you can ask who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, the evening devolves into an airing of marital grievances that that threatens to go nuclear. Wilde and Seth Rogen play one of beleaguered duos; Edward Norton and Penelope Cruz play the other. Very curious about this one, in a sort of Bill-Hader-as-Keith-Morrison-chomping-popcorn-meme kind of way. 


	Remember how Charli XCX and “Brat Summer” dominated 2024? The singer-songwriter is now ready to give you a firsthand look at what it was like to be in the eye of that pop-superstar storm, via a cheeky metafictional comedy! Director, co-writer, and longtime Charli collaborator Aidan Zamiri has described this faux-chronicle of the hitmaker on tour as an “alternate history of the Brat era… if she'd made all the wrong choices.” Alexander Skarsgård plays the hottest director in town, who's been hired to document everything. Rachel Sennott, Kate Berlant, Rosanna Arquette, Jamie Demetriou, and Hailey Gates co-star. We assume the premiere will shock Sundance like a defibrillator.


	In 1972, the late, great filmmaker William Greaves (Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One) sent out an invite to the last living creators and emissaries of the Harlem Renaissance: come to Duke Ellington's apartment on the corner of West 157th and St. Nicholas Avenue for a night of cocktails and conversations. Greaves proceeded to document a who's who of songwriters, authors, poets, theater bigwigs, journalists, movers, and shakers sitting around and reminisced. The footage remained virtually unseen — until now. Thanks to David Greaves, William's son (and who was operating one of the cameras on that fateful night), we now get to be a fly on the wall as a host of legends detail how they made history and changed American art forever.


	Anyone who has been lucky enough to sample Maria Bamford's sense of humor — via her stand-up specials, the Comedians of Comedy documentary, her TV show Lady Dynamite, or at a mid-sized theater or club near you — can attest to the fact that she is one of the funniest, smartest, and most unique comics working today. Seriously: name another comedian who would center an entire televised showcase around performing her act live for her parents, and no one else. She's also had her share of struggles in terms of anxiety, depression, mental instability, and what may or may not be professional self-sabotage (it depends on whether you consider a Target pitch-person talking shit about the superstore to be “self-sabotage.”) Bamford has been long overdue for a solo doc, so thank the good lord that Judd Apatow and co-director Neil Berkeley have not only put this profile together, but refused to play down her issues — or how she's consistently managed to turn a long, hard stare into the abyss into a tight hour of hilarious material.


	Before the World Wide Web, before Wayne's World, before social media and the era of 24-7 content creators and influencers, there was public access television — a wild frontier of would-be talk show hosts, bon vivants, raconteurs, kooks, freaks, and free-speech advocates with a need to push the boundaries of good taste. When New York City introduced the nation's first public cable channel in 1971, it not only opened the floodgates to a host of DIY entertainers and marginalized communities — it changed what could be said and shown on the air. David Shadrack Smith's doc gets into the good, the bad, and the Midnight Blue of it all, filling in a lost chapter of media history that's crazier than you could imagine.


	Jay Duplass — he of the Duplass brothers, Transparent and Industry acting fame, and director of the recent shaggy-dog comedy The Baltimorons — hits Sundance with an adaptation of Adam Cayton-Holland's memoir Tragedy Plus Time: A Tragi-Comic Memoir. Cooper Raiff (Cha Cha Real Smooth) plays the author's screen counterpart, a young writer named Aaron who's trying to find his voice. Then a family tragedy forces him to deal with an unbearable loss, and the idea that humor can help guide folks through the darkest of times. If anyone can pull this off without turning this into quirky indie grief-porn, it's Duplass. Kaitlyn Dever, David Duchovny, Hope Davis, and Lucy Boynton costar.  


	Because what is Sundance without a ridiculous buddy comedy, usually involving various dim and/or down-on-their-luck dudes getting into absurd — and absurdly dangerous — situations? Thank god writer-director-actor Macon Blair (I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore) stepped up and gave the 2026 edition its requisite bumbling-idiots road-movie farce. O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Dave Franco are hired to transport a rich teen (The Black Phone‘s Mason Thames) to rehab. Simple enough, right? Before you can say The Ransom of Red Chief, however, he's turning their lives into a living hell. Also along for the ride: Peter Dinklage, Nicholas Braun, Kiernan Shipka, and Killer Mike.


	No stranger to Sundance — he's been a constant presence at the fest since Reality Bites premiered there in 1994 — Ethan Hawke stars as a Depression-era dad who ends up in a brutal work camp out in the Oregon wilderness. But there's this corrupt warden (Russell Crowe), see, and he has an offer: smuggle a mother lode's worth of gold through a 100 miles of unforgiving terrain, and if he makes it through, the prisoner can go free. The task is way, way harder than it sounds. This sounds so up our action-filled-1970s-style-character-study-survivalist-thriller alley.


	It started with a teenager being robbed and murdered for his Georgetown jacket in the hallways of his high school, during the middle of a school day; the 1983 crime would rock the Baltimore neighborhood in which it took place, causing a generation of kids to feel that they were unsafe in their own community. But it would also lead to a gross miscarriage of justice, in which one of the victim's best friends was coerced by the police to lie about what he witnessed that day — a decision which would send three innocent teens to jail for 36 years. Documentarian Dawn Porter (The Lady Bird Diaries, John Lewis: Good Trouble) and executive producer Ta-Nehisi Coates revisit the case, and dive into the details regarding the conspiracy that landed the trio in jail, how they were eventually exonerated and released, and the sense of guilt that hovered the young man whose decision cost them their freedom.


	Video artist and filmmaker Park Joon Eung — who goes by the nom de artiste Kogonada — has been one of the major Sundance discoveries of the past 10 years, having shown his extraordinary first feature Columbus at the festival in 2017. He's back with this elliptical, sci-fi–inflected story of a Hong Kong resident (Michelle Mao) who begins to encounter her future self. Then things apparently get weird(er). Longtime collaborator Haley Lu Richardson and Pachinko's Jin Ha add to the vibes.

A Vermont lawmaker is setting his sights on the skies with a new bill poised to create a UFO panel within the state. 

Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, has introduced legislation looking to set up the Vermont Airspace Safety and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force, according to the Vermont Digger. 

The bill reportedly proposes the creation of a state task force to investigate reports of both unidentified aerospace and underwater objects, assess safety risks regarding airspace, and work alongside federal partners and researchers to discover improved policies. 

The task force would be composed of officials from Vermont's departments of transportation and public safety, while also opening up seats for lawmakers and experts on the topic.

""I am not a subject matter expert at all,"" Headrick said, the Vermont Digger reported. ""As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging trends [in public safety]."" 

According to H.654, the panel would investigate reports of any unknown objects that exhibit ""performance characteristics not consistent with currently understood technologies,"" such as, ""instantaneous acceleration absent observable inertia or hypersonic velocity without a corresponding thermal signature or sonic boom."" 

Headrick initially introduced the legislation at the request of a constituent, lobbyist Maggie Lenz, according to Seven Days Vermont.

AMERICA'S SKIES ARE WIDE OPEN TO NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS, DRONE EXPERT WARNS: 'WE HAVE NO AWARENESS'

If passed, the new legislation would create a panel to investigate objects showcasing ""performance characteristics not consistent with currently understood technologies,"" such as, ""instantaneous acceleration absent observable inertia or hypersonic velocity without a corresponding thermal signature or sonic boom."" (iStock)

Lenz, owner of Atlas Government Affairs, reportedly became interested in the issue after a string of UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, made headlines throughout New Jersey in 2024, sparking nationwide panic regarding countless mysterious flying objects. 

""I'm certainly not saying that it's aliens,"" Lenz said, according to Seven Days Vermont. ""But I do think just having the conversation here in Vermont will begin to allow for it to be taken a little bit more seriously.""

The proposed legislation replicates the federal government's response to UAPs in recent years, following Congress passing the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act in 2023 and the U.S. Department of War's creation of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

Rep. Headrick reportedly offered a more practical use for the proposed committee – including investigating drone sightings as use of the technology continues to grow within the state. (iStock)

The draft bill indicates that Vermonters have reported UAP sightings to police in various instances, signaling a need for a coordinated response between state and federal officials. 

While speaking before Vermont's House Government Operations Committee last week, Headrick offered a more down-to-earth reason behind the proposed bill – pointing to the surge of drones throughout the state. 

""The proliferation of drone use — this is where I see the need for data,"" Headrick told the committee, the Vermont Digger reported.

Headrick did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While the proposed bill has yet to be voted on by the committee, Headrick reportedly tried to sweeten the deal by promising to look into Vermont's famed sea monster if the legislation is passed. 

""For the cryptids fans in the room, there's an underwater provision to this as well,"" Headrick said, according to the Vermont Digger. ""So if we want to investigate Champ, we can do that.""

A financial crisis could be triggered by an announcement that aliens exist, according to Helen McCaw, a former policy expert of the Bank of England.

McCaw told The Times of London that politicians and bankers can't afford to dismiss alien life, and wrote to the governor of the Bank of England, urging him to organize a contingency plan in case the White House confirms alien existence.

A 2021 study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that intelligent life exists beyond Earth. Some Americans, meanwhile, believe that there is proof of UFOs and alien life being concealed from the public by global governments. However, this belief is held by a significant minority.

President Donald Trump has previously indicated that his administration may declassify some information on the nature of extraterrestrial life. In 2025, the UFO documentary The Age of Disclosure made headlines, and its director Dan Farah said that Trump could reveal the existence of aliens.

McCaw was a senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England for ten years, until 2012.

She told The Times, ""The United States government appears to be partway through a multiyear process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).""

""If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions. It is entirely possible that government leadership and their central banks have not been properly briefed on the topic. UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences,"" she said.

McCaw said there could be price volatility in the financial markets, and a collapse in confidence, in addition to a potential rush to safe assets such as gold.

She also told the outlet that the authorities should be prepared for unrest.

The report has quickly made an impact online.

Mario Nawfal, a podcast host, said in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times, ""WAIT…WHAT?! A former Bank of England policy analyst is warning the UK's central bank to prepare for a financial crisis…caused by aliens.""

Holly Wood, a researcher and public speaker sharing The Times piece, in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times: ""And at the centre of it is my friend, Helen McCaw. A former Bank of England senior analyst in financial security. A Cambridge graduate. Someone whose actual job was to think about state-level risk, stability, and what breaks systems. I'm incredibly proud of her. She inspires me regularly. The question is no longer ""is it real?"" It's ""what happens when it's confirmed?""

The YouTuber Hustle B****, in a post on X sharing The Times report, viewed over 100,000 times, which read in part: ""READ THIS TWICE - THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS PREPARING FOR ALIENS. This is not a meme. This is not a fringe blog. This is an actual newspaper article reporting that the Bank of England has been urged to prepare for financial collapse if aliens are officially confirmed.""

There is a continued interest in the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth. The documentary The Age of Disclosure made a significant impact online, with the trailer amassing millions of views and the documentary prompting a discourse about aliens.

The upcoming fictional film Disclosure Day, directed by Steven Spielberg, has also prompted significant interest, with the trailer fast amassing more than a million views on X. Disclosure Day is set for release in the U.S. on June 12, 2026.

Shaping the future of finance

Waking up today, I am shocked to see the headlines about aliens wrecking the world's financial markets. Apparently, various American politicians have kind of confirmed that aliens are real, admitting to an 80-year cover-up including Dulce Base in New Mexico and Area 51, Nevada.

The reason this came up today is that, if confirmed true, this could create a widespread panic in the financial world. Specifically, Helen McCaw, who served as a senior analyst in financial security at the UK's central bank, has just written to Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England's governor, urging him to set out contingencies if the White House confirms the existence of alien life, according to The Times.

Ms McCaw, who worked for the Bank of England for 10 years until 2012, said politicians and bankers can no longer dismiss talk of alien life, and warned that if the USA confirms alien life exists then it could lead to major bank and financial collapses.

She reportedly said: “The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).”

UAP is the formal term for a UFO.

“If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions.”

Her warning comes as senior American officials have indicated their belief in the possibility of alien life.

In a recent UFO documentary, The Age of Disclosure, 34 US government insiders, including those from the military and intelligence community officials, were spoken to about a “global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin”.

The director, Dan Farah, spoke with sources including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, New York Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, to discuss the government's work with UAPs.

Marco Rubio told the documentary maker: “We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities, and it's not ours.”

Ms McCaw said: “UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological* shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences ... There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods.”

The former Bank of England worker explained there might be a rush towards assets such as gold or other precious metals, and government bonds, which are perceived as “safe”. Alternatively, she said precious metals might lose their status as perceived safe assets if people speculate that new space-faring technologies will soon increase the supply of precious metals.

Given these scenarios, my question would be: do aliens use money?

 

* Ontology is the philosophical study of ‘being' which encompasses all of reality and every entity within it. Ms McCaw is implying that, if the US confirms aliens are out there, it will make us question everything about what it means to be a human being, the meaning of life and more.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=uap","Gerb Blasts Secret Battelle Circle That 'Sanitises' America's UFO Truth","https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/uap-whistleblower-gerb-says-battelle-job-carousel-shields-alien-secrets-americans-1771961","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 08:57:00 GMT","

In a startling challenge to official narratives, a high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb now claims that a powerful Battelle-linked job carousel is actively shielding alien secrets from the American public, placing the Pentagon's own anomaly office at the centre of a hidden network that controls what citizens are allowed to know about unidentified aerial phenomena.

In 2024 a peculiar metallic object recovered from private land in Ohio was handed to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for analysis after witnesses said its properties did not match any known earthly alloy. The case quickly landed on the desk of AARO, the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which is meant to investigate precisely this kind of material.

Gerb argues the sample was never treated as neutral evidence but instead channelled into a closed scientific system designed to downplay anything uncomfortable. Within months AARO issued a brief statement suggesting the object was likely ordinary, a conclusion Gerb describes as rushed, politically convenient and scientifically shallow.

He insists Oak Ridge was selected not for its independence but for its deep ties to defence contractors and the Battelle corporation, which operates the lab through its subsidiary UT-Battelle. To Gerb, this creates a perfect loop in which the same corporate ecosystem both examines potential non-human technology and decides what the public hears about it.

Gerb's most explosive claim centres on what he calls a secret career carousel connecting Battelle, Oak Ridge and AARO. Senior officials, contractors and scientists regularly move between these institutions, creating what he describes as a cosy club that controls funding, research priorities and public messaging.

He points to former Undersecretary of Defence Ronald Moultrie, who quietly removed his past role on Battelle's board from his official biography. For Gerb, this deletion symbolises a deeper effort to obscure conflicts of interest.

Supporters say this is classic regulatory capture, comparable to Wall Street officials moving between Goldman Sachs and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Critics counter that such job mobility is normal in science and defence, noting that researchers frequently rotate between PNNL, LANL, Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore, all Battelle-run facilities.

Gerb accepts the pattern exists across government but argues that in the UAP realm it becomes dangerous because evidence of possible non-human technology is at stake.

A parallel debate now rages over whether whistleblowers like Gerb are genuine truth-tellers or unwitting tools of the intelligence community. Some observers suggest the IC could be feeding partial or distorted information through prominent researchers to mislead foreign adversaries such as Russia and China.

Sceptics note that if Washington wanted controlled disclosure, it would not be publicly discrediting figures like Lue Elizondo or redacting their roles from official records. Instead, the Department of Defence has repeatedly challenged whistleblower claims, with spokesperson Susan Gough revising her statements about Elizondo's employment multiple times.

Journalist Steven Greenstreet has argued that many whistleblowers are part of a slow-drip disclosure strategy, a view echoed by debunker Mick West, who admits being paid to analyse UAP claims but refuses to reveal by whom.

Gerb's supporters reject this, saying the pushback from officials proves he is not being guided by them but is instead exposing them.

The controversy now stretches far beyond one metal fragment. It touches on the credibility of AARO, the role of defence contractors, and whether America's intelligence apparatus is suppressing a trillion-dollar secret programme behind Special Access Protocol barriers.

Former AATIP figures such as Sara Gamm, Jay Stratton and Travis Taylor have backed elements of whistleblower accounts, complicating the narrative that this is mere conspiracy. Meanwhile, critics argue that extraordinary claims still require extraordinary evidence.

For now, Gerb's central allegation remains simple and stark. He says the Battelle-linked job carousel is not accidental, it is structural, and it keeps real UAP knowledge locked inside a closed elite circle.

Paramount and key producers revealed new details about the upcoming Paranormal Activity film as the franchise prepares for its next chapter. The team confirmed the release date for the eighth installment but kept story specifics under wraps.

Paramount set May 21, 2027, as the release date for the eighth Paranormal Activity film. Ian Tuason will direct the new installment. His previous feature, Undertone, premiered at the 2025 Fantasia International Film Festival. It won the audience award.

Paramount and Blumhouse-Atomic Monster are co-financing and co-producing the project. James Wan and Jason Blum, both from Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, are producing the film. Oren Peli, the creator of the original Paranormal Activity, also joins as a producer through Solana Films. Michael Clear and Judson Scott of Blumhouse-Atomic Monster, along with Steven Schneider of Room 101 Inc., serve as executive producers.

James Wan said, “I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying. I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise” (via The Hollywood Reporter). Jason Blum added, “Diving in with James for this exciting rebirth of the franchise that started it all for Blumhouse is exactly what we dreamed of when we merged with Atomic Monster” (via The Wrap).

Paramount released the original Paranormal Activity in 2007. The film, made on a $15,000 budget, earned around $193-194 million globally. It set a benchmark for profitability in film history and redefined the found-footage horror genre. The franchise has since generated over $900 million worldwide across seven films.

The studios have not disclosed any plot details for Paranormal Activity 8. Paramount will be taking care of the film's theatrical distribution. Warner Bros. currently has the only other wide studio release scheduled for May 21, 2027, with the animated film Bad Fairies, featuring the voice of Cynthia Erivo.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX)  — In 1977, Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope detected a mysterious signal from space, sparking decades of intrigue and research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life.



Volunteer astronomer Jerry Ehman discovered the signal, dubbed the Wow! Signal, which originated from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and lasted 72 seconds.

Despite numerous attempts, the signal was never detected again.

The Wow! Signal fueled interest in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), inspiring advancements in telescope technology and research methodologies. 

Although the Big Ear is no longer operational, the enigma of the Wow! Signal continues to captivate scientists and enthusiasts alike, as they ponder the age-old question: ""Is anyone out there?""

A financial crisis could be triggered by an announcement that aliens exist, according to Helen McCaw, a former policy expert of the Bank of England.

McCaw told The Times of London that politicians and bankers can't afford to dismiss alien life, and wrote to the governor of the Bank of England, urging him to organize a contingency plan in case the White House confirms alien existence.

A 2021 study from the Pew Research Center found that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that intelligent life exists beyond Earth. Some Americans, meanwhile, believe that there is proof of UFOs and alien life being concealed from the public by global governments. However, this belief is held by a significant minority.

President Donald Trump has previously indicated that his administration may declassify some information on the nature of extraterrestrial life. In 2025, the UFO documentary The Age of Disclosure made headlines, and its director Dan Farah said that Trump could reveal the existence of aliens.

McCaw was a senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England for ten years, until 2012.

She told The Times, ""The United States government appears to be partway through a multiyear process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).""

""If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions. It is entirely possible that government leadership and their central banks have not been properly briefed on the topic. UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences,"" she said.

McCaw said there could be price volatility in the financial markets, and a collapse in confidence, in addition to a potential rush to safe assets such as gold.

She also told the outlet that the authorities should be prepared for unrest.

The report has quickly made an impact online.

Mario Nawfal, a podcast host, said in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times, ""WAIT…WHAT?! A former Bank of England policy analyst is warning the UK's central bank to prepare for a financial crisis…caused by aliens.""

Holly Wood, a researcher and public speaker sharing The Times piece, in a post on X viewed over 100,000 times: ""And at the centre of it is my friend, Helen McCaw. A former Bank of England senior analyst in financial security. A Cambridge graduate. Someone whose actual job was to think about state-level risk, stability, and what breaks systems. I'm incredibly proud of her. She inspires me regularly. The question is no longer ""is it real?"" It's ""what happens when it's confirmed?""

The YouTuber Hustle B****, in a post on X sharing The Times report, viewed over 100,000 times, which read in part: ""READ THIS TWICE - THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS PREPARING FOR ALIENS. This is not a meme. This is not a fringe blog. This is an actual newspaper article reporting that the Bank of England has been urged to prepare for financial collapse if aliens are officially confirmed.""

There is a continued interest in the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth. The documentary The Age of Disclosure made a significant impact online, with the trailer amassing millions of views and the documentary prompting a discourse about aliens.

The upcoming fictional film Disclosure Day, directed by Steven Spielberg, has also prompted significant interest, with the trailer fast amassing more than a million views on X. Disclosure Day is set for release in the U.S. on June 12, 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural's Uncertain Future Leaves VR Fitness Users Looking For Options","https://www.uploadvr.com/vr-fitness-supernatural-alternatives/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:01:43 GMT","

Supernatural continues to rank at or near number one on the Meta Quest charts in  the wake of Meta's decision to pause content updates and lay off much of the team behind one of VR's most effective fitness apps.

Many in the VR fitness community have been looking into their options. 

Supernatural has always been positioned as a premium experience. Access as of this writing is subscription-only, with users paying either $9.99 per month or $99 per year. That recurring revenue, combined with strong engagement and brand recognition, made Supernatural feel like a rare success story in consumer VR fitness.

Meta says the existing library, which spans thousands of workouts, will stay accessible. Current subscribers can continue paying for full access and new users are still able to sign up. In the short term, that keeps Supernatural viable, especially for users already invested in its structure and coaching. What happens to the mainstream music used in the project if licenses expire? 

What makes Supernatural's situation so disruptive is not just the pause in new content, but the loss of certainty. VR fitness depends on habit, trust, and long-term commitment. When a chart-topping, subscription-only app can be upended overnight, the entire health journey some people are may see potential disruption down the line.

In that context, ownership models, studio independence, and transparency do actually matter to many more than production value alone. At a moment when VR fitness is proving its ability to retain paying users and drive real behavior change, Meta appears to be stepping back from one of its strongest examples.

For users navigating this moment, the good news is that the ecosystem is deeper than it once was. The harder question is which platforms feel stable enough to earn long-term trust.

I've tried a number of VR fitness options besides Supernatural to check out what the latest options offer.

I have spent a meaningful amount of time inside FunFitLand, starting back in its early alpha period. Early on, it leaned heavily on Supernatural's blueprint, with real coaches in 3D as well as beautiful real-world and imaginary scenes for workouts. Over time, it moved past that influence and developed its own identity.

That evolution is most visible in the community and coaching. The tone is supportive and motivational without feeling performative. Coaches have sharpened their virtual instruction skills, with clearer cues, tighter pacing, and better movement guidance. On the workout side, the platform has expanded its movement set with additions like side steps and hammer strikes, giving sessions more physical range.

DanceFit has since evolved into GrooveFit, favoring looser, more expressive routines. The addition of FlowFit has been especially meaningful. It introduces a meditative, tai chi-inspired experience focused on balance, breath, and intentional movement. It reinforces the idea that VR fitness does not need to be all intensity to be effective.

FunFitLand also improved its music selection. The library now spans a wider range of genres, including cinematic tracks and some heavy metal. That added variety helps reduce repetition and gives different workout modes a clearer identity.

FunFitLand mirrors Supernatural's pricing structure, offering both monthly and annual subscriptions. At the time of writing, a first-year annual discount of $69.99 appears to still be available for new subscribers, undercutting Supernatural's standard annual fee. The app, which also supports hand tracking, has also launched on Apple Vision Pro, signaling ambition at a time when others are pulling back.

FitXR began life as BoxVR in 2017 and has since grown into one of the most feature-rich VR fitness platforms available. It operates on a subscription model priced at $12.99 per month or $108.99 per year.

The platform, which also supports hand tracking, currently offers seven workout types: Box, Combat, HIIT, Sculpt, Dance, Zumba, and the newer mixed-reality SLAM mode. Workouts span multiple intensity levels and are supported by a progression and rewards system designed to encourage consistency. Regular content updates and monthly themed challenges keep the experience from feeling static.

FitXR uses recognizable fitness personalities as coaches, though in some modes, particularly Sculpt, Dance and Zumba, those coaches appear as stylized cartoon avatars. Choreography across disciplines is strong, and the workouts are fully capable of delivering a serious sweat.

Where FitXR falls slightly behind Supernatural and FunFitLand is in environmental range and polish. There are fewer workout environments, and those that do exist are not as breathtakingly beautiful - think functional rather than awe-inspiring. Hit feedback in the boxing and combat modes also lacks the satisfying auditory impact found in FunFitLand, which remains best in class in this area. Even so, FitXR's breadth, progression systems, and consistent update cadence make it a strong long-term subscription for users who value variety and structure.

FitXR is also expanding beyond Meta's ecosystem. The app is now available on Samsung's Galaxy XR headset, running Android XR, marking an early move to support next-generation mixed reality hardware outside the Quest platform.

Les Mills XR Bodycombat takes a fundamentally different approach. It is sold as a one-time purchase priced at $29.99, with optional DLC packs typically around $9.99. For users wary of subscriptions, that alone makes it appealing.

The workouts are demanding and efficient. Sessions are designed to escalate intensity quickly, and it does not take long to work up a sweat. Real-life Les Mills coaches Dan Cohen and Rachael Newsham appear briefly at the start of sessions as holograms, then transition to voice-only guidance for the remainder of the workout.

The workouts share a familiar structure, and for people who train often, that repetition becomes noticeable over time. Even so, the effectiveness is hard to argue with. The sessions move quickly, the combinations stay demanding, and by the end you feel the work you put in. This is not a gentle program, and that intensity is what many users seek.

PowerBeats VR has been a fixture in VR fitness since launching on SteamVR in 2019 and arriving on Meta Quest in 2021. On Quest, it retails for $22.99, with DLC packs typically priced between $2.99 and $5.99.

Its defining feature is customizability. PowerBeats VR allows users to upload their own music and fully customize workouts, sidestepping licensing concerns entirely. That level of control is uncommon and will appeal to users with established playlists or specific training goals.

The experience itself is less refined than many competitors. Visuals are straightforward, presentation is functional, and there is less emphasis on coaching personality or community. Even so, it remains enjoyable and effective at getting users moving when workouts are tuned to personal preferences.

The one-time purchase model combined with deep customization makes PowerBeats VR compelling for a specific audience. It does not sit in my personal top tier, but it fills a niche for many users.

XR Workout takes a different approach from most VR fitness platforms by prioritizing open movement and functional, full-body training over scripted classes and cinematic presentation. The app is free to download and use, with the free tier limited to eight minutes per day, with a starter membership promising multiplayer. A paid Pro membership unlocks the full feature set, including extended workout time, expanded modes and deeper customization tools.

One of its defining characteristics is controller-free movement through hand tracking, allowing users to exercise without holding controllers for extended sessions. Workouts rely heavily on bodyweight movements such as squats, jumps, running in place, and target-based striking that engages both upper and lower body at the same time. The result feels closer to an open training circuit than a guided class.

XR Workout also supports mixed reality, blending the user's physical space into the workout environment so surroundings remain visible during sessions. Multiplayer workouts, playlist selection, and the ability to build or customize routines give the app a level of flexibility that most top platforms do not attempt.

XR Workout feels very different from most VR fitness apps. There is little hand-holding, and very little emphasis on presentation. You load in, start moving, and manage your own pace. If you are looking for coaching, structure, or personality, it will likely feel bare. If you are comfortable setting your own rhythm and just want a space to move hard for a few minutes, it does exactly that.

Starwave

Starwave sits closer to the dance rhythm game end of the VR fitness spectrum, but it overlaps in interesting ways with Supernatural's Flow workouts. Movement is driven by techno and electronic tracks, with players slashing incoming notes using glowing, cosmic batons. The emphasis is on rhythm, timing, and continuous motion rather than precision or scoring.

There are no coaches, no guided programs, and no overt fitness framing. You load in, follow the beat, and keep moving. In practice, the experience can feel meditative in the same way Flow sessions do, especially during longer play sessions where movement becomes more fluid and less deliberate.

I have found Starwave to be an enjoyable and consistent addition to my weekly fitness rotation. It is not a replacement for structured workouts, but it works well as a lighter, movement-focused session that still gets the heart rate up.

Starwave is a one-time purchase, priced at $19.99 on the Meta Quest store (on sale as of this writing). Additional content is offered through an optional DLC pack at $4.99. There is no subscription model.

The platforms I picked here represent what I would consider the top tier VR fitness experiences available in VR headsets right now. They combine polish, consistency, ongoing development, and enough depth to support long-term use. There are plenty of other VR fitness apps on the Quest platform, but many are less refined or narrower in scope, but they are still fun and fully capable of working up a sweat. For users experimenting with VR fitness for the first time, those options can still be worthwhile.

I certainly haven't covered everything, so please share your favorite ways to get fit in VR in the comments below too. If you're the developer behind an app building something new in this space, you can also email UploadVR via tips@uploadVR.com.

Created in partnership with Nebula 

Nebula, available as both a website and app, is a spiritual guidance space that offers clarity and insight into one's values, potential, purpose, and place in the universe. With over 60 million users worldwide, Nebula supports anyone who wants to understand themselves better and build a stronger relationship with others.

When you invite Nebula into your world, it immediately becomes your personal guide to navigating life's journey. Not just on a daily basis, but in the months and years to come, too. It removes any doubt about the question “is Nebula legit?” because after using it for some time, you know: it is.

What struck me first was how easy the Nebula app is to use. Once you set up your account, you're offered over 1,000 psychics and advisors who are available 24/7. Each one specializes in specific topics, ranging from Western and Vedic astrology, Tarot, numerology, aura scanning, palmistry, birth charts, and more.

Each advisor has their experience listed, whether or not they're currently online and available, as well as the option to chat via text or give them a call. No matter which means of communication you're most comfortable with, both can be done through the Nebula website and the app, making it incredibly easy to access.

  

Another aspect I really appreciated was that I was greeted with a welcome text from one psychic, as well as follow-ups from a few others, offering their spiritual guidance. So, if you're not sure what you're looking for, these brief interactions, which are sort of like prompts, can help you narrow down the best psychic for you, and what your concerns and interests happen to be.

The short answer: absolutely. Of all the Nebula psychics — and again, there are many — I had the pleasure of chatting with Zendaya. Just as is the case with all the profiles of Nebula's advisors, I was able to see her expertise, how many years she's been practicing, her overall score based on the Nebula psychic reviews, and how many consultations she has done as a Nebula psychic and advisor.

I was also able to see her star ratings, which range from one to five, along with positive comments about her energy and skills among ask Nebula reviews. Between all the five-star ratings Zendaya has received and the feedback from clients, both new and regulars, I was impressed with what I saw and knew she was a fit for me.

Although my session with Zendaya, which included a Tarot reading, was done via text, I felt a genuine warmth from her and she was able to establish trust with me almost immediately, creating a connection between us that put me at ease. I knew I could be completely open and candid with her, and I could also tell just how much she loved being part of Nebula's team of advisors and psychics.

  

We discussed everything from my personal relationships to my career to my emotional state as of late. Zendaya was 100 percent there for me, explaining each card she pulled in detail and how it impacted my presence and future. Zendaya not only saw and heard me, but with the information she gave me, she provided me with the tools that will set me up for success in the coming months, a time that looks to be a bit turbulent and rife with changes for me, some more challenging than others.

It was somewhere between Zendaya pulling the Temperance card and the Two of Pentacles card that I no longer saw Nebula as just an app — instead, it became a trusted companion for emotional, mental, and spiritual growth all in the palm of my hand.

The parts of my life that had felt foggy and filled with confusion, became clear thanks to her.

After we parted ways, I thanked Zendaya for the insight and kindness. Fearful that after the session ended I'd lose her wisdom, I'd been taking screenshots of what she had say, only to find out afterward that I was able to revisit my session with her, rereading her advice and what she sees in my future, fully knowing that all that information is protected and private.

While a complete overhaul of personal transformation may be months away for me, or longer, with Nebula as my guide and trusted companion, I'll never be alone in my quest for understanding myself and those around me again.

Nebula takes the age-old practice of spirituality, in all its realms, and modernizes it. It's available on iOS, Android, and the web, making Nebula a leading brand in the spiritual niche in the U.S. and globally.

With the Nebula app, you have access to:

  

And if you prefer the Nebula website, you can expect:

Depending on what your budget for such an important tool might be, Nebula has a subscription that will work for you.

All plans renew automatically and provide uninterrupted access to the app's features. You can also pay per minute, for chatting with psychics, which is a flexible option if a subscription isn't right for you. Should you need any sort of help, whether it be billing, unlocking new features, or updating notifications, Nebula customer service is a click away.

While nothing in life is a guarantee and curveballs being thrown our way is inevitable, knowing I can turn to Nebula when things start to become too much is a huge relief.

Children as young as four are being trained how to shoot rifles at a school in Sussex run by conspiracy theorists. 

Hope Sussex, which has barred Ofsted from inspecting, offers reception aged-children lessons in shooting and martial arts alongside maths, English and science. 

Images published by Hope's founder Matthew Single - who opened the establishment with his wife Sadie - show youngsters clutching air rifles and aiming at targets near Netherfield village in East Sussex.

Another photo shows Mr Single, 54, wearing a T-shirt embellished with the words, 'I identify as a conspiracy theorist - my pronouns are told/you/so'. 

More than 40 families attend Hope each week, according to recent company filings. 

Pupils have been tasked with making necklaces out of bullet casings and creating their own nunchuks. 

Hope Sussex was reportedly founded by a group of anti-vaccine activists and former members of the far Right in 2021. 

It denies that it is a school, instead referring to itself as an 'autonomous community' that helps home-educating parents.

Ofsted believes it is running as a school, but was forced to close its investigation into the establishment due to current legislation. 

The inspectorate currently does not have the legal right to force its way onto the grounds of what it suspects is an illegal school. 

It last visited Hope Sussex in 2022, when inspectors were stopped from entering by Mr Single and a second member of staff, The Times first reported. 

A new bill, titled the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, is going through parliament and proposes to hand the inspectorate more authority. 

Mr Single and his wife are former members of the British National Party. 

They urge parents to remove their children from state education and send them to their site for education. However, they reportedly tell the council that the youngsters are being homeschooled. 

Mrs Single, a former state primary teacher, previously said that her history lessons include 'some of the fallacies and lies that have taken place', including conspiracy theories that have been widely disproven by historians. 

Meanwhile Mr Single is an admirer of president Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. 

He said he believes the 'awake community' is 'at war' with the state - reportedly encouraging people to 'take the fight to them'.

Another young child holds a large rifle during a lesson with the establishment, which denies it is a school 

A child shoots at targets with an archery bow during one of the institution's lessons 

In one post, titled 'They are coming for our children', he wrote: 'We must be prepared to step outside of the comfort zone of simply protesting and demonstrating with placards and megaphones - we have our army in the field, now we must press forward with greater, more specific action.' 

He told The Times that the comments were made with the intention of 'applying political pressure on the Government'. 

He also claimed that the archery and air-weapon shooting lessons prioritised 'safety at all times'. 

Ofsted declined to comment when approached by the Daily Mail and Hope Sussex has been contacted for comment.

...

Conspiracy theories are practically a side dish to the NFL main course. Every postseason brings a new claim that the league is “scripted,” the refs are nudging outcomes, or some graphic designer in New York secretly knows the Super Bowl matchup months in advance. Most of the time, it's harmless internet fun. But every so often, something pops up that makes even the skeptics pause.

That “something” this season arrived in the form of an NFL social-media poster published on January 16 to promote the road to Super Bowl LX. The graphic showed a cluster of star quarterbacks surrounding the Lombardi Trophy. Nothing unusual there, until fans noticed who was standing closest to the hardware: Drake Maye, Bo Nix, Matthew Stafford, and Sam Darnold.

Fast-forward two days and, unbelievably, these are the exact four quarterbacks left standing in the conference championship games. Fans, of course, couldn't help but once again jump on the “NFL is scripted” train.

“Quite literally means the NFL is scripted,” one fan immediately commented.

“It means that these games are scripted,” another fan helpfully pointed out.

“The fix…is in!,” was another comment.

However, some fans couldn't help but notice one anomaly: Bo Nix. Only hours after Denver's emotional overtime win over Buffalo, coach Sean Payton stepped to the podium with what he called “not good news.” Rookie sensation Bo Nix had fractured his right ankle late in overtime and would require surgery in Birmingham, Alabama. Jarrett Stidham will be taking over as the starting quarterback for the rest of the Broncos' postseason run.

It seems the NFL “script-writers” didn't see this particular plot twist coming.

The injury occurred on a designed run with just over six minutes left. Nix was tackled awkwardly, limped back to the huddle, threw an incompletion, and then twisted the ankle again while taking a kneel-down. He finished the game 26-of-46 for 279 yards and three touchdowns, leading his sixth game-winning drive of the season, but his postseason was over.

Oddsmakers reacted instantly. New England opened as 4.5-point road favorites, a number that jumped to 5.5 as the reality of life without Nix set in. Denver's defense has carried them all year, but asking Stidham to outduel Maye is a tall order.

While the AFC drama centers on Nix's absence, the NFC matchup will deliver its own intrigue. Sam Darnold's Seahawks have won eight straight behind a dominant defense and a surging run game, while Matthew Stafford's Rams continue to survive on late-game magic.

The two West rivals split the regular-season series, including Seattle's unforgettable 38-37 overtime win in Week 16. Now the same four names from that January graphic, minus the injured Nix, sit one victory away from Santa Clara and Super Bowl LX. The seasoned conspiracy theorists can perhaps now look for more hidden clues that will tell us the conclusion ahead of time.

In my early 30s, I was working long hours as the editor in chief of a magazine, juggling deadlines and the looming ""should we have kids?"" question — all while feeling completely wrung out. I drafted a resignation email.

When my boss called me in, she surprised me: ""Take some time off,"" she said. ""Come back to manage a new launch later this year.""

My plan for a year off collapsed into two months.

It began quietly in India at a yoga retreat near Kerala and ended with an adventure in Indonesia, climbing Mount Bromo and motorbiking through Yogyakarta.

It wasn't a true gap year, but it was long enough to reset. The next year, I stepped into my boss's role, leading the creative team I'd almost left behind.

That experience made me realize that time off doesn't have to derail a career — it can redefine it.

I wasn't a student with few obligations or a 20-something who hadn't settled on a career path. I was an established professional stepping away when the stakes were high.

Extended time off can carry long-term costs — lower earnings, disrupted savings, slower compounding — but for some, the benefits outweigh the risks.

David Burkus, an organizational psychologist and author, began researching sabbaticals in 2015.

""People report better mental and physical health, increased confidence, and a greater sense of purpose after an extended break,"" Burkus told Business Insider.

He also notes the benefits for employers: Teams cross-train, share knowledge, and become less dependent on a few ""indispensable"" people.

Paid sabbaticals are still a rarity in the US. Society for Human Resource Management data showed that 5% of companies offered them in 2019, rising to 7% by 2023.

And despite employers not rolling them out broadly, employees are increasingly seeking time off. In SHRM's 2025 benefits survey, leave was the second-highest priority for workers — trailing only health benefits — for the fourth year in a row.

A peer-reviewed study published in the Academy of Management in 2022 interviewed 50 professionals who had taken extended time off. All interviewees said they came back as better leaders.

DJ DiDonna, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and coauthor of the study, says everyone he interviewed wished they had taken one earlier.

DiDonna told Business Insider that the best times for a sabbatical often coincide with natural life transitions, like a honeymoon, a newly empty nest, or the ""twilight career"" stage before retirement.

This collection brings together people who took that pause at different ages, for different reasons, and for vastly different lengths of time.

If you've taken an adult gap year yourself, I'd love to hear from you at akarplus@businessinsider.com.

In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really ""driverless"" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel?

One startup is fully embracing it.

Vay is a Berlin-based startup founded by two engineers and a former Zoox employee.

The company is taking a somewhat contrarian approach to what it calls a ""driverless car.""

Instead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.

To do so, Vay wants to leverage remote-driving technology and, eventually, autonomy to deliver cars without humans inside to people who need a private vehicle for less than a day.

Thomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program.

""It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport,"" von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. ""It's half the price of Uber and half the price of robotaxis. How it works: We just bring the car, you then drive, and then when you're done, you don't have to park.""

Von der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. The Vay cofounder said he oversaw some of the first public testing of Zoox cars when there were safety drivers inside the vehicle.

At the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline.

""It always felt like it was three years out,"" he said of autonomous driving. ""And then every year it shifted by a year. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. And then it was 2021 and so forth.""

Von der Ohe left Zoox in 2018. Instead of fixating on robotaxis, von der Ohe wanted to stay in mobility but work on something that could be faster to bring to market and easier to scale with less capital. Vay was born.

Customers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. To rent a car, users have to upload a driver's license and a photo of themselves.

Vay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. If you're out of the service area, then you're out of luck.

Once the car is delivered, the renter takes over.

The startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said.

The Vay cofounder told Business Insider that the service area is about twice the size of San Francisco.

Inside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat.

A large red button to the left of the driver's seat activates an emergency protocol during which the car pulls over to the side of the road.

Vincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride.

""It's similar to kind of like a high-grade racing sim,"" Reddy said of the driving experience. ""The thing that feels the most different is not having the feedback of what it feels like driving over bumps and things on the road because the seat doesn't move. There's no G-force, or you don't get the feeling of accelerating or braking.""

To deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. The car can go on the highway once the customer takes over the vehicle.

There were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office.

Vay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber.

Von der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride.

Users are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym.

When Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25.

When asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure.

The CEO said he can keep the costs low because Vay's vehicle fleet doesn't have a complex sensor suite, and the remote operators manage multiple cars.

Von der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle.

""So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price,"" he said.

Vay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia.

While von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features.

""We're not in competition with them,"" von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators.

Since its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO.

He said the service has especially seen high demand during the Consumer Electronics Show.

When Von der Ohe opened the app, the wait time to get a car was 31 minutes.

""It's extremely busy today already,"" he said. ""It's a long way. It should be five.""

Demand for survival supplies and long-lasting food products has soared in Greenland's capital city of Nuuk, CNN reported on Monday, citing local retailers. The surge comes amid growing concerns over possible US interference on the Arctic island.

In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has intensified his push to bring Greenland under Washington's control, which he has pursued since his first term. He argues the move is vital for US national security to counter Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic – a claim rejected by both Beijing and Moscow.

Tensions escalated further last week after Trump vowed to impose an additional 10% tariff in February on US trading partners in Europe that refuse to back his push to acquire the Arctic island. He also said the tariffs would rise to 25% in June and remain in place until a “complete and total purchase.”

On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US sees Greenland as vital to its defense in an emerging “battle for the Arctic,” adding that European partners will ultimately “come around” to the idea of handing the island to Washington.

Shopkeepers in Nuuk told CNN that residents are increasingly buying camping stoves, long-shelf-life food, and freeze-dried meals.

Meanwhile, locals interviewed by Reuters on Sunday said they strongly oppose any US takeover of Greenland, describing Trump's remarks as irrational and threatening. Greenlanders stressed they are not intimidated, expressing confidence the plan would fail and pointing to political and military support from European allies as they seek to defend the island's sovereignty.

Last week, several European states, including Germany, France, Sweden, Norway and the UK, sent between one and 15 personnel to Greenland for a Danish-led military exercise. German personnel have already withdrawn from the island.

In response to Trump's tariff threats, the EU has vowed to defend its economic interests with countermeasures, including a possible revival of a suspended €93 billion ($108 billion) retaliatory tariff package. Brussels is also considering the use of the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), designed to punish economic coercion with measures such as restricting market access, investment, and intellectual property rights.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said he is “concerned” about the escalation. It was a calm word for this particular bout of Donald Trump's insanity.

The President of the United States insists he will take Greenland from Denmark – and the European Union – and now says that he will use heavy tariffs to try to coerce allies into handing over the territory. If you take him at his word, it's worth noting that he has said he'd be prepared to invade an ally, too.

It's a surefire way to break the U.S. from Europe, to start a trans-Atlantic trade war, to rip the North Atlantic Treaty Organization apart, and to make the world much more chaotic and dangerous. Not least for Canada.

If Mr. Trump breaks the trans-Atlantic alliance, Canada will be awkwardly placed in the middle between its long-standing allies and the newly avaricious U.S. superpower on whom it depends for domestic security. 

Greenland has become the epicentre of the growing rift between Europe and the U.S.

And it's already awkward. Mr. Carney obviously has to oppose the Greenland madness of King Trump. But will it invite a new round of tariff threats for Canada?

Until recently, the U.S. led a group of countries that protected democracies from aggressors bent on expanding their territory.

Now, the President of the United States has switched sides.

The alarming thing is that, on the whole, the American public doesn't seem to have noticed how far that has gone.

Mr. Trump's Greenland threats are no longer just a momentary whim. Now, the world has to hope that Americans themselves will step up to slam the brakes on it.

David Shribman: Trump's preoccupation with Greenland reflects how his presidency is reshaping the world order

Yes, there are members of Congress who have opposed Mr. Trump's threats to invade Greenland, but the numbers of Republicans who have spoken up are underwhelming. Congressional opposition to Mr. Trump's proposal to levy tariffs on eight European countries that oppose it has so far been weak.

The suggestion by House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson that there will be no invasion but “diplomatic channels are the way to go” – he cited Mr. Trump's appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as a special envoy charged with making Greenland a U.S. territory – show us just how far congressional Republicans have gone in accepting Mr. Trump's Greenland fetish.

Mr. Trump's assertion that the U.S. needs to own Greenland to prevent it from being taken by Russia or China is also flatly ridiculous. 

It's part of NATO. The U.S. already has a base there. Denmark would have welcomed an increase in U.S. security in Greenland, at least until Mr. Trump started to express lust for its conquest. Somehow, in the world we're in, Mr. Carney's assertion that NATO can and should collectively defend Greenland sounds like he is challenging Mr. Trump.

Instead, Mr. Trump's Greenland coercion is a boon for the global ambitions of Russia and China, and a great danger to the now-fractured “West.” The biggest obstacle Russia and China faced was not just U.S. power, but the fact that it was amplified by like-minded countries that backed it through policy, diplomacy, economic measures and alliances such as NATO. 

Carney says Trump's ‘escalation' of Greenland pursuit is concerning

Now, Mr. Trump is rending that fabric. He is instead asserting that the U.S. should control the hemisphere and proposing a world divided into the spheres of influence of great powers. 

That means a world divided up by the U.S., China and Russia. It's just what President Vladimir Putin has wanted. The Russian leader must find it hard to believe that a U.S. president would come to decisively aid his ambitions by trying to dismantle NATO and weaken Europe.

The demand that Greenland be ceded to the U.S. for security reasons amounts to a statement that the U.S. is unwilling to defend territory that is not owned by the U.S. – in itself a weakening of U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.

For Canadians, that's an impending split between its allies. Just as alarming is the shrug of the American polity. Mr. Trump has shifted the U.S. from leader to predator, and the Congress has acquiesced.

The Congress failed to assert its constitutional power over trade policy when Mr. Trump declared all manner of things as threats to national security so he could impose tariffs. To impose them over Greenland, he'd have to make the farcical claim that the failure of European countries to support his Greenland demands is a national-security emergency. 

This time, however, it's bigger than a trade disruption. This farce threatens to smash security alliances and make the world more dangerous.

During a surprise performance at a concert in New Jersey, Bruce Springsteen criticized the Trump administration and the deployment of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis.

Springsteen dedicated his performance of the 1978 song “The Promised Land” to Renee Good, the 37-year-old who was fatally shot by an ICE agent.

President Trump has told the Norwegian prime minister that he is 'no longer obliged to think purely of peace' after he was snubbed of the Nobel Peace Prize. In the message, Trump also reiterated his calls for Greenland to be handed over to the United States.

More than 100 vehicles including multiple semis were involved in a pileup on western Michigan's Interstate-196 amid whiteout conditions. Authorities said it would take hours to clear the road, which was closed in both directions for miles. Intense lake effect snow bands are lashing the area and creating dangerous travel conditions.

The Department of Justice said they are investigating a group of anti-ICE protesters after they interrupted a church service in Minnesota, alleging that one of the church's pastors oversees local ICE operations.

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump will undoubtedly go down in world history if he resolves the issue of annexing Greenland, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Commenting on Trump's statements about Greenland, the spokesman said: ""Perhaps here we can detach ourselves from the question of whether this is good or bad or whether it complies with international law or not. But there are international experts who believe that by resolving the issue of Greenland's accession, Trump will go down in history. Not only in US history, but in world history as well. And, I repeat, without discussing whether this is good or bad, it is difficult to disagree with these experts.""

Trump has repeatedly emphasized the importance of Greenland joining the US. During his first term, he proposed buying the island, and in March 2025, he said it could be annexed. On January 17, Trump announced on Truth Social that the US would impose a 10% tariff on goods from the U.K., Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, France, and Sweden. The tariff will remain in effect until the parties reach an agreement on Washington's ""complete and total acquisition"" of Greenland. The tariff will take effect on February 1, and increase to 25% on June 1.

In addition, the US leader criticized Europe's intention to send its forces to Greenland, calling it a ""very dangerous game."" Trump argued that owning the island is necessary to strengthen US national security and deploy the Golden Dome missile defense system effectively.

Greenland is Denmark's autonomous territory. In 1951, Washington and Copenhagen signed the Greenland Defense Agreement in addition to their NATO alliance commitments. Under the treaty, the US committed to defend the island from potential aggression.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US justice department announced it is investigating protesters in Minnesota who disrupted church services

Kristi Noem first denied that federal agents were using chemical agents against protesters, then after being shown video footage turned to blaming the protesters themselves, as tensions continued to run high amid the Trump administration's surge of federal officers into Minneapolis.

The head of homeland security, who has acted as spearhead for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in the city – known as “Operation Metro Surge” – told the CBS show Face the Nation on Sunday that her department had not used pepper spray against crowds.

A federal judge on Friday had ordered that federal law enforcement stop using pepper spraying against peaceful protesters, whom Noem has accused of attempting to hinder the immigration crackdown. Kate Menendez found federal agents had used “chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected first amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations”.

Noem first denied the judge's finding, but after being shown a video of chemical agents being used on four occasions, she backtracked and said her department “only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe”.

Tensions continue to run high in Minneapolis, with the Pentagon ordering around 1,500 active-duty soldiers stationed in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment, which Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has described as a “ridiculous” overreaction to largely peaceful protests against the violent behaviour of ICE agents.

On Sunday the Department of Justice also declared it is investigating a group of protesters who disrupted services at a church where a local ICE official is reportedly a pastor. Footage livestreamed by Black Lives Matter Minnesota showed people interrupting services at the Cities church in St Paul by chanting “ICE out” and “justice for Renee Good”, referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE agent.

The assistant attorney general, Harmeet Dhillon, announced on social media an investigation into purported civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers”, adding: “A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!”

Nekima Levy Armstrong of the Racial Justice Network was dismissive of the threat of an investigation. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts,” she told the Associated Press.

It is not clear whether David Easterwood, the pastor who also reportedly heads the local ICE field office, was present at the church. He has defended ICE tactics in Minnesota such as swapping out license plates and using pepper spray on protesters.

Those tactics have inflamed an atmosphere that the Minneapolis parks and recreation department cited as the reason for canceling youth sports on Friday and Sunday “out of an abundance of caution”. Meanwhile, the newly installed Laotian American mayor of St Paul, Kaohly Her, said she had “received advice to carry my passport with me because they may try to target me based on what I look like as well”.

Some protesters arrested during ICE operations in Minneapolis have been denied their right to see an attorney, according to ABC News, citing four attorneys who said there were denied access to clients at the federal building in Minneapolis, the site of now daily protests.

“ICE agents were physically restricting me from seeing them,” one immigration attorney who asked not to be identified told ABC. “I stood outside the attorney visitation room for about four hours on Thursday, trying to see one of my clients who had been there for multiple days. I kept saying, you got to let me see my client. And they just kept repeating, we don't do attorney visitation.”

A DHS spokesperson denied the claims, saying all detainees “have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers” and said “all detainees receive full due process”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

New Jersey musician said during concert in home state that US core values ‘have never been as endangered' as now

Bruce Springsteen used a Saturday concert to decry what he called the “Gestapo tactics” of the Trump administration's surge of immigration officers and said the country's founding values “have never been as endangered as they are right now”.

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it's worth speaking out, and it's worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump's actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump's authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society. They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.”

Donald Trump has responded to Springsteen's remarks by calling the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member “highly overrated”, “not a talented guy” and a “pushy, obnoxious jerk”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Czechia will not sell its L-159 light combat aircraft to Ukraine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Jan. 19, despite Czech President Petr Pavel advocating for the move.

""Mr. (Defense Minister Jaromir) Zuna clearly said that the aircraft still have a service life of about 15 years and that the army needs them,"" Babis said after a government meeting, Czech Television reported.

Pavel, who visited Ukraine last week, said on Jan. 18 that Kyiv's offer to buy the planes is an opportunity for the Czech defense industry and argued that selling four out of the Czech military's 24 L-159 jets would not endanger its defense capabilities.

The news underscores the foreign policy divide between Czechia's Ukraine-friendly head of state and the country's new ruling populist coalition.

""I'm afraid that with this decision, we are moving closer to selfishness rather than solidarity,"" Pavel, a retired NATO general, commented on the refusal to sell the aircraft to the country facing the Russian invasion.

Senior government officials, including Czech Foreign Minister Petr Macinka, have criticized the president for raising the prospect of a sale, arguing that the decision falls outside his authority.

Pavel, in turn, noted that Ukraine has been seeking to acquire the aircraft for at least half a year and said he was simply continuing earlier negotiations.

The L-159 is a subsonic attack aircraft and trainer jet manufactured by the Czech company Aero Vodochody.

Tomio Okamura, head of the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party and the coalition's most vocal opponent of aiding Ukraine, said the jets have low residual value but remain highly valuable to the country's armed forces.

Czechia's populist coalition that ousted the pro-Ukraine government of ex-Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the October 2025 elections has vowed to halt assistance to Kyiv from the Czech budget, instead supporting U.S. President Donald Trump's peace efforts.

Despite this, Macinka, who also visited Kyiv in early January, affirmed that the two countries remain partners and that Czechia would continue to coordinate the ammunition initiative for Ukraine.

Reporter

Martin Fornusek is a reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in international and regional politics, history, and disinformation. Based in Lviv, Martin often reports on international politics, with a focus on analyzing developments related to Ukraine and Russia.  His career in journalism began in 2021 after graduating from Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, earning a Master's degree in Conflict and Democracy Studies. Martin has been invited to speak on Times Radio, France 24, Czech Television, and Radio Free Europe. He speaks English, Czech, and Ukrainian. 



The development is driven by a stronger ruble and low oil prices, according to the news agency.

Moscow is currently studying the proposal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to state news agency TASS. 

Chief of the Royal Danish Army Major General Peter Boysen will also deploy to the island alongside soldiers.



""NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'"" Trump said, accusing Denmark of being unable to counter it.

Czechia will not sell its L-159 light combat aircraft to Ukraine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Jan. 19, despite Czech President Petr Pavel advocating for the move.

Russia struck energy infrastructure overnight in “several regions,” cutting power in five oblasts as freezing temperatures add strain to Ukraine's grid, Deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said.


According to Axios reporter Barak Ravid, the Russian official will meet Trump's envoys, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, on Jan. 20 to discuss the Washington-backed peace plan for Ukraine.

Among the Russian air defense systems that endured ""destruction"" are S-300, S-350, and S-400 air defense systems, as well as Russian anti-aircraft missile systems BUK-M1 and BUK-M2, and Pantsir-S1 and Pantsir-S2 air defense systems, according to the SBU. 

Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures.



Ukrainian and U.S. officials will continue peace proposal discussions during the World Economic Forum in Davos, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said Jan. 18.

After quickly hitting the initial target, organizers raised the goal to 2 million zloty ($550,000) — a figure that has since been surpassed, with donations now exceeding 2.4 million zloty (around $660,000).

The European Union is preparing possible retaliation against the United States, including up to 93 billion euros ($101 billion) in tariffs or restrictions on U.S. companies operating in the bloc, amid escalating tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland, the Financial Times reported Jan. 18.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A courtroom at the Edmonton Law Courts building on June 28, 2019.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

The Globe and Mail is expanding its Secret Canada project for the first time since it launched three years ago, now offering a comprehensive guide on how to access court records in different jurisdictions across the country.

This new tool lays out the basics of what kinds of records Canadians are entitled to access, and the process to obtain documents such as lawsuits, small claims files, bankruptcy records and daily dockets. 

The guide provides this information for each province, territory and federal jurisdiction – and can be found on SecretCanada.com in the resources section. 

Canada lags other countries in making judges' decisions available online

Up until now, Secret Canada has focused on Canada's broken freedom of information (FOI) regime. FOI – which is also called access to information and right to information – is the process by which Canadians can obtain records from most publicly funded entities, including each level of government, police services, hospitals, universities, Crown corporations and transit agencies. 

As part of the reporting, The Globe created SecretCanada.com, which features a database of hundreds of thousands of completed FOI requests as well as numerous guides for how to use, file and appeal FOIs.

Like FOI, there is no one Canadian court system. Each jurisdiction has its own rules and processes. Secret Canada's new guide on accessing court records builds off a previous one that lays out the different FOI regimes in each part of the country.

The site also includes a letter generator with templates. In 2025, more than 5,200 people used the Secret Canada FOI generator.

The US president wrote to complain about not getting a Nobel Peace Prize, a decision that doesn't rest with Norway's PM. He said he would devote more thought to US interests, after having ""stopped 8 Wars PLUS."" 

US President Donald Trump wrote a message to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, shared widely with other nations and the media by the US adminstration on Monday, saying that he no longer feels obliged ""to think purely of peace"" considering that he was not awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. 

Trump has frequently been reminded that Norway's government has no part in awarding the Nobel Prize, including by Store, but has expressed his doubts on this matter in response. 

The US president reiterated his recent demands for ""Complete and Total Control"" of Greenland, which is not a part of Norway although Oslo once contested control of it with Denmark. 

""Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I long longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. 

Trump's claim to have stopped eight wars is ambitious. Probably the most notable example is the stop in hostilities in Gaza, although that is stuck in the first phase of the peace plan and hundreds have died since the October ceasefire. 

Most of the other conflicts or disputes the White House cites were either short-running skirmishes, or were not solved, or did not involve fighting, or a combination of these three. Which ""wars"" beyond eight Trump believes he stopped is not clear.

Trump then proceeded to transition to a discussion of Greenland without introduction. 

""Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway?"" he asked. ""There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also."" 

The first Norse settlers arrived in Greenland in the 10th Century. Various legal documents starting in 1814 delineate Greenland as part of Denmark. A 1933 international court ruling rendered the entirety of the island property of Denmark, rather than Norway, and in 1953 Greenland was incorporated as a realm or ""Amt"" within Denmark rather than a Danish-held colony. 

The US did twice try to purchase Greenland from Denmark, once shortly after World War II's end and again in Trump's first term. Although Denmark, one of the 12 founder members of NATO, refused, the US was granted rights to extensive military access. However, it has been steadily withdrawing troops from the territory in recent decades amid an increased military focus on areas including Asia and the Middle East.

""I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,"" Trump asserted. ""The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!"" 

Trump's letter to the Norwegian prime minister was sent soon after Store and Finland's President Alexander Stubb issued a joint statement asking Trump to de-escalate his recent rhetoric regarding Greenland and requesting a call with him. 

Store said on Monday that he, like many other people in politics and the press, had told Trump more than once that his government was not involved in choosing Nobel Peace Prize laureates. 

""I have several times explained clearly to Trump the well-known fact that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, which awards the prize"", Store said. 

That Committee awarded the 2025 Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Trump instead had to settle for the newly-created ""FIFA Peace Prize"" awarded by world soccer's governing body at the draw for the upcoming World Cup in North America.

			Robert Garson tells The Telegraph the October 7 attacks hardened his views and increased his fears for the future

“I am a great believer,” says Robert Garson, prior to pulling the trigger on the semi-automatic rifle tucked firmly into his shoulder, “that if there had been six million guns in six million Jewish hands, there would have been six million fewer deaths.”

Mr Garson, 49, is wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan “AGGRESSIVELY JEWISH” and a camouflage baseball cap pulled tight over his head as he takes aim at a target 25 yards away at the Founders Shooting Club, the shooting range of choice for South Florida's Jews.

An hour earlier, Mr Garson had been sitting in his Miami office, wearing a three-piece blue suit and presidential seal cufflinks, looking every inch Donald Trump's lawyer. Which, in fact, he is.

Before leaving his office, the father of three tucked a pistol into a holster, clipped it to his trousers, jumped into his open-top Audi sports car and headed for the rifle range with four of his guns.

The club, dense with cigar smoke, has become a hangout for 700 Jews, who make up about two-thirds of the membership. It is here, after an hour of firing bullets into pieces of paper, that Mr Garson declares that Britain – where he was born and which he left in 2008 – is no longer safe for Jews.

So concerned is he that he has begun a dialogue with Mr Trump's anti-Semitism tsar about offering the UK's 300,000 Jews asylum in the US.

In the US, he has become the head of armed security at his Florida synagogue, having become a National Rifle Association-licensed instructor in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. In his spare time, he offers to “train any Jewish person that wants to learn”.

Born in the dampest corner of north-west England, he was a pupil at Manchester Grammar who fluffed his A-levels before becoming a jobbing criminal barrister working in London's least glamorous Crown Courts.

Now he has the ear of the most powerful president in recent American history. Manchester is a distant memory. Mr Garson has embraced the Florida sunshine, guns and President Trump in equal measure.

He was hired by the president in 2022 to sue Bob Woodward – the world's most famous investigative journalist, whose reporting forced Richard Nixon to resign – for $50m over the publication of an audiobook.

Donald Trump Jr had already employed him as counsel for his publishing house, while in May this year, the president appointed Mr Garson to the board of the Holocaust Memorial Council, replacing Doug Emhoff, Kamala Harris's husband, who Mr Trump had just sacked. (“I have tried to thank Doug personally, but he never got back to me,” says Mr Garson.)

Mr Garson proffers a video from his meeting with Mr Trump in the Oval Office in November for the swearing-in of Sergio Gor, a Maga fixture and another of his clients, as the US ambassador to India.

It's worth noting from the video that Mr Trump had orchestrated the line-up so that Mr Garson was closest to him on his left shoulder.

“The first time I met Donald Trump, I was as giddy as a schoolgirl,” says Mr Garson with a grin. “I was completely starstruck. What struck me when I first met him was how blue his eyes are – very, very blue.”

It was 2021, and Mr Garson and his wife Rachel had been invited to Mar-a-Lago through his connections to Mr Gor and to Donald Jr. Sylvester Stallone was there too, along with Rudy Giuliani, the Trump ally and ex-New York mayor, and the party – despite taking place in the Covid years – was “in full swing”.

Mr Garson was mesmerised. “He [Trump] is really imposing,” he says, which isn't surprising. At 5ft 5in tall, Mr Garson is almost a foot shorter than the president.

At the time, Mr Trump was at a low ebb, engulfed by legal actions and criminal lawsuits.

The Mar-a-Lago encounter was Mr Trump's way of sounding Mr Garson out before hiring him to sue Mr Woodward.

“At the point I took President Trump on as a client, he was probably the most unpopular man in the world. But to me, I saw a man whose rights had been trampled upon,” recalls Mr Garson, adding: “What they didn't realise in America at the time was that by martyring Trump, they gave rise to his resurrection.”

Mr Garson denies any suggestion that what he might be doing is somehow grubby amid allegations levelled time and again against Mr Trump that he brings legal actions, often spurious, to silence or bully critics.

In the summer, a federal judge dismissed Mr Trump's lawsuit against Mr Woodward, but Mr Garson has amended the complaints and the case rumbles on.

The dispute concerns taped interviews of Mr Trump conducted by Mr Woodward, which were then used in The Trump Tapes, a best-selling audiobook.

Mr Garson insists this is not a spurious claim. Nor does he think, incidentally, is Mr Trump's $10bn claim against the BBC over editing of his January 6 speech to his supporters in Washington, DC, which the broadcaster injudiciously edited and which was first disclosed by The Telegraph.

Mr Garson is not involved in that claim, but he urged the BBC to settle. “President Trump has a very strong case and the BBC should be very afraid,” he says, pointing out that Florida – where the case is being brought – has “a history of very large awards”.

Of his own case, he says: “I took on the Bob Woodward case because it revolves around a fascinating point of intellectual property law. In any other circumstance of using somebody else's voice, then that person would be vindicated.”

The case – hopeless or not – hasn't done Mr Garson any harm. His name appeared on the pleadings, and the secret was out.

Business has been booming ever since. His parents, who divide their time between London and Israel, met the news their boy was Mr Trump's lawyer with a certain amount of bemusement. Friends back in the UK called him and asked what on Earth he was doing.

The first client meeting with Mr Trump, held at Mar-a-Lago, revealed two things: firstly, the security service team “jostled” to be the one to take him into the room because “they loved him and wanted to be in his presence”, and secondly, “you realised you never meet one-to-one”.

“There are always people in the room. He holds a couple of conversations at the same time, but he always asks very prescient questions. That is what really impresses me.”

Mr Garson's elevation to the Holocaust Memorial Council, the governing board of the national Holocaust museum in Washington, DC, gives him a platform to voice his concerns about anti-Semitism worldwide, including in the UK.

At the back end of last year, he was invited into Downing Street to discuss Britain's own plans for a Holocaust memorial in central London. At the meeting, he raised his concerns about the BBC's perceived anti-Israel bias and incidents of alleged anti-Semitism.

He is scathing about Sir Keir Starmer, accusing the Prime Minister of “turning a blind eye” to the discomfort of Britain's Jews, horrified by the chants on regular pro-Palestinian marches in London that have gone, he says, unchecked.

He took his concerns to Rabbi Yehuda Kaploun, Mr Trump's special envoy monitoring and combating anti-Semitism, and raised the prospect of the US offering safe haven to the UK's 300,000 Jews.

The rabbi, attached to the US State Department, was “receptive” to such a scheme.

Mr Garson grew up in Broughton Park, an orthodox Jewish area of Manchester, where he wore a yarmulke, a sign of his faith, attracting abuse when he got off the coach to play rugby to a decent level with Manchester Grammar School.

He persuaded the University of Manchester's archaeology department to take him after he failed to get his A-level grades.

He discovered debating at university, meeting and becoming lifelong friends with fellow student Rob Rinder, who would go on to become a television celebrity, the UK's version of Judge Judy. The pair still talk weekly, he says.

With confidence from his success at debating, he ditched plans for an archaeology PhD and switched to a law conversion before heading to the Bar in London. He began practising criminal law, largely as a defence counsel in the Crown courts dotted around London.

But in 2005, his confidence in the UK was shaken when he walked past a demonstration at a mosque in which the crowd was chanting “death to America, death to Britain, death to the Jews”.

He approached a police officer to complain. “I said to him: ‘I am Jewish,' and the officer looked at these guys who were burly and bearded and he said: ‘I suggest you walk on, sir,' and that affected me greatly.”

It was the same year he met his wife, Rachel, an American.

With the then Labour government cutting legal aid and anti-Semitism on the rise, Mr Garson went home one day and declared to his wife: “We are leaving.”

In 2008, they moved to New York, where he would set up GS2 Law in 2010 “with zero clients”. He was 34. His lucky break came in 2014 when he was hired by the New York Observer, coincidentally owned by Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law, to defend it from a libel action from a nightclub owner it had accused of running an escort agency.

So when Donald Jr and his business partner Mr Gor needed a lawyer for Winning Team Publishing, they turned to Mr Garson on a recommendation from the New York Observer.

By then, the Garsons had moved to Florida, upping sticks early in the pandemic on a promise from Ron DeSantis, the state's governor, to open schools faster than in New York.

More than five years on, Mr Garson is reaping the rewards of his loyalty to Mr Trump. GS2 Law is making a lot of money – “business is magnificent”, he says – and in the coming weeks, Mr Garson is off to the Democratic Republic of Congo with a client, seeking some kind of business deal. He won't say what.

October 7 has hardened his views and his fears for the future of the Jews. For three months after the attacks, he couldn't step inside his synagogue, his faith in God shaken by the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists.

The attacks also made him step up his weapons training, his resolve stiffened by the attack on Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester. It was a shul he knew well.

The Islamist assault on Mr Garson's hometown prompted him to approach Mr Trump's anti-Semitism tsar to raise the idea, at the very least, of the US offering asylum to Britain's Jews.

It's an extraordinary concept. But in the outlandish, crazy, dangerous world of Mr Trump – where Greenland now faces likely annexation – nothing should be ruled out. “It is certainly not an unattractive proposition,” he says, before unleashing another volley of bullets at his paper target.

Mr Garson is confident that British Jews would be well protected in the US, and he's serious about it.

“I know that in a God-forbid situation, there are 200 armed Jewish guys who could mobilise in a few seconds,” he says. It's a thought he finds oh so oddly reassuring.

Live Updates


            • US President Donald Trump tied his ambitions to annex Greenland to his unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in an extraordinary message to Norway's prime minister. Trump said he no longer feels bound “to think purely of Peace.”
    


            • European countries are weighing using their so-called “trade bazooka” after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies, including the UK, until a deal is reached for the purchase of Greenland.
    


            • UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies, and that the future status of Greenland belongs to its people and Denmark.
    


            • Meanwhile, an Israeli official said Trump invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin also received an invitation.
    


            NATO will continue to work with Denmark and Greenland on matters relating to the security of the Arctic region, the military alliance's Secretary General Mark Rutte said Monday.
    


            His comments follow a meeting with Denmark's Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt.
    


                    “We discussed how important the Arctic – including Greenland – is to our collective security and how (Denmark) is stepping up investments in key capabilities,” he posted on X. “We'll continue to work together as allies on these important issues.”
                





            During the meeting, Poulsen said he and Motzfeldt raised the possibility of having a NATO mission in Greenland and the Arctic, according to Reuters news agency.
    


                    “We have proposed this. The NATO secretary general has also taken note of this, and I believe we can now hopefully establish a framework for how this can be achieved,” Reuters quoted Poulsen as saying.
                





            President Donald Trump linked his interest in acquiring Greenland to his unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in a stunning message to Norway's prime minister.
    


            Meanwhile, stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold reached a new high after Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until they agree to a deal for the US purchase of Greenland.
    


            In response to Trump's threats, António Costa, the president of the European Council (EUCO), called for an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders on “transatlantic relations,” which is scheduled to be held in Brussels on Thursday at 1 p.m. ET, according to the council.
    


If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments:


President Trump has told the Norwegian prime minister that he is 'no longer obliged to think purely of peace' after he was snubbed of the Nobel Peace Prize. In the message, Trump also reiterated his calls for Greenland to be handed over to the United States.


CNN's Kevin Liptak, Olesya Dmitracova, Auzinea Bacon, James Frater, Catherine Nicholls, Inke Kappeler, Rebekah Riess, Benjamin Brown, Amy Croffey, Billy Stockwell and Henrik Pettersson contributed to this report.



            Europe is not interested in picking a “fight” with the US over President Donald Trump's ambitions to annex Greenland, but the bloc will “hold our ground,” according to the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
    


                    “We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground. Europe has a slate of tools to protect its interests,” Kallas said in a social post Monday.
                





            Trump's threat to hit his allies with tariffs unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland is “not the way to go about this,” Kallas said.
    


                    “Denmark and Greenland are not alone,” she said. “Arctic security is a shared transatlantic interest, and one we can discuss with our US allies.”
                





            Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said there are “red lines which can't be crossed,” referencing US President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland. However, he added that he has no intention of escalating the situation.
    


            He said he believed the United Kingdom and the European Union would stand behind Denmark, citing the “strong statement” of support from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
    


            Starmer said earlier Monday that it's “completely wrong” to impose tariffs on allies and reaffirmed that any decision about the future status of Greenland “belongs to the people of Greenland.”
    


            Asked if he felt betrayed by the US, Rasmussen said Monday: “I use the word surprised… I have no intention to escalate things.”
    


                    “It's so important that all our allies in the NATO alliance, European Union, stand up for these principles to show the American president you have a desire, you have a vision, you have a request, but you will never be able to achieve that by putting pressure on us,” Rasmussen said.
                





            Greenland's Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen said today that dialogue should prevail as US and Europe clash over President Donald Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland and subsequent threat of tariffs on European allies.
    


                    “We don't let ourselves be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,” Nielsen said in a social post referring to Trump's latest announcements.
                





            Nielsen said support for Greenland from other countries and state leaders “means something,” calling it a “clear recognition that Greenland is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions.”
    


                    “The demonstrations at home and in Denmark have shown a strong and dignified unity. Many people have peacefully expressed love for our country and respect for our democracy. I am very grateful for that,” he added.
                





            Three US cardinals have issued a rare joint statement calling for a “genuinely moral foreign policy” for America, citing recent events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland.
    


            “We renounce war as an instrument for narrow national interests and proclaim that military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations,” the cardinals said.
    


            The statement was signed by Cardinals Robert McElroy of Washington, DC, Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark.
    


            The three cardinals quoted from Pope Leo XIV's recent “state of the world” address in the Vatican, where the pontiff warned how “zeal for war is spreading” and the post-Second World War principle that prohibited nations violating the borders of others has been “completely undermined.”
    


            The US' “moral role” in the world, the cardinals state, was now coming “under examination,” while attempts to build peace are being “reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies.”
    


            Their unusual joint declaration comes after both the pope and US bishops have criticized the Trump administration's policy on immigration. McElroy, whose doctoral thesis was published as a book titled “Morality and American Foreign Policy: The Role of Ethics in International Affairs” in 1992, last year described immigration deportations as “morally repugnant.”



            Meanwhile, the US archbishop who has responsibility for the military expressed concern that “service personnel could be put in a situation where they're being ordered to do something that's morally questionable” when it came to any US action against Greenland.
    


            Archbishop Timothy Broglio told the BBC yesterday that “he cannot see any circumstances” that a US operation in Greenland could be a just war, describing Denmark as “an ally.”
    


            European countries are weighing using their “trade bazooka” after US President Trump threatened tariffs on European allies.
    


            But what is this so-called anti-coercion instrument?
    


            The tool — adopted in 2023 with countries like China in mind — can be applied if a third country tries to pressure the European Union or one of its member states “into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment.” It could block some of America's access to EU markets or impose export controls, among a broader list of potential countermeasures.
    


            Trump announced Saturday that he would impose 10% tariffs on February 1 on goods from eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland. It would increase to 25% if an agreement is not reached by June 1.
    


            The types of measures the European Commission can take using this anti-coercion instrument include restricting “foreign direct investment, financial markets, public procurement, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, export controls, and more,” according to the policy.
    


            However, the implementation of the “trade bazooka” could take time to implement.
    


            The European Commission would first need to examine the existence of economic coercion in an individual case. Then the council has a maximum of eight to ten weeks to “expeditiously” implement the act and would request “the coercing third country to stop the coercion,” the policy reads.
    


            Efforts would then be made to consult with the coercing third country to resolve the issue, but “if those efforts do not bear fruit,” the EU would then implement its anti-coercion instrument.
    


            CNN has obtained the full message exchange between Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, writing on behalf of himself and President Alexander Stubb of Finland, and US President Donald Trump. Here's that conversation:
    


Text message from Prime Minister Støre to President Trump [January 18 at 3:48 p.m.]:



«Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine - and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today - with both of us or separately - give us a hint of what you prefer! Best - Alex and Jonas»






Text message from President Trump to Prime Minister Støre [January 18 at 4:15 p.m.]:



«Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States.The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT»






            When US President Donald Trump began his second term last year, he immediately started threatening steep tariffs on goods imported from countries around the globe.
    


            On Saturday, he announced that he would impose 10% tariffs on goods from eight European countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany. Those eight nations had sent troops to Greenland Friday to take part in a joint military exercise on the island over the weekend.
    


            Trump did not specify whether the announced levies would be enacted on top of other tariffs already in existence. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Tariffs are taxes on imported goods or services. In some countries, exports can also be subject to tariffs.
    


            The levies typically amount to a percentage of the value of the import and can vary based on what the imports are and where they come from.
    


            Domestic businesses that import products into the country pay the tariffs up front. They may choose to absorb those extra costs or pass them on in part or in full to their customers.
    


            Tariff transactions occur at hundreds of points of entry into the United States, designated by Customs and Border Protection to take in imports, including airports, railways, roads and ports.
    


            China hit out at the United States today, rejecting the claim that it poses a threat to Greenland.
    


            “We urge the US to stop using the so-called ‘China threat' as a pretext for seeking selfish gains,” China's foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a news briefing in Beijing, according to CNN affiliate CCTV.
    


            The rebuke comes as US President Donald Trump, in a lengthy social media post Saturday, said the United States needed possession of Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian threats in the Arctic and develop what he has called the Golden Dome to protect North America from ballistic missiles.
    


            “China has stated its position on multiple occasions on Greenland. The international law underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter is the foundation of the current international order and must be upheld,” Jiakun added.
    


            There will be a “substantial increase” in the number of Danish troops in Greenland after today, a Danish military spokesperson told CNN, with soldiers being deployed to the Arctic island this evening.
    


            The troops will be sent to the municipality of Kangerlussuaq, the spokesperson said. Kangerlussuaq, in the south-west of the island, is in the Arctic Circle.



            The chief of the Royal Danish Army, Major General Peter Boysen, will be deployed with the soldiers, the spokesperson added.
    


            US President Donald Trump has invited Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join the US-led “Board of Peace,” a senior Israeli official told CNN.
    


            According to the official, the invitation was extended to Netanyahu or another Israeli representative on his behalf. Israel hasn't officially replied yet to be a founding member state, the official said.
    


            Over the weekend, the US extended invitations to multiple world leaders to join the Trump-led board, which is expected to oversee governance and reconstruction of post-war Gaza.
    


            The Kremlin earlier said Russian President Vladimir Putin was also invited to join the committee.
    


For more context: Netanyahu is facing internal political pressure following the advancement of the Gaza ceasefire deal to phase two. On Saturday, he harshly criticized the inclusion of Turkey and Qatar in key roles on the executive board after trying to prevent their involvement in Gaza.
    


            We're getting more updates on the special European Council meeting being convened regarding US-Europe tensions over Greenland.
    


            António Costa, the current president of the European Council (EUCO), called for the extraordinary meeting of EU leaders on “transatlantic relations” to be held in Brussels on Thursday at 1 p.m. ET, according to the council.
    


            Costa has said that after consulting with member states, European leaders are in agreement that US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations.
    


                    “We do not want a trade dispute with the United States of America,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today in Berlin. “But if we are confronted with tariffs that we consider unreasonable, then we are in a position to respond, and that is exactly what we will be discussing in Brussels on Thursday.”
                





            Amid threats from US President Donald Trump that he will impose tariffs on several European countries in his pursuit of acquiring Greenland, a spokesperson for the European Commission has said that the priority among EU leaders is to “engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs.”
    


                    “It's clear from the consultations among EU leaders, including President von der Leyen, that the priority here is to engage, not escalate, and avoid the imposition of tariffs. Why? Because this will ultimately harm consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” Olof Gill said today.
                





            If tariffs are imposed, however, the EU “has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond, because we will do everything necessary to protect EU economic interests,” he said.
    


            European leaders are “consulting intensively,” while “engagement with the US is continuing at all levels,” Gill said.
    


                    “Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint and responsible leadership is what President von der Leyen and indeed the European Union as a whole are all about,” he added.
                





            President Donald Trump's niece has urged Europe to “fight back” following the US leader's threat to impose tariffs on eight countries that oppose a takeover of Greenland.
    


            Quoting a New York Times headline that reads “European Officials Lean Toward Negotiating, Not Retaliating, Over Trump Threat,” Mary Trump said that she was “so f**king tired” of people trying to negotiate with her uncle.
    


                    “I am so f**king tired of the failed strategy of negotiation and appeasement. It only empowers him. Fight back!” she posted on X on Sunday night.
                





            Stocks in Europe weakened, while the price of gold – a safe-haven asset – reached a new peak after US President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on European allies until a deal was reached for the US purchase of Greenland.
    


            In the United States, where markets are closed Monday, Dow futures were 0.9% down, while S&P 500 futures dropped by a steeper 1.2%.
    


            The US president announced Saturday that he would impose a 10% tariff from February 1 on goods from eight European countries. Trump didn't specify whether the tariff would be on top of what they're already paying.
    


In response, the European Union is considering imposing €93 billion ($108 billion) of previously announced retaliatory tariffs against the United States. French President Emmanuel Macron has also reportedly called for the activation of the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument. Colloquially known as a “trade bazooka,” the instrument could block some of America's access to EU markets or result in export controls, among other potential measures.
    


            “Given their deep economic and financial ties, both the US and Europe have the ability to impose significant pain on each other, but only at great cost to themselves,” Jonas Goltermann, a senior markets economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said in a note Monday.
    


            “As such, the more likely outcome, in our view, is that both sides recognise that a major escalation would be a lose-lose proposition, and that compromise eventually prevails. That would be in line with the pattern around most previous Trump-driven diplomatic dramas.”
    


            US President Donald Trump tied his ambitions to annex Greenland to his so-far unsuccessful bid for a Nobel Peace Prize in an extraordinary message to Norway's prime minister, according to a European diplomat who has seen the note.
    


            “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the message, which was addressed to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
    


            It came in response to a text message Støre had sent to the president opposing his plans to levy new tariffs on European nations who oppose his bid to control Greenland.
    


            The contents of the note were sent to other European diplomats afterwards.
    


            “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,” Trump wrote in the message.
    


                    “I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” the note concluded.

This post has been updated with additional reporting.



            Russian President Vladimir Putin's top economic envoy will travel to the Swiss resort town of Davos to hold meetings with members of the US delegation, sources with knowledge tell CNN.
    


            Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) and Kremlin special envoy will meet Trump administration officials on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, the sources added.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has been invited to join US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace,” the committee that will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza, his spokesman said on Monday.
    


            “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
    


            He said the Kremlin is now reviewing the invitation and “hoping to get more details from the US side.”
    


Some context: The establishment of the board, chaired by Trump, is a key step in the United Nations-backed American plan to demilitarize and rebuild Gaza, which was ravaged by two years of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group.
    


            Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent requires it to have good relations with the United States.
    


                    “It is in our national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defense, security and to intelligence,” Starmer said Monday, fielding questions from reporters about whether US President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland might cause a fundamental rupture in relations between the US and the UK, along with other NATO allies.
                





            The prime minister said the UK's nuclear deterrent “is our foremost weapon… when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom, (which is) my primary duty.”
    


                    “That requires us to have a good relationship with the United States,” he said. “But that doesn't mean… that we pretend we don't have differences.”
                





            The prime minister stressed that it is not right for the UK to “choose between the US and Europe,” because it remains allies of both.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will attend the Supreme Court's oral argument Wednesday in a case involving the attempted firing of Fed governor Lisa Cook, an unusual show of support by the central bank chair. 

The high court is considering whether President Donald Trump can fire Cook, as he said he would do in late August, in an unprecedented attempt to remove one of the seven members of the Fed's governing board. Powell plans to attend the high court's Wednesday session, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 

It's a much more public show of support than the Fed chair has previously shown Cook. But it follows Powell's announcement last week that the Trump administration has sent subpoenas to the Fed, threatening an unprecedented criminal indictment of the Fed Chair. Powell — appointed to the position by Trump in 2018 — appears to be casting off last year's more subdued reponse to Trump's repeated attacks on the central bank in favor of a more public confrontation. 

Powell issued a video statement Jan. 11 condemning the subpoenas as “pretexts” for Trump's efforts to force him to sharply cut the Fed's key interest rate. Powell oversaw three rate cuts late last year, lowering the rate to about 3.6%, but Trump has argued it should be as low as 1%, a position few economists support.

The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, an allegation that Cook has denied. No charges have been made against Cook. She sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court Oct. 1 issued a brief order allowing her to stay on the board while they consider her case. 

If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, he could appoint another person to fill her slot, which would give his appointees a majority on the Fed's board and greater influence over the central bank's decisions on interest rates and bank regulation.

The Sundance Film Festival may be a little bittersweet this year. It will be familiar in some ways as it kicks off on Thursday in Park City, Utah. There will be stars, from Natalie Portman to Charli XCX, and breakout discoveries, tearjerkers, comedies, thrillers, oddities that defy categorization and maybe even a few future Oscar nominees. The pop ups and sponsors will be out in full force on Main Street. The lines to get into the 90 movies premiering across 10 days will be long and the volunteers will be endlessly helpful and cheery in subfreezing temperatures.

But the country's premier showcase for independent film is also in a time of profound transition after decades of relative stability. The festival is bidding farewell to its longtime home and forging forward without its founder, Robert Redford, who died in September. Next year, it must find its footing in another mountain town, Boulder, Colorado.

It's no surprise that legacy will be a through-line at this year's final edition in Park City. There will be screenings of restored Sundance gems like “Little Miss Sunshine,” “Mysterious Skin,” “House Party” and “Humpday” as well as Redford's first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama “Downhill Racer.” Many will also pay tribute to Redford at the institute's fundraising event, where honorees include Chloé Zhao, Ed Harris and Nia DaCosta.

“Sundance has always been about showcasing and fostering independent movies in America. Without that, so many filmmakers wouldn't have had the careers they have,” said “Mysterious Skin” filmmaker Gregg Araki. He first attended the festival in 1992 and has been back many times, including at the labs where Zhao was one of his students. 




Quite a few festival veterans are planning to make the trip, including “Navalny” filmmaker Daniel Roher. His first Sundance in 2022 might have been a bit unconventional (made fully remote at the last minute due to the pandemic) but ended on a high note with an Oscar. This year he's back with two films, his narrative debut “Tuner,” and the world premiere of “The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,” which he co-directed with Charlie Tyrell.

“We're going through a weird moment in the world … There's something that strikes me about an institution that has been evergreen, that seems so entrenched going through its own transition and rebirth,” Roher told The Associated Press. “I'm choosing to frame this year as a celebration of Sundance and the institute and a future that will ensure the festival goes on forever and ever and ever and stays the vital conduit for so many filmmakers that it has been.”

Over the past four decades, countless careers have been shaped and boosted by the festival and the Institute. Three of this year's presumed Oscar nominees — Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryan Coogler and Zhao — are among those the Institute supported early in their careers.

Jay Duplass, who first came to Sundance in 2003 with his brother, Mark, with what he calls a “$3 film” said it was the place where his career was made.

“I'd probably be a psychologist right now if it wasn't for Sundance,” Duplass said.

While he's been to “probably 15 Sundances” since, it hasn't lost its luster. In fact, when a programmer called him to tell him that his new film “See You When I See You” was selected, he cried. The film is based on a memoir in which a young comedy writer (Cooper Raiff) attempts to process the death of his sister (Kaitlyn Dever). It's one of many films that finds humor amid grim subjects.

As always, the lineup is full of starry films as well, including Cathy Yan's art world satire, “The Gallerist,” starring Portman, Jenna Ortega, Sterling K. Brown, Zach Galifianakis and Da'Vine Joy Randolph. The romantic drama “Carousel,” from Rachel Lambert, features Chris Pine and Jenny Slate as high school exes who rekindle their romance later in life. Araki is also bringing a new film, “I Want Your Sex,” in which Olivia Wilde plays a provocative artist (Araki described as a cross between Madonna and Robert Mapplethorpe) who takes on Cooper Hoffman as her younger muse.

“It's kind of a sex-positive love letter to Gen Z,” Araki said. “It's a comedy. It has elements of mystery, thriller, murder — a little bit of ‘Sunset Boulevard' … it's fun, it's colorful, it's sexy. It's a ride.”

Wilde also steps behind the camera for “The Invite,” in which she stars alongside Seth Rogen as a couple whose marriage disintegrates over the course of an evening. Olivia Colman is a fisherwoman looking to make the perfect husband in “Wicker,” co-starring Alexander Skarsgård. Zoey Deutch plays a Midwestern bride-to-be seeking out her celebrity “free pass” (Jon Hamm) in the screwball comedy “Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass.” And Ethan Hawke and Russell Crowe lead the Depression-era crime drama “The Weight.”

Pop star and noted cinephile Charli XCX will also be out and about, starring in the self-referential mockumentary “The Moment,” and appearing in “The Gallerist” and “I Want Your Sex” as well.

The 2026 festival features a robust lineup of documentaries too, which have a good track record of snagging eventual Oscar nominations and wins. There are a handful of films about famous faces, including basketball star Brittney Griner, Courtney Love, Salman Rushdie, Billie Jean King, Nelson Mandela and comedian Maria Bamford.

Others delve into newsy subjects past and present, like “When A Witness Recants,” in which author Ta-Nehisi Coates revisits the case of the 1983 murder of a boy in his Baltimore middle school and learns the truth. “American Doctor” follows three professionals trying to help in Gaza. “Who Killed Alex Odeh” examines the 1985 assassination of a Palestinian American activist in Southern California. “Everybody To Kenmure Street” is about civil resistance to deportations in Glasgow in 2021. And “Silenced” tracks international human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson in her fight against the weaponization of defamation laws against victims of gender violence. 

And some don't fit into any easy category, like “The History of Concrete” in which filmmaker John Wilson takes what he learned at a “how to sell a Hallmark movie” seminar and tries to apply it to a documentary on concrete. 

There might be a bit of wistfulness in the air too, as everyone takes stock of the last Sundance in Park City and tries to imagine what Boulder might hold.

“It feels very special to be part of the last one in Park City,” Duplass said. “It's just a super special place where, you know there are going to be movies there with giant stars and there's also going to be some kids there who made movies for a few thousand dollars. And they're all going to mix.”

Araki, like Redford, knew long ago that the festival had outgrown Park City. It will be strange to no longer have its iconic locations like Egyptian Theatre and Eccles and The Ray anymore, but it's also just a place. 

“The legacy and the tradition of Sundance will continue no matter where it is,” Araki said.

The European Union's executive arm, Russia, Belarus and Thailand on Monday were the latest to be asked to join U.S. President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace that will supervise the next phase of the Gaza peace plan, while France is holding off accepting for now.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin received the invitation and that the Kremlin is now “studying the details” and would seek clarity of “all the nuances” in contacts with the U.S. 

It's unclear how many leaders have been invited to join the board. But a Trump reference in the invitation letters that the body would “embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict” suggested it could act as a rival to the U.N. Security Council, the most powerful body of the global organization created in the wake of World War II.

France does not plan to join the Board of Peace “at this stage” despite receiving an invitation, a French official close to President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. The issue is raising questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, said the official, speaking anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices. 

A top Israeli official said the initiative is “bad for Israel” and should be scrapped.

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has been invited and is ready to take part, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. The Thai Foreign Ministry said it was also invited and that it was reviewing the details.

European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill confirmed that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, received an invitation and would be speaking to other EU leaders about Gaza. Gill didn't say whether the invitation had been accepted, but that the commission wants “to contribute to a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.”

According to the World Bank's Gaza and West Bank Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (IRDNA) report released last year, it'll take $53 billion to rebuild the strip.

Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday dismissed the Board of Peace as a raw deal for Israel and called for its dissolution. 

“It is time to explain to the president that his plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,” Smotrich said. “Gaza is ours, its future will affect our future more than anyone else's. We will take responsibility for what happens there, impose military administration, and complete the mission.”

Smotrich, a hard-liner who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, even suggested that Israel renew a full-scale offensive on the territory to destroy Hamas if it doesn't abide by a “short ultimatum for real disarmament and exile.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later on Monday that while there are differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza, it would not harm his relationship with Trump.

“There will not be Turkish soldiers and Qatari soldiers in the (Gaza) Strip,” he said. 

Netanyahu's office earlier said the formation of an executive board that will work to carry out the vision of the Board of Peace wasn't coordinated with the Israeli government and “is contrary to its policy” without clarifying its objections. Israel hasn't been invited to join the committee, unlike Turkey, a key regional rival.

The U.S. is expected to announce its official list of members in the coming days, likely during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

Board members will oversee an executive committee that will be in charge of implementing the tough second phase of the Gaza peace plan that includes the deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-devastated territory.

A $1 billion contribution secures permanent membership on the board, with the money going to rebuild Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the charter as he wasn't permitted to speak publicly about details of the board, which hasn't been made public. A three-year appointment has no contribution requirement.

Details of how this will also work remain murky. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday the United Kingdom is talking to allies about the Board of Peace. Although the U.K. hasn't said whether Starmer has been formally invited to join, he said it's necessary to proceed with the Gaza peace plan's second phase and that his country has “indicated willingness to play our part, and we will.”

Egypt's top diplomat on Monday met with the leader of the newly appointed committee of Palestinian technocrats who will be running Gaza's day-to-day affairs during the second phase of the peace plan.

Foreign Minister Bader Abdelatty met with Ali Shaath, a Palestinian engineer and former official with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, who was named last week as chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza.

Abdelatty expressed the Egyptian government's “complete support” of the committee and affirmed its role in running Gaza's daily affairs until the Palestinian Authority takes over the territory, said a statement from the Egyptian ministry.

He also underscored “the importance of preserving the unity of the Palestinian territories, ensuring geographical and administrative continuity between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.”

The U.N. World Food Program on Monday said it has “significantly expanded” its operations across Gaza 100 days into the ceasefire, reaching more than a million people each month with hot meals and food parcels. But it warned the situation remains “extremely fragile.” 

It noted that malnutrition has been prevented for 200,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children under 5. 

Still, the most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis in December indicated that 77% the population is facing crisis-level food insecurity.

Israeli military and security forces launched what they called a large-scale counterterrorism operation in the West Bank city of Hebron to dismantle “terrorist infrastructure, eliminating illegal weapons possession and strengthening security.”

The Israeli military said Monday the operation is expected to continue for several days. Israeli armored vehicles and soldiers patrolled city streets and put up barriers where operations were being conducted. 

Hebron Mayor Khaled Dudin said Israeli forces targeted the area that's home to 80,000 people because it obstructs the construction of additional Israeli settlements.

The West Bank has seen a surge in Israeli military activity since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack into Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.

Israeli forces on Monday killed three Palestinians, including a teenager, in southern Gaza, hospital authorities said.

Two men crossed into Israeli-controlled areas east of Khan Younis before being shot dead, while 17-year-old Hussein Tawfiq Abu Sabalah was shot and killed in the Muwasi area of Rafah, according to the Nasser hospital. It wasn't immediately clear whether the teen had crossed into or came close to the Israeli-controlled area.

More than 460 people were killed by Israeli fire and their bodies brought to hospitals since the ceasefire went into effect just over three months ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts

Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices following a 'massive security gap.'

The Apple iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the United States and one of the most widely used devices in the world. An estimated 1.6 billion people rely on iPhones every day. That massive user base also makes the platform a prime target. 

Over the past few weeks, Apple has been sending out warnings about a serious security flaw. New data suggests the risk could affect roughly half of all iPhone users.

That puts hundreds of millions of devices in potential danger right now.

WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY

Apple is warning iPhone users about a serious Safari security flaw that could leave hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable if updates are delayed. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)

Late last month, Apple confirmed two critical vulnerabilities in WebKit. WebKit powers Safari and every browser that runs on iOS. According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code. Once that happens, attackers could gain control of the device, steal passwords or access payment information. In simple terms, visiting the wrong website could have been enough.

Apple moved quickly to release a fix. The patch is included in the latest software update. The problem is that many people have not installed it yet. Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide. Data from StatCounter paints an even worse picture. It estimates that only 20 percent of users have updated so far. Once security details become public, the risk grows fast. Attackers know exactly what to exploit.

Apple says the following devices are affected if they are not updated:

If your device appears on this list and you have not updated it, it is vulnerable.

INSTAGRAM PASSWORD RESET SURGE: PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNT

New data suggests nearly half of all iPhone users worldwide may still be exposed to a critical WebKit exploit Apple says was actively used in attacks. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

There is no setting to flip and no safe browsing habit that fixes this issue. The vulnerability lives deep inside the browser engine. Security experts say there is no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully reduces the risk. Installing the latest software is the only effective defense. Apple is no longer offering a security-only update for users who want to stay on iOS 18. Unless your device cannot run iOS 26, the fix is only available through iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2.

Updating is quick and usually painless. If automatic updates are enabled, the fix may already be installed.

If not, follow these steps:

Make sure your device is connected to Wi-Fi and has enough battery life or is plugged in.

Keeping your iPhone updated is critical, but it should not be your only line of defense. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by scanning malicious links, blocking risky websites and alerting you to suspicious activity before damage is done.

This matters even more when attacks rely on compromised websites or hidden browser exploits. Security software can help catch threats that slip through and give you extra visibility into what is happening on your device.

Think of it as backup protection. Software updates close known holes, while strong antivirus tools help guard against the next one.

 FAKE ERROR POPUPS ARE SPREADING MALWARE FAST

Apple rarely uses language like ""extremely sophisticated"" unless the threat is serious. This flaw shows how even trusted browsers can become attack paths when updates are delayed. Waiting weeks or months to update now carries real consequences. If you use your iPhone for banking, shopping or work, this update should be treated as urgent.

How long do you usually wait before installing major iPhone updates, and is that delay worth the risk anymore? Let us know by writing to us at Cyberguy.com.

There may have once been a narrow avenue for a serious conversation between the United States and Greenland about some form of relationship.

Perhaps it could have taken the shape of a compact of free association or a new security and economic framework reflecting the realities of the Arctic in the 21st century. However, that door has long since slammed shut.

Whatever opportunity existed has been squandered by an obsessive fixation on “owning” Greenland, as if it were a distressed property listed on Zillow rather than a territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.

At no point has there appeared to be a real strategy. What initially looked like a joke or an online troll quickly metastasized into something far more damaging: a persistent signal to allies that the U.S. no longer understands the difference between power and petulance. You cannot browbeat partners into cooperation by floating ideas that insult their sovereignty.

The damage is not hypothetical.

This episode has seriously strained relations with key U.S. allies, particularly NATO allies. And not just the perennial deadweights who fail to meet NATO's defense spending targets. Real allies are questioning their relationship with America. The United Kingdom, long considered Washington's most reliable partner, is increasingly uneasy. Other European capitals are reassessing what their relationship with the U.S. will actually mean moving forward.

I just returned from Finland after attending MATKA, a major Nordic regional travel and tourism show. Greenland was the elephant in the room that nobody wanted to talk about because everyone was thinking about it.

Between the semiquincentennial, the World Cup, and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, the U.S. should be selling itself. Instead, the mood at MATKA was unmistakable: nobody wants to visit America. Literally nobody. Tourism is often dismissed, but soft power matters. Right now, America is hemorrhaging it.

This should alarm Republicans.

The cleanup will not end when the 2028 presidential campaign begins in earnest or when President Donald Trump leaves office in three years. Republicans are going to inherit the consequences of this behavior for years, if not decades.

Credibility once lost is not easily restored. The next Republican president will not be starting from a position of trust. Instead, he will be greeted with folded arms and raised eyebrows.

Who abroad is going to take Republicans seriously again when they talk about alliances, shared values, or long-term commitments? Why should anyone believe them?

Some on the Right have shrugged this off. Maybe we do not need Spain. Maybe we do not need the U.K., and maybe we do not need Canada. This bravado sounds tough on TV, but it collapses under any scrutiny. The U.S. does not operate in a vacuum. We live in a dangerous world populated by dangerous and rogue actors who are more than happy to exploit fractures within the West.

There will come a time when the U.S. needs help from its friends and allies. It might be a military contingency, an intelligence-sharing crisis, or another conflict, near or far. When that moment arrives, alliances, access, and trust will matter.

And trust is precisely what this Greenland fixation has eroded. It also reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how influence works.

If the U.S. wants a stronger presence in the Arctic, there are ways to pursue that goal: investment, diplomacy, scientific cooperation, security agreements, and respectful engagement with the Danish realm. This slow and often frustrating process is how diplomacy and statecraft work.

Republicans should be particularly concerned because they are the ones who claim to believe in realism, prudence, and American leadership grounded in strength. Ending this nonsense is not about appeasing Europeans or caving to criticism. It is about recognizing that American power is maximized when it is exercised with discipline and purpose.

TRUMP'S UNNECESSARY GREENLAND THREATS UNDERMINE US INTERESTS

Enough is enough.

The Greenland distraction has outlived whatever fleeting political utility it once had. It has harmed U.S. economic and national security interests, embarrassed allies, and weakened alliances that keep America secure. If Republicans want to govern again, they need to say so clearly and move on.

Kamala Harris has decided that her self-declared “existential threat” isn't so terrifying after all.

The former vice president just dropped roughly eight million dollars on a mansion in Malibu's celebrity haven, Pt. Dume, complete with sweeping ocean views and a beach just a stroll away. Oceanfront living is nice work if you can afford it, especially if your paycheck came from taxpayers. The property sits a few hundred feet from the Pacific, which, if you believe Harris's speeches, should be devouring coastlines any moment. Yet the ex-Veep chose this patch of endangered paradise for her private retreat. It's almost as if she knows the water isn't coming.

TRUMP FIRST YEAR REPORT CARD: A- PROMISE KEEPER OR ‘NIGHTMARE' FAILURE

That contradiction never seems to bother the professional climate grifters. Their message is for everyone else. Americans are told to regulate thermostats, ditch gas cars, and submit to higher prices for “planetary justice.” The lecturing is constant. Harris once said that being “practical” means changing personal behavior to slow the planet's decline.

Yet her own practicality has involved spending millions on private jet travel and purchasing one of California's most desirable coastal compounds. Only the climate establishment could twist virtue into something so self-serving and call it leadership. Her environmental morality is a sermon delivered from the pulpit of a luxury veranda with panoramic views of the Pacific.

Harris didn't invent the script. She inherited it from a long, lucrative tradition of climate alarmists cashing in on the very apocalypse they describe. A former president famously bought a multimillion-dollar waterfront estate after years of sounding the alarm of rising sea levels threatening homes, then arranged the purchase through a network of loopholes that would impress any accountant.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES NEW TARIFF ON EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT OPPOSE GREENLAND ACQUISITION

The pioneer of planetary panic himself lives in an enormous estate that uses as much electricity as a small neighborhood. Perhaps that power bill covers the servers for the internet he supposedly invented. A self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont spent his campaign circling the globe by jet, creating a carbon footprint that might make an actual oil executive blush.

The former climate czar who married into the Heinz family preaches restraint while logging luxury air miles and enjoying VIP aviation privileges.

Even the self-styled champion of the Green New Deal has admitted that she still flies and runs the A/C whenever she wants.

If these self-anointed prophets truly feared their predictions, they'd live like it. But fear is for the audience, not the actors. Their play depends on maintaining a looming crisis big enough to justify every tax, restriction, and scolding. The so-called science they cite gets thinner every decade, while the carbon footprints of its promoters get wider. And most inconvenient of all, the planet stubbornly refuses to perform according to their storyline.

Ocean-level records show no acceleration that can be attributed to emissions. Even longtime alarmist outlets have reluctantly admitted that Pacific islands are not sinking beneath the waves after all. The science that once promised doom has instead become a tool for political theater, and no troupe cashes in harder than the environmental elite.

TRUMP WARNS OF JANUARY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER OBAMACARE

Despite all this, the climate industry keeps growing. It can't survive on accuracy, only anxiety. The panic pays well, both in votes and real estate. That's why Harris's Malibu mansion matters. It exposes the real confidence game. The officials who warn about dying reefs and flooded coasts behave like charlatans, investing in the very real estate markets they tell everyone else to abandon. Their actions behind the green curtain reject the hysteria upon which their public personas depend.

Harris's mansion isn't just a home; it's the physical manifestation of a confession. She knows the seas aren't rising, and the island nations aren't sinking. She knows the coastline will still be there for her neighbors, the movie stars and moguls who share her ZIP code. What's rising isn't the water but grift in the form of endless subsidies, regulations, and the political control that flows from fear. The ocean isn't claiming Malibu anytime soon, but within the climate elite, hypocrisy rises faster than any tide.

The most narcissistic corner of the internet is having a moment.

The so-called looksmaxxing movement is narcissistic, cruel, racist, shot through with social Darwinism, and proudly anti-compassion. As the name suggests, looksmaxxers share a monomaniacal commitment to improving their physical appearance. They trade stories of breaking their legs in order to gain extra inches, “bonesmashing” their faces with hammers to heighten their cheekbones, injecting steroids and testosterone to inflate their muscles, and even smoking crystal meth to suppress their appetite. If you had to pick a single corner of the internet that best captures the vices of the Trump era, you couldn't beat the looksmaxxers. Perhaps more than any other group, they reveal the depth of the moral crisis that confronts young men today.

Although many looksmaxxers support Donald Trump, they defy neat political classification. The community is simply too nihilistic. Its newest star, Braden Peters, made this clear during a recent podcast interview with the conservative commentator Michael Knowles, in which the two discussed a potential 2028 presidential contest between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President J. D. Vance. Peters said he disagrees with Newsom's politics but would vote for the governor anyway because he's more handsome—or, in the group's parlance, he “mogs” Vance. The governor is a “Chad” and the vice president is “subhuman,” Peters explained to Knowles, who was gobsmacked.

On social media, Peters goes by the moniker “Clavicular,” a reference to the unusual importance that looksmaxxers place on the width of their clavicles. The white 20-year-old, who was expelled from college, has quickly become the most recognizable member of the movement thanks in part to his constant presence online. Perhaps his most viral moment came on Christmas Eve. While livestreaming from Miami, Peters appears to run over an alleged stalker with his Cybertruck. “Is he dead?” he asks the girl riding in the car with him. “Hopefully,” he adds.

George Packer: The depth of MAGA's moral collapse

Few details have been reliably reported. Some viewers suspected that the incident had been staged. Others claimed to have identified the supposed stalker and said he survived. Whether it was real or faked, the video reveals the breathtaking callousness of Peters and the many fans who rushed to his defense. Indeed, the incident seems only to have grown Peters's following. James Fishback, a far-right candidate for governor of Florida, posted on X that Peters “did nothing wrong.” (Peters did not respond to a request for an interview.)

My introduction to Peters came late last year, when Instagram's algorithm served me a video of him wearing a baseball cap, primping and pouting for the camera. He remains silent, letting the large word on his hat do the talking: NIGGA. The post earned him tens of thousands of likes along with the admiration of white nationalists such as Nick Fuentes, who declared to his online following of so-called Groypers that Peters is the modern-day Nietzschean “overman” he had hoped for. “Sculptor and clay!” rhapsodized Fuentes, referring to himself and Peters. “I prefigured the white-ass nigga!”

The looksmaxxing movement—ideologically incoherent but rife with juvenile racism—echoes the ongoing Groyperization of the American right. This is particularly evident in the growing antagonism that certain factions express toward Vance. Fuentes, for example, sounded like a looksmaxxer himself when he criticized the vice president last year. “He's visibly obese and very ugly. He's got a fat face, no jawline, no chin,” Fuentes said, before shifting to a more familiar topic for him: “His wife and kids are not white!”

Looksmaxxing grew out of the online culture of “incels,” or involuntary celibates, a term that emerged in the 2010s. United by their resentment of women, incels tend to see attractiveness as a straightforward function of genetics—millimeters, symmetry, skin color—and therefore out of their control. Looksmaxxers hold a similarly superficial view of beauty as a kind of rigid mathematics with a single, knowable solution. But they believe that this makes it malleable: One can “ascend” to a higher plane of attractiveness with enough money, effort, and perhaps the willingness to dabble with crystal meth.

For many members of the group, though, looking good is not a path to social or romantic goals; it is an end in its own right, a kind of self-glorification. Rather than a womanizing Don Juan, their ideal is someone closer to Achilles, the Homeric war hero whose excellence is determined by his success over other men. The primary goal of the looksmaxxer is not sexual pleasure or mating prowess—Peters speaks freely about his infertility, supposedly caused by excessive testosterone supplements—but to mog and achieve status within the pecking order of their same-sex digital community.

This kind of thinking has spread among young men on the right at the same time that many of them are adopting polar-opposite beliefs. Another part of the cohort is embracing Christianity, whose pro-social commitments—monogamy, marriage, childbearing—flatly contradict the looksmaxxing ethos.

Timothy Keller: American Christianity is due for a revival

But the rise of looksmaxxing and the return to social conservatism are both reactions to the same set of conditions. Today's young men came of age on the social internet, during the upheavals of COVID-19, and under the political dominance of the most narcissistic and superficial president in American history. And their generation has experienced so many of the worst effects of decades of social fragmentation, economic anxiety, and zero-sum competition for what can feel like ever more limited opportunities for meaning, fulfillment, and recognition. Amid this tumult, the fact that Clavicular and his ilk have managed to intrigue so many young men with their brand of nihilism shouldn't be a surprise. That so many others have sought refuge in traditional sources of order and structure shouldn't be one either. Instability breeds divergence.

For many of the men who reject conventional norms, appearance has become the stablecoin of the realm. And of course this is true for many women too. Some estimates suggest that more than 3 million women have opened creator accounts on the amateur-pornography website OnlyFans. Many of them are hoping to be the next Sophie Rain, a 23-year-old former waitress from Florida who has already made $82 million on the platform. For younger generations lacking purpose or faith in the future, nothing remains to them but their own bodies, to paraphrase the Hungarian critic László Földényi.

The paradox is that they would manipulate and exploit themselves even as they live in a time of relative peace and plenty. But physical security can coincide with existential precarity. In discussions about looksmaxxing on social media, some critics have highlighted that irony by citing an experiment by the ethologist John B. Calhoun. In 1968, Calhoun built large, enclosed mouse colonies with abundant food and water, no predators, and lots of space for nesting. At first, the population flourished. Later in the experiment, a group of male mice emerged that Calhoun dubbed “the beautiful ones.” These mice spent most of their time grooming, sleeping, and eating—maintaining clean, unscarred bodies and showing no signs of stress. Concerned only with themselves, they disengaged from the other mice and stopped reproducing. Eventually the entire population collapsed.

Oscar Wilde made the strongest case that worshipping beauty for its own sake can end only in death and destruction. Dorian Gray, the Victorian era's proto-Clavicular, literally exchanges his soul for eternal youth and beauty—a move that the looksmaxxing community would seem to endorse wholeheartedly. The bargain makes him a monster, but Gray's downfall is not the result of mere egoism. It comes from something even more dangerous: the belief that beauty exempts you from responsibility.

A mix of carmine and scarlet, with a hint of orange — a new hue, inspired by an elderly woman at Barcelona's opera house, whose elegance struck a young Valentino Garavani.

The colour, introduced to the fashion world several years later, in 1959, with a strapless cocktail dress of draped tulle, has carried his name — ""Valentino red"" — ⁠ever since, doubling as the eponymous Italian fashion group's signature.

""I think a woman dressed in red is always wonderful, she is the perfect image of a heroine,"" Valentino wrote in the book ""Rosso"" (Red), released in 2022. He ‍would include at least one red dress in every ‍one of his collections.

Valentino, one of Italy's leading ‍fashion designers, died on Monday at his Roman residence, his foundation announced. He was 93 years old.

The cause of death was not immediately known.

Valentino ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of a leading generation of designers, from an era before fashion became a highly commercial industry run as much by financiers and marketing executives as by couturiers.

Scaling the ‌heights of ‌high fashion, he was the first Italian to feature on the exclusive Paris haute couture catwalks.

Passionate ​about film, he dreamed as a young man of dressing the ""beautiful ladies of the silverscreen"", as he called them, among them 1950s Hollywood stars Lana Turner and Judy Garland.

Valentino would eventually design Elizabeth Taylor's wedding gown, and was the first choice for numerous Oscar winners, including Sharon Stone and Penelope Cruz.

His romantic designs, simple at first glance, were full of intricate detail. ""I love beauty,"" Valentino said. ""It is not my fault. And I know what women ⁠want: they want to be beautiful.""

The designer, who also dressed Jackie Kennedy, created a business empire under his own name before selling it off ahead of his retirement in 2008.

Valentino was an only child, born into a well-to-do family in Voghera, south of Milan, where his father ran an electrical supplies company.

Having started drawing and appreciating high-end clothes from a young age, he studied couture in Milan and Paris, where he then worked as an apprentice for designer Jean Dessès. He returned home in 1960, opening his own fashion house in the heart of Rome.

That year, Elizabeth Taylor chose a white Valentino gown for the premiere of the blockbuster ""Spartacus"".

Also in 1960, he met Giancarlo Giammetti in a Roman cafe. Giammetti would go on to be his partner in business and in life.

""To share life with a person for your whole existence - every moment, joy, pain, enthusiasm, disappointment - is something that cannot be defined,"" Valentino said of him.

Giammetti took on the managerial part of the business, leaving creative matters to the designer.

""To be with Valentino as a friend, as a lover and as an employee is a bit the same: you need a lot of patience,"" Giammetti said in ""Valentino: The Last Emperor"", a documentary that followed the designer in the last two years of his career.

Valentino's georgette fabrics, chiffon ruffles and ornate embellishments, including the exclusive budellini technique - where long strips of sheep's wool are hand rolled into tubes, wrapped in silk and stitched together - won him a multitude of awards, including France's highest ‍civilian distinction in 2006.

""Fame and fortune didn't change him,"" Giammetti said at the time. ""He is still the little guy I met 45 years ago.""

Superstitious and introverted, ‌Valentino loved chocolate, skiing and his pugs. He told Corriere in 2017 that he was afraid of death.

In 2007, he ⁠wowed Rome with lavish celebrations for his decades in fashion - a three-day event that included dinners, parties and exhibitions with thousands of guests flying in from around the world.

Months later, he announced that he would stop designing for his company, which he no longer controlled after ‍selling the firm almost a decade earlier for some $300 million.

""I have decided that this is the perfect moment to say adieu to the world of fashion,"" he said. ""As the English say, I would like to leave the party when it is still full.""

His last catwalk show was held in January 2008 in Paris, a city he called his second home and which he said had taught him to love fashion and life.

The business that bears his name was bought by Qatari fund Mayhoola for 700 million euros in 2012. French luxury group Kering bought a 30% stake in 2023, with a commitment to fully acquire the business from 2026, but then deferred the move to 2028 at ⁠the earliest.

Valentino and Giammetti remained active in supporting the arts. Their foundation ‌opened the PM23 gallery in the centre of Rome in 2025, next to the Valentino headquarters.

Fittingly, the opening exhibition - ""Horizons/Red"" - focused on the colour most closely associated with Valentino.

""Red isn't just a colour,"" Giammetti said at the time. ""It's a symbolic and ​aesthetic force of extraordinary power.""

In this article

Shares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers fell sharply on Monday morning, following U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.

Europe's Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index traded 2% lower at around 1:02 p.m. London time (8:02 a.m. ET), paring losses from earlier in the session.

Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group stood between 2.5% to 3% lower, while Milan-listed shares of Ferrari dipped around 2.2%, notching a 52-week low. Germany's Porsche fell 3.2% on the news.

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler, and Peugeot, were last seen 1.8% lower. 

The moves come shortly after Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, part of the United States.

The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said.

European political leaders are expected to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response. 

The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. 

""Our view is that ultimately tariffs are a blunt tool that seldom really works for any sort of length of time. Mostly because it's a very global economy these days and people find a way around it even if they can't talk themselves out of them,"" Rob Brewis, director and investment manager at Aubrey Capital Management, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.

""Clearly, the tariffs created a huge stir back in April last year but ever since then, their impact diminishes with time and with repeated use, I guess,"" he added.

Asked which European sectors were likely most exposed to Trump's latest tariff threats, Brewis singled out the automotive industry.

""My focus is more on emerging markets, so I spend less time on Europe, but I think it's unhelpful for sectors like the car sector, which is already facing huge threats from the Chinese players,"" he added.

Amid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. 

From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. 

""Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation,"" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  ""Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door.""

Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. 

Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using ""virtually worthless"" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. 

While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. 

Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. 

That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an ""escape valve"" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  

""This was a violent repricing driven by fear,"" Li said. ""As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight.""

He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, ""they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible,"" in an emergency situation, Li said. 

""That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack,"" he added.

The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  

Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.

""If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse,"" said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  

However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of ""put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug,"" Campbell said.

And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. 

""When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option,"" Campbell said.

The Motley Fool->



Since 2018, Bitcoin is up more than 600%, while XRP has lost 44% of its value.

While XRP is capable of explosive upside potential, it simply can't keep pace with Bitcoin over an extended period of time.

Long-term buy-and-hold investors are better off sticking with Bitcoin and forgetting about XRP.

It's easy to see why some crypto investors have already given up on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in favor of more speculative cryptocurrencies such as XRP (CRYPTO: XRP).

After all, Bitcoin is down more than 20% from its all-time high of $126,000 it had reached last October. And it's still badly underperforming gold. Even with a mini-rally to start the year, Bitcoin has yet to top a price of $100,000 in 2026.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

But forgetting about Bitcoin would be a mistake, especially if you're planning to rotate into XRP instead. Here's why.

It all comes down to the difference between short-term and long-term performance. Over just a few months, XRP has shown explosive upside potential. For example, in the period from November 2024 to January 2025, XRP had skyrocketed by 580%.

Image source: Getty Images.

But over the long haul, XRP has had trouble putting together any type of consistency. Just consider the following chart. It shows the relative performance of Bitcoin and XRP since January 2018. That's when XRP hit its all-time high of $3.84. Since then, Bitcoin has soared 756%, while XRP is up just 59%.

XRP Price data by YCharts.

Or consider a 12-month comparison between Bitcoin and XRP that tracks their performance since January 2025. Over this period, Bitcoin is down nearly 5%, while XRP has lost nearly 35% of its value. Even with a huge price spike over the summer, XRP couldn't keep pace with Bitcoin.

XRP Price data by YCharts.

To use a sports analogy, XRP is a sprinter, while Bitcoin is a marathon runner. If you're a long-term, buy-and-hold investor, you want marathon runners in your portfolio, not sprinters. Even better, you want marathon runners capable of very fast mile split times. In other words, you want cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that you can buy and hold for decades.

When you look at Bitcoin's historical track record, everything becomes clear. Since 2012, Bitcoin has never had back-to-back losing years. And in 10 of those years, it was the top-performing asset in the world. In many years, Bitcoin posted triple-digit returns, massively outperforming every other asset class.

Simply stated, Bitcoin can compound returns year after year, delivering spectacular performance over the long haul. Yes, Bitcoin is prone to cycles of boom and bust, but the ""boom"" years are so phenomenal that they more than make up for the ""bust"" years. From 2017 to 2025, Bitcoin grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44%.

So don't give up on Bitcoin quite yet. If history is any guide, it will continue to outperform XRP over the long haul, surprising and delighting investors in the process.

Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $474,578!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $1,141,628!*

Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 955% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor, and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.

The Ethereum (ETH) 4-hour chart is flashing warning signs as price hovers around a critical support zone. After months of sideways trading, ETH remains trapped in a consolidation, signaling weakening momentum amid uncertain broader market conditions. According to a crypto analyst, ETH's 4-hour chart suggests that the cryptocurrency could be heading for a major price dump if buyers fail to regain control. 

Ethereum Price Chart Signals Major Crash Ahead

A new market analysis by crypto expert Tyrex draws attention to a 4-hour chart, warning that ETH may be preparing for another price crash. Tyrex noted that Ethereum recently bottomed inside the purple rectangle on the lower timeframe, where price dipped below a key support around $3,260, briefly triggering a liquidity sweep. The move, however, was quickly reversed, indicating it was a fakeout rather than a true bearish breakdown.

Even after the rejection, the analyst revealed that Ethereum's broader 4-hour pattern remains largely unchanged. He stated that ETH has also repeatedly returned to the same support area, raising concerns that demand may be weakening. Notably, when price keeps revisiting the same lows, it often signals growing pressure, not strength. 

On the chart, Ethereum is now consolidating just above the highlighted support zone. Momentum has slowed compared to the earlier impulsive rally, and the price is still struggling to gain upward traction. Instead of continuation, the market appears to be hesitating at a critical area.

 According to Tyrex, this hesitation could be a major risk. Repeatedly retesting the same lows makes the market more vulnerable, increasing the likelihood of a deeper price dump. Notably, each retest makes it easier for sellers to break through support as buyers gradually lose control. 

The analyst's chart also outlines a potential path lower if support gives way. A drop beneath the purple zone would put Ethereum at risk of sliding toward the next downside area between $3,209 and $3,221. At the time of Tyrex's analysis, ETH was trading around $3,312, which means a move to this range would have represented a roughly 3% decline.

However, as of writing, Ethereum has dropped to $3,200–which is already below the analyst's initial breakdown target. This suggests that upward momentum has weakened further, and the recent price drop could signal an even larger decline, according to Tyrex's analysis. 

Analyst Recommends A “Wait And See” Approach

While the Ethereum price navigates bearish trends, Tyrex has advised investors and targets to adopt a wait-and-see approach. He indicated that ETH's outlook is not entirely bearish. According to him, if Ethereum can hold above $3,230, it would shift his bearish bias to a cautiously bullish one. 

Maintaining that level suggests buyers are defending the range and preventing further downside. In that scenario, ETH could stabilize and potentially climb toward $3,420, as highlighted by the green zone on the chart.

Solana Labs CEO and co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko issued a defiant strategic directive on January 17, 2026, arguing that the Solana network must “never stop iterating” if it hopes to remain relevant in a rapidly maturing global financial system. Speaking via social media in response to a philosophical post from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Yakovenko challenged the idea that a blockchain should strive for a “self-sustaining” or static state. While Buterin recently advocated for Ethereum to reach a point where it could survive for decades without active developer influence, Yakovenko countered that a hands-off approach is a recipe for technical obsolescence. He emphasized that for Solana to meet the diverse and shifting needs of its millions of users and developers, the network must maintain an aggressive, iterative development cycle, effectively adopting an “adapt or die” mentality that prioritizes real-world utility over theoretical purity.

The debate between the two most prominent figures in the Layer 1 space highlights a fundamental divergence in the technical roadmap for the 2026 bull market. Yakovenko's vision for Solana is one of a “living ecosystem” that introduces new features, optimizes its validator stack, and updates its core codebase to fit the immediate demands of internet-scale financial activity. This stands in stark contrast to the “walkaway test” proposed for Ethereum, which focuses on maximizing decentralization and privacy even if it results in a slower pace of innovation. Supporters of Yakovenko's approach argue that the complexity of modern finance requires a network that can handle thousands of “micro-advancements” in areas like scheduler optimization and compute unit limits. By rejecting the notion that a protocol can ever be “finished,” Solana is positioning itself as the primary venue for consumer-facing applications and high-frequency trading, where speed and reliability are predicated on continuous technical refinement rather than long-term ossification.

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, Yakovenko even suggested a future where the Solana network could leverage artificial intelligence to assist in its own development. He envisioned a model where network fees could be used to fund AI-assisted tools that write and improve the chain's codebase, ensuring a diverse and decentralized pool of contributors rather than a single development team. This forward-thinking approach aligns with Yakovenko's recent prediction that the stablecoin market will surpass 1 trillion dollars by 2026, a milestone he believes will be reached through the constant improvement of high-throughput networks. As Solana continues to integrate institutional real-world assets and tokenized equities, the co-founder's push for “more iterations” serves as a reminder that the chain's long-term success is far from guaranteed and requires a relentless commitment to outcompeting legacy financial systems. By promising that there will “always be a next version” of the protocol, Yakovenko is signaling to developers that Solana is not a static platform to be built upon, but a dynamic partner that will evolve in tandem with the cutting edge of global finance and decentralized technology.

        Share    

India's RBI wants BRICS to link CBDCs like the e-rupee and digital yuan by 2026, creating a shared rail for trade and tourism that bypasses dollar-based systems.

The Reserve Bank of India has proposed a plan to interconnect the central bank digital currencies of all BRICS nations to streamline cross-border trade and tourism through direct digital settlement.

The statement, reported in Reuters, states that India's central bank hopes to link other BRICS nations via a common digital currency. 

The RBI has recommended that the Indian government place the initiative on the formal agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, which India is scheduled to host later this year, the report stated. The proposal would mark the first coordinated effort to link sovereign digital currencies, including India's e-rupee and China's digital yuan, within a shared, multilateral framework, if adopted.

The proposal aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in international settlements, according to the RBI. By enabling direct payments in local CBDCs, BRICS members could settle trade and tourism flows without routing transactions through dollar-based correspondent banking systems. The central bank stated that such a system would improve efficiency by eliminating intermediaries, lowering settlement delays, and reducing transaction costs.

The proposal follows recent geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. RBI officials referenced recent tariff threats and criticism of BRICS from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has described the bloc as “anti-American,” according to the report. The central bank has positioned a shared CBDC infrastructure as a tool for economic resilience, allowing member states to insulate trade flows from external political pressure.

Implementation would require consensus on technical interoperability standards and governance rules across the member countries. The challenge has grown more complex as BRICS has expanded to include newer members such as the UAE, Iran, and Indonesia, the report noted.

One mechanism under discussion involves bilateral foreign-exchange swap lines between participating central banks to address potential trade imbalances, according to the RBI. The central bank continues to emphasize the e-rupee's role as a regulated alternative to private stablecoins, which it views as posing risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

As of January 2026, India's e-rupee has reached approximately 7 million retail users, while China is actively promoting international use of its digital yuan, according to the report. Brazil, Russia, and South Africa are all operating advanced CBDC pilot programs.

The RBI's proposal could become a foundational step toward a BRICS-wide digital settlement layer if endorsed at the 2026 summit, potentially reshaping how emerging economies conduct cross-border trade, the report stated.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed linking the official digital currencies of BRICS nations to make cross-border trade and tourism payments smoother, reported news agency Reuters, citing two officials familiar with the matter.

According to the report, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that the government place the proposal on the agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, which India will host later this year.

If accepted, it would mark the first formal attempt to link the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) of BRICS members, a move that could reduce dependence on the US dollar at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.

The BRICS grouping includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, along with newer members such as the UAE, Iran and Indonesia.

Any initiative to operationalise digital settlements among these nations is likely to draw scrutiny from Washington, especially as US President Donald Trump has previously labelled BRICS “anti-American” and threatened tariffs on member countries.

The RBI, the Indian government, and several BRICS central banks either declined to comment or said they had no information to share, the Reuters report added.

The proposal expands on a 2025 declaration at the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, which encouraged interoperability between members' payment systems to improve cross-border efficiency.

India has repeatedly spoken of its interest in linking the digital rupee with other nations' CBDCs to speed up cross-border settlements and support greater use of the Indian currency globally.

Although none of the BRICS members have fully launched their CBDCs, all five core economies are running pilots. India's e-rupee has gathered about seven million retail users since its introduction in December 2022, while China has been pushing for wider international use of its digital yuan.

The RBI has also enabled offline payments, programmability for government subsidies and fintech wallet integration to encourage adoption.

For BRICS currency linkages to work, a shared framework for technology, governance, and settlement of trade imbalances will be essential, one official told Reuters. Differences over which technology to use or which country's platform to rely on could slow progress, making consensus critical.

One option being explored involves bilateral foreign exchange swap lines between central banks to settle transactions on a weekly or monthly basis. This may help avoid the kind of imbalance that emerged when Russia accumulated large amounts of rupees after India imported Russian goods but could not offer equivalent exports in return.

The broader BRICS project has regained attention amid Trump's revived tariff threats and geopolitical realignments. India's ties with Russia and China have strengthened economically even as New Delhi faces trade frictions with Washington.

However, the bloc's effort to create a common BRICS currency has been shelved, and global enthusiasm for CBDCs has been tempered by the rapid spread of stablecoins.

Indian officials remain wary of stablecoins, which the RBI argues could undermine monetary stability and fragment the payments ecosystem. Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar recently said CBDCs offer a safer alternative because they avoid risks associated with privately issued digital tokens.

India's proposal to link BRICS digital currencies now sets the stage for what could become one of the most consequential financial discussions at this year's summit, potentially reshaping how emerging economies settle trade and challenge the dominance of the US dollar.- EndsPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Jan 19, 2026Tune InMust Watch ","{'href': 'https://www.indiatoday.in', 'title': 'India Today'}","cryptocurrency"

Increasing activity in a deep-brain region can boost the immune system's response to vaccines—and people can be trained to do it themselves using the power of brain scans and positive thinking, according to a new study published on Monday in Nature Medicine. The findings could help explain the so-called placebo effect.

Researchers trained 34 participants using a technique called neurofeedback. Just as someone can be trained to lower their heart rate by watching a heart monitor in real time, people can learn how to activate certain parts of their brain while lying in a brain scanner. “We open a sort of window into an unconscious neural activity,” says Nitzan Lubianiker, co-lead author of the study and a neuroscientist at Yale University.

Participants were encouraged to try different mental strategies such as thinking of a positive memory or focusing on their body. And through real-time feedback, they learned to activate reward pathways in two deep-brain structures called the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens.

Two other groups of participants were trained to activate different brain regions or received no training at all. All the participants then received the hepatitis B vaccine. Researchers measured their immune systems' response to the shot by checking the levels of hepatitis B antibodies in their blood two and four weeks later.

People who showed higher activity levels in their VTA had higher levels of antibodies in their blood. This suggests that the body mounted a stronger immune response when the VTA's reward pathways were activated. The study “is one of the first to show that activity in a specific human brain region can correlate with downstream antibody responses,” says Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at Harvard University, who wasn't involved in the research.

That said, there weren't significant differences in antibody levels between the group that got the neurofeedback training focused on reward regions of the brain and the groups that didn't. This may be because the nucleus accumbens, the other reward region that some participants learned to ramp up, didn't have the same connection to immune response, muddying the results.

Participants who focused on positive expectations while in the brain scanner were more able to increase activity in the VTA, while concentrating on happiness or pleasure more broadly did not have the same effect.

The result could indicate a potential connection with the placebo effect, a phenomenon whereby a sham intervention shows positive results in people who expect the treatment to benefit them.

“There has to be some kind of a biological mechanism that explains how, when we expect something positive to happen, actually something changes in our body,” Lubianiker says. And while this study did not explicitly test the placebo effect, it does suggest our mind is connected to our immune system.

“This result showed the power of positivity. They utilized very modern and comprehensive methods, but the result is very simple,” says Kyungdeok Kim of Washington University in St. Louis, who was not involved in the study but co-authored an accompanying article about the results.

Researchers are still working to understand how the connection between the brain's reward system and immune system works. Are brain signals transmitted to immune cells in the rest of the body via nerves, Chiu wonders, or some other mechanism?

It's possible that the connection has deep evolutionary origins, hypothesizes Tamar Koren, a neuroimmunologist at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and co-lead author of the study. Reward signals may have evolved to encourage us to seek out food and mating—both of which can expose us to dangerous pathogens. It makes sense that, when we experience a feeling of reward, “we will also boost our immune response towards something that is potentially harmful for us,” she says.

The lack of biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of asthma exacerbations remains a significant limitation to improving patient outcomes. To address this need, we analyze data from three asthma cohorts, combining up to 25 years of electronic medical records with sequential metabolomics studies, to develop and replicate a predictive model for asthma exacerbation risk. We identify asthma-associated biochemical pathways via global circulatory metabolomics and then apply targeted mass spectrometry methods to quantify selected steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites. The sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios robustly associate with 5-year exacerbation risk (discovery p value = 1.63×10⁻26-0.029; replication p value = 1.89×10⁻36-0.033). Based upon these findings, we derive and replicate a simple 5-year predictive model of asthma exacerbations using 21 sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios that outperforms current clinical measures (discovery AUC = 0.90; replication AUC = 0.89). These findings underscore the value of metabolomic profiling to develop a practical, cost-effective clinical assay for asthma exacerbation risk that may improve patient care.

Asthma exacerbations are a major health care burden and cause of disease morbidity, leading to progressive loss of lung function, airway remodeling, and enhanced disease severity1,2. The heterogeneity of asthma complicates identifying individuals at high risk for future exacerbations3,4, and there are no current clinical tests or biomarkers that effectively identify those at risk for asthma exacerbations5,6,7, making this a critical unmet need8,9,10.

Metabolomics studies have been successful in developing clinical biomarkers11,12,13,14 and have the distinct advantage of reflecting both acute and long-term environmental influences in the context of underlying genetic predisposition. To date, asthma metabolomics studies have identified disruptions in several metabolic pathways, including sphingolipids, steroids, and microbial-derived metabolites15,16,17,18,19, that characterize the overall disease state across a spectrum of symptoms. Despite this progress, limitations in current asthma metabolomics studies persist, including small sample size, lack of validation, incomplete capture of metabolites20, and failure to consider the heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, few studies have considered how metabolomics findings may be translated into clinical care. Metabolomics applications that characterize asthma heterogeneity and/or predict exacerbation risk may prove particularly useful for reducing the health burden and improving treatment efficacy.

For metabolomics studies to effectively transition into clinical applications, it is imperative to move beyond discovery metabolomics and perform targeted analyses that delve deeply into the disrupted metabolic pathways and interrogate the clinical applicability of the initial findings. Targeted assays aid in identifying candidate biomarkers by providing robust data with a high level of confidence in metabolite identity and are more appropriate for adaptation into clinical applications in terms of cost, reproducibility and overall feasibility. Despite the logical progression to move beyond discovery metabolomics, targeted studies for multiple diseases, including asthma, remain limited.21,22 Among the targeted assays that did build on discovery metabolomics, there are notable successes in the development of clinical assays, for example, the application of ceramide ratios to assess risk for cardiac events23. Validation of the metabolic pathways implicated to date in asthma, followed by further characterization of their overall impact on the disease—in particular their potential to predict exacerbation risk—is a necessary next step to understand how these findings may have clinical impact. When discovery metabolomics implicates multiple pathways for a disease, identifying the interrelationships between these pathways may bring a more complete understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms for biomarker development24. Evaluating the impact of cross-pathway metabolite ratios for asthma is compelling for several reasons. These measures are straightforward to calculate and have been successfully used to develop predictive disease biomarkers previously25. Metabolite ratios have the advantage of providing biological insights into the interplay between two metabolic processes and are analytically more robust.

The objective of this study was to build on the existing metabolomics literature to enable practical clinical translation in the context of real-life electronic medical records (EMRs). We utilized three well-characterized asthma cohorts, totaling 2513 participants, with up to 25 years of longitudinal data from EMRs and implemented discovery and independent replication across all stages of the study. We first validated the major dysregulated asthma pathways via discovery metabolomics. We then designed targeted assays to quantify the primary metabolites in the implicated pathways. We characterized the relationship between metabolites and multiple clinical traits for asthma and focused on the development and validation of a simple, cost-effective predictive biomarker panel to assess asthma exacerbation risk. In this process, we also used cross-pathway metabolite ratios to reflect the interrelationship of biological processes across metabolic pathways. This process established a framework that leverages global metabolomics followed by targeted assays to create a reliable and clinically relevant biomarker.

This study included three asthma cohorts: the Mass General Brigham Biobank–Karolinska Asthma Study (MGBB-KAS, n = 1040), Mass General Brigham Biobank-Asthma (MGBB-Asthma, n = 610), and Mass General Brigham Biobank-Longitudinal Lung Function (MGBB-LLF, n = 823; formerly Omic Determinants of Longitudinal Lung Function in Asthma [ODOLLFA]), totaling 2513 individuals (Fig. 1). Together, these cohorts represent a broad range of clinical and demographic characteristics common in adult asthma (Table 1.1, 1.2). The asthma cases in MGBB-KAS and MGBB-Asthma had moderate-to-severe disease, as indicated by elevated blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts, reduced pulmonary function, and higher IgE levels. Across both cohorts, patients exhibited varying patterns of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and oral corticosteroid (OCS) over the clinical course of disease, including the 5-year period after metabolomic profiling.

Discovery metabolomic profiling in the MGBB-KAS cohort identified 154 significant metabolite associations with asthma using a False Discovery Rate (FDR ≤ 0.05) correction for multiple testing. Of these metabolites, 46 replicated on a pathway level at nominal significance (p ≤ 0.05) in the MGBB-Asthma study, implicating eight metabolic pathways (Fig. 2, Supplemental Data 1). Significant asthma-associated metabolites included microbial–derived metabolites, involved in four metabolic pathways that have been previously reported: 1) creatine metabolism26,27; 2) glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism28,29,30; 3) methionine, cysteine, taurine metabolism31,32; and 4) tryptophan metabolism33,34,35,36. We observed an inverse relationship between asthma status and steroid metabolites while adjusting for ICS treatment, which was supported by extensive prior literature16,31,37,38. Sphingolipids were strongly associated with asthma in the MGBB-KAS cohort, and their role in asthma has been substantiated in prior studies18,19,39; however, they were not included in the older global metabolomics platforms used for the MGBB-Asthma cohort, which prevented internal validation of these associations. We also observed increases in amino sugar and mannose metabolites with asthma diagnosis; however, these pathways were less substantiated in prior studies26,40. When considering these results in conjunction with the asthma metabolomics literature15,16,18, we identified steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites for follow-up investigation via targeted assays.

These pathways were selected based on their significant metabolite associations using MGBB-KAS in the global profiling, further supported by our validation study (MGBB-Asthma) and prior literature.

We quantified 77 sphingolipids, 18 steroids, and 71 microbial-derived metabolites in serum samples from the MGBB-KAS cohort and observed 93 significant metabolite associations with asthma at an FDR ≤ 0.05 across six clinical measures related to asthma, including asthma diagnosis, pulmonary lung function, total serum IgE levels, and asthma exacerbations (Fig. 3, Supplemental Fig. 1.1, Supplemental Data 2). The strongest associations across all targeted assays were observed for asthma exacerbations: 29 sphingolipids and 17 microbial-derived metabolites were positively associated with exacerbations, while 7 steroids were negatively associated with exacerbations. Overall, androgen, glucocorticoid, and progestogen metabolites were inversely associated with asthma diagnosis and exacerbations and positively associated with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). In particular, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisone, and pregnenolone sulfate were associated with both asthma diagnosis (p value = 1.63 × 10−10, 5.33 × 10−9, 1.09 × 10−5, respectively) and decreased asthma exacerbations (p value = 3.11 × 10−8, 9.14 × 10−12, 7.22 × 10−5, respectively). While there were only a few significant microbial-derived metabolites associated with asthma (arginine: p value = 7.3 × 10−5; indol-3-propionate: p value = 3.4 × 10−6) and lung function (FVC: kynurenine, p value = 9.23 × 10−4; FEV1/FVC: betaine, p value = 2.87 × 10−4), 16 microbial-derived metabolites were associated with significant increases in exacerbations, including phenylacetylglycine, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenate, and quinolinate (p values = 6.66 × 10−10, 1.28 × 10−9, 8.67 × 10−9, and 3.69 × 10−8, respectively). Sphinganine-1-phosphate (sphinganine-1P) was positively associated with asthma (p value = 2.1 × 10−4). Many sphingolipid subclasses were associated with both increases in FEV1 and FVC; however, there were no associations with FEV1/FVC. Positive associations were observed with exacerbations across all sphingolipid classes, with Cer(d18:1/20:1), lactosylceramide(d18:1/14:0) (LacCer), and sphingomyelin(d18:1/14:0) (SM) exhibiting the most pronounced associations (p values = 2.48 × 10−6, 3.59 × 10−6, and 2.78 × 10−6, respectively). To further explore whether these associations were influenced by sex, we conducted sex-stratified analyses and present the results in Supplemental Data 3. We observed that males and females often exhibited distinct sets of significant metabolites for the same asthma phenotypes. In cases where overlapping metabolites were identified across sexes, the directions of association (β coefficients) were consistent, suggesting shared biological mechanisms despite potential sex-specific sensitivity. These findings indicate that while metabolite associations may vary by sex, the core directional relationships remain stable.

Two-sided t tests for β = 0 are reported with test statistic t(df) = value, and exact P values are reported in Supplemental Data 3. The significance levels of the metabolite ratio regression analyses were FDR ≤ 0.05. The black metabolites represent those with p value ≤ 0.05 in the regression model, while the red metabolites indicate those with FDR ≤ 0.05 in the regression model.

We observed a marked elevation in the percentage of significant associations between asthma traits and metabolite ratios compared to individual metabolites (Fig. 3, Supplemental Fig. 1.2, Supplemental Data 4). We assessed the associations with asthma traits and 3898 sphingolipid to microbial-derived metabolite ratios (sphingolipid:microbial), 794 microbial-derived to steroid metabolite ratios (microbial:steroid), and 1248 sphingolipid to steroid ratios (sphingolipid:steroid). The overall association patterns identified consistent relationships between ratios of specific metabolite subclasses and asthma traits, either displaying strong overall significance or no significance at all (Fig. 4A, B). Thousands of associations between ratios and asthma traits were found to be FDR significant. The strongest associations among these were between asthma exacerbations and sphingolipid:steroid ratios, where 59.9% of these ratios tested were FDR significant. Ceramide/sphingomyelin to DHEAS ratios had the strongest associations with asthma exacerbations (p value = 1.63 × 10−26 – 1.63 × 10−22); however, significance with exacerbations was observed across a broad range of sphingolipid and steroid subclasses (Figs. 3 and  4). The ratios of multiple sphingolipids to DHEAS were also associated with asthma diagnosis (p value = 3.86 × 10−16 – 8.56 × 10−14), while ratios between ceramides/sphingomyelins and estrone/deoxycorticosterone were negatively associated with log(IgE). These findings are biologically plausible given that sphingolipids, especially ceramides, are known to modulate steroidogenesis through the regulation of steroidogenic gene expression and intracellular signaling. Alterations in sphingolipid:steroid ratios may reflect imbalances in hormonal regulation and lipid signaling, both of which are critical in the inflammatory and immune processes underlying asthma.

There were 873 FDR-significant associations between microbial:steroid ratios and asthma traits. The strongest microbial:steroid ratios were observed with asthma exacerbations (p values = 1.20 × 10−23 – 1.55 × 10−17), with DHEAS in the denominator, whereas a broader range of metabolite ratios were associated with asthma diagnosis (p values = 2.37 × 10−13 – 1.79 × 10−10), FEV1, FVC, and log(IgE) levels. There were 1603 FDR-significant associations between sphingolipid:microbial ratios and asthma traits. Specific metabolite subclasses were associated with asthma diagnosis (e.g., sphingosines, sphinganines, serotonin, indole-3-propionate), FEV1 (e.g., ceramides, sphingomyelins, kynurenine), FVC (e.g., sphingomyelins, quinolinate), and asthma exacerbations (e.g., ceramides, methylobutyrate, isobutyrate); however, there were no significant associations with FEV1/FVC or log(IgE).

The significant metabolite ratio associations were independently replicated using the MGBB-LLF cohort (Supplemental Data 5). Similar association patterns were observed across both cohorts between clinical measures and pathway-level metabolite ratios. In both cohorts, the largest proportion of significant metabolite ratios was associated with asthma exacerbations, whereas a relatively small proportion of metabolite ratios was associated with lung function and log(IgE). The most significant metabolite ratios in MGBB-KAS replicated in MGBB-LLF, identifying ratios of specific metabolites and/or metabolite subclasses associated with distinct asthma traits: 1) Exacerbations: ceramides, sphingomyelin, DHEAS, isobutyrate; 2) FEV1 and FVC: ceramides, sphingomyelins, kynurenine, quinolinate, and testosterone; and 3) log(IgE): ceramides, deoxycorticosterone, indoles, and estrone.

In both MGBB-KAS and MGBB-LLF, the highest proportion of FDR-significant associations was between 5-year incident and prevalent exacerbations and sphingolipid:steroid ratios. Manhattan plots of the exacerbations to sphingolipid:steroid ratios associations demonstrated that replication was consistent across the same subclasses of sphingolipid:steroid ratios in MGBB-LLF, with stronger overall statistical significance. Association p values in both cohorts ranged between 1.0 × 10−30–1.0 × 10−10 and were as low 1.39 × 10−36 in MGBB-LLF (Fig. 4C). Both cohorts showed the strongest associations for ratios with androgens, followed by glucocorticoids and progestogens. Significant ratios included multiple sphingolipid subclasses and were particularly elevated for those involving DHEAS, pregnenolone sulfate, androstenedione, cortisone, cortisol, and corticosterone in both cohorts. Further interrogation between asthma exacerbations and the sphingolipid:steroid ratios found that overall significance was driven by the combined impact of both the numerator and denominator of the metabolite ratios, rather than being driven by either the denominator or numerator alone (Supplemental Fig. 2). Associations were not driven by outliers in the ratio distributions (Supplemental Fig. 4) and were more correlated with distinct clusters of the sphingolipid:steroid ratios and correlated with specific sphingolipid and/or steroid metabolites (Supplemental Fig. 3). Results were robust to various covariate adjustments.

To assess whether sphingolipid:steroid ratios can improve upon current clinical metrics in predicting exacerbations, we first evaluated the associations between clinical metrics available in the EMR and incident exacerbations. Despite nominal associations between higher neutrophil counts and exacerbators in the MGBB-KAS cohort (p = 0.028) and lower FVC among exacerbators in the MGBB-LLF cohort (p = 0.049), no clinical measures differed significantly between exacerbators and non-exacerbators across both cohorts (Fig. 5A). This suggests that current clinical characteristics alone are insufficient to distinguish which individuals will experience an asthma exacerbation in the next five years. We then assessed the value of including sphingolipid:steroid ratios to predict incident exacerbations alone and when used in combination with clinical measures.

Curves show cumulative incidence = 1−Kaplan–Meier S(t) for strata Q1 and Q4. The center is the estimated cumulative incidence; shaded ribbons denote 95% pointwise confidence intervals.

Using elastic net regression, the feature selection retained 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios in the predictive model for incident exacerbations. Individual Cox models of all 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios were significant and able to differentiate time until the first asthma exacerbation between exacerbation prone (Q1) and non-exacerbation prone (Q4) individuals in MGBB-KAS (Fig. 5C). The difference in mean days to the first exacerbation between the two groups varied across the sphingolipid:steroid ratio, with most differences exceeding 100 days. Ratios with cortisone in the denominator, including Cer(d18:1/20:1):cortisone, HexCer(d18:1/24:1):cortisone, Sphinganine(d18:0):cortisone, and SM(d18:1/20:0):cortisone showed the strongest differentiations, with mean differences ranging from 265 to 366 days in the time until first exacerbation between the two groups (p value range = 2.50 × 10−12 – .02 × 10−9). When the metabolite ratios were available, we evaluated these associations in MGBB-LLF and identified that the biggest differences in the time until exacerbations were with ratios where DHEAS is in the denominator (p value range = 9.98 × 10−12 – 7.3 × 10−7), replicating these findings in MGBB-KAS. Ratios with cortisone did not replicate our findings in MGBB-KAS (Supplemental Fig. 5).

The prediction models that included the 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios had the greatest predictive accuracy when compared with other clinical and baseline variables. The best predictive accuracy for 5-year incident asthma exacerbations, including 21 sphingolipid:steroid ratios serum IgE level, and baseline variables (race, ICS medication), achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.901 (Supplemental Data 6). This predictive accuracy was validated in the MGBB-LLF cohort with a similar AUC of 0.893, despite the unavailability of 11-deoxycortisol in the MGBB-LLF cohort, which reduced the number of ratios to 16. In the predictive model, we included only individuals with complete data for selected input variables. Participants with missing values for candidate predictors (such as FEV1, IgE, or eosinophils) were excluded whenever these variables were part of model training (Table 2 summarizes missingness). When serum IgE was excluded from the model, the predictive model remained robust, with AUC values of 0.793 in MGBB-KAS and 0.724 in MGBB-LLF, indicating that the sphingolipid:steroid ratios alone have excellent predictive power. Recognizing the potential for selection bias when restricting the prediction modeling to asthma cases with specific asthma measures (e.g., IgE levels, FEV1, eosinophils, etc.), we conducted additional analyses to evaluate how these patterns of missingness might impact our study conclusions. Specifically, we evaluated how other clinical characteristics of asthma cases may vary when IgE and/or FEV1 measures were missing. We found no significant differences in other asthma-related measures, such as eosinophil and neutrophil counts/percentage, lung function, between cases with and without these data. These findings suggest that missingness in IgE and/or FEV1 in the use of asthma cases is unlikely to introduce systematic bias, and therefore is unlikely to affect the development of the prediction model.

In comparison, the baseline model of race and ICS medication achieved an AUC of 0.498. To further evaluate the predictive contribution of prior exacerbation history and traditional clinical markers, we constructed additional models incorporating OCS prescriptions, FEV1, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Prior exacerbation history (baseline model plus OCS prescriptions history) alone achieved an AUC of 0.726 in MGBB-KAS and 0.781 in MGBB-LLF. Including metabolite ratios alongside prior exacerbation history (Race, ICS, OCS, metabolite ratios) further improved the AUC to 0.845 and 0.844, respectively. Similarly, adding FEV1 to the race and ICS baseline model modestly improved prediction (AUC = 0.610–0.588), and combining FEV1 with metabolite ratios (Race, ICS, FEV1, metabolite ratios) achieved an AUC of 0.809 in MGBB-KAS and 0.733 in MGBB-LLF.

In parallel, we constructed models incorporating eosinophils and neutrophils alongside metabolite ratios. These models resulted in lower AUC values (e.g., 0.795) compared to those that included IgE (AUC = 0.901), as shown in Supplementary Data 7. Models including only clinical markers (eosinophils, neutrophils, FEV1, or IgE without metabolite ratios) performed worse (AUC range: 0.515 to 0.654), all substantially lower than those incorporating metabolite ratios (Fig. 5B). These findings demonstrate that while blood eosinophils, FEV1, and prior exacerbation history are clinically informative, combining sphingolipid:steroid metabolite ratios with selected clinical variables yields the highest predictive accuracy for asthma exacerbations in our cohort.

Using three large asthma cohorts with up to 25 years of EMRs, this study moves beyond global metabolomics profiling by following up primary findings with targeted assays to develop and validate an accurate predictive biomarker for 5-year incident asthma exacerbation. Throughout this process, we validated key metabolic pathways for asthma and characterized the relationship between metabolites and metabolite ratios with a spectrum of asthma traits. Our findings reinforce the important role of steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites in asthma and identify reproducible relationships between distinct metabolite ratios and specific asthma traits. The strongest relationship was between sphingolipid:steroid ratios and exacerbations, where single ratios could differentiate high and low exacerbation proneness by up to one year. Based on these ratios, we constructed a validated predictive model for asthma exacerbations incorporating only 12 sphingolipids and 4 steroids, which outperformed conventional clinical predictors—including prior exacerbation history, FEV₁, eosinophil count, and IgE level—in both discovery and replication cohorts. The simple prediction models for exacerbations developed here offer cost-efficiency, increased accuracy, and straightforward implementation, suggesting a viable option for clinical assay development that may be useful in improving asthma treatment efficacy.

After validating asthma-association metabolic pathways via global metabolomics, we selected steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites for detailed investigation using targeted assays, ultimately focusing on the relationship between steroid and sphingolipid metabolism and 5-year asthma exacerbation risk. Sphingolipids and steroids have independently demonstrated important roles in asthma. Low ceramide levels in utero and early life have been linked to abnormal lung development and asthma41,42. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, evidence suggests that environmental triggers, including allergens and infections, induce sphingolipid signaling and mast cell activation to instigate inflammation during asthma exacerbations43,44. Genetic studies have also shown that ORMDL3 polymorphisms, which inhibit serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and regulate sphingolipid homeostasis, contribute to asthma45. These findings demonstrate that sphingolipids play a complex, multifactorial role in asthma, yet more remains to be explored. The primary mechanisms of steroidogenesis are better understood and form the basis for corticosteroid treatment in asthma. Steroid deficiencies lead to increases in inflammation in the lung and are a risk factor for asthma exacerbations that start in utero and persist over the life course46,47,48. While ICS treatment effectively reduces lung inflammation and is efficacious for asthma control, evidence suggests that prolonged ICS treatment may suppress adrenal function, further exacerbating the underlying physiologic state16. The inherent link between endogenous steroid production and exogenous steroid treatment, therefore, complicates its role in the disease process. Nevertheless, this makes steroid metabolism an ideal candidate for optimizing asthma control.

While we observed associations between asthma exacerbations and both sphingolipids and steroids, the associations and prediction accuracy were vastly improved with sphingolipid:steroid ratios. Importantly, the significant exacerbation associations replicated consistently across subclasses of sphingolipid:steroid ratios, with the most pronounced associations replicating for androgens, followed by glucocorticoid and progestogen species with that respective order across both cohorts.

The use of metabolite ratios enables us to capture relative imbalances between metabolic pathways, offering insights that may not be apparent from individual metabolite levels alone. In asthma, where inflammatory lipid signaling and endocrine function are closely intertwined, sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios may reflect meaningful shifts in these biological processes. The strong associations between sphingolipid:steroid ratios and asthma exacerbations are further supported by the established interrelationship between these metabolite classes. Multiple sphingolipid species act as secondary modulators/regulators of steroidogenesis49,50,51, with distinct cellular functions that include regulating steroidogenic gene transcription52,53,54 and acting as both intracellular second messengers55,56 and extracellular paracrine/autocrine regulators57,58,59. Ceramides—produced through either de novo synthesis or via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin - serve as the precursor to all sphingolipids and, therefore, play a particularly important role in sphingolipid metabolism. Ceramides are powerful in steroidogenesis because they can both directly and indirectly modulate steroid hormone production through their metabolism into other bioactive sphingolipids. Ceramides also act directly to suppress androgens and progestogens, further validating why these ratios may be clinically relevant60. Our findings broadly substantiate these mechanistic studies with particularly strong associations observed between ratios of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and Hex/Lac ceramide species to androgen, glucocorticoid, and progestogen species.

Even single sphingolipid:steroid ratios demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability with direct clinical relevance, with single ratios effectively differentiating high and low exacerbators by as much as one year, highlighting the potential importance of this approach for clinical applications. While steroid regulation is important in asthma, the suppression of steroids is likely both a part of the disease etiology and a consequence of long-term ICS treatment. Yet, there is more to learn about how this pathway may impact asthma and its treatment. The relationship with the sphingolipids provides a new angle for how we might understand their impact. While individuals who have the same levels of specific steroids overall, when examined in combination with sphingolipids, some individuals are at much higher risk of an exacerbation, while others remain at low risk. This phenomenon sheds new light on steroids overall, where we can accurately discriminate between two people with similar cortisone or DHEAS levels into low and high-risk groups. This work suggests that the interaction between sphingolipids and steroids, rather than their isolated effects, may play a pivotal role in more fully understanding the condition and suggests that increased study into the interaction of these pathways is merited. While metabolomics research has primarily focused on the dysregulation of metabolites within a pathway, the interrelation between dysregulated pathways - captured in metabolite ratios—may be a crucial metric to describe disease-specific perturbations.

Much of the progress with metabolite ratios to date has focused on alterations within a given metabolic pathway, while a relatively limited amount of epidemiological research has explored the relationship between metabolites across pathways. The use of within-pathway ratios, such as ceramide ratios for cardiovascular disease (CVD)61, kynurenine:tryptophan ratio for cancers62 and CVD63, and various lipid ratios for CVD64 haas marked some of the substantial advancements toward clinical translation. While between-pathway relationships are less well-studied, the approach we implemented here, by first limiting the metabolite ratios to metabolites from select pathways that are implicated in asthma, offers an initial approach to limiting the total number of ratios. Additional mechanistic work, such as what has been described, the interdependence between sphingolipids, steroids, and specific microbial-derived metabolites provides another approach to identify biologically relevant metabolite ratios65,66,67 that then may be studied further via targeted assays. However, the process of translating these findings into a clinical assay requires that the selected metabolites be vetted as viable candidates for clinical use. Sphingolipid:steroid ratios are not only predictive but would be relatively straightforward to implement into a clinical setting. These molecules are readily amenable to clinical assay development because they are abundant, stable, and the analytical methods for their quantification are relatively straightforward and inexpensive. If these ratios can accurately predict exacerbation risk within the next 6 months, that would enable the implementation of preventative measures to protect against an exacerbation. In addition, these ratios may identify those asthmatics who have poorly controlled asthma as demonstrated by increased numbers/frequency of exacerbation, suggesting that they should receive alternative treatment (e.g., biologics).

In addition to the finding between spinngolipid:steroid ratios and exacerbations, the distinct patterns observed between specific metabolite ratios and other asthma traits offer several viable findings for follow-up. Specific ratios, such as ceramide/sphingomyelin to kynurenine/quinolinate, were strongly associated with lung function measures, but not other asthma traits. The phenotypic specificity between key metabolite ratios and specific clinical outcomes may also be important for understanding the biological mechanisms of asthma. Prior metabolomic studies have identified strong comorbidity across disease phenotypes68; however, there is a lack of specificity between metabolites and specific clinical outcomes. The specificity observed in the ratio associations suggests that these may serve as potential biomarkers for specific clinical outcomes.

The current study has several limitations. First, the discovery metabolomics analyses conducted in the MGBB-KAS and MGBB-Asthma cohorts were performed using different platforms, resulting in discrepancies in metabolite annotations. Consequently, the validation of global association findings was performed at the sub-pathway level rather than at the level of individual metabolites. While targeted assays were applied in the MGBB-KAS cohort, the validation process in the MGBB-LLF cohort relied on global metabolomics data, which meant that not every metabolite or ratio identified in MGBB-KAS could be directly replicated in MGBB-LLF. This limitation underlines the challenges of cross-platform metabolomics analysis and highlights the importance of using targeted assays for validation, because they offer greater reproducibility and comparability across studies and laboratories69. Further follow-up work can focus on additional targeted assays covering other metabolic pathways. Second, while asthma clinical phenotypes used in this study were extracted from the EMR data, it is essential to recognize that real-world data, such as EMRs, might not match the quality of data derived from clinical studies or surveys. This discrepancy arises because EMRs are primarily tailored for clinical care rather than research. To address EMR-related concerns, we enhanced data reliability by calculating median laboratory test values over a five-year period around the data collection date, ensuring a robust dataset for our analysis. Our study utilizes EMR data from adult populations, which captures typical clinical practice. In our cohorts, IgE results were heterogeneously captured, leading to substantial missingness. Despite this, our analyses indicate that such missingness does not introduce meaningful bias into our predictive model. Moreover, the addition of IgE measurements significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of our model, suggesting IgE may reflect key physiological mechanisms underlying exacerbation susceptibility. Pending further validation, our results advocate for the regular assessment of IgE in adults with asthma to improve overall disease management. Additionally, while we used OCS prescriptions as a proxy for asthma exacerbations, we acknowledge that OCS may be prescribed for conditions unrelated to asthma. To assess the validity of this proxy, we conducted a correlation analysis between OCS prescription count and documented asthma exacerbation diagnoses in the EMR, which yielded a moderate-to-strong correlation (r = 0.573). This suggests reasonable specificity in our definition, although we recognize the need for future studies with more granular, temporally linked clinical data to further validate this endpoint. Furthermore, we observed variations in sample characteristics across the three cohorts, with the MGBB-KAS cohort utilizing serum for metabolomics measurements, in contrast to plasma used in the other cohorts. The strong validation suggested that our findings were robust to these cohort and matrix differences. Last, the study considered the impact of ICS treatment on steroid levels by adjusting the analytical model for ICS usage, addressing potential confounding effects and ensuring the validity of our results. Although faced with these constraints, we demonstrated robust replication of our findings. The use of targeted assays provided biochemical insights that were instrumental in refining disease prediction models and enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying asthma and its diverse manifestations. These findings underscore the potential of metabolomics as a pivotal tool in the advancement of precision medicine. Moving forward, the next step will involve further refining these predictive models by incorporating additional asthma-related features, which will be crucial for enhancing the precision and application of metabolomics in precision medicine.

As we move toward precision medicine, there is a need to translate the findings from large-scale omics studies into viable clinical biomarkers. This study focuses on bridging the gap to translation by focusing on asthma exacerbations, which comprise a major portion of the overall disease burden. We used the findings from global metabolomics to develop targeted assays that quantified select steroids, sphingolipids, and microbial-derived metabolites. We then developed a 5-year predictive model for asthma exacerbation risk using 21 sphingolipid-to-steroid ratios with high predictive accuracy that outperforms current clinical measures (discovery AUC = 0.90; replication AUC = 0.89). These findings underscore the value of metabolomics profiling and metabolite ratios to develop a practical, cost-effective clinical assay for asthma exacerbation risk that may improve patient care. Metabolite ratios have the potential to add to the predictive space and further inform us about biological mechanisms that contribute to important clinical outcomes.

The overall goal of this study was to develop an accurate predictive model of exacerbations using global metabolomics profiling followed by selected targeted assays across three asthma cohorts (n = 2513) (Fig. 1). The study design includes three stages: 1) Stage 1: Discovery metabolomics to identify asthma metabolic pathways related to asthma; 2) Stage II: Targeted assays for follow-up study and identification of top metabolites and metabolite ratios associated with asthma; 3) Stage III: Predictive model development for 5-year asthma exacerbation risk (Fig. 1). Stage I employed two case-control studies, MGBB-KAS (n = 1080) and MGBB-Asthma, n = 610), with discovery circulatory metabolomics profiling to identify and validate top metabolite pathways associated with asthma. Combining these findings with existing metabolomics literature, top pathways were identified for further study via targeted assays. In Stage II, three targeted assays were developed to quantify 166 selected steroid, sphingolipid, and microbial-derived metabolites across the top pathways. Using asthma cases from two studies, MGBB-KAS and the MGBB-LLF (n = 823), the relationship between targeted metabolites and their ratios with asthma traits was evaluated to identify the strongest candidates for prediction modeling. In Stage III, a 5-year prediction model for asthma exacerbation risk was developed and compared with the performance of current clinical measures.

The MGBB (https://biobank.partners.org) resulted from a project led by MGB (formerly known as Partners HealthCare) in which DNA, plasma, and serum samples were connected to clinical data from the EMR obtained from over 125,000 consented patients as of June 2021. Informed consent was obtained in written form from all participants. Patients involved in the biobank have provided consent through either in-person recruitment or electronic informed consent (eIC). Their involvement in the biobank allowed for blood sample data, EMR data, and survey data, including lifestyle, environmental, and family history information to be collected. The MGBB is linked with the MGB Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR), which stores EMR data on over 4.6 million patients in a SQL Server database, allowing researchers to query the RPDR through the MGBB Portal. The RPDR includes demographic data, diagnoses, procedures, medications, inpatient and outpatient encounter information, provider information, laboratory data, imaging and pathology data, and insurance information. EMR data are available from as early as 1999, and recruitment into the MGBB began in 2011. As such, individual participants may have up to 25 years of longitudinal EMR data, though the actual span varies by individual. For enrolled participants, extensive longitudinal EMR data, including relevant phenotypic information pertaining to asthma, can be extracted.

MGB worked with the Institutional Review Board (IRB: 2014P001109) for approval for this collection of biospecimen data and the use of human participants for research through both the MGBB and the RPDR. The information obtained is approved for use in all types of research on human health, including genomics, biomarker analyses, epidemiology, and cell line creation. In this study, three independent asthma studies selected individuals from the MGBB using distinct study designs. Clinical phenotypes related to asthma, including lung function measures (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC), blood differentials (eosinophil and neutrophil counts), IgE levels, ICS treatment, and asthma exacerbations defined via OCS treatments, were harmonized across all three cohorts. For some clinical phenotypes, such as lung function measures, blood differentials, and IgE levels, multiple values were often available per participant due to repeated clinical visits. To ensure temporal consistency with the metabolomics data, we selected the value closest in time to the serum sample collection date for each individual for analysis.

The MGBB-KAS is a matched case-control study of asthma from the MGBB, consisting of 540 asthma cases and 540 non-asthmatic controls. An individual with asthma was defined by all the following criteria: 1) an asthma diagnosis defined by the asthma prediction algorithm70 in the RPDR (positive predictive value > 85%); 2) at least one oral steroid prescription or one inhaled steroid prescription (ICS of ICS/LABA ≥ 1). Control individuals were identified by the following: 1) no diagnosis of asthma (negative predictive value > 99%); 2) no ICS or OCS medications; 3) matched on age, sex, and self-reported race. All 1140 participants of MGBB-KAS were non-smokers and had serum samples available. Participants with missing serum collection dates and BMI information were excluded from subsequent analyses, along with their matched participants. As a result, 540 pairs of asthma cases and controls were included in the analyses (total n = 1080; Table 1).

The MGBB-Asthma is an independent asthma case-control study in MGBB16 with 287 asthma cases and 323 control cases (total n = 610; Table 1), with no overlap from the MGBB-KAS cohort. A validated phenotyping algorithm70 in the RPDR was used for asthma diagnosis and identified 287 individuals with asthma (positive predictive value > 85%) and 323 controls (negative predictive value > 99%) to generate the MGBB-Asthma population (total n  =  610 individuals; Table 1). Non-fasting plasma samples for the MGBB-Asthma cohort were collected between October 2010 and March 2017 and were stored immediately (within 4 hours) in a −80 °C freezer. Controls were randomly selected from the pool of individuals without asthma with available plasma samples.

The MGBB-LLF is also an independent MGBB cohort of 823 severe asthma cases, with no overlap from the MGBB-KAS and MGBB-Asthma cohorts. An individual with severe asthma was defined by all the following: 1) an asthma diagnosis defined by the asthma prediction algorithm70 based on the RPDR; 2) evidence of persistent disease activity, defined as at least three lung function assessments and/or ICS treatment in conjunction with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) testing. All participants of MGBB-LLF had available plasma samples and were non-smokers (total n = 823, Table 1).

Samples were assayed on three liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms (HILIC-positive, lipidomics-positive, and lipidomics-negative) using an Agilent QToF 6550 interfaced with a Rapid Resolution separation module. For data quality control (QC) and pre-processing, coefficients of variation (CV%) were first computed, and features with CV% ≥ 25% were removed. Missingness was calculated across each feature and each sample. Features missing ≥ 75% were also excluded. Missing values were imputed as half the minimum value across all samples for each feature. The resulting plots of principal component analysis (PCA) were examined, and the interquartile range (IQR) and skewness of each feature were computed. All features were subsequently log-10 transformed and Pareto-scaled, and IQR and skewness were recalculated after transformation. PCA was performed again, and the distribution of PCs according to demographic variables was examined. After QC, 2338 features from the HILIC-positive platform, 2672 features from the lipidomics-positive platform, and 1918 features from the lipidomics-negative platform were retained. Features with less than or equal to 30% missing were included in subsequent analyses (2317 from HILIC-positive, 2650 from lipidomics-positive, and 1885 from lipidomics-negative platforms). Metabolite annotations were assigned to features using the MS-DIAL software, resulting in 1902 metabolite identifications71,72. Unidentified features and xenobiotics were not included in further analysis. A detailed description of the data acquisition and the metabolite annotation workflow is provided in the supplemental material.

Untargeted global plasma metabolomics profiling was generated by Metabolon Inc. (Durham, North Carolina, USA). CV were measured in blinded QC samples randomly distributed among study samples. Batch variation was controlled for in the analysis. Sample preparation and global metabolomics profiling were performed according to methods described previously73,74,75. Metabolomic profiling was performed using four liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods that measure complementary sets of metabolite classes described previously: 1) Amines and polar metabolites that ionize in the positive ion mode; 2) Central metabolites and polar metabolites that ionize in the negative ion mode; 3) Polar and non-polar lipids; 4) Free fatty acids, bile acids, and metabolites of intermediate polarity. All reagents and columns for this project were purchased in bulk from a single lot, and all instruments were calibrated daily for mass resolution and mass accuracy.

Metabolite peaks were quantified using the AUC. Raw area counts for each metabolite in each sample were normalized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences by the median value for each run-day; therefore, the medians were set to 1.0 for each run. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of ~8,000 chemical standard entries that include retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and curated by visual inspection for QC using software developed at Metabolon, Inc.76. Identification of known chemical entities was based on comparison to metabolomic library entries of purified standards. Additional mass spectral entries were created for structurally unnamed biochemicals, which were identified by virtue of their recurrent nature. These compounds have the potential to be identified by future acquisition of a matching purified standard or by classical structural analysis. Missing metabolite values were imputed by replacement with half the minimum value for each metabolite in all samples. Metabolites with an IQRs of 0 were excluded from further analysis, with 904 metabolites remaining for the analysis. The remaining metabolites were subsequently log-10 transformed and Pareto-scaled.

The sphingolipid profiles were quantified in all serum samples of MGBB-KAS participants (N = 1080) using LC-MS/MS. Details of the sphingolipid profiling method can be found in previous studies18,77. A total of 77 sphingolipids were reported, of which 42 were quantified using external calibration curves. The 35 remaining sphingolipids were identified based on the predicted retention time for the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transition. For these 36 compounds, a pseudo-quantitation was performed based on compounds sharing similar structures and internal standards. Concentrations of sphingolipids were reported in nanomolar (nM). Two types of QC samples were included: QC of extraction and QC of injection. CV corresponding to each type of QC samples was calculated. Skewness of each sphingolipid was also calculated. The main sphingolipid subgroups included in this panel were dihydroceramides (dhCer), ceramides (Cer), ceramide-1-phosphates (Cer1P), sphingosines, sphingosine-1-phosphates (S1P), sphingomyelins (SM), hexosylceramides (HexCer), and lactosylceramides (LacCer), in addition to 3-ketosphinganine (3-KS), sphinganine, sphinganine-1-phosphate (Spa1P), and glucosylsphingosine. All sphingolipids had <7% missing values; thus, none were removed based on missing percentages. Sphingolipid concentrations were standardized (original value minus mean, then divided by standard deviation) to obtain effect estimates comparable among different sphingolipids.

A separate batch of serum samples from the same participants was sent to Precion Inc. for quantification of a panel of microbial-derived metabolites that included 71 metabolites in the following pathways: short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolism, dietary aromatic compounds, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, polyamine metabolism, trimethylamine N-oxide biosynthesis, secondary bile acid metabolism, histidine metabolism, and vitamin biosynthesis. The microbial-derived metabolites panel analysis consists of two extractions of serum sample aliquots (50 and 100 μl). The extracts are analyzed with three different LC-MS/MS methods for the 71 analytes of interest. The concentration of microbial-derived metabolites was reported in μg/mL. This targeted panel was developed by Precion Inc., which described it as a “Microbial Metabolite Panel”. While some metabolites are indeed microbially produced, others are of dietary or host origin. To improve clarity, we use the term “microbial-derived metabolites” throughout the manuscript, and a comprehensive list of all 71 profiled metabolites is provided in Supplemental Data 2. Fifty-one metabolites missing≤30% were included in subsequent analyses. Microbial-derived metabolites' concentrations were standardized (original value minus mean, then divided by standard deviation) to obtain effect estimates comparable among different metabolites.

A separate batch of serum samples from the same participants was sent to Precion Inc. for quantification of a steroid hormone panel, including 16 endogenous steroids in the following sub-pathways: androgens, estrogens, progestogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. The Comprehensive Steroid Hormone Panel utilizes 200 µl of serum or plasma, calibrated across analytes and conducted via three LC-MS/MS methods: Method 1 for aldosterone, estrone, and estradiol in ESI negative mode; Method 2 for non-conjugated steroids including prednisone and prednisolone in ESI positive mode; and Method 3 for steroid sulfates in ESI negative mode. Each method employs stable labeled internal standards for quantitation through linear regression analysis, with calibration and QC standards maintaining accuracy within ±15% of the nominal value and precision ≤10%. Steroid concentrations were standardized (original value minus mean, then divided by standard deviation) to obtain effect estimates comparable among different steroids.

We summarized the basic demographic characteristics of participants in MGBB-KAS, MGBB-Asthma, and MGBB-LLF, stratified by asthma status (Table 1). Additionally, Table 2 provides a summary of the clinical measures relevant to asthma cases in MGBB-KAS and MGBB-LLF.

We employed conditional logistic regression models using the clogit function from the survival R package to evaluate the associations between asthma status and individual metabolite features in the MGBB-KAS cohort, which followed a matched case-control framework. Matching was performed on age, race, and sex, and models were additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) values recorded closest to the serum collection date. To account for multiple testing, statistical significance was determined using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.

In the MGBB-Asthma cohort, we applied multivariable logistic regression models using the glm function (family = binomial) from the stats package, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and smoking status, to replicate the significant asthma finding in MGBB-KAS. A finding was deemed to replicate if (1) the observed effect size (odds ratio, OR) aligned in direction with the initial association and (2) the association's p value was < 0.05.

Using the global asthma metabolomics findings of the MGBB-KAS cohort and the scientific literature, we identified sphingolipid metabolism, steroid metabolism, and microbial-derived metabolites as priority pathways for further study. We expanded our study of these pathways through three targeted assays that quantified 77 sphingolipids, 71 microbial-derived metabolites, and 18 steroids. For these quantified metabolites, we used conditional logistic regression models implemented via the survival R package, accounting for the matched study design (matched on age, sex, and race). All participants were non-smokers, and BMI was included as an additional covariate to adjust for residual confounding. Additionally, we investigated the associations between targeted metabolites and asthma clinical measures among individuals with asthma. This investigation utilized multivariable linear (lm function, stats package) and Quasi-Poisson regression models (glm function with family = quasiposson) to evaluate various asthma clinical measures. Linear regression models focused on lung function measures such as FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, in addition to log(IgE). Quasi-Poisson models were employed to analyze the consumption of oral corticosteroids (OCS) over the past five years. The regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and race, ethnicity, BMI from the closest record to the serum collection date and the count of ICS use within the last five years. Specifically, for lung function measures (FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio), we additionally adjusted for height. Given the smaller number and higher reliability of targeted metabolites, we applied a more stringent FDR ≤ 0.05 threshold to correct for multiple testing and ensure higher specificity of the results.

In MGBB-KAS, the metabolite ratios were calculated using targeted metabolites from different panels, where the numerator and denominator originated from separate panels. The ratios were determined by dividing the raw concentration of one metabolite by another. Ratios were computed only when both the numerator and denominator metabolite values were available. Ratios with missing values of less than 30% were considered for further analyses. To ensure comparability and enhance model performance, all metabolite ratios were log₁₀-transformed prior to analysis. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this transformation improved model diagnostics, including residual normality and homoscedasticity, as shown in Supplemental Data 4. In this study, we focused on the ratio generated from three targeted panels (sphingolipids, microbial-derived metabolites, and steroids panels). These ratios consisted of three different varieties: sphingolipid/microbial-derived metabolite ratios (Sph/Microb, number of ratios = 3898), sphingolipid/steroid ratios (Sph/Str, number of ratios = 1248), and microbial-derived metabolites/steroid ratios (Microb/Str, number of ratios = 794). The same multivariable linear/Quasi-Poisson regression models were utilized to assess the association between log-transformed metabolite ratios with asthma and its phenotypes within asthma cases, where the number of participants varied for each metabolite ratio. To correct for multiple testing, we applied a stringent FDR significance threshold (FDR ≤ 0.05).

We extracted 62 sphingolipids, 46 steroids, and 118 microbial-derived metabolites to replicate our findings in the MGBB-LLF cohort. microbial-derived metabolites involved in the following pathways were selected: Phenylalanine Metabolism, Tyrosine Metabolism, Tryptophan Metabolism, Short-Chain Fatty Acid, Polyamine Metabolism, Secondary Bile Acid Metabolism, Carnitine Metabolism, and Histidine Metabolism. We calculated the ratios using raw values of these metabolites, ensuring the numerator and denominator were derived from the same three distinct categories as in MGBB-KAS. To ensure a normal distribution of the ratios, we applied a log10 transformation to all metabolite ratios. This process resulted in the generation of the same three varieties of ratios as identified in MGBB-KAS: Sphingolipid:microbial (number of ratios = 7316), sphingolipid:steroid (number of ratios = 2852), and microbial:steroid (number of ratios = 5428). To replicate the associations between metabolite ratios and asthma clinical measures, we employed regression models similar to those used in MGBB-KAS, adjusting for variables such as age, sex, race, and BMI (based on the closest record to the serum collection date), as well as ICS usage within the past five years. For lung function measures specifically, adjustments were also made for height. Additionally, we applied an FDR threshold of ≤ 0.05 in our statistical analysis.

In our study, the presence of asthma exacerbations was assessed through the utilization of OCS medication. Participants who had not used OCS medication in the past five years were considered not to have experienced prevalent asthma exacerbations. Conversely, those whose OCS medication usage was equal to or exceeded the average (7 OCS prescriptions) within the last five years were classified as having prevalent asthma exacerbations. This same threshold was used to identify cases of incident asthma exacerbation over the next five years.

The elastic net approach was employed to identify biomarkers indicative of asthma exacerbations in MGBB-KAS. In initial modeling, we included all FDR-significant metabolite ratios from both sphingolipid:steroid and microbial-derived metabolite:steroid classes to evaluate their combined predictive performance. After comparison, we subsequently focused on the sphingolipid:steroid ratios, which showed better performance and feasibility for assay development. Utilizing the glmnet R package, we trained binomial regression models for asthma exacerbations within the last 5 years on FDR-significant sphingolipid:steroid ratios alongside confounders such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI (based on the most recent record before serum collection), and ICS usage. To maximize the AUC, we set the alpha parameter to 0.6. Through 10-fold cross-validation, an optimal lambda was selected based on the alpha parameter. Demographic variables like sex, race, and ethnicity were encoded using one-hot encoding. Ultimately, only those features with a non-zero coefficient were chosen as significant for identifying prevalent asthma exacerbation. This model was then tested to predict asthma exacerbations in the next 5 years in MGBB-KAS. The performance of the model was assessed using the AUC value and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The model was subsequently validated in the independent MGBB-LLF cohort using mapped selected features from the logistic regression analysis.

To determine the discriminatory power of the single selected ratios for predicting incident asthma exacerbation, survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan–Meier estimator to compare survival times between incident asthma exacerbation or not based on the single selected ratio through the survfit function from the survival R package. The event of interest was defined as the time gap to the first OCS medication use after the sample collection date. To further investigate the relationship between the single selected ratio and the time to first OCS medication, a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted using the coxph function. The model included covariates such as age at collection, BMI, gender, race, ethnicity, and ICS usage in the past five years. The mean time to the first OCS medication after the sample collection date was also calculated for participants with and without asthma exacerbation, based on the single selected ratio.

All analyses are conducted in R version 4.1.278.

Ethical approval was obtained from the IRB (2014P001109) of Brigham and Women's Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. We ensured the inclusion of participants irrespective of gender, race, or socioeconomic status.

TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images. 

The product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.  

After learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.

The technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch. 

He hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,  

Bustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis. 

Bustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome. 

“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.  

The CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.  

Now with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies' next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health. 

“We're positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.

What happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you? 

That's not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user's inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors. 

“In the agent's mind, it's doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week's episode of Equity. “It's trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”

Meftah's example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom's AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. 

Misaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic's portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. 

Witness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI's fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.

“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren't going rogue, aren't deleting files, aren't doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. 

Meftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.

“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said. 

As to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there's room for many approaches.

Plenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.

Caccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.

“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn't easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat them?”

For his part, Caccia doesn't want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider. 

“CrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,” he said. “Someone comes through and stands next to the big guys…and we built Witness to do that from Day One.

And for the rest, `-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook` should already have most of the values that you set explicitely.

Realistically, most 'normal users' have PDF needs like these links and we as tech people can safely give these sites to non-technical people and have confidence their data isn't being stolen on remote dodgy servers (think gas / electricity bills, invoices, bank statements etc which is a PII gold pot).

reply

I have no confidence in any website, especially the one that claims to be local-only but can technically change on a whim of the developer once it starts getting enough traffic from users.OTOH, I trust 30+ years old software sitting on on my hard drive not to phone home on every keystroke.

You can do as you like, but I don't think this is a particularly good use of your time, even with AI doing the majority of the heavy lifting.I guess what I'm saying is that ""Swiss army knife multitool"" apps are one of the lowest hanging LLM fruits, so don't be too surprised when you find that the tree has been stripped clean.

It's just that there's zero effort put into them so they don't really offer anything of value.

I'd suggest you at least try and mitigate that by having the LLM do extensive e2e testing if you aren't interested in using your own product.

reply

It offers Word -> PDF conversion. Just for interest I tried it and it doesn't even get the simplest page right. It puts the filename into an header. The test page had 4 images, one svg, one pdf (from svg), and another variation of the first 2. The generated PDF only contains 2 of those images with wrong sizes. The later two are missing. So it's basically completely useless.The free of charge LibreOffice gives much better results with its own caveats.

I just don't want people to litter their heavily polished immaculately styled products that have so clearly bad user-interaction design. E2e testing and closing the loop on LLMs does seem to help here.Though I really would prefer people click around their own product for at least 5 minutes.

Also does Adobe have some kind of patent/copyright on PDF forms? I don't think I saw any free tools that can edit fillable fields / tables in PDFs. I don't see any mention of forms in the Suite section of your app either. Is it just stupidly difficult / annoying to implement ?

reply

Image-only PDFs (scans):
These are the hardest case. If a PDF is basically high-res images (like iPhone scans), browser-based tools have limits compared to ImageMagick, which has much finer control over resampling and JPEG compression. Ghostscript-style pipelines help, but ImageMagick often wins if you're willing to discard more detail. Improving this is on the roadmap, but it's genuinely tough in-browser.PDF forms:
Adobe doesn't own forms, but editable PDF forms are extremely complex and poorly standardized. Many free tools avoid true form editing because it's easy to break files. That's why I haven't enabled it yet—possible, just time-consuming and error-prone.

https://repo.autonoma.ca/?action=repo&repo=notanexus.git&vie...Basically, you drop a PDF onto your own web server. The web server serves up PDFs via PDF.js on the client. When the user highlights text to annotate it, the date, time, and text of all annotations in the document are pushed back to the server. As the author, when I reload the same PDF URL, I can add, review, modify, navigate through, or summarize the annotations just like a reader. Here's a screenshot with a funny comment one of my beta readers made:https://i.ibb.co/5gZMJ0qc/annotations.pngBeta readers wanted, see profile for contact!

So we built our own PDF scanner & editor — lightweight, privacy-first, and (hopefully) not annoying to use. No ads, no subscriptions. Most features are free — a couple of advanced tools require a one-time unlock. All core features run 100% offline with on-device processing.The main features are built for everyday workflows:Scan documents — auto edge detect, live corner adjust, batch multi-page
Fill and sign forms — reusable signatures, flatten for secure sharing
OCR text recognition — preserves layout, searchable PDFs or clean text export (supports 18 languages, e.g., English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, etc.)
Edit OCR-detected text — adjust or fix recognised text
Page tools — reorder, rotate, duplicate, delete, extract pages
Annotations and highlights — comments, text notes, custom watermarks
Folder organization — custom folders, drag-and-drop move/rename
Everything runs locally — no accounts, no tracking, no upload processing.
You can download an AI model to your device (one-time download — it stays cached), and then:- ask questions about a document
- summarise sections or chapters
- extract key points or data
- turn long documents into quick notes
- After the model is installed, all Chat PDF processing happens fully offline on your device.The app is free to download, and most features are free (scanning, OCR, signatures, annotations, editing, etc).We wanted to keep the essential tools free, and only charge once for a few advanced features.We also put together a YouTube playlist with short feature walkthroughs.You can find the app here: https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/pdf-master-scan-edit-sign/id67...We'd really appreciate feedback — especially on the Chat PDF feature (usefulness, speed, UX, edge cases, things it should do better). If you try it and have suggestions, we're actively improving the app based on user feedback.

However, before the courtesy of my company giving me a macos-enabled gear - I had to cope with PDFs using multiple apps on Windows and Linux. Recently I got there again and found out that PDF support is really weak in Linux, and the formerly award winning Acrobat Reader now looks slow and poor, trying to steal my data and occupy as much space as possible. Also Acrobat Reader reference browser for linux is killed now.Hence, the question. If everyone is using PDF, why there are no good, fast native tools? and... why are we even staying with PDF?

These online converters are immensely popular for a reason. They also used to do everything serverside and had ads all around which is obviously terrible security wise. So having WASM versions is much better.Since these are link away they are easy to send and save. I help self-host a podcast and you need very particular settings for the export of the audio file. Instead of cooking up some automated solution, editors have bookmark of this https://ffmpeg-online.vercel.app/ with all the ffmpeg settings correctly selected and they can do the final file themselves for both their preview and production.Compare that to having multiple people with multiple platforms having to install and learn to use some gui app.

There are already free PDF editors that can be downloaded and installed once forever. What I used most is Libreoffice Draw: it imports a PDF, edit it as if it were a file in its own format, export as PDF again. It's not the only choice. Firefox has had a vanilla PDF editor since last year: download a PDF or drag one inside the browser window, edit it, save it. It's enough to add a PNG of my signature and fill out forms.

Now, privacy, I love it! That ""normal people"" just store stuff in the cloud ""it's on my phone"", yeah ok, is one thing. It's another topic…But since Gmail came out and was all the rage in nerd circles, I am wondering why the people who understand the tech the most, are so eager to hand over their data to Big Tech and some other very questionable entities.Here's the thing in terms of money.If your app does put my data into the cloud, I am not going to use it. At all. Ever.If your app blesses me with a beautifully designed native GUI (or UI), instead of presenting itself in Electron slop to me, then I am already almost sold. Literally. I start to consider forking over some cash to you, dear developer of that beautifully designed, privacy respecting app.I do use my browser to browse the web. I am not interested in a ""secondary OS architecture"" where I have to play sys admin for a range of ""apps"" aka plugins. Neither Chrome plugins (I don't use Chromium based stuff.) nor Wordpress plugins, nor Emacs ""modes"" are going to replace well done native programs.You don't care enough about your project to provide a native program? Tells me, I shouldn't care either. Good buy.For a high school student who survives on an allowance, paying $39 for an app may be a bit much, but not for an adult with an income.Curation. A good maintained app store does all the ""sys admin"" stuff for me. No viruses, no weird installation procedures and so on.This is why that works. Hassle-free. Locally-run, native app, means beauty and privacy.I would pay for that. Happily. In fact, I have done so many times. The success of a plethora of developers with paid-for apps in the stores proves I am not the only one.And, btw, this is the distribution/commerce model that RMS always favoured. I quote RMS:> Since “free” refers to freedom, not to price, there is no contradiction between
selling copies and free software. In fact, the freedom to sell copies is crucial: collections of free software sold on CD-ROMs are important for the community, and selling them is an important way to raise funds for free software development. Therefore, a program that people are not free to include on these collections is not free software.This is basically the app-store model.And I would pay, for the above stated reasons and I would be inclined to gulp an even higher price if the package has the ""OSS inside"" sticker on it. For personal reasons, right?Then there is one last thing. I don't want to have to create an account somewhere just to test-drive your app. Or to use it fully, later on.Privacy means, I don't have to be online in order to use the software. The end.

Years ago, at Pumping Station One in Chicago, I watched someone struggle with the driving of multiple LEDs from an Arduino in his project. He wondered why the LEDs got dimmer when more than one was lit.I looked at the original schematic, and what he had built, and noticed a difference. The original design had a resistor on each LED, but he had decided that was a redundancy and refactored it to use a single LED instead. In the case of current flow, this meant the circuit still worked, but that current limiting that resistor provided now was shared across every active LED, leading to the progressive dimming as more LEDs were active.It turned out his background was in software, where the assumptions are much different as to what is important. Cutting out redundant code is an important skill.I saw it as a cognitive impedance mismatch being played out in real life.I assume the same is true for an LLM/AI attempting the same leap.

My project (https://phaestus.app/blog) takes a different approach: pre-validated circuit blocks on a fixed 12.7mm grid with standardized bus structures. The LLM picks which blocks you need and where they go, but the actual circuit design was done by humans and tested. No hallucinated resistor values, no creative interpretations of datasheets.It's the same insight that made software dependencies work. You don't ask ChatGPT to write you a JSON parser from scratch, you ask it which library to use. Hardware should work the same way.Still WIP and the block library needs expanding, but the constraint-based approach means outputs are manufacturable by construction rather than ""probably fine, let's see what catches fire.""

I don't want to detract from what you're building, but I'm puzzled by this sentence. It very much sounds like the problem is that they're bad at circuits and that you're working around this problem by making them choose from a catalog.Try that for code. ""The problem isn't that LLMs are bad at coding, it's that we're asking them to write new programs when they should be doing selection and integration"".

Module based design is cool for getting the prototype going but once you get into production you want to optimize everything so it falls apart quickly when you need to move the parts (not blocks, parts) to fit the least possible amount of space, cut components that could be shared (do 8 blocks on one board each with its own decoupling caps need entire set of them? Probably not). Fine for prototyping/hobby stuff/one off but falls apart quickly in production.Still, having working prototype quickly that can then be optimized in more traditional way can still be very valuable.> It's the same insight that made software dependencies work. You don't ask ChatGPT to write you a JSON parser from scratch, you ask it which library to use. Hardware should work the same way.hardware optimising gets you far more money faster than software, because the cost of software not being optimal is mostly cost on the consumer (burning more CPU than it would if it was optimized), while for hardware each chip less is more money left in your pocket and there are actual size constraints that can be pretty hard edged vs software's ""well the user will have to download extra MB more""

For example a part like the ADS7953 ADC comes with layout recommendations, including the design of the ground plane underneath the chip and the placement of the decoupling caps. A more extreme example would be an esp32 and all of it's supporting parts, including the keepout area on the PCB for wifi transmission.I really want to assemble circuits out of higher level primitives like that, drag and drop a chip and all of its supporting parts, including their layout and power connections.

My intent for phaestus isn't to design pcb's, it's to design entire products, and also to be friendly to non technical users who don't know what a PCB is, let alone do layout themselves.

For the time being, I'm erring away from feature creep, even though I really, really want to though! For the sorts of products I would like this to make for the time being, simple I2C, SPI and GPIO driven peripherals are the limit. I only have 2 more weeks, and then I want to have a working, battery powered device on my desk. PCB, Enclosure, Firmware, everything.Similarly, I haven't got a framework for anything mechatronic in the MCAD pipeline, so no moving parts (besides clickable buttons). Fixed devices are fine, like screens and connectors though.

It very much aligns with how I've approached hardware since I was 15 and had a massive stack of functional blocks of electronics circuitry that I would combine in all kinds of ways. I've lost the 3x5's, but I still work that way, build a simple block, test it, build another block, test that, hook the one to the other etc.

I know Ben is having some fun, perhaps making a valid point, with the burning component on the breadboard. I think it does underscore a difference between software vibing and hardware vibing—crash vs. fire.But in fact vibe-breadboarding has drawn me deeper into the electronics hobby. I have learned more about op-amps and analog computing in the past two months in large part thanks to Gemini and ChatGPT pointing the way.I know now about BAT54S Schottky diodes and how they can protect ADC inputs. I have found better ADC chips than the ones that come pre-soldered on most EDP32 dev boards (and have breadboarded them up with success). These were often problems I didn't know I should solve. (Problems that, for example, YouTube tutorials will disregard because they're demonstrating a constrained environment and are trying to keep it simple for beginners, I suppose.)To be sure I research what the LLMs propose, but now have the language and a better picture in my mind to know what to search for (how do I protect ADC inputs from over or under voltages?). (Hilariously too, I often end up on the EE Stack Exchange where there is often anything but a concise answer.)5V USB power, through-hole op-amp chips… I'm not too worried about burning my house down.

I can't think of any reason why you'd want to use Schottky diodes to protect op-amp inputs. They have high leakage currents and poor surge capabilities. Most op-amps have internal protection diodes, and if you need some extra ESD or overvoltage protection, a Schottky diode probably isn't the way.I'm not taking an anti-LLM view here. I think they are useful in some fields and are getting better. But in this particular instance, there's a breadth of excellent learning resources and the one you've chosen isn't good.

Depending on your setup: beware of your ground and realize that breadboards are an extremely bad fit for this sort of application. It's hard enough to get maximum performance out of a good DAC on a custom designed PCB, on a breadboard it can be a nightmare.

Exactly. I'm a life-long software guy, but I've dabbled in electronics at various times. But typically I'd hit walls that I just didn't know how to get past, and it wasn't easy to find solutions. If I'd had an LLM to help, I'm pretty sure I'd have become much more deeply involved in electronics.

reply

Other than that, it does useful circuit review, part selection (or suggestions for alternative parts you didn't know existed), and is usually usefully skeptical. It's also great at quick back of the napkin “can I just use a smt ceramic here?” Type calculations, especially handy for roughing out timings and that kind of thing.

The logical next step is to use metal, but that's outside of my hobby tools. I found that JLCPCB offered sheet metal fabrication but I had no experience with sheet metal designs.

I received the adapters last week and was really impressed by how nice they turned out.All of that to say, AI-assisted design is actually lowering the bar of entry for a whole lot of problems and I am quite happy about it.

I wonder if a SPICE skill would make LLMs safer and more useful in this area. I'm a complete EE newbie, and I am slowly working through The Art of Electronics to learn more. Being able to feed the LLM a circuit diagram—or better yet, a photo of a real circuit!—and have it guess at what it does and then simulate the results to check its work could be a great boon to hands-on learning.

The MVP was hand coded, leaned heavily on sympy, linear fits, and worked for simple circuits. The current PoC only falls back to sympy to invert equations, switches to GPR when convergence stalls, and use a robust differential evolution from scipy for combinatorial search.

This makes me a bit uncomfortable because of how close it comes to infringing on freedom of speech, and how specific a rule it would for search engines (and chat bots) - i.e. there's no real analogy of ""can't target trademarked terms"" for any ad format other than search engines.I think my preference would be to simply enforce laws around fraud. If you're a business and you intentionally mislead people, that's fraud, pure and simple. Bring the enforcement hammer down so that companies don't dare make an ad that granny might mistake for not being an ad. Make them err far on the side of making ads look unmistakably like ads for fear of ruinous fines.

It would require conflicts of interest to be disclosed clearly. I.e. labelling speech incentivized by someone else (ad buyer) clearly, as not organic speech (the search engine results).That is pro-transparency and ethics, not anti-speech.

A popular flight tracker is $60/year (or a $300 purchase). A flash card app costs the same. Apple's curated list of “essential utilities” includes a birthday countdown that costs $5/wk.I know every app will cost me hundreds over the span of just a few years for marginal utility so I simply stopped buying them.

For those that do, they won't get past scare wall #1 of enabling APKs and scare walls #2, #3, and #4 of downloading, installing, and enabling the app.Google knows this.Tyranny of defaults, trained user behaviors, ecosystem, scare tactics, and even SERPs manipulation to make this nigh undiscoverable.But they weren't content with some number of you slipping through the cracks! They're starting to close the ability to release unsigned and self-signed code. You can only imagine what's after that.

Now, what is left? iPads are great, MacBook with Apple silicon are unmatched in refinement, iPhones are awesome but getting a bit stale. Apple Watch is awesome, but for sports Garmin are better.  It is the integrated ecosystem with iCloud that makes the total system powerful.Where to go? I love Linux with CachyOS on my desktop. Anything similar for tablets and laptops? I think KDE has something like connect that aims to do what iCloud does.

Music.app is simply an ad for Apple Music, Books.app is like reading in a Barnes and Noble while someone from marketing looks over your shoulder and their TV app features their own shows to an overbearing degree — everything else is becoming more of an afterthought.

If you use iTunes Match or load your own MP3s every time you open the app the search field is set to “Apple Music” and the search fails until you toggle it, every time.Been like that for 2+ years

a bigger older problem is the number of copycat applications allowed in the app store.  for example the listing for the official microsoft authenticator app (free and used in many corporate environments) is surrounded by results with similar looking icons and titles.  these look a likes also work for MFA but charge a monthly subscription.  not exactly a scam since they do work, but its obvious they are only there to confuse users into paying for something thats free.

Apple's App Store ad initiatives have always been woeful, and doubt it makes enough revenue to warrant a separate line item on their public accounting reports.  Some executive has seen yet another overfunded company potentially making bank with an ad-based business model (OpenAI, et al.), and has thought they could extract Google-level ad revenue due to the App Store's exclusivity.  It could also be a response to potentially competing App Stores given their rocky relationship with the EU.It will have little effect, on revenue or user experience.  The greater tragedy is the organisational decay that led to this being greenlit in the first place.

I think the situation is a lot more stark than this. Unless they're desperate, the board of directors of corporations will install an MBA as CEO. In most cases, the only time this doesn't happen is at the founding of the company, when a founder is CEO. But if the founder doesn't maintain controlling interest, the founder can be replaced.The promotion of Steve Jobs to interim CEO of Apple in 1997 was a rare exception. Apple fired its CEO, and the company was in danger of bankruptcy. They were running out of options and feeling the aforemention desperation. Note how the situation was very different in 1985, when the board of directors chose John Sculley over Steve Jobs in a power struggle. At the time, they weren't financially desperate.

Frankly, Apple could have probably just totally replaced the App Store a long time ago if they were not slaves to financial reports by simply integrating app search into spotlight more closely or prominently… pull down, search “ai app” (or whatever) and you're provided with a list of app results that includes an install button.App updating could and should have been integrated into the settings app.These kinds of things will only increasingly start biting the Apple as Google has been forced to face the abyss of the death of the common search they've dominated for decades now. I don't think Apple has faced that existential Grim-reaper yet… what do you do when the app ecosystem, OS UI/UX advantages, and even hardware quality has vanished through the cascading integration of AI? I don't know that Apple has faced that yet or at least has been left blindsided, considering what I've been seeing from them.

Grab this awesomely cheap OLED monitor before it sells out


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


You don't need to pay an obscene amount to enjoy the benefits of a new OLED monitor, thanks to this awesome gaming monitor deal. The 26.5-inch Acer Predator X27U is on sale right now at Amazon, bringing the price down by 22% to a new record low.

That means you'll be paying just $429.99 for the Acer Predator X27U – if you're quick enough to buy it, that is. Our Acer Predator X27U review confirms just what a good option for gamers this is, grabbing a near-perfect 4.5-star score due to its stunning, impossible-to-resist picture quality.

First things first, if you're coming from an older LCD display, you'll be seeing (quite literally) a serious upgrade with a move to a QD-OLED panel like this one. Compared to LCD, OLED panels offer much higher peak brightness levels and much more vibrant color output. The end result is that big cinematic games, along with movies, will be great to watch on the X27U, especially HDR content, with this monitor offering HDR10 support. QD-OLED is the better of the two main OLED panel types, too, thanks to superior color volume and better power efficiency.

All-time low price 

This Acer Predator X27U display features a 26.5-inch QD-OLED panel with a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. A 240Hz refresh rate makes it a great option for fast-paced gaming, with AMD FreeSync support to deal with any screen tearing.

The Acer Predator X27U offers a max resolution of up to 2,560 x 1,440. 1440p gaming on an OLED is a serious step up over 1080p, while also remaining much less demanding for a mid-tier GPU to match. It has a fast 240Hz refresh rate to avoid messy motion blurring in any fast-paced games you play, with AMD FreeSync Premium support to eliminate screen tearing completely.

With two HDMI 2.1 and two DisplayPort 1.4 connections apiece, you're free to hook up your full kit to this monitor: PC, laptop, consoles, and handhelds will also work here. This is a budget-friendly OLED gaming monitor, but you're not seeing too many compromises on build quality, with a fully ergonomic stand that includes tilt, swivel, pivot, and height adjustments. You've also got two 3W speakers included, which, in a pinch, will help you get gaming without a suitable headset.

A $429.99 sale price makes this Acer Predator X27U gaming monitor one of the most approachable options for an OLED upgrade to your gaming setup. This price is a new record low, but don't expect it to stick around for too long.

To live long and healthy, studies suggest there are several lifestyle changes people can make to potentially extend their life. 

Not smoking, drinking less alcohol, managing stress, following a healthy diet, and moving more have been shown to help keep us feeling young and healthy as we grow older. 

Now a new study published in the journal The Lancet found tha just an extra 5 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day, or sitting 30 minutes less per day, could help prevent as much as 10% of deaths. 

For this study, researchers analyzed health data from previous studies, encompassing more than 150,000 adult participants from the United States, Sweden, Norway, and the United Kingdom. All selected studies included physical activity data collected through the use of devices. 

“We and many others have shown that higher levels of physical activity is beneficially associated with numerous health outcomes, quality of life and lower risk for premature mortality,” Ulf Ekelund, PhD, professor at the Oslo Research Centre for Physical Activity and Population Health in the Department of Sports Medicine at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Norway, and principal investigator of this study, told Medical News Today.

“However, it is unclear how small changes in physical activity and sedentary time might prevent the number of deaths in the population, given that all individuals increase their activity levels,” Ekelund pointed out. 

At the study's conclusion, the researcher said that adding in an extra 5 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day lowered the number of all deaths by 6% in the least active 20% of participants during an average 8-year follow-up.

“It means that in a population where 100,000 individuals die every year, 6,000 of these might be preventable by a five-minute increase in activity in the least active 20%,” he added. 

When researchers applied the 5-minute addition to the entire participant population, the possible prevention of deaths rose to 10%.

Researchers also examined how sitting less each day might help prevent deaths. They found that sitting 30 minutes less a day may prevent about 3% of deaths among the least active, and 7% across the whole participant population.

“If all in the population groups decreased their sitting by 30 minutes, 3,000 and 7,000 deaths might be prevented in a population with 100,000 deaths — this is close to the annual death rate in Sweden,” Ekelund said. 

“Small changes in physical activity and sedentary time might have profound health benefits in the population if all in the population adhere to these changes.”

– Ulf Ekelund, PhD

“We plan to examine the effects of small changes in daily steps on the potential number of deaths averted and possibly disease incidents,” he added. 

MNT had the opportunity to speak with Alyssa Lombardi, exercise physiologist for the GoodLife Fitness Program at Hartford HealthCare, about this study.

Lombardi, who was not involved in this research, commented that, as an exercise physiologist, her first reaction to the findings was “I love it.” 

“Getting people to move their bodies more in hopes it will make their daily activities easier and to help them live a longer and happier life is exactly what I preach every day,” she told us. “Movement is medicine, even just five minutes can really improve someone's physical and mental state.”

“Using movement as medicine can be a huge benefit for people,” Lombardi continued. “Even more so now as the boom of keeping things more natural is on the rise. More people now than ever are focusing on keeping nutrition natural and there are many people who would rather have lifestyle changes vs taking prescription medications. This research is even more important to back up these society changes.” 

“I would love to see a continuation of this study where they compare different forms of exercise on this theory,” Lombardi added. “Such as comparing running vs. Pilates and what could have a stronger outcome.”

MNT also spoke with Bert Mandelbaum, MD, sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and codirector of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles, CA, about this study. 

Mandelbaum, who was not involved in this research, explained that as we increase our lifespan and improve our healthspan, we are learning that we have what he calls “firmware” overriding our genes, and we're learning all the “switches” that we could turn on that are part of our adaptive DNA heritage.

“This manuscript really demonstrates the fact that the more you exercise, the more you're turning on the appropriate switches,” he continued. “And a lot of that has to do with, again, our ancient heritage of being predators. That the better physically fit you are as a predator, the more food you get, the better able you can reproduce, […] and so on.” 

Mandelbaum said this also helps improve what he calls “playspan” — when looking at a curved data model, this is the area measured by healthspan on the Y axis and lifespan on the X axis. 

“If people are living longer with disease and disability and are far down that Y axis, [that's] not so good,” he explained. “What we want is a greater area under the curve […] we now call ‘playspan,' which is measured on the Y [axis] healthspan, which is basically disability-free life, and lifespan is a number of years.” 

“So the better we're able to sustain fitness, the better we're able to eat, keep our nutrition good, the more load our bodies and our musculoskeletal systems can take, the better we can prevent injury, the further up that curve and the more area under the curve that we have. We call it a better ‘playspan' or preservation of performance.”

– Bert Mandelbaum, MD

Among adults aged 65 years or older, the high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) was associated with fewer cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and influenza hospitalisations than the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV), regardless of diabetes status.

""[The study] findings, while exploratory, underscore the importance of influenza vaccination and suggest potential benefit of HD-IIV compared with SD-IIV in individuals with diabetes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anne Bjerg Nielsen, MD, Copenhagen University Hospital-Herlev and Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on January 12, 2026, in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The DANFLU-2 trial was not powered for subgroup analyses; therefore, the findings were exploratory and hypothesis generating. The results should be interpreted in the context of the neutral primary outcome of hospitalisation for influenza or pneumonia. The duration of diabetes may have been underestimated because some participants could have been diagnosed earlier than the time windows used.

This study was funded by Sanofi. Three authors reported being employees of the funder; one author reported holding shares in Sanofi and another reported having stock options in Sanofi. Several authors reported receiving personal fees, grants, and travel support from various pharmaceutical companies, including Sanofi.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

As GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) such as Wegovy or Ozempic (semaglutide) become more widely used for weight loss, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) are taking regulatory action against inappropriate prescribing and advertising.

Healthcare practitioners have already been disciplined for prescribing or supplying weight-loss injectables to patients with disordered eating, a spokesperson for AHPRA told Medscape News Australia. “This [discipline] has included the imposition of conditions on their registration and issuing formal cautions,” said the spokesperson.

Some of the issues with prescribing GLP-1 RAs, which AHPRA continues to be notified about, include inadequate assessment, poor communication with other treating practitioners, and insufficient follow-up, the AHPRA spokesperson said.

AHPRA is concerned that some healthcare practitioners “may be failing to meet the standards of good practice” by working for healthcare services that provide “access to a predetermined medicine,” said the spokesperson. “This [practice] poses risks to patient safety that have the potential to cause significant harm.”

Dietitians are increasingly hearing that patients with complex relationships with food and body image are being prescribed GLP-1 RAs, Fiona Willer, AdvAPD, PhD, president of Dietitians Australia, told Medscape News Australia.

“Sometimes they're even pitched to them as a solution to their issues,” she said. “I've heard about long-recovered eating disorders reemerging with a vengeance. Anecdotally, we hear about people who have acquired the GLP-1 from a telehealth pill mill bragging about not having had anything to eat for days. It's the kind of worrying thing we see in pro-anorexia social media groups. Very dangerous.”

The TGA requested the removal of more than 3000 online ads that included weight-loss therapeutic goods in the 2024-2025 financial year and gave 10 infringement notices for the alleged unlawful advertising of prescription-only weight-loss medicines in September 2025. The TGA also issued social media guidelines in November 2025, partly in response to the unlawful advertising of prescription-only drugs such as Ozempic.

“There are concerning parallels between how these drugs are being marketed and the long-standing, often unscrupulous commercial weight-loss industry,” said Willer. Prescription weight-loss drugs “are powerful medications with real risks, not lifestyle products,” she said. “Pharmaceutical companies and medical providers should be held to a much higher standard than the broader weight-loss marketplace.”

GLP-1 RAs suppress appetite by mimicking the natural hormone GLP-1, which regulates digestion and hunger. Patients taking GLP-1 RAs reduce their total caloric intake by as much as 39%.

“If the only outcome we're chasing is kilograms lost, that can be mistakenly framed as success,” said Willer. “But nutritionally, this level of intake is extremely concerning. Inadequate nutrition increases the risk of muscle wasting, loss of bone density, and osteoporosis, and people can end up physically weaker and more vulnerable than when they started.”

It's against the law to market prescription medications directly to consumers in Australia, so some weight-loss services rely on a workaround; they allude to medical options or encourage people to speak to a doctor about their weight but do not name specific drugs.

Telehealth providers such as Juniper, Pilot, Moshy, and hub.health hint on their websites that a medication is part of their weight-loss service. Some offer patients a quick eligibility check, a virtual doctor consultation, and drug delivery as a package deal.

Eucalyptus, the umbrella company that runs Juniper and Pilot, recently faced scrutiny in the media for advertising discounted medical weight-loss services as part of a Black Friday sale. This kind of large-scale marketing campaign can reach vulnerable patients with eating disorders and should be regulated more heavily, Jane Rowan, the head of Eating Disorders Families Australia, told ABC News.

Meanwhile, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — pharmaceutical companies that manufacture GLP-1 RAs — have come under fire for their ad campaigns that raise awareness of weight as a health issue. Willer labeled these campaigns “unethical” in an interview with ABC News in October 2025.

“Ads like the Eli Lilly ‘We won't weight' campaign give the impression that this is a magic, effortless solution to weight gain,” Barbara Mintzes, PhD, professor of evidence-based pharmaceutical policy at the University of Sydney in Sydney, told Medscape News Australia.

GLP-1 RA manufacturers have also been behind a push to classify obesity as a disease rather than a risk factor. They have gained influence by making payments to Australian doctors via support for educational events, travel, and consultancies, said Mintzes.

“There are people who meet the BMI criteria for obesity and are also healthy, active, and vibrant,” said Mintzes. “The idea that they have a disease is presented by Eli Lilly as combatting stigma. But is this also creating more stigma in its own way, by representing obesity as a form of ill health?”

Aggressive advertising of GLP-1 RAs increases the risk for overprescribing, said Mintzes. Overprescribing can be dangerous for patients with eating disorders and can harm patients who experience the drugs' side effects without meaningful health benefits.

GLP-1 RAs aren't risk-free. They have been associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Researchers also have found a potential association between these medicines and increased risk for thyroid cancer.

Wegovy is likely to be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme soon for patients with cardiovascular disease and obesity, meaning that it will become cheaper to access for a subset of patients. But at present, all GLP-1 RAs used for weight loss in Australia are prescribed privately and cost patients thousands of dollars per year — and might need to be taken for life.

Demand for GLP-1 RAs has surged, with up to 239,000 Australians accessing the drugs privately each month. This booming market caused Eucalyptus to double its annual revenue to almost $250 million last year.

“During the last few years, we have seen quite a growth in consumers being curious about and actively using GLP-1s for weight loss,” Jo Root, acting CEO of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, which advocates for better healthcare, told Medscape News Australia.

“What this demand shows us is that there is an absolute need for Australia to have a national obesity strategy, which includes the role of GLP-1s and how consumers find out about them,” she added.

Australia's health ministers met in December to discuss the National Obesity Strategy, among other agenda items, but regulating the promotion of medical weight loss was not discussed.

“We shouldn't be leaving public health messaging to the people who are going to make a profit from it,” said Root. “We have seen a rise in social media influencers in this space doing paid sponsorships that sometimes aren't disclosed, which is concerning and should not be allowed to continue.

“Advertising in this area of health is aggressive and stigmatizing to a vulnerable group. This shouldn't be the standard we accept, and we want to see the government step in and become the custodian of reputable health information going to consumers about GLP-1s.”

Willer and Root reported having no relevant financial relationships. Mintzes reported being an expert witness on a legal case for the TGA.

 January 19, 2026  

Patients became aggressive towards pharmacy staff after changes to COVID-19 vaccine eligibility and failures in the national booking system allowed ineligible people to make appointments, according to a survey by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). 

The problems arose after the government narrowed eligibility for the autumn 2025 COVID-19 booster programme. However, the online booking system continued to accept appointments from people who no longer qualified, leading to wasted visits and confrontations in community pharmacies.

A survey of NPA members found that 88% of pharmacies reported intimidation from frustrated patients, with some staff describing being spat at or pushed. On average, around half of vaccine appointment bookings towards the end of last year had been made through what the NPA described as “a fundamentally flawed national NHS system” that still accepted ineligible patients.

Pharmacies also reported poor communication from NHS England, with little explanation given to individual sites about the system failures or the rationale for the change in eligibility.

The NPA called on the NHS to compensate its 6000 independent community pharmacy members for wasted staff time and resources. It estimated the cost could amount to at least £2 million a day. 

A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said that, in line with independent advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the autumn 2025 COVID programme was focused on the oldest adults and immunosuppressed people, who are at highest risk for serious complications from respiratory infections.

“Abuse of staff in any setting is unacceptable and should not be tolerated,” the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Medscape News UK. “Pharmacy providers have policies in place to protect individuals and should ensure any inappropriate incidents are reported where necessary.”

Under the updated rules, boosters were offered to adults aged 75 years or over, residents of care homes for older adults, and immunosuppressed people aged 6 months or over.

This marked a change from the autumn 2024 programme, which also included adults aged 65-74 years and all those aged 6 months or over in a clinical risk group. Frontline health and social care workers and staff in care homes for older adults also became ineligible for routine vaccination in autumn 2025.

The JCVI advised that vaccinating these groups would likely have “only a very limited impact on reducing staff sickness absence.”

Accepting that advice last June, the DHSC said that “in the current era of high population immunity,” additional doses would “provide very limited, if any, protection against infection and any subsequent onward transmission of infection.”

Despite this, the national booking system allowed ineligible patients to make appointments anyway, the NPA said. Some patients also reported receiving text messages from the NHS or their GP inviting them for vaccination despite no longer qualifying.

NPA chief executive Henry Gregg said: “This was a problem of the NHS's own making that should have been avoided. It is disgusting to learn of pharmacists being spat at by disgruntled individuals, and any physical intimidation or abuse is utterly unacceptable.”

He added: “The NHS must learn the lessons from this issue for future years. This includes doing the right thing and compensating pharmacies for losses made during this process.”

Although some costs, such as staff time and supplies, could not be quantified, he said “other consequences such as the loss of reputation and the impact of abuse cannot be.”

The JCVI has described COVID-19 as “a relatively mild disease for most people,” noting that it is now becoming endemic, with widespread immunity from previous infection or vaccination.

Because pre-2023 vaccine procurement arrangements no longer apply, the committee now uses standard cost-effectiveness measures to assess whether the “substantial investments” in vaccination programmes represent good value for public money, and whether resources could be better spent on other healthcare interventions. 

It said this had led to “a more refined approach,” with the autumn 2025 campaign targeted at people at highest risk for hospitalisation and death.

 January 19, 2026  

Many people who die from sepsis die of organ failure, including liver failure, which is a common, often fatal complication. For many years, the underlying causes and mechanisms of sepsis-induced liver damage remained a medical mystery.

Ping Wang, MD, and Monowar Aziz, PhD, of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, have attempted to shed light on that process, publishing new findings based on their observations on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in mice.

Neutrophils are our most abundant type of white blood cell and the first to respond against infections. They eject protein-arginine deiminase type-4, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to trap and kill pathogens. These NETs, however, contain several inflammatory molecules, making excessive NETs dangerous.

“Our discovery first revealed that upon inflammation, neutrophils release their intracellular DNA content, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These NETs, decorated with toxic molecules, profoundly activate liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) to release inflammatory mediators, ultimately leading to liver cell death,” said Wang. 

Kupffer cells live in the lumen of our liver sinusoids — the main site of blood flow and material exchange in the liver — to prevent bacteria, bacterial endotoxins, and microbial debris from our gastrointestinal system from entering via the portal vein. Endogenous inflammatory molecules from the NETs trigger an aberrant activation of Kupffer cells by stimulating a receptor called protease-activated receptor-1. This activation then results in the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, which injure surrounding hepatocytes.

Because the portal vein connects the gut and liver, Wang and his team hypothesized that this liver injury, driven by Kupffer cells and proinflammatory mediators, was simultaneously driven by the gut — specifically caused and exacerbated by proinflammatory gut intraepithelial lymphocytes and their proinflammatory interactions with neutrophils. These interactions through the protein CD112 are what train our neutrophils to subsequently cause more damage.

“Indeed, we subsequently discovered that this NET-forming, deleterious subset of neutrophils is generated in the inflamed gut through interaction with gut-specific lymphocytes,” Wang said. “This devastating neutrophil subset then migrates from the gut, homes to the liver, and causes irreversible damage to the liver, ultimately leading to death.”

By identifying this phenomenon of cellular crosstalk between the gut and liver, Feinstein researchers were able to uncover a key relationship between organs during sepsis. Examining the intricacies of this relationship has the potential to reshape our fundamental understanding of sepsis pathology, particularly where sepsis-induced damage starts and how it can spread. 

“Organ-to-organ crosstalk refers to the bidirectional communication and interaction between distinct organs, essential for coordinating systemic functions and maintaining overall homeostasis,” said Wang. “Normally, gut-liver crosstalk is a crucial symbiotic relationship. The gut delivers absorbed nutrients, metabolites, and some microbial products to the liver via the portal vein for processing and detoxification. In return, the liver supplies bile acids vital for gut digestion. This intricate interaction maintains metabolic and immune balance throughout the body.”

“In sepsis, however, this beneficial crosstalk becomes highly dysregulated and pathogenic,” he continued. “Compromise of the gut barrier (leaky gut) leads to the translocation of bacteria and potent inflammatory mediators directly to the liver via the portal circulation. This overwhelms the liver's processing capacity, triggering exacerbated inflammation, activating Kupffer cells, causing profound metabolic dysfunction, and severe liver injury. This vicious cycle significantly worsens systemic sepsis and contributes to multi-organ failure.”

“When I began to study sepsis approximately 40 years ago, relatively little was known about the molecular and cellular physiology of sepsis,” said W. Conrad Liles, MD, PhD, founding director of the Sepsis Center of Research Excellence-University of Washington, Seattle.

He points to seminal research advances in the role of innate immunity in sepsis: 

Despite all that, Liles says, no agent or drug exists to prevent and treat sepsis-induced organ failure. Current treatment is mostly limited to supportive care.

“We desperately need effective, pathogen-agnostic therapeutic agents for the treatment of sepsis that target the deleterious host responses that mediate sepsis-related complications, such as acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), shock caused by diffuse microvascular leakage, sepsis encephalopathy, and sepsis hepatopathy (sepsis-related liver injury),” said Liles, who was not involved in this research.

Liles, for his money, would like to see how these new findings would play out beyond animal studies. “Findings from mouse models of sepsis do not necessarily translate to clinical sepsis in humans,” he said. “Another point: Do other models of sepsis, other than CLP, show a similar prominent role for NETs/NETosis in the pathogenesis of end-organ injury? In other words, are the findings reported in this study unique to CLP, or are they generalizable across preclinical models of sepsis?”

Wang and his team are already using their findings to develop a treatment to prevent liver damage.

“Inhibiting the trafficking of [the] devastating neutrophil subset from the gut to the liver by blocking portal vein blood flow is unrealistic,” said Wang. “Instead, we have identified a new therapeutic target: preventing the generation of these gut-primed, NET-forming neutrophils by disrupting the interaction between gut-resident lymphocytes and neutrophils through their specific receptors.”

“Indeed, our ongoing work has led to the discovery and development of a novel small peptide that inhibits this interaction in the gut, thereby completely preventing the generation of these gut-primed, NET-forming neutrophils,” he continued. “We have successfully treated septic animals with this peptide, inhibiting liver injury by mitigating the detrimental impact of gut-liver crosstalk mediated by this gut-derived neutrophil subpopulation. We are now rigorously verifying our data and preparing to publish a new paper on the impact of therapeutically targeting this novel mechanism to mitigate liver injury in sepsis.”

The study authors reported no financial conflicts.

Edited by Katie Lennon

 January 19, 2026  

EU cancer mortality rates are projected to decline by 7.8% in men and 5.9% in women by 2026, with female lung cancer mortality showing signs of stabilization around 12.5 per 100,000 in most countries. The study predicts approximately 1,230,000 cancer deaths in the EU for 2026, reflecting an increase in absolute numbers due to population aging despite falling mortality rates.

“Strengthening taxation, implementing advertising bans, creating smoke-free environments, and providing cessation support are essential for closing regional and socioeconomic gaps, and achieving sustained reductions in lung cancer mortality across Europe,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Carlo La Vecchia, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan in Milan, Italy. It was published online in Annals of Oncology.

The predictions are based on official World Health Organization death certification data from the most populous European countries, which have high coverage and quality. However, the authors noted that findings should be interpreted with caution because they assume that factors driving the latest trends will not change in the short term. The predictions rely on age-specific joinpoint models, which may be less sensitive to shifts in cohort trends.

The study was supported by the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro Foundation through grant number 22987 to E. Negri. Moreover, C. Santucci and C. La Vecchia declared receiving support from EU funding within the NextGenerationEU-MUR PNRR Extended Partnership initiative through grant number PEOQOO00007, INF-ACT. The funding sources had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

As people age, structural brain changes influence their ability to adapt to the environment. New from eNeuro, Tatiana Wolfe and colleagues at the University of Arkansas characterized changes in the brain across two periods of adulthood that may correspond to changes in adaptive behavior. 

The researchers identified brain areas associated with the ability to adapt to the environment by analyzing previous neuroimaging studies. They then used a publicly accessible database-the Human Connectome Project-to identify different structures that enable these brain areas to communicate and work together to promote adaptive behavior. Structures related to shifting between tasks or updating information about the environment were more strongly linked to adaptive behaviors in older adults compared to younger adults. A separate imaging dataset from the UK Biobank revealed that biological features of these structures that older individuals rely more heavily upon deteriorated over time in a way that may be linked to deficits in behavioral adaptability that arise later in adulthood. 

According to the researchers, this work supports the idea that brain structures linked to the brain's ability to adapt to the environment undergo age-related changes and point to potential measures for identifying these changes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Medicare coverage of telehealth: Study could inform Congressional decision","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260119/Medicare-telehealth-Study-shows-no-visit-increase-informing-policy-debate.aspx","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:20:00 GMT","

With another Congressional deadline looming this month for most telehealth coverage under Medicare, a new University of Michigan study adds more data to the debate.

It shows that the total number of patient visits hasn't gone up since most patients gained the ability to see doctors and other health care providers virtually.

In fact, among non-surgical medical specialties and mental health providers, the total number of visits stabilized and even declined slightly through June 2024, the most recent period available to analyze. The data come from more than 60 million people who had nearly 539 million appointments during a five-year period.

The findings could help inform policymakers who must vote by January 30 to either temporarily renew or permanently extend Medicare telehealth coverage standards that have been in effect since March 2020.

If they don't meet that deadline, older and disabled Americans with traditional Medicare coverage could find themselves receiving messages like they did last fall, when there was a lapse in telehealth coverage during the government shutdown that began October 1.

Such letters told them that if they had a telehealth visit during that time, they may be responsible for paying the entire cost, or that their appointment was being converted to in-person or being canceled or rescheduled.

Just before Thanksgiving, Congress authorized retroactive payment for telehealth visits that patients with traditional Medicare had decided to keep during the shutdown.

But the budget agreement only provided for coverage of future care under current standards through the end of January 2026.

The new findings, published in the peer-reviewed publication Health Affairs Scholar by a team from the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, build on findings that the researchers published as a preprint nearly a year ago during a prior period of uncertainty about Medicare coverage of telehealth.

The new analysis includes data from January 2019 through June 2024 and breaks down telehealth and in-person visit trends for surgical, non-surgical and behavioral (mental) health care.

Telehealth was possible only under very limited circumstances in Medicare before March 2020. That month, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid emergency pivot to virtual care. Since then, such care has become routine for most people. In fact, the study shows that telehealth now accounts for 44% of all behavioral health visits and 9% of primary care visits among beneficiaries in traditional Medicare.

However, despite this sustained adoption, the study finds that overall healthcare visits have remained stable or declined over time. The researchers used a special type of statistical analysis to look at visit patterns among specialties with high, medium and low telehealth use.

They found that even in fields where telehealth was widely adopted, the total number of visits, including in-person and virtual visits, stayed steady or even declined over time. Contrary to some predictions, overall visits didn't climb higher as telehealth became more popular.

Lead author James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., said that it's important to look at the overall trajectory of both telehealth and in-person visits in order to inform policymakers who want to balance care access and flexibility with budgetary responsibility.

One of the things that is paralyzing the policy debate is uncertainty and concern about whether covering telehealth in parity with in-person care would be associated with runaway utilization. But we don't see that here.""

James D. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., National Clinician Scholar at IHPI and Clinical Instructor in the U-M Medical School's Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Medicine

Lee and senior author Chad Ellimoottil, M.D., M.S., led the analysis. They did not include asynchronous patient portal messages, which providers can bill Medicare for under a separate code if they spend a substantial amount of time addressing the patient's concern.

They also cannot include any visits that patients had with providers who did not bill traditional fee-for-service Medicare, such as mental health providers who patients may have paid for out of their own pocket.

Because half of Medicare beneficiaries have chosen Medicare Advantage plans, which bill Medicare differently, their data aren't included either.

The fact that the new analysis shows a declining trend for total visits for behavioral health and primary care is also of interest, Lee said. This may reflect the well-known shortage of primary care and behavioral health providers in the United States, including reduction in capacity as burned-out providers reduce the number of appointments they offer. 

In addition to Lee and Ellimoottil, the authors are Elena Chun, M.S., Chiang-Hua Chang, Ph.D., Hechuan Michelle Hou, M.S., former NCSP scholar Terrence Liu, M.D., M.S., Rodney Dunn, Ph.D., Jeffrey McCullough, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D.

The study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the support that Lee receives for his National Clinician Scholars Program fellowship from IHPI and the VA Office of Academic Affiliations.

A study of 227 individuals who experienced neuro cognitive difficulties post COVID-19 infection – such as headaches, vertigo, balance dysregulation, changes in taste/smell, and brain fog – displayed a significant increase in their blood plasma of a crucial protein called tau, which is found in nerves and especially in the brain. Excess levels of tau are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and found in many Alzheimer's patients.

Published this month in eBioMedicine, the study suggests that people who experience Long COVID neurocognitive symptoms could be at further risk for neurodegenerative diseases.

The research involves ongoing blood biomarker studies of 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) responders who are monitored by clinicians and researchers at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program. The research team analyzed plasma samples taken prior to the participants' COVID-19 infections and many months to years after having COVID-19. They measured a specific tau protein, pTau-181, which stands for phosphorylated tau, an abnormal type associated with dementia patients.

Overall, the cohort showed a 59 percent increase of tau (pTau-181) in their plasma post COVID-19 infection while or after experiencing neurocognitive symptoms, compared to their plasma tau levels pre-COVID-19.

All the participants are individuals with some form of Long COVID, or specifically for this study those with Neurological Post-Acute Sequelae COVID (N-PASC).

The presence of tau at higher levels in the blood is a known biomarker of lasting brain damage. Therefore, these study results imply that Long COVID could worsen with time and cause changes in neurological symptoms or lead to cognitive difficulties that become worse. Yet, we do not know if this increase in tau in our sample represents a biological course that could be similar to individuals who develop Alzheimer's or related diseases.""

Sean Clouston, PhD, Corresponding Author and Professor in the Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine in the Renaissance School of Medicine (RSOM) and Program in Public Health, Stony Brook University

The 227 individuals with N-PASC were compared to 227 other WTC responders who either 1) did not contract COVID between their pre- and post-pandemic blood sample collection dates, or 2) developed COVID but did not develop any Long COVID symptoms, including neurological ones. This cohort served as the control group for the study.

Unlike those with N-PASC, any increased plasma tau levels in the control group from their pre-COVID tau levels was not evident based on testing.

For those with N-PASC who had neurocognitive symptoms for more than 1.5 years, the tau level increases were worse. This finding, the authors write, ""might portend worsened cognitive functioning as individuals age.""

""We measured tau at an average of 2.2 years after COVID-19 infection, and our measurements taken ranged from six months to four years,"" adds Xiaohua Yang, First Author and Senior Research Program Manager at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program. ""This sampling timeframe represents a true long-term post-acute sequela of COVID-19.""

Clouston and colleagues stress that other research steps need to be taken to determine if increased plasma levels of tau in those with N-PASC have any association with cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases.

""One important step is to validate our study results using neuroimaging tools to see if tau plasma level increases also represent increased levels in the participants' brains,"" explains Clouston.

Additionally, the authors also point out that the cohort for this study – WTC responders – also have had more environmental exposures than the general population. Therefore, findings in N-PASC individuals who are WTC responders could be much different from the general patient population.

""The long-term impact of COVID-19 may be consequential years after the infection and give rise to long-term illnesses including neurocognitive problems similar to what is seen in Alzheimer's disease,"" says Senior Author Benjamin J. Luft, MD, Director of the WTC Health and Wellness Program, an infectious diseases specialist, and the Edmund D. Pelligrino Professor of Medicine in the RSOM.

""This is one of the first studies to show that a virus may contribute to the development of abnormal tau production over time,"" he adds. ""This has important implications for our understanding of the biological factors involved in the development of neurodegenerative disease. On a practical level, it has important implications for the development of effective vaccines and therapies to prevent an acute infection before it can embed itself in people and cause long-term disease.""

The study was supported in part by funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CDC/NIOSH CDC-75D30122c12222) and the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Aging (NIH/NIA Ago49953).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT, Monaco striker Balogun: Playing vs. Real Madrid 'a dream'","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/47662176/usa-monaco-striker-folarin-balogun-playing-real-madrid-dream","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:36:00 GMT","

United States men's national team and Monaco striker Folarin Balogun told ESPN he will achieve one of his dreams on Tuesday when the Ligue 1 club face Real Madrid at the Bernabéu in the Champions League.

One point in their last two games against Real Madrid and Juventus could be enough for Balogun and Monaco to qualify for the UCL playoffs.

This past December, Balogun became the first American to score in three consecutive Champions League appearances, when he converted from close range in the 68th minute against Galatasaray to give Monaco a 1-0 win.

He also scored in Monaco's two previous Champions League matches against Pafos and Bodo/Glimt. He now has eight goals and two assists in 22 appearances in all competitions for the Ligue 1 side this season.

""Playing Real Madrid in the Champions League is special. It will a first time for me and I am sure it will be a first time for a lot of my teammates,"" he said.

""It is important that we go there to qualify though. We have our own objectives. We are not just going there to enjoy the experience.

""We believe we can get a result. We have done well against big teams in the Champions League so far this season. The opportunity to play at the Bernabéu against Real Madrid is wonderful. I am excited.""

Monaco have lost seven of their last eight league games but have been faring much better in Champions League play and Balogun said it was hard to explain.

""It is a paradox,"" he said. ""There is frustration sometimes for the coach and the staff because we can beat these teams, we can dominate these teams as well and then in Ligue 1 we are struggling for that consistency.

""The league doesn't lie. We are ninth. We know we need to turn this around,"" he said last week at Monaco's training ground.

The Champions League has been a breath of fresh air for both the players and for Monaco manager Sébastien Pocognoli, who took over the team in October.

Pocognoli's side are looking to bounce back after a 3-1 defeat to Lorient on Friday, their fourth consecutive loss in the French championship.

""I am a very optimistic person, but after a difficult series in the championship, it's normal to be affected,"" Pocognoli said. ""If you're not, it shows a lack of concern, which is far from the case. We work hard and we know why things don't always go in our favour. There are things we can control and others that are more difficult to manage. Above all, I feel sad for my players.""

Asked whether it was the right moment to face Real Madrid, Pocognoli insisted the focus must be on Monaco's own performance.

""We need to focus on ourselves and be at a very high level, no matter the opponent. We're not thinking about whether it's the right time or not. In big matches, we've shown that we can be present when we're not expected and that we're up to the task.""

Balogun, meanwhile, said the experience of Champions League playing time has motivated him to see his role differently.

""For us this season, when we had the opportunity to play in the Champions League, it was like a reset. A new competition,"" Balogun said. ""We can feel the preparation is different, we wear different kit in training. I really enjoy that. We had some tough games.

""We went to Bodo/Glimt, it's 2 p.m. and it's already dark outside. It's cold, it's raining. It's new experiences. It gives us the chance to bond as a team. We have to believe in ourselves.""

The 24-year-old Brooklyn-born forward will lead the line for the Ligue 1 side on Tuesday.

His first career Champions League goal came this past November in Monaco's 1-0 win over Bodo/Glimt.

He is enjoying his football but wants more heading into the World Cup on home soil.

""The best thing I can do is have a good season with Monaco and when I see the U.S. team in March, I have to perform,"" Balogun said. ""I have to remind myself to embrace it all. Be in the moment. You don't want to look back on your career and think: I was so focused that I didn't realize I was achieving my dreams.""

""It is an accomplishment to be at the World Cup or at the Bernabéu in the Champions League. At this level, you have to be ruthless,"" he said.

""There is more I want to do. I have high expectations for myself at the half way point of the season. I am happy to be healthy and playing week in week out but I want to achieve more.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

 Pape Thiaw could be bannned from the 2026 World Cup

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has officially opened disciplinary proceedings against Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw following his actions during the dramatic 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final.

The decision places Thiaw under threat of a lengthy suspension, with reports suggesting he could potentially miss the 2026 FIFA World Cup, scheduled to be co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The proceedings stem from a controversial moment late in the AFCON final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on Sunday, January 18, 2026. 

A penalty was awarded to Morocco in stoppage time after a VAR review, sparking protests from the Senegal players.

Watch how Senegal coach was forced to leave press conference after AFCON final

Thiaw urged his squad to leave the pitch and return to the dressing room in protest of the decision, temporarily halting play and escalating tensions in the stadium.

While Senegal ultimately went on to win 1–0 in extra time, the incident has drawn the attention of CAF, who are investigating whether Thiaw's actions violated disciplinary codes regarding player conduct, match integrity, and engagement with match officials.

The outcome of the proceedings could have wide-ranging consequences for Senegalese football on the global stage. 

Reports indicate Thiaw could face a maximum suspension that could go as long as the 2026 World Cup. 

A suspension for Thiaw could affect the team's preparation and leadership ahead of the 2026 World Cup, placing the country's national squad under scrutiny at a critical time.

CAF has not yet announced a timeline for its investigation or potential sanctions.

Rough Draft Atlanta


					Hyperlocal news for metro Atlanta				




Rough Draft is a clever, curated, and concise email to help you stay up-to-date.

Demand for tickets to the FIFA World Cup 2026 reached record levels, with more than half a billion ticket requests submitted during the tournament's “Random Selection Draw” sales phase, FIFA announced.

The application window ran from Dec. 11 through Jan. 13, during which fans reportedly submitted an average of around 15 million ticket requests per day over the 33-day period.

Applications were received from fans in every country and territory that is governed by FIFA's 211 member associations, a result that the soccer organization says reflects the global reach of the upcoming World Cup — which stands as the first in the event's history to feature an expanded 48-team field. 

In addition to the three host nations (the United States, Mexico and Canada), FIFA says that the largest number of applications came from fans based in Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.

The most sought-after match during this sales phase was Colombia vs. Portugal, scheduled for June 27 in Miami. Other high-demand games included Mexico vs. Korea Republic on June 18 in Guadalajara, the opener between Mexico and South Africa on June 11 in Mexico City, as well as the World Cup final on July 19.

“Half a billion ticket requests in just over a month is more than demand — it's a global statement,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “On behalf of FIFA, I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response.”

With the sales phase now closed, FIFA Ticketing will verify applications and allocate tickets through a random selection process. Fans will be notified of the results by email beginning Feb. 5. 

Unsuccessful applicants will have another chance during the “Last-Minute Sales” phase, when remaining tickets go on sale closer to the tournament on a first-come, first-served basis.

“Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums,” said Infantino. “That is why we are committed to creating multiple ways for fans to be part of the FIFA World Cup 2026 — through a wide range of fan experiences beyond the stadiums, both in person and online — so that as many people as possible can share in what will be the biggest sporting event ever staged.”

The FIFA World Cup begins on June 11 with Atlanta set to host eight matches — including one of the semi-final games.

Marc Guehi has officially signed for Manchester City after completing a £20m ($27m) move from Crystal Palace. The England defender has penned a contract with City until 2031 and immediately boosts the team's injury-ravaged defence, with Pep Guardiola's side having lost Josko Gvardiol for the rest of the season while also missing Ruben Dias and John Stones.

City said in a statement: 'Manchester City is delighted to announce the signing of Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace. The 25-year-old has signed a five-and-a-half-year deal that will keep him at the Etihad Stadium until the summer of 2031. An England international with 26 caps to his name, Guéhi began his career at Chelsea. After an impressive loan spell with Swansea City in the 2020-21 campaign - where he helped them reach the Championship play-off final - he signed for Crystal Palace.  

'Following an exceptional summer at EURO 2024, where he was a stand-out player for England on their route to the final, he was named club captain for Oliver Glasner's side ahead of the 2024-25 campaign. Guéhi's first season as Palace captain saw him lead them to a major trophy and European football for the first time in their history after lifting the FA Cup against City last May. This success was followed by winning the FA Community Shield in August, beating Liverpool at Wembley Stadium. The defender has played 188 games and scored 11 goals for The Eagles.'

Guehi told City's official website: ""I am really happy and incredibly proud to be a Manchester City player. This move feels like the culmination of all the hard work I have put into my career. I am now at the best club in England and part of an unbelievable squad of players. It feels good to be able to say that. I want to grow as a player and a person, and I know at this club that's going to happen. I love football – it has given me so much for so long – and to be able to continue my development at Manchester City is a really special moment for me and my family.

""I absolutely cannot wait to get started now. I want to meet my teammates, train hard, understand what the manager expects of me and then show the City fans what I can do.""

City's director of football Hugo Viana added: ""It is clear Marc has been one of the best defenders in English football for quite some time now, so we are absolutely delighted to bring him to Manchester City. I feel we have signed a huge talent who will help us improve. He is only 25, but he has shown already he is a leader, a brilliant professional and someone desperate to improve. He is strong, has exceptional defensive qualities, is an intelligent reader of the game, and brings passion and energy every time he steps onto the pitch. I am so pleased it was us he chose to join. Marc is entering the prime years of his career. I am sure every City fan is excited to see how good he can be in a sky blue shirt.""

Tottenham have confirmed that defender Ben Davies is set to undergo surgery after fracturing his ankle in his side's 2-1 loss to West Ham. Pressure is mounting on Spurs boss Thomas Frank after a damaging home defeat to the relegation-threatened Hammers at the weekend. To make matters worse, Wales international Davies picked up the injury in the derby defeat and now he faces a lengthy lay-off.

Callum Wilson's late winner at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday condemned Tottenham to a Premier League home record of played 11, lost six, and won just two. Two days on, Spurs manager Frank is walking a tightrope to stay in his role, although the north London team are sticking with the ex-Brentford boss for now. The result means Tottenham are 14th in the table and have failed to win any of their last four matches. And going by the boos at full time, Spurs fans are far from happy with what they are seeing.

On those boos, Frank said after the match: ""It's not a nice feeling, but I understand the frustration. We are losing to a big London rival, there is nothing worse. We couldn't win at home, which we worked very hard to try to do that. Hopefully they [the fans] can see the effort from the boys, they are working very hard. We did everything in the second half.""

On Monday, Tottenham revealed that Davies will go under the knife later today for a left ankle fracture he suffered early in the West Ham clash. It remains to be seen how long the experienced defender will be out for but the club have wished him a speedy recovery.



When Tottenham sacked Ange Postecoglou after he guided them to Europa League glory last May, they turned to Frank for a more pragmatic approach. But Spurs, who finished 17th last term, are in a similar position to where they were under the Australian at this point last season but instead of swashbuckling, and often kamikaze, football, the north London team are utilising a style that has flattered to deceive. Despite that, Frank still feels he has the backing of the club's board. 

He said on Saturday: ""I am feeling the backing from everyone, everyone wants the same thing - long term success. We are doing a lot of things right behind the scenes, but we are not getting the results which is crucial.""

Despite that, he was well aware that the defeat to West Ham was not good enough and even admitted his side's ability to deal with set pieces is at an all-time low. 

""It feels like we've seen this before, like at Bournemouth when we do very well second half, get the equaliser and push for the winner, having chances and opportunities, but not getting over the line. Then we are stretched in the last moments of the game and lose 2-1,"" he said. ""We started well in the first 15, then went 1-0 down. Then we rushed too much, gave the ball away too much, half-time helped, the boys pushed and did everything right. We scored the equaliser and created chances. It's super disappointing that we conceded in the last minute. If we can't win then we need to get the draw.

Tottenham have a chance to bounce back quickly from this West Ham setback when they host Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. Then, at the weekend, they travel to lowly Burnley in the Premier League. If he fails to win any of those matches, Frank could be out the job by next week.

'Avatar' wasn't the only Disney winner at the holiday box office. 'Zootopia 2' is now the top-grossing animated film of all time globally and the ninth-highest-grossing film of any genre.



		By Aaron Couch, Pamela McClintock 

	January 19, 2026 9:06am	




	Despite all the hype, Nia DaCosta's elevated horror-zombie sequel 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple came in behind expectations at the long Martin Luther King Jr. holiday box office as Avatar: Fire and Ash won the four-day session with an estimated $17.8 million, including $14.5 million for the three-day weekend proper.


	Sony's The Bone Temple is estimating a four-day debut of $15 million, including $13 million for the three days. (Tuesday actuals will determine the final numbers for all films.) That's well behind the opening of the last film, 28 Years Later, which posted a three-day debut of $30 million in June 2025, on its way to topping out at $151 million globally. It also came in behind tracking, which showed Bone Temple launching to $20 million domestically.

	The 28 Years Later franchise hails from director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, who brought the film series to Sony after a heated bidding war. Filmmaker Nia DaCosta is in the director's chair for Bone Temple, the second part in a planned trilogy, with Sony saying last month that it will make a third installment with Cillian Murphy — star of the original 28 Days Later — with Boyle returning to direct. It is not known how this opening weekend could change that calculus. In 2002, 28 Days Later opened to just $10 million before transforming into a water-cooler sensation and pushing the boundaries of the zombie genre.

	










			Popular on THR		







	Sony insiders remain hopeful that word of mouth could give Bone Temple legs. The feature earned strong reviews (94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), an A- CinemaScore (a rare high grade for a horror film) and a 4.5 PostTrak rating. Bone Temple stars Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Alfie Williams, Erin Kellyman and Chi Lewis-Parry.


Avatar 3, now in its fifth weekend, easily stayed in first place as it races toward the $400 million mark domestically. So far, the film has collected an estimated $358 million domestically and north of $1.2 billion globally.


	James Cameron's threequel wasn't the only Disney release making headlines. Thanksgiving juggernaut Zootopia 2 became the top-animated film of all time globally over the MLK weekend after passing up Disney/Pixar's Inside Out 2, not adjusted for inflation. It is also the No. 9 film of all time of any genre with receipts north of $1.7 billion, including a domestic cume of $390 million and $1.3 billion internationally.


Zootopia 2 came in third with an estimated $12 million for the four days, including $9.2 million for the three.


	The Sydney Sweeney-Amanda Seyfried vehicle The Housemaid continued to clean up for Lionsgate, falling just 21 percent in its fifth weekend to an estimated $8.6 million for the three days and an estimated $10.2 million for the four days as it jumps the $100 million mark domestically and suits up to jump the $250 million mark sometime this week, an eye-popping feat.


	Filmmaker Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme landed in fifth place. From A24, the specialty pic has been an overperformer since its Christmas release, and observers were correct in predicting it would get a bump following star Timothée Chalamet's best actor win at the Golden Globes last weekend. It earned an estimated $6.7 for the four-day frame, including $5.5 million for the three days. With a domestic tally of $80 million through Sunday, it has now passed up Oscar best-picture winner Everything Everywhere All at Once to rank as A24's top-performing title of all time.

	











	Elsewhere at the specialty and awards box office, Chloé Zhao's Hamnet — another awards frontrunner — expanded after it took home best drama at the Golden Globes Jan. 11, with Oscar hopeful Jesse Buckley winning the actress prize. The film, which started off playing in select runs in November, added more runs over Christmas and again this weekend. Playing in 718 theaters this weekend, it earned an estimated $1.6 million for the four days, bringing its domestic total to $15 million. Focus plans further expansion after Oscar nominations are announced. Hamnet producers Steven Spielberg and Sam Mendes are hitting the awards campaign trail hard for Zhao.

	In a bizarre message to Norway's Prime Minister, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he “is no longer obliged to think purely of peace” because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.


	Trump sent the message to the Norwegian PM amid an ongoing political crisis over the future of Greenland, with POTUS seeking control over the Danish territory. You can read the message below.


	Trump has vowed to impose a 10% levy on goods imported from eight European allies of America until a deal is reached over the U.S. purchasing the island.

	In his text message to Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump blamed Norway for him not getting the Nobel Peace Prize, despite Støre having previously told Trump that an independent committee decides who gets the accolade, not the Norwegian people.

	In other news likely to alarm America's allies, the Kremlin said today that Trump has invited Vladimir Putin to join Trump's Board Of Peace, which will oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. Putin's spokesperson said the Russian President is reviewing the invitation.


	You can read Trump's message to the Norwegian PM — confirmed by CBS and reported on by Reuters, BBC, Bloomberg and other news outlets — in full below.


	“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.

	











	“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT”

Should be rotting in prison. Funny how those Epstein files never got released.

Well, he can forget about ever receiving the Nobel Peace Prize now. That ship has sailed.

Europe and the European Union need to stand their ground. Don't cave in just because that spoiled manchild is throwing another temper tantrum. He's a bully that needs to learn that no means no. Greenland is not for sale.

I'm ignorant to this stuff, but given everything horrible that this douche has done and is… is there nothing the Democrats or anyone at all can do to stop this mad man?? 

That is a serious question

You are low-information, so you have no idea how far Europe has overstepped in creating global turmoil over the last couple decades – including the financing of fake narratives that you get from television.

The EU, Canada, and Australia are approaching China levels of authoritarianism and it will be one of history's great ironies when the “you will own nothing and be happy” people lose everything.

Maybe you should try traveling to Europe at some point, so you can see that that claim is pure lunacy, or maybe just get an education – or both. Despite what you might think, ignorance is not a bliss.

You obviously typed that wearing a tinfoil hat

Your tin foil hat is on too tightly. 

And you didn't answer OP's question.

totally worth starting world war three over. you idiots know your tax cuts wont matter if the country is a bombed out wasteland right?

I believe that this man is no better then Jim Jones or any the other whacko who killed their people.All he is doing is not helping America he is destroying it.Please get rid of him now

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","READ: Actual Telegram From Marlon Brando to Martin Luther King Jr.","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/marlon-brando-martin-luther-king-jr-telegram/","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:47:13 GMT","

Every year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day reminds us of the incredible legacy of its namesake. As one of the most recognizable faces of the Civil Rights Movement, King made connections across the country. He even counted some of Hollywood's elite among his list of supporters, including Marlon Brando. In 1964, Brando sent King a telegram regarding this support, which has since become an important piece of Americana.

In the telegram, Brando expressed his regret at not being able to join King in what he called “activities of liberation” due to recent health issues. However, he made his feelings on King's cause very clear. “I feel that those who take active part in demonstrations for equality and freedom are the heroes of our time,” the actor wrote. “I regard it as an honorable duty to participate.” Despite not being able to stand beside King and other leaders in this instance, Brando was a major supporter of the Civil Rights Movement.

The 1964 telegram to King wasn't the beginning of Brando's participation in the Civil Rights Movement. Several 1963 photographs show the actor walking in solidarity with CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) protestors in Torrance, California, one of the many times he lent his time and money to the cause throughout the 1960s. He also famously participated in the pivotal March on Washington that same year.

In 1968, Brando addressed King's heartbreaking death in an interview with Johnny Carson. “King got shot, and I sat in front of the television set, and I wondered what it meant to me [that] he's dead,” Brando began. He eloquently recalled King's last words from the night before his death. ” I thought somehow this has got to matter somewhere,” Brando said. “And if we don't — all the citizens — do something that is a person-to-person contribution, I don't think that we're really gonna have any place to come home to if we do get a job.”

The actor then expressed how he planned to continue the fight. “I couldn't think of any other alternative rather than to make my time, my energies, and my money fully available to do what I can as an individual.” As I Love Ancestry reported, Brando donated thousands of dollars and even decided to forgo a movie role so he could devote more time to participating in the movement.

Although King died long before he could personally see his vision for peace and equality realized, his tragic passing lit a new fire. Like Brando, many came to see King's death as a renewed call to action. Sixty years later, Martin's legacy lives on through what the movement accomplished. The beloved leader is also remembered for his public speaking talents, including the last words he ever said to his followers. 

“Like anybody, I would like to live a long life,” King said in what would be his final speech. “Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now.” He went on to say that God had allowed him to climb the proverbial mountain. “And I've looked over,” King said. “And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we as a people, will get to the promised land.” That journey is still ongoing, thanks to King and other Civil Rights Movement leaders being brave enough to take the first steps.

							By 

	Joseph Hudak



Dolly Parton turns 80 years old today, but somehow she continues to possess all the vitality she had when she first arrived in Nashville from her native Sevierville, Tennessee, back in the Sixties. In honor of her milestone birthday, we publish — for the very first time — this interview about the making of her 1971 album Coat of Many Colors, which gave the Country Music Hall of Fame member her signature autobiographical song. This story was originally presented as part of Rolling Stone‘s “500 Greatest Albums” podcast series.


	Dolly Parton has a number of songs that could be considered her signature: the warning “Jolene,” the tireless “9 to 5,” and the royal ballad “I Will Always Love You.” But none come close to “Coat of Many Colors,” her 1971 autobiographical tale about growing up in Appalachian poverty and the hand-sewn clothes that Parton and her siblings would wear to school. To this day, it summons visceral emotion, both in the woman who sang it and in the country music fans who hear it.

	











	But the song also represents Parton's emergence as an all-around star: not just as a singer, but as a songwriter.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I was always trying to progress and try to do more, try to grow, and try to express myself musically as much as I could in every album that we did, but still stay true to myself,” Parton tells Rolling Stone. “I always take myself more seriously as a songwriter than I even do as a singer.”


	By the time Parton walked into RCA Studio B in 1971 to record Coat of Many Colors, she had already been living in Music City for seven years. She moved to the city intending to be a songwriter, not a singer, but it would take a while for Nashville to recognize Parton as a great writer.

	











	Once in Music City, Parton met a figure who'd play a pivotal role in her life, Porter Wagoner, a veteran country hitmaker who had his own TV variety show. Wagoner gave Parton her big break by casting her on his show, and the pair became frequent duet partners. They released 13 duet albums and won the Country Music Association Award for Vocal Duo of the Year three times. Wagoner even helped Parton pick which songs to record and was a looming presence in the studio.

	“Porter was always involved in the production and working with the engineers and working with the musicians, making sure that they got it the way that that he wanted,” she says.


	Parton ended her musical partnership with Wagoner in 1974, writing him a heartfelt goodbye with “I Will Always Love You.” But when Parton recorded Coat of Many Colors in 1971, she was already starting to break away. To fully come into her own as a solo artist and songwriter, Parton knew she had to write the bulk of the album, and it all started with the title track, a clear-cut origin story about her childhood in East Tennessee.


	Parton grew up poor in Sevierville, Tennessee, near the Great Smoky Mountains. The memory of her one-bedroom cabin was still fresh in Parton's mind when she moved to Nashville in 1964 after graduating high school. “We didn't have anything,” she says. “Mama used to sew all of our quilts and curtains for the windows, remake our clothes, and make clothes out of feed sacks or scraps.”


	In “Coat of Many Colors,” Parton sang in plainspoken language about her poverty. The song draws on the biblical tale of Joseph and his treasured garment, the coat of many colors.


	“I went to school thinking I looked like Joseph,” she says, unaware that she was about to be laughed at. “I was upset with my mom, and I was crying because I felt she had told me a fib. Mama said, ‘I don't want to ever hear you say that we're poor. We are rich in kindness and love and understanding.'”

	Grammy-winning songwriter Brandy Clark says “Coat of Many Colors” succeeds because it's so universal. “You've got family, you've got religion, you've got honesty, and you've got poverty, and also being made fun of,” she says. “I think if you haven't had one of those five things go on, you probably haven't lived.”


	Parton first wrote the lyrics to “Coat of Many Colors” on a tour bus with Wagoner. The flashy country singer had his suits with him in a dry cleaner's bag and, when inspiration struck, Parton snatched the receipt from the bag and began scribbling. “I just grabbed the tag … and I started writing ‘Coat of Many Colors' on it. I finished the song pretty much on that,” she recalls.

	











	Despite honoring Wagoner's request to cut some of his songs, Coat of Many Colors is distinctly Parton's album, and you can hear her take agency of her story. Rolling Stone writer Chet Flippo described it as “the first true flowering of Dolly Parton's faltering steps to emerge as a free musical soul and a major songwriter.”


	Along with the title track, she wrote “Traveling Man,” about a young woman who makes plans to run off with a salesman, only to have her mother steal him first. Clark recognizes clues in the song, as well as in another Coat track, “She Never Met a Man She Didn't Like.”


	“She was working her way to ‘Jolene,'” Clark says of the songs.


	The spirit of Parton's native Smoky Mountains is woven throughout the album. It's in the lyrics of the title track, in the song “Early Morning Breeze,” and in the actual music of “My Blue Tears,” a bluegrassy song that uses nature as a metaphor for heartbreak.


	“Those kind of songs are like a tribute to my Tennessee mountain home,” Parton says. “I wanted to get that old world sound with it.”


	“It is mountain music,” Clark echoes. “And that's another theme that runs through Dolly's catalog. I always want to listen to Dolly in the fall, because I love to go to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge when the leaves are turning. Dolly has figured out a way to make her music feel like that part of the country.”


	Sonically, there's one outlier on the mostly acoustic album: “Here I Am” is more funk-rock than country music. It's also the most aggressive example of Parton owning her art.


	“I wanted to do something a little more bluesy or little more rock, and I remember kind of having to fight a little bit: ‘That's not really country enough,'” she recalls of the recording session. “And I thought, ‘Yeah, but it's soulful.'”


	Country singer Carly Pearce, who considers herself a Dolly Parton superfan, says that Parton's most open secret is in the simplicity of her lyrics. “She just has a way of writing that is really to the point,” Pearce says. “I'm reminded when I try to overcomplicate things, that these songs really have stood the test of time, and they were quite simple.”


	In the end, the same can be said of Coat of Many Colors. It remains an essential album because it represents country music's mission statement: simple storytelling that anyone can relate to.

Coat of Many Colors peaked at Number Seven on Billboard‘s Country Albums chart. It also scored Parton her first Album of the Year CMA Award nomination. Looking back, Parton says the album accomplished exactly what she came to Nashville to do — be a songwriter. She's a global superstar now too, but the title track will always be a part of her story, a glimpse at who she was and who she was about to become. It's even been adopted as an anthem of gay pride, thanks to its themes of acceptance and love.

	











	“I think people just loved the song, and then there's a lot of fun, good little songs in the album,” Parton says. “And it's my early days. A lot of my newfound fans like to go back and see who I am, who I was. And that little coat, people relate to it for many different reasons.”

	On a recent Saturday afternoon, Kendall Mayes was mindlessly scrolling on X when she noticed an unsettling trend surface on her feed. Users were prompting Grok, the platform's built-in AI feature, to “nudify” women's images. Mayes, a 25-year-old media professional from Texas who uses X to post photos with her friends and keep up with news, didn't think it would happen to her — until it did.


	“Put her in a tight clear transparent bikini,” an X user ordered the bot under a photo that Mayes posted from when she was 20. Grok complied, replacing her white shirt with a clear bikini top. The waistband of her jeans and black belt dissolved into thin, translucent strings. The see-through top made the upper half of her body look realistically naked.


	Hiding behind an anonymous profile, the user's page was filled with similar images of women, digitally and nonconsensually altered and sexualized. Mayes wanted to cuss the faceless user out, but decided to simply block the account. She hoped that would be the end of it. Soon, however, her comments became littered with more images of herself in clear bikinis and skin-tight latex bodysuits. Mayes says that all of the requests came from anonymous profiles that also targeted other women. Though some users have had their accounts suspended, as of publication, some of the images of Mayes are still up on X.

	











	The realistic nature of the images spooked her. The edits weren't obviously exaggerated or cartoonish. In our call, Mayes repeated, in shock, that the image edits closely resembled her body, down to the dip of her collarbone to the proportions of her chest and waist. “Truth to be told, on social media, I said, ‘This is not me,'” she admits. “But, my mind is like, ‘This is not too far from my body.'” 

	











	Mayes was not alone. By the first week of the new year, Grok's “nudification” loophole had gone viral. Every minute, users prompted Grok to “undress” images of women, and even minors. Common requests included “make her naked,” “make her turn around,” and “make her fat.” Users got crafty with the loophole, asking Grok to generate images of women in “clear bikinis” to get as close to fully nude images as possible. In one instance reviewed by Rolling Stone, a user prompted Grok to turn a woman's body into a “cadaver on the table in a morgue” undergoing an autopsy. Grok complied.

	After owner Elon Musk initially responded to the trend with laughing emojis, xAI said it had updated Grok's restrictions, limiting the image generation feature to paying subscribers. Musk claimed he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” In another reply to an X post, he stated that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” (A request for comment to xAI received an automated response.) Many existing image edits, however, remain online. 


	Last week, gender justice group UltraViolet published an open letter co-signed by 28 civil society organizations calling on Apple and Google to kick Grok and X off app stores. (Earlier this month, Democratic senators also called for the apps to be taken down.) 


	“This content is not just horrific and humiliating and abusive, but it's also in violation of Apple and Google's stated policy guidelines,” says Jenna Sherman, UltraViolet's campaign director.


	Upward of 7,000 sexualized images were being generated per hour by Grok over a 24-hour period, according to researchers cited by Bloomberg, which Sherman calls “totally unprecedented.” Sherman argues that xAI's restriction of Grok to paid users is an inadequate response. “If anything, they're just now monetizing this abuse,” she says.

	In the past, X was Mayes' “fun” corner of social media — an app where she could freely express herself. But as harassment and bullying have become fixtures of the platform, she is considering leaving the app. She has stopped uploading images of herself. She mulls over what her employer or colleagues might think if they were to find the explicit images.


	“It's something I would just never hope on anyone,” Mayes says. “Even my enemies.”

	











	Emma, a content creator, was at the grocery store when she saw the notifications of people asking Grok to undress her images. Most of the time, she posts ASMR videos whispering into microphones and tapping her nails against fidget toys, producing noises meant to send a tingle down your spine. The 21-year-old, known online as Emma's Myspace, and who asked to be only identified by her first name, has cultivated 1.2 million followers on TikTok alone. 


	Numbness washed over Emma when the images finally loaded on her timeline. A selfie of her holding a cat had been transformed into a nude. The cat was removed from the photo, Emma says, and her upper body was made naked.


	Emma immediately made her account private and reported the images. In an email response reviewed by Rolling Stone, X User Support asked her to upload an image of her government-issued ID so they could look into the report, but Emma responded that she didn't feel comfortable doing so. In some instances, Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, says uploading such documentation is a necessary step when filing social media reports. “But when the platform repeatedly does everything they can to not earn your trust,” he says, “that's not an acceptable outcome.” 


	Emma has been targeted by sexualized deepfakes in the past. Because of this, she's forced to be meticulous about the outfits she wears in the content she posts online, favoring baggy hoodies over low-cut tops. But no deepfake she has encountered in the past has looked as lifelike as the images Grok was able to generate. “This new wave is too realistic,” Emma says. “Like, it almost looks like it could be my body.”


	Last week, Emma took a break from her usual content to post a 10-minute video warning her followers about her experience. “Women are being asked to give up their bodies whenever they post a photo of themselves now,” Emma says. “Anything they post now has the ability to be undressed, in any way a person wants, and they can do whatever they want with that photo of you.” 


	Support poured in, but so did further harassment. On Reddit, users tried to track down and spread the images of Emma. In our call, she checked to see if some of the image edits she was aware of were still up on X. They were. “Oh, my God,” she says, letting out a defeated sigh. “It has 15,000 views. Oh, that's so sad.” 

	











	According to Megan Cutter, chief of victim services for the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, this is one of the biggest challenges for survivors of digital sexual abuse. “Once the image is created, even if it's taken down from the place where it was initially posted, it could have been screenshotted, downloaded, shared,” Cutter says. “That's a really complex thing for people to grapple with.”


	While it might seem counterintuitive, Cutter recommends survivors screenshot and preserve evidence of the images to help law enforcement and platforms take action. Survivors can file reports on StopNCII.org, a free Revenge Porn Hotline tool that helps detect and remove nonconsensual intimate images, or NCII.


	“It's not that abuse is new; it's not that sexual violence is new,” Cutter says. “It's that this is a new tool, and it allows for proliferation at a scale that I don't think we've seen before, and that I'm not sure we're prepared to navigate as a society.” 


	On Tuesday, Senate lawmakers passed the Defiance Act, a bill that would allow victims of nonconsensual sexual deepfakes to sue for civil damages. (It now heads to the House for a vote.) California's attorney general also launched an investigation into Grok, following other countries. 


	According to a 2024 report by U.K.-based nonprofit Internet Matters, an estimated 99 percent of nude deepfakes are of women and girls. “A lot of the ‘nudify' apps are these small things that pop up, and are easily sort of smacked down and easily vilified [by] everybody,” Winters says. Last year, Meta sued the maker of CrushAI, a platform capable of creating nude deepfakes, alleging that it violated long-standing rules. In 2024, Apple removed three generative AI apps being used to make nude deepfakes following an investigation by 404 Media. Winters says that Grok and X appear to be facing “incomplete” backlash, in part because the platform is not explicitly marketed as a “nudifying” app, and because Musk is “extraordinarily powerful.”


	“There is less willingness by regulators, by advertisers, by other people to cross him,” Winters says.

	That reluctance only heightens the risks of Grok's “nudifying” capabilities. “When one company is able to do something and is not held fully accountable for it,” Winters says, “it sends a signal to other Big Tech giants that they can do the next thing.”


	Sitting in her home in Texas, Emma feels deflated that any number of image edits are still floating around the internet. She worries that trolls will send the images to her sponsors, which could hurt the professional relationships she relies on. She's heard the argument that the people who are prompting Grok to create illegal content should be held accountable instead of the tool, but she doesn't completely buy it. “We're, like, handing them a loaded gun for free and saying, ‘please feel free to do whatever you want,'” she says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Bank of England prepares for potential financial crisis from UFO and alien disclosure","https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109746/bank-of-england-prepares-for-potential-financial-crisis-from-ufo-and-alien-disclosure/index.html","Mon, 19 Jan 2026 03:11:01 GMT","

The UK and Bank of England are preparing for a potential financial crisis if the US government says we are not alone, and that UFOs, UAPs, USOs, and alien life are disclosed.

Former BoE analyst, Helen McCaw, has previously worked in financial security at the Bank of England, helping develop plans for theoretical economic crises, including the one now that she sees as a possibility in a full UFO and aliens disclosure scenario.

She wrote to Andrew Bailey, who is the Bank of England's governor, urging him to set out contingencies in case the Trump administration and the White House confirms the existence of alien life, reports The Times.

McCaw wrote: ""There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods. If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability"".

McCaw has penned out a few different potential future scenarios that would happen if disclosure on alien life happened, with one of them being a jump to Bitcoin as a ""safe haven asset"" due to the possible obliteration of trust in traditional, government-based power structures.

She added: ""There might be a rush to digital currencies such as bitcoin, which may prove appealing if people question the legitimacy of government and lose trust in government-backed assets"".

""The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions"".

If there are two things the internet loves talking about, it's conspiracy theories, and who may or may not be a narcissist.

Misinformation and conspiratorial thinking are long-running concerns, while narcissism has become TikTok's favourite armchair diagnosis.

Research shows the two concepts, though seemingly separate, may actually be closely linked.

In my new research published in the Journal of Personality and Individual Differences, more than 600 people completed surveys, and the findings show higher scores on measures of narcissism were linked to belief in conspiracy theories and misinformation.

Importantly, this result held true regardless of how educated the participants were.

Scholarly evidence shows people with lower levels of education are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. But that's only part of the story.

We also know that historically, conspiracy theories have done well in times of uncertainty, including during war, economic downturn and widespread hardship (such as the COVID pandemic).

A prominent explanation for this is that conspiracy beliefs serve underlying psychological needs. These include providing answers when things are unclear or uncertain, providing a sense of control by identifying a powerful group to take action against, and for social reasons, such as showing others which political groups you belong to and signalling loyalty to those groups.

I wanted to find out when educated people might also “fall down the rabbit hole”, and learn more about which psychological needs lead them to do so.

Over two studies, 660 adults were asked to complete a series of questionnaires to measure narcissistic traits. These included:

The participants then answered how much they believed in certain conspiracy theories. One example put to them was: “the assassination of John F. Kennedy was not committed by the lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, but was rather a detailed, organised conspiracy to kill the President”.

They also attempted to distinguish true statements from misinformation, including “Ebola Virus Caused by US Nuclear Weapons Testing, New Study Says”.

The participants had varying levels of education, ranging from high school or less through to having a masters or doctorate. They also had a variety of political beliefs.

People who scored higher in narcissistic traits were more accepting of conspiracy theories and misinformation.

Importantly, this was true regardless of how educated the person was.

The results showed these traits might offset the differences linked to education. When these traits were above average, highly educated people were just as likely to endorse these beliefs as those without any formal education.

Education often provides people with skills in evaluating evidence, critical thinking and a shared understanding of how we can find truth.

However, humans are quite good at “motivated reasoning”: using reasoning skills to come to pleasing conclusions because we want to believe something.

This type of reasoning is often linked to unfounded beliefs – those without evidence. When people feel superior to experts, want to feel special, or need a concrete answer during uncertain times, they might use their reasoning to hold certain beliefs despite a lack of evidence.

My research suggests educated people are not immune to this.

It's important to recognise there's a variety of factors that determine people's beliefs and which ones they hold most dear. These include the above personality traits and thinking styles, as well as factors like identity, how people view themselves and show support for the groups they belong to.

These findings suggest even highly educated people can be resistant to changing their mind if underlying psychological needs are threatened. It's important to keep these in mind when discussing controversial topics. This is true whether talking with friends, family, or those with opposing political views to our own.

We should also take into consideration our own motivations and needs, and how these might influence our points of view. Doing so might help in finding common ground and improve social discourse on a larger scale.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday.

Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.

The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans.

For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual.

But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences for it.

Trump said in late August that he was firing Cook from the seven-member Fed Board, citing claims that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two homes she owns. 

Cook denies any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any crime.

She sued Trump in federal court in D.C., seeking to block her removal.

A district court judge there on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing her as the lawsuit continued. A federal appeals court soon after upheld that order.

The Department of Justice, in filings with the Supreme Court, has called the lower court orders barring Cook's removal ""yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to  remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause.""

Growing evidence points to a close neurophysiological link between brain and body. Recent rodent studies have shown that the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which underlies expectations of positive outcomes, also modulates immune function. However, it remains unknown whether a similar brain-immune link exists in humans and whether it involves conscious positive expectations. In a preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial, we used fMRI neurofeedback (NF) to train healthy participants to increase reward mesolimbic activity through self-chosen mental strategies, followed by an immune challenge with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and assessments of HBV antibody (HBVab) levels. Eighty-five participants were randomized to (1) reward mesolimbic upregulation (n = 34), (2) non-mesolimbic control upregulation (n = 34) or (3) no-NF control (n = 17). Prespecified primary outcomes were (1) differences in reward mesolimbic activation between NF groups, (2) correlation between reward mesolimbic upregulation and post-vaccination HBVab changes across both NF groups and (3) group differences in post-vaccination HBVab changes. Both NF groups showed significant increases in reward mesolimbic activation. Notably, greater ventral tegmental area (VTA) upregulation—but not nucleus accumbens or control region activation—was associated with larger post-vaccination increases in HBVab levels (r = 0.31, P = 0.018). Sustained VTA upregulation was further linked to mental strategies involving positive expectations. Post-vaccination antibody levels did not differ between groups, and no adverse effects occurred. Together, these findings suggest that consciously generated positive expectations can engage reward circuitry to influence immune function, a process that may be leveraged for non-invasive immune modulation.

Whole-brain results for the high vs neutral reward anticipation contrast during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. The overlaid predefined meta-analytic masks of the mesolimbic system, taken from refs. 57,66, are shown in white. Abbreviations: Nucleus Accumbens (Nac); Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). Statistical threshold was set at a cluster-level p(FWE) < .05. b. ROIs of the reward mesolimbic network. The offline functional localization of the reward mesolimbic regions. For the VTA, the predefined anatomical mask57 was intersected with the high>neutral reward anticipation maps presented in A. For the bilateral Nac, a 5 mm sphere was created around the peak activation voxel within the 8 mm predefined Nac masks (defined based on reward anticipation meta-analysis66).

a. Conceptual scheme. In randomized ROI-NF, each participant is randomly assigned to one of K subgroups of different functionally defined neural targets (colored in pink, orange, and yellow). While in each sub-group, a specific neural target is modulated along with the general task processes (colored in green – control, learning and reward processes), group-level modulations (right panel) include only the averaged (non-specific) general processes common to all subgroups (that is the target process specific to each subgroup is averaged over the whole group). Conversely, in a typical experimental NF group, all participants modulate both the general and target processes (colored in green and blue, respectively). Therefore, group-level modulations include both the general processes and the reoccurring target process modulations. Consequently, differences in outcome effects (such as immune function) between groups can be attributed solely to the target-specific effects (Figure adapted from ref. 10). b. Neural networks of subgroups. Targets of the randomized ROI-NF control condition. All target networks were selected from meta-analyses of fMRI studies on specific functional processes. MNI coordinates: T1. Spatial navigation network76: right medial temporal lobe: 26, -35, -11; left medial temporal lobe: -26, -47, -9; left posterior cingulate: -15, -59, 19; T2.

Following practice, participants fill out the MSQ-NF for each strategy applied during the session, based on their logged choices during training. “Other” strategies, as well as those with predefined names, are verbally described, and then each strategy is labeled across the MSQ space.

Ianalumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody drug being studied for its potential to treat various B cell-driven autoimmune diseases, received a Breakthrough Therapy designation for Sjögren disease from the FDA, according to a press release from its developer, Novartis.

Ianalumab has a distinct mechanism of action in that it uses B-cell activating factor receptor blockade to deplete B cells and impede both their survival and activation.

Looking ahead, Novartis is seeking global approval of ianalumab. If granted, this global approval would make ianalumab the first targeted therapy for the management and care of Sjögren disease.

This Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on the results of NEPTUNUS-1 and NEPTUNUS-2, which are multicenter, phase 3 clinical trials. The NEPTUNUS-1 and NEPTUNUS-2 trials were specifically designed to evaluate changes in European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) from baseline to week 48 in patients receiving ianalumab vs placebo.

The outcomes for the trials were presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2025 Annual Meeting in October.

The results presented there on NEPTUNUS-1 highlighted trends in ESSDAI score from baseline to week 48, showing a drop of 6.4 vs 5.1 points with ianalumab vs placebo.

Other data presented on NEPTUNUS-2 also looked at outcomes between baseline and week 48, with a reported ESSDAI score decline of 6.5 vs 5.5 points with ianalumab vs placebo.

All in all, these research outcomes showed that ianalumab use led to a clinically significant decline in patient burden and better overall disease activity. When it came to safety and overall prevalence of adverse events, the results from both investigations indicated that ianalumab had similar outcomes to placebo.

Previously, the FDA granted ianalumab a fast-track designation in 2016.

In a pooled analysis of 25 studies from 23 countries, a two-question screening tool demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy for identifying individuals with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), with a pooled sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity of 0.86.

“The results demonstrate a high diagnostic accuracy (pooled sensitivity, 0.88; and specificity, 0.86) of the screening questionnaire in detecting HS in healthy adults,” the study authors wrote. This questionnaire, they concluded, “may prove useful in triaging, ensuring that only individuals fitting the criteria see specialized dermatological care.”

The study was led by Dorra Bouazzi, Department of Dermatology, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark, and was published online on January 9 in the British Journal of Dermatology.

The exclusive inclusion of GHiSA studies may have limited the generalizability of the findings. The study had a high risk for bias in reference standard and patient flow domains, which lowered the validity of the study. Additionally, the absence of likelihood ratios limited comprehensive assessment of the diagnostic test.

Bouazzi reported receiving research grant support from Region Sjaelland – Medicinsporet. The Section for Biostatistics and Evidence-Based Research at the Parker Institute was supported by a core grant from the Oak Foundation. Several authors reported receiving honoraria, grants, and other funding from Abbott, AbbVie, bioMérieux, Brahms GmbH, and various sources. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

Conservative and Labour MPs have become the first voices to call for a boycott of the World Cup this summer after Trump announced new tariffs on the UK.

Simon Hoare and Kate Osborne said the government needed to ‘push every button and pull every lever' to show its objection to the US president's threats towards Greenland.

Mr Hoare, a senior Conservative MP, told Metro that could include not going to the World Cup, a day after he called for the King's state visit to the US to be cancelled.

Labour MP Ms Osborne agreed that the tournament should be boycotted because Trump was ‘threatening Greenland and attacking our own government'.

The Republican president has become the face of the 2026 World Cup, which the United States are hosting this summer along with Canada and Mexico.

He was also awarded FIFA's inaugural peace prize in December.

America will host 78 of the 104 fixtures in the expanded 48-team men's World Cup.

England and Scotland have both qualified for the tournament in June, while Wales or Northern Ireland could also book their places through the play-offs.

Questions have been raised about whether European countries should go to the tournament after Trump announced he would place 10% tariffs on the eight countries over their refusal to let Trump take over Greenland.

German politician Jurgen Hardt said on Friday that boycotting the World Cup could be a ‘last resort' to ‘to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue'.

Mr Hoare, who represents North Dorset, has joined those calls, telling Metro that dropping out of the spectacle would ‘refocus Trump's mind'.

He told Metro: ‘We should send as many messages as possible to the Trump administration and the American people that there are certain red lines in regards to upholding sovereignty and international affairs.

‘If that means not going to the World Cup then we shouldn't go to the World Cup.

‘If it means cancelling a state visit, then we should cancel the state visit.

‘Trump is looking forward to America hosting the World Cup and all the benefits that accords to America.

‘We need to send a message to the White House that leadership has responsibilities.

‘It doesn't allow you to behave like some modern-day pirate, gangster, bully.'

On Sunday, Mr Hoare called for King Charles' spring visit to Washington to be scrapped – a suggestion endorsed by the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey.

Now a boycott of the World Cup has also found agreement across the political spectrum.

Labour's Kate Osborne MP, who is chair of the Women's Football All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), said she ‘supports those calling for a boycott.'

The Jarrow and Gateshead East representative told Metro: ‘Trump's appalling record on human rights, climate change, his flagrant contempt for the rule of law, his attacks on democracy, and an illegal war in Venezuela is not enough for him.

‘Now he is threatening Greenland and attacking our own government & politicians.

‘Last year there was huge public support for the successful campaign to refuse to legitimise Trump by allowing him the honour of addressing Parliament.

‘We need to see the same now in relation to the World Cup.

‘The USA should not be able to participate in the World Cup, let alone be part of hosting it, so yes I support those calling for a boycott.'

Three Lions Pride, England's official LGBTQ+ fan group, also announced last week they would not have a ‘visible presence' at the 2026 Men's World Cup due to what they called a ‘dangerous rollback of human rights' in the US.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to take place from June 11 to July 19, with 16 cities hosting the tournament – 11 in the US, three in Mexico, and two in Canada.

Labour MP Richard Burgon stopped short of endorsing a boycott, but called for the US to be barred from hosting the tournament.

He told Metro: ‘With Trump ripping up the international rulebook, letting the US host the World Cup would be a political gift to him and a complete own goal.

‘You don't reward bullies — you have to stand up to them. The World Cup should be moved to another country to send a clear message that international law still matters.'

The US president announced over the weekend that he would be imposing 10% tariffs on the UK, increased to 25% from June 1, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.

He said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.

The move sparked outrage across Europe, with Sir Keir Starmer telling an emergency press conference today that tariffs were ‘completely wrong'.

He added: ‘It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland security as a justification for economic pressure.'

In a joint statement warning about the potential impact of such a move, the eight affected NATO countries warned Trump's actions could create a ‘dangerous downward spiral'.

They said: ‘We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.

‘Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind.

‘Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.'

Metro has approached the Football Association and the Government for comment.
