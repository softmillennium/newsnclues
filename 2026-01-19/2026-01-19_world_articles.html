The roughly $250 million sale of Venezuelan crude went to Vitol, a Geneva-based energy and commodity trading firm whose US arm is headquartered in Houston. Addison, who attended a recent White House meeting with other top oil executives, donated $6 million total to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign via several super PACs, including $5 million to MAGA Inc. US Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), noted on social media that Vitol has a “criminal history of bribing foreign governments” and called the Venezuelan oil deal “fundamentally corrupt.” “Trump took Venezuela's oil at gunpoint, and gave it to one of his biggest campaign donors,” Murphy wrote. After clearing final regulatory and legal approval, the firm can use them to make a considerable profit turning newly available Venezuelan oil into gasoline. The company that would be acquired by an Elliott affiliate is Citgo, the Houston-based refining firm owned by Venezuela's state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Citgo owns refineries in Illinois, Louisiana and Texas that are well-positioned to profit off the millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil that Trump says will be steered to US refineries because it is a particularly heavy blend of crude that is difficult to process. Only certain refineries, like those run by Citgo, are equipped to handle it. “After illegally and unconstitutionally striking Venezuela, Trump is now selling Venezuelan oil through a campaign donor, and funneling the proceeds to an offshore account in Qatar — creating a potential slush fund with no accountability, oversight, or guardrails for Trump and his allies,” US Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote late Sunday. “His continued abuse of power doesn't serve the Venezuelan people or the American people — and it certainly doesn't lower costs for Americans.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

POTUS is using trade as an instrument of political coercion. The EU cannot simply move on to business as usual.” German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil also signaled on Monday that European nations are at the end of their rope when it comes to Trump's relentless threats against them, reported Bloomberg. “There is a legally established European toolbox that can respond to economic blackmail with very sensitive measures, and we should now examine the use of these measures.” European officials said in a report published by Politico on Monday that they were considering fully breaking with the US over Trump's demands of territorial concessions, as they no longer feel that the US can be a trusted international partner. Europeans aren't the only ones criticizing Trump's latest actions, as Melinda St. Louis, director of Global Trade Watch at US-based government watchdog Public Citizen, said the president's latest tariffs over Greenland show that he has never cared about protecting American jobs, but only about exerting power.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US justice department announced it is investigating protesters in Minnesota who disrupted church services Kristi Noem first denied that federal agents were using chemical agents against protesters, then after being shown video footage turned to blaming the protesters themselves, as tensions continued to run high amid the Trump administration's surge of federal officers into Minneapolis. A federal judge on Friday had ordered that federal law enforcement stop using pepper spraying against peaceful protesters, whom Noem has accused of attempting to hinder the immigration crackdown. Noem first denied the judge's finding, but after being shown a video of chemical agents being used on four occasions, she backtracked and said her department “only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe”. Tensions continue to run high in Minneapolis, with the Pentagon ordering around 1,500 active-duty soldiers stationed in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment, which Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has described as a “ridiculous” overreaction to largely peaceful protests against the violent behaviour of ICE agents. It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts,” she told the Associated Press. He has defended ICE tactics in Minnesota such as swapping out license plates and using pepper spray on protesters. Those tactics have inflamed an atmosphere that the Minneapolis parks and recreation department cited as the reason for canceling youth sports on Friday and Sunday “out of an abundance of caution”. Meanwhile, the newly installed Laotian American mayor of St Paul, Kaohly Her, said she had “received advice to carry my passport with me because they may try to target me based on what I look like as well”. “ICE agents were physically restricting me from seeing them,” one immigration attorney who asked not to be identified told ABC. A DHS spokesperson denied the claims, saying all detainees “have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers” and said “all detainees receive full due process”.</p>

New Jersey musician said during concert in home state that US core values ‘have never been as endangered' as now

Bruce Springsteen used a Saturday concert to decry what he called the “Gestapo tactics” of the Trump administration's surge of immigration officers and said the country's founding values “have never been as endangered as they are right now”.

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it's worth speaking out, and it's worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump's actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump's authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society. They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.”

Donald Trump has responded to Springsteen's remarks by calling the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member “highly overrated”, “not a talented guy” and a “pushy, obnoxious jerk”.</p>

MOSCOW, January 19. /TASS/. The most difficult situation with power supply disruptions is currently reported in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and the cities of Dnepropetrovsk, Krivoy Rog, Odessa, Kharkov, and Chernigov, Vladimir Zelensky said.

Following a meeting with his government members on the subject, Zelensky wrote on Telegram that power supply problems also plagued several settlements near the capital, as well as the regions of Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Sumy, Kharkov and Chernigov.

Reports of emergency power outages have been coming from Kiev and several Ukrainian regions since morning.

Currently, an emergency situation regime is in effect in the Ukrainian energy sector. There are hours-long blackouts every day in all regions. Supermarkets, cafes and restaurants suspend their work, and schools extend holidays or switch to distance learning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Corporate chiefs and government leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress – even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. Some people think we've already entered a new era. Trump's third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela's oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump's peacemaking credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “Board of Peace” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. Carney tentatively agrees to join Trump's ‘Board of Peace' but says details must be worked out The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby: He's blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, will be on hand. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world's most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with some celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” IMF forecasts 3.3% global growth in 2026 as AI boom offsets trade headwinds The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbours, while nearly 70 per cent believed institutional leaders – such as from business or government – deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report ahead of the Davos event which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16 per cent last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than US$18-trillion. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world's population lives in poverty, the group said. With such concerns filtering through to policy-makers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. Companies like Microsoft, India's Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike have joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States – a USA House is making a debut this year – to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. Critics have long accused the annual meeting in Davos of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump's return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. “It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland's Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin marked Orthodox Epiphany with a traditional icy dip, his press secretary Dmitry Peskov said. "Naturally, Epiphany is a great holiday for him, as for all Orthodox believers who work in the Kremlin." "This is a tradition and many honor it," Peskov noted. Immersing in ice-cold water on Epiphany is not bravado for 73-year-old Putin. The president is known to be a religious man. In addition, he is in excellent physical shape and can afford practicing customs that are extreme for most ordinary people without risk to his health. Back then, Putin was on a trip to St. Petersburg. He plunged into an ice hole at Lake Seliger while visiting the Nilov Monastery in the Tver Region. Peskov explained then that it was not the first experience of Epiphany bathing for the president. Since then, the president's plans for January 19 have been the focus of public interest fueled by videos released by the Kremlin press service in 2021, featuring the Russian president, wearing a sheepskin coat and felt boots, approaching a cross-shaped ice hole, crossing himself, and immersing himself in ice-cold water. According to official reports, since then, Putin took part in Epiphany bathing in the Moscow Region, skipping only 2020 and 2022. In 2020, he was barred from doing this by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2022 he was recommended by medics and the church to avoid the epidemiological situation. During his next visit to Jordan in 2012, Putin took part in the opening ceremony of the Russian Guest House near the site of Jesus Christ's baptism. Epiphany bathing organized in Russia overnight on January 19 is rather a popular tradition than a church rite. The Orthodox Church, however, generally approves of this tradition if it is treated with reverence and poses no health risks.</p>

Speaking to reporters during a regular media briefing, Dmitry Peskov said: “President Putin also received through diplomatic channels an invitation to join this Board of Peace.” CNN has asked the White House for a comment. The ministry's press service said Minsk “highly appreciates that the American side sees Belarus – and this is clearly stated in the text of the address – as a country ready to take on the noble responsibility of building a lasting peace and leading by example, investing in a secure and prosperous future for future generations.” Lukashenko is Putin's closest ally and has been described as Europe's last dictator. However, signs of discontent have already started to appear. Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee issued a statement on Sunday warning that the body proposed by Trump “would have a mandate wider than the implementation of the Gaza Peace Plan.” While it may be imperfect, the UN and the primacy of international law is more important now than ever,” she said in a statement. Described by Trump as the “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled,” the committee will include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump has also invited Israel to join the board as a founding member state, a senior Israeli official told CNN on Monday. According to the official, the invitation was extended to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or another Israeli representative on his behalf. It is unclear how many invitations have been sent out – the information about which countries and global leaders have been asked to join has been coming from the individual states, rather than the White House. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Argentinian President Javier Milei and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also received invitations to join, according to statements from them or their offices. Members of the committee will receive a permanent seat if they pay $1 billion, according to a US official, who told CNN that, while there was no requirement to contribute funds to the board, members who do not make the $1 billion payment will have a three-year term. All funds raised will go toward rebuilding Gaza, the official said, adding that “there will not be exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat that plagues many other international organizations.” The Kremlin's involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been limited, although it did offer to mediate soon after the war started, touting its ties to both Israel and Hamas. Unlike many Western countries, Russia does not officially consider Hamas to be a terror group. CNN's Kevin Liptak and Tal Shalev contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's second-largest economy posted a record trade surplus of US$1.19-trillion in 2025.STR/AFP/Getty Images China reported it had hit its full-year GDP growth target of 5 per cent Monday, with exports to other markets more than compensating for slowing U.S. demand. The Chinese economy bore the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war last year, with both sides engaging in tit-for-tat tariffs that threatened to spiral out of control until Mr. Trump agreed to a new trade deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a summit in South Korea. At one point, Washington imposed cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on most Chinese goods, a rate that threatened to essentially halt exports from China to its largest trading partner. But for all the uncertainty this engendered, in China and global markets, Beijing refused to back down, imposing its own tariffs and negotiating hard ahead of the October agreement. The world's second-largest economy posted a record trade surplus of US$1.19-trillion in 2025, underlining how China remains the dominant global supplier despite competition from developing markets and domestic challenges, including increasing labour costs and a shrinking population. Though growth dropped to 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, raising fears of slowing momentum heading into 2026, Beijing has cause to remain optimistic on this front, having stabilized trade with the U.S. – for now – and agreed to new trade deals with Canada and South Korea, as well as making progress on similar agreements with Britain and the European Union. Opinion: Is more trade with China really a good idea? Indeed, China has been helped in this regard by Mr. Trump: The U.S. President's advisers once framed tariffs as a means of containing Beijing, but instead Washington's all-out global trade war has driven many countries – Canada among them – closer to China. That includes even the EU, where long-standing concerns about oversupply and a yawning trade deficit are being offset by new threats of U.S. tariffs over EU support for Greenland and even a potential invasion by the U.S. of the Danish territory. For all that China's export economy – long the engine of its stratospheric growth in recent decades – remains relatively rosy, domestic consumption did not improve significantly in 2025, despite concerted efforts to boost demand both to offset external pressures and reduce China's increasingly politically toxic trade deficit with overseas partners. Chinese policy-makers have vowed to “significantly” boost domestic consumption over the next five years, including by adopting proactive fiscal measures. These policies could yet “deliver notable effects in 2026,” Prof. Xu said. However, falling property prices – investment in the sector slumped 17.2 per cent last year – high youth unemployment and a weak social safety net have all combined to drive down domestic demand. Chinese consumers have so far responded tepidly to stimulus measures such as vouchers or government-backed electronics trade-in programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaker Mike Johnson is actively working to unite his conference behind another Republican-only policy bill ahead of the midterms, with members clamoring for more wins and eager not to waste what they fear could be the waning days of their majority. Despite facing one of the smallest House margins in history, Johnson has outlined an extraordinarily aggressive legislative plan for 2026 that, if successful, Republicans believe could help preserve their fragile hold on the chamber next year — and potentially protect the speaker's own political survival. And the Louisiana Republican is moving quickly, telling CNN he held a “productive” meeting last week with key chairmen and has spoken with Senate GOP Leader John Thune in recent days. I think we can do something,” he said last week, discussing the prospect of Republicans passing a party-line package under a process known as reconciliation. And it will be difficult for Johnson to start cobbling together a new bill when he is still constantly quelling internal fights about GOP priorities on the floor and begging members to show up for votes with no room to spare in their narrow margin. Last week alone, GOP leaders lost a floor vote they didn't even realize was in trouble and were forced to pull several other measures from their agenda. Trying and failing — like Republicans did with their Obamacare repeal effort in 2017 ahead of Trump's last midterm — could highlight GOP ineptitude just months before the election. But he also offered a reality check: “We barely had the votes to defund NPR. I don't know how aggressively we'll be able to reform some of the things.” GOP lawmakers acknowledge it will be much more difficult to deliver another package after Congress passed Trump's tax break, spending cuts and immigration bill last year. To start, there is no clear idea of what the bill would include. One major faction of House Republicans, known as the Republican Study Committee, is pushing for housing policies and an expansion of health care savings, which they say would also cut $1 trillion from the federal deficit. They even have a name: “Making the American Dream Affordable Again.” “I think we have some really good proposals that leadership is looking at, that's in line with what the president wants to do, some creative ideas,” the group's chairman, Rep. August Pfluger of Texas, told CNN, saying the ideas have vast support among the American people, not just GOP voters. … There's a lot of legislative proposals that truly are 80-20 issues.” Other conservatives are pushing their Senate colleagues to relitigate a series of messy fights they already lost on pieces of the first bill that were deemed out of compliance with strict Senate rules, such as immigration policy. And there isn't even consensus on whether Johnson should attempt another party-line push at all. Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he'd rather the GOP sit down and “really regroup,” and then focus on issues like health care that he thinks the party has been ignoring. “I pray to God we don't do something stupid,” Van Drew said when asked about a possible second Trump agenda bill. “I don't give a damn how many reconciliation bills you do unless it's going to have a health care component to it.” But they are also feeling immense pressure from many in their conference, who have been frustrated by months of slow legislating, including a lengthy shutdown that kept members out of town for 43 days. GOP leaders are also driven to shield the president from being perceived as a lame duck. Many are also increasingly worried about their party's fate in the November elections, as voters warn that Trump isn't doing enough to shore up the economy. Still, one top Republican, Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, acknowledged that fears over losing the House majority isn't enough to unite the conference behind a bill. So, if everybody comes along and says, ‘We agree with what's being put in the bill,' that would be awesome,” Hern said. Hern said the biggest concern for leadership will be: “Do we have enough in there that satisfies everybody?” And this time, Johnson is dealing with a House margin that will require perfect unity within his famously unruly conference. There is also no guarantee that any House effort would have a future in the Senate, where Thune has had to contend with his own unpredictability among his conference. There are also concerns that the GOP hasn't yet done a good enough job of selling the bill it passed last year. Johnson and his leadership team have been repeatedly stressing to their members that they need to better sell the package back home. Voters, they argue, are still understanding the impact of the massive piece of legislation that included broad tax cuts for Americans as well as big changes to tighten access to Medicaid and food stamps that conservatives cheered. The bill largely extended tax cuts Trump passed in his first term — and showing voters the benefit of not losing the tax breaks has been harder than expected to campaign on, some have acknowledged. Republicans who are facing tough reelection fights are among the most vocal in pushing for another big Trump package, arguing it would help them to expand their list of legislative wins. “I think maybe it would relieve some of President Trump's frustration with the filibuster and demonstrate we can actually get things done,” said Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is in the fight of his political life in a three-way primary in Texas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's capital Kyiv, home to over 3 million people, has rarely been prepared for winter. Frozen, icy sidewalks, bursting pipes, and year-long infrastructure collapse have been a key feature of the city under Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Now, following Russia's Jan. 9 attack, Kyiv has been pushed into a humanitarian crisis, leaving residents without heating, hot water, and electricity through the coldest winter in years. President Volodymyr Zelensky has been open about who he holds to blame. Zelensky called the situation in Kyiv "especially difficult," slammed the local authorities, and compared the capital's readiness to that of other cities — heavily bombarded Kharkiv — saying they were better equipped to handle the consequences of Russian attacks. "Kyiv, unfortunately, has done much less — far too little has been done in the capital. And even these past few days, I haven't seen sufficient effort — all of this must be urgently corrected," Zelensky said on Jan. 14. Klitschko hit back, dismissing the accusations as "groundless" and politicized. "Lots of things could have been done. But it seems like everyone was looking at each other, prepared to blame the other party for the misgivings that ordinary people are going through right now." Observers see the back-and-forth as a power struggle for control over Ukraine's capital and its finances, while also pointing to Klitschko's presidential ambitions. Zelensky's leverage over the city comes from Kyiv's unique status, both as a city and as a region. While Klitschko maintains both posts, during the all-out war, Zelensky has appointed Tymur Tkachenko to lead Kyiv's Military Administration. Klitschko has accused Tkachenko of trying to take over the mayor's powers. The standoff between Klitschko and Zelensky unfolds as Kyiv faces a dire situation. Since Russia began its consistent campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure in 2022, the defense of the country's energy grid has taken center stage, with authorities reporting on the construction of protective structures for energy facilities. "We had a state of emergency in the energy sector for a couple of years already, so we should have changed the status quo of how to manage this situation a long time ago." According to Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy prime minister and the community and territories development minister, Kyiv authorities failed to properly deploy a backup power system, critical infrastructure lacked backup energy sources, and there was no public communication with residents about what to do in case of power outages. He also leads the task force dedicated to protecting energy infrastructure. Kyiv has the largest local budget among Ukrainian cities, with a surplus. Voitsitska argues that the government could have reviewed local expenditures, helping to better prioritize its spending. However, despite having the surplus, Klitschko "irresponsibly spent funds," including on park renovation, she said. The local authorities may still face bureaucratic hurdles, requiring approval from the central government to make certain decisions. But the tensions between Zelensky and Klitschko seem to be disrupting communication. "It's a pity that instead of supporting (the mayor), we are killing ourselves," Klitschko's adviser told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity. The Kyiv mayor said that he hasn't had any personal meetings with Zelensky since the all-out war began. Olena Pavlenko, president and co-founder of the Ukrainian DiXi Group think tank, said many international projects "did a lot for Kyiv's heat supply, with generators, with other stuff." "The question is how much of that stuff was installed and whether it was destroyed before or not," she told the Kyiv Independent. Despite his popularity abroad, Klitschko often faces criticism at home for how he handles the city, with his reputation further marred by illegal construction and corruption allegations involving his allies. From the start of his presidency, Zelensky sought a loyalist to head the Kyiv City State Administration. Zelensky reportedly considered ousting Klitschko from his role as head of the Kyiv City State Administration after a Russian attack killed three people near a shelter in Kyiv in 2023. "If we focus on finding who is guilty and punishing them in the middle of winter, I think we might end up with no heat at all," Pavlenko said. "I would suggest keeping these investigations and punishments until at least after the heating season is over." Despite the ongoing flurry of diplomacy, here in Ukraine, we see no readiness from Russia to end its brutal war, as relentless attacks continue.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The comments come as Trump threatens to impose up to 25% tariffs on European countries that oppose his ambitions to annex Greenland, the world's largest island and semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. "NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Trump has repeatedly staked his claim to the strategically valuable island, not ruling out the use of military force after Danish and Greenlandic authorities rejected his offer to buy it. European leaders have hit back at Trump's threats and are reportedly drawing up their own economic countermeasures, including tariffs or restrictions on U.S. companies. The escalating dispute is seen as the most serious rupture in transatlantic relations in a decade, a development openly praised by Russia. Trump has justified his claim to the island on national security grounds and accused Danish authorities of insufficient investment in its defense, arguing it makes Greenland vulnerable to Russia and China. Washington already operates a military base on the island, and a 1951 treaty with Denmark grants it broad rights to station forces there. European leaders have rejected the accusations and dispatched a small contingent of troops for exercises on the island last week. "The world is not secure unless we have complete and total control of Greenland," Trump wrote, according to Bloomberg. The U.S. president reiterated his stance in a phone interview with NBC News, once again declining to rule out military options. He also rebuked European leaders for pushing back on the matter. "Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them," Trump told NBC News. In private discussions with top aides, Trump has also complained about Canada's alleged inability to counter the Russian and Chinese threat in the Arctic region, NBC News reported, citing undisclosed sources. Trump's warnings about the Russian threat contrast with his often conciliatory stance toward Moscow, especially in regard to the war in Ukraine. Only last week, the U.S. president declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks peace, accusing Kyiv of standing in the way despite ongoing talks on a peace deal between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Moscow is currently studying the proposal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to state news agency TASS. "NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,'" Trump said, accusing Denmark of being unable to counter it. Czechia will not sell its L-159 light combat aircraft to Ukraine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Jan. 19, despite Czech President Petr Pavel advocating for the move. Russia struck energy infrastructure overnight in “several regions,” cutting power in five oblasts as freezing temperatures add strain to Ukraine's grid, Deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said. According to Axios reporter Barak Ravid, the Russian official will meet Trump's envoys, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, on Jan. 20 to discuss the Washington-backed peace plan for Ukraine. Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures. Ukrainian and U.S. officials will continue peace proposal discussions during the World Economic Forum in Davos, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said Jan. 18. After quickly hitting the initial target, organizers raised the goal to 2 million zloty ($550,000) — a figure that has since been surpassed, with donations now exceeding 2.4 million zloty (around $660,000).</p>
