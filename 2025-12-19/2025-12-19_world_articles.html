                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. A board of commissioners in North Carolina decided earlier this month to dissolve the entire library board of trustees in response to that board refusing to remove a single book featuring a transgender child character from the shelves. The book in question, “Call Me Max,” features a character who says he wants to be called a name that better matches his gender identity — Max. In October, in response to a parent's complaint about the book, the Randolph County Public Library's Board of Trustees voted 5-2 against removing or relocating the book in its libraries, with some trustee members describing such an action as being a “slippery slope” toward censorship. “We have the responsibility to serve all sides of issues.” Armfield added that it was “parents' responsibility to choose what they believe are appropriate books for their children.” Kyle Lukoff, the author of “Call Me Max,” shared in a social media post his distress at the trustees being removed. “I just feel so bad for the people who live in that community and love their library.” Over the past several years, school and community libraries have seen an increase in right-wing attempts to ban books, particularly those with LGBTQ and/or nonwhite characters. Bans on such books make it difficult for kids to feel seen and included, experts say. “When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part,” Rudine Sims Bishop, sociology professor emerita at Ohio State University, wrote in a paper earlier this year. Zane McNeill, former news writer at Truthout and current health equity and civil rights fellow at Lawyers for Good Government, also panned the Rudolph County commission's actions. “Librarians and library boards nationwide pushed back, calling these bans what they are: censorship.” At a time when authoritarianism gains power by casting trans people as the ‘Other,' every local struggle — from libraries to courtrooms, universities, and state capitals — matters. December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts decry ‘neocolonialist' Guinea-Bissau study after Trump administration changed advice for US babies The Trump administration has indicated that it will fund a $1.6m study on hepatitis B vaccination of newborns in the west African country of Guinea-Bissau, where nearly one in five adults live with the virus – a move that researchers call “highly unethical” and “extremely risky”. The news follows an official change in recommendations on hepatitis B vaccines at birth from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which called the shots an “individual” decision, despite decades of safe and effective vaccination and no evidence of harm. It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world. “He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.” When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action. “We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote. It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. Yamey noted: “There's already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?” “This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said. In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added. “We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place in Guinea-Bissau instead of the United States or Denmark, they said. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said. The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said. “In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it's still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote about red flags in Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.” “I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said. The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has also written about major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn. After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they're now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.” “Because Robert F Kennedy Jr is an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said. Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.” It's hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm's way by the administration.”</p>

The treaty says that individuals from nonsignatory nations can be held liable for crimes committed in the territory of a member state. Last year, the ICC issued warrants for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza, including murder and forced starvation in a war that has left more than 250,000 Palestinians dead, wounded, or missing. The affected judges have recently described how the US sanctions have left them and their families — who are also blacklisted — “wiped out economically and socially.” “It will continue to carry out its mandate with independence and impartiality, in full accordance with the Rome Statute and in the interest of victims of international crimes.” The US government has imposed sanctions on two additional ICC judges in order to shield Israeli officials from charges of grave international crimes.These sanctions are the latest attempt by the Trump administration to blatantly interfere with independent justice.— Human Rights Watch (@hrw.org) 2025-12-18T20:01:41.893084605Z The US government has imposed sanctions on two additional ICC judges in order to shield Israeli officials from charges of grave international crimes.These sanctions are the latest attempt by the Trump administration to blatantly interfere with independent justice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Man known as ‘John' expected to be eligible for $50,000 reward from FBI for providing details on the suspect A man known publicly so far only as “John” posted key information on the Reddit platform about an encounter with the suspect that caught the attention of investigators, while Reddit users urged him to go to the police with his tips. The man approached a police officer in Providence, the Rhode Island capital where the Ivy League school is based, and said “I think you are looking for me,” according to authorities. John reported an unusual encounter at the university with the person who turned out to be the suspect and said he also saw him acting oddly in relation to a rented gray Nissan car with Florida license plates. “He was, in fact, critical to this and certainly everyone in Providence owes this individual a debt of gratitude,” Brett Smiley, the mayor of Providence, said in an interview with CNN on Friday morning. “He came in and was fully forthcoming , provided key details ... We had disparate pieces of information and we had strong suspicions that these pieces of information fit together but it hadn't been corroborated and he was able to do that for us, and so it was really a critical turning point,” Smiley said. The mayor added that John probably had legitimate fear for his safety after an image of him on surveillance footage was released by the authorities but “this was an individual who stepped up and stepped forward for all the right reasons.” Investigators believe Valente was also responsible for shooting dead the MIT professor Nuno FG Loureiro at his home in the Boston suburbs. He later pursued Valente and saw him with the rental car that ultimately helped investigators track him down to Salem, New Hampshire, where Valente was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Thursday night. Smiley said the tipster was, himself, a Brown graduate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no longer famine in Gaza, a United Nations-backed hunger monitor announced on Friday, after an influx of humanitarian aid into the strip following a ceasefire agreed in October between Israel and Hamas. “Following a significant reduction in conflict, a proposed peace plan, and improved access for both humanitarian and commercial food deliveries, food security conditions have improved in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said. “No areas are classified in Famine,” it added. The global watchdog had said in August that parts of Gaza are officially experiencing a “man-made” famine. Famine confirmed in Gaza City, but that's not news to these Palestinians The organization noted, however, that despite these improvements, most of Gaza's population faced high levels of acute food insecurity. “Although humanitarian assistance, including food aid, has increased, only basic survival needs are being met,” the IPC said. “Under a worst-case scenario involving renewed hostilities and a halt in humanitarian and commercial inflows, North Gaza, Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah, and Khan Younis would face a risk of Famine through mid-April 2026,” it said. Israel in August heavily disputed that there was famine in Gaza, saying it was doing all it could to allow aid into the strip. There is no famine in Gaza,” adding that there are “hundreds” of aid trucks entering the strip every day. The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli agency tasked with facilitating aid distribution in Gaza, said that between 600-800 aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip every day, approximately 70% of which carry food. Hamas has previously disputed figures from COGAT, saying that not enough aid is making it into the enclave. CNN, along with other media outlets, has widely reported on hunger and starvation in Gaza. While some people have died of starvation and hunger, others have been killed trying to receive aid at distribution sites. Under the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished or 15% of children suffering from acute malnutrition based on body measurements, and at least two in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea Fagan, writer and co-founder of the Financial Diet website, says that hosting at home is often cheaper than going out for dinner.Chelsea Kyle/Supplied In this era of delivery apps and best new restaurants lists, Chelsea Fagan is somewhat of an anachronist. The millennial writer and co-founder of the Financial Diet website regularly invites friends over for meals and thinks others should, too. Her new book, Having People Over, is not a trad-wife guide, but rather an argument for hosting dinner parties as a way to resist late-stage capitalism and the loneliness epidemic. She spoke to The Globe and Mail from her home in Manhattan. The expense of hosting is a big reason millennials and Zoomers give for not having dinner parties. But you make the argument that hosting at home is often cheaper than going out for dinner. I think, when you look at the data, millennials and especially Gen Z have become accustomed to spending on restaurants, delivery, bars et cetera, essentially outsourcing the food experience to an extent that previous generations never have. And I think we've really become kind of inured to how expensive that actually is, and how much of our budget that dictates. What is lost when we're choosing dinner delivery rather than having a friend come over and cooking a meal for them? Obviously money, but I think we're losing a sense of intimacy and personal touch when we default to a restaurant. If people want a perfectly curated meal experience, where the food, the service, the ambiance, everything is at a professional level and requires no lift on their end, they can go to a restaurant. They come to someone's home not just to be with them in an intimate way and have quality time with them, but also to experience the world through their eyes. I think that there's just a real lack of humanity and the human touch that we experience when we're constantly defaulting to these professional third parties. An honest mess: Is the pressure to deep clean for guests sabotaging our social time? These years really forced me to be creative and thoughtful in a way that I don't have to be any more. It was a lot of potlucks, it was a lot of pulling together what I had. It was a studio apartment, so we were eating dinner next to my bed. I feel like my worst guest experiences have been in the homes of people with a ton of money. Often, the more money we get, the less and less of that touch that we have. Fagan says part of curating isn't just about you being a host, it's about people who show up.Chelsea Kyle/Supplied I had a person who flaked on me earlier this year. I am basically forgetting that she exists. But you have to be a person of your word. This interview has been edited and condensed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled a long-awaited shuffle of deputy ministers that places new people in charge of the government's priority files in areas such as economic growth and national defence. The government is bringing in two outsiders to key positions: Marie-Josée Hogue, who headed the public inquiry into foreign interference in Canadian politics, to Justice; and John McArthur, a policy expert on sustainable development, as a senior adviser in the Privy Council Office. While most of the names taking on new roles are career public servants, Ms. Hogue's appointment was a surprise. Mr. Sabia previously served as the CEO of Hydro-Québec, BCE and Quebec's pension fund. He is also a former federal deputy minister, having led the Finance Department from 2020 to 2023. Chris Forbes, who was deputy minister at Finance, has been moved to the PCO as a senior adviser. He is being replaced by Nick Leswick, a senior official at the Bank of Canada, which Mr. Carney once headed. Mr. Leswick previously led Finance Canada on an interim basis after Mr. Sabia left the position in 2023. Prior to that, Mr. Leswick was associate deputy minister at Finance, a position that involved regular appearances before parliamentary committees to answer questions from MPs and senators about budgetary matters. Heading into a year in which negotiations with First Nations on major projects such as pipelines and critical mineral mines will be key to the government's agenda, the Prime Minister promoted Michelle Kovacevic, associate deputy minister of Indigenous Services, to deputy minister. As for Mr. McArthur, Mr. Carney recruited him from the Brookings Institution's Center for Sustainable Development to become deputy secretary to the cabinet on economic policy. He is a former CEO of Millennium Promise Alliance, an international non-governmental organization. Earlier this year, he co-edited a book at Brookings titled For the World's Profit: How Business Can Support Sustainable Development. He has also been a member of a deputy minister steering committee that guides the federal government's Policy Horizons Canada team, an in-house policy research organization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The paintings of contemporary visual artist Julie Mehretu hang in some of the world's most prestigious art institutions. Renowned for her large-scale abstract and multilayered landscape pieces that explore the themes of history and globalism, Mehretu has earned international acclaim. “We're here standing on the shoulders of giants, as we always are, and hopefully we can also create more of that space for so many others that deserve to be a part of it,” she told CNN's Larry Madowo during a visit to Nairobi. Right now, she and her team at the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), a pan-African artists network, are concluding a series of workshops held across Africa. “We're doing these workshops throughout the continent in five different cities, working on media arts, media and film and trying to really kind of interrogate that space in the kind of deeply mediated world we live in now,” she explained. World-renowned contemporary visual artist Julie Mehretu is known for her large-scale abstract works exploring themes of history and globalism. In an interview with CNN's Larry Madowo in Nairobi, Kenya, Mehretu discusses her mission to help African creatives thrive. How Ethiopian-born abstract artist Julie Mehretu is helping African artists The goal, she added, is “to be able to create a kind of cross-disciplinary, intergenerational conversation between countries and between artist spaces, so we can … not just amplify our voices, but also invent new forms that are just as rigorous and challenging.” Since 1975, the initiative has allowed famed international artists to transform BMW cars into “rolling sculptures,” giving them complete creative freedom. In participating, Mehretu joined the ranks of artists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. As with her other projects, Mehretu wanted this one to stand out, so she proposed an idea that would connect with her home continent. “One of the proposals I said to BMW was what if … we went from Cairo to Cape Town on this old idea of this Pan-African highway, and through that use the car as the common link between these places to then work with filmmakers in each country, to use the road and the car as the protagonists, and then be able to really have Africans tell their own stories?” she said. With this vision and BMW's financial support, Mehretu and her AFMAC co-founder, filmmaker Mehret Mandefro, partnered with local cultural institutions across Africa to conduct workshops aimed at “connecting and strengthening the artistic community within Africa.” The first stop was Lagos, Nigeria, in April 2025. The team then traveled to Tangier, Morocco; Nairobi, Kenya; and Dakar, Senegal, and will arrive in Cape Town, South Africa, next month. “The African continent is this place that has always drawn me back,” Mehretu said. “It's a place that I was born in. And so there's this immense possibility of what can happen but also what can happen with the pan-African kind of possibility, especially in the creative space.” As Mehretu wraps up the workshops, she is preparing to unveil another major project, one unlike anything she's done before. In 2024, the Obama Foundation announced that Mehretu had been selected to create a unique artwork for the presidential library in Chicago. Mehretu described the project as “exciting,” but also “unique” in its challenges. But when asked about her legacy, Mehretu brings the focus back to working with others. She said she wants to be able to “participate in a bigger collective of many makers, painters, and creative artists, sculptors, video artists, media artists, filmmakers (and) musicians.” Mehretu added, “There's this other form of cultural reverberation; there is a collective we are all a part of, and hopefully that creates space for more of that possibility. And I'm excited for what the future holds.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking at the press conference, Nawrocki said that his meeting with Zelensky is "bad news for Russia." "President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit is evidence that in strategic matters and security issues, Poland, Ukraine, and the countries of the region stand together," he added. Nawrocki said that there is a sense in Poland that its aid to Ukraine since the start of the all-out war "has not been sufficiently recognized." Zelensky responded by once again expressing his gratitude to Warsaw. "There are sometimes difficult moments in our societies, but as presidents, we must define policies that keep us united. Kyiv proposed consultations with Warsaw on drone defense, as Russian drones have multiple times entered NATO airspace over the past year. Nawrocki didn't exclude the possibility of delivering MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, and said he expects Kyiv to share drone production technologies with Poland in exchange. Initially considering using frozen Russian assets, officials opted for an alternative financing approach after failing to reach a consensus. Later in the day, Zelensky also met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Since Nawrocki took office, relations between Kyiv and Warsaw have seen growing tensions, despite Poland's role as one of Ukraine's key allies since the start of the full-scale invasion. While Nawrocki expressed support for Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression, he has also spoken critically about Kyiv's EU and NATO ambitions, often highlighting historical grievances. The first exhumation on Ukrainian soil since 2017 began this April in the former village of Puzhnyky, Ternopil Oblast, marking what officials on both sides called a breakthrough after years of a de facto moratorium. Representatives from the National Memory Institutes of Ukraine and Poland held talks in Warsaw on Dec. 19. We count on your respect for our Ukrainian memory," said Zelensky. Based in Kyiv, she focuses on domestic affairs, parliament, and social issues. She also studied at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. The Kyiv Independent on Dec. 9 hosted its first live event in New York City, an evening dedicated to storytelling, investigative journalism, and front-line reporting. Kyiv has already held consultations with European partners and is now preparing for continued discussions with the U.S., according to deligation head, Rustem Umerov. European leaders have approved an interest-free loan for Ukraine, providing a financial lifeline and securing a large portion of the cash-strapped country's financing needs for the next two years. More than 2,400 people have joined the Kyiv Independent community during our anniversary campaign, helping us reach our goal of 25,000 members by the end of 2025. "There are sometimes difficult moments in our societies, but as presidents, we must define policies that keep us united. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Ukraine knows where the Oreshnik would be deployed in Belarus and is sharing this information with its Western allies. In "a new unprecedented special operation" in neutral waters more than 2,000 kilometers from Ukraine, Russia's QENDIL tanker sustained "critical damage" and can no longer be used for its intended purpose, the source claimed. U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a $900 billion defense spending bill on Dec. 18, approving a sweeping package that includes $800 million in military assistance for Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump said Dec. 18 that he hopes Ukraine will move quickly amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war. A Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter crew was killed in combat, the 12th Separate Army Aviation Brigade reported Dec. 18.</p>

MOSCOW, December 19. /TASS/. Kirill Dmitriev, Special representative of the Russian president for economic cooperation with foreign countries, Chief Executive Officer of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has said that abandoning the EU's illegal scheme to use Russian assets to finance Ukraine would be a major victory for law and common sense.

"If true, shelving the EU's originally proposed illegal scheme to tap Russian foreign reserves to fund Ukraine is a major win for law + common sense - and for the voices of reason in Europe that protected EU/euro/ Euroclear," he wrote on the X social network.

According to Dmitriev, it was a "major blow to EU warmongers" led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

EC chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier that participants of the European Union summit had been unable to agree on the expropriation of frozen Russian assets under the guise of a reparations loan to Kiev. Instead of this option, the EU decided to finance Ukraine for the next two years in the amount of 90 bln euros through a pan-European loan at 0%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UNITED NATIONS, December 19. Budapest is ready to host a meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Donald Trump of the United States "at any point of time," as it is also ready to provide a venue for a Ukraine peace summit, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in an interview with TASS. "We are absolutely ready. We are ready at any point of time. We have made this commitment again, both in Washington and in Moscow," Szijjarto said in response to a relevant question. "We understand in both capitals, that if there is something which is not being under dilemma, is the venue of the peace summit, which is a great honor for us, obviously," he added. Hungary has maintained a pro-peace position since the onset of the conflict, the top diplomat noted, despite what he called "enormous political attacks" against Budapest. On October 16, after a telephone conversation with Putin, Trump announced that they had agreed to meet in Budapest soon. However, the summit was later postponed indefinitely because the two sides could not agree on how to achieve a meaningful result in settling the Ukrainian conflict. Both Moscow and Washington said the meeting would take place when the conditions were right.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This article has been updated to include comments from President Volodymyr Zelensky, European Council President Antonio Costa, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko, and further details about the loan. European leaders on Dec. 19 approved an interest-free loan for Ukraine, providing a financial lifeline and securing a large portion of the cash-strapped country's financing needs for the next two years. "Today we approved a decision to provide 90 billion euros ($105.5 billion) to Ukraine for the next two years," Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council, said in a press conference. EU officials had initially sought to underpin a large loan to Ukraine with immobilized Russian central bank reserves, but after failing to secure a consensus, they opted for an alternative financing approach. Kyiv was set to run out of cash by mid-2026. "This (agreement) sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin: This war will not be worth it," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on X. "This is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience," President Zelensky said in a post on social media. "Thank you for the result and unity. Together, we are protecting the future of our continent," he added. Ukraine's finance minister, Serhii Marchenko, also welcomed the decision in a post on social media, adding that the funds "will be directed toward budgetary and defense needs." Later on Dec. 19 in a social media post following a meeting with G7 finance ministers, Marchenko called the $105 billion loan an "interim measure," and urged the EU to keep working towards the reparations loan. EU leaders spent hours discussing the technical and legal feasibility of structuring a loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Diplomats said the plan proved too complex and politically sensitive to resolve at this stage, prompting leaders to move forward with an alternative interest-free loan instead. As momentum built for the reparations loan ahead the summit, European countries voted to indefinitely immobilize the Russian assets on Dec. 12, using a provision in the EU treaties known as Article 122, usually reserved to help its members to deal with economic emergencies Article 122 only requires a "qualified majority," to vote in favor, meaning a minimum of 15 countries representing 55% of the bloc's population. Usually, matters of foreign policy must be decided by unanimity. The Kyiv Independent on Dec. 9 hosted its first live event in New York City, an evening dedicated to storytelling, investigative journalism, and front-line reporting.

"There are sometimes difficult moments in our societies, but as presidents, we must define policies that keep us united. Without our independence, Moscow will inevitably push further into Europe and will come for Poland," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Warsaw. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Ukraine knows where the Oreshnik would be deployed in Belarus and is sharing this information with its Western allies.
