(AP Photo/Matt Kelley, File) STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Federal investigators sifting through the wreckage of a business jet that crashed in North Carolina and killed retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his family, and three others are trying to figure out who was flying the plane and what caused it to return to the airport soon after takeoff. The Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground Thursday, killing all seven on board. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but crashed less than 10 minutes later while trying to return and land, authorities said. Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. Two people appear in a federal database of pilot licenses under that name. The crash also killed Dutton's son, Jack, and Biffle's friend Craig Wadsworth. Biffle's wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, were also killed in the crash, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said. “Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said. Greg Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. A memorial with flowers sprouted up Friday by Biffle's marble star in his hometown of Mooresville, honoring him as a member of the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. In 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina. “The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That's who the Biffles were,” U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said. Wadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said. “He didn't know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. The joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were “deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Homeland Security announced its intention to pause a visa program intended to admit certain individuals to the United States, though it's unclear whether it's been suspended entirely. “At President (Donald) Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X late Thursday. DHS oversees the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Claudio Neves Valente, the suspect in Saturday's shooting at Brown University who is also accused of killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor on Monday, was found dead Thursday night. Valente was identified as a 48-year-old former Brown University student and Portuguese national. Noem said Thursday that he came to the United States in 2017 on a DV1 visa and received a green card. The State Department runs the diversity visa program, which is designed for individuals in countries that are determined by a formula to have a low enough level of immigration to the US. The issuance of those green cards is handled by DHS. It's unclear what direction Noem could provide, aside from pausing the issuance of green cards for those in the program. The Department of State is working closely with Department of Homeland Security to put in place all necessary measures to protect America from this threat,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. CNN also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for additional details. The diversity visa program has long been a target of President Donald Trump's ire — he took aim at it during his first term after an Uzbek national who was a recipient of the program was suspected of killing eight people in a terrorist attack in New York City. At the time, Trump backed a Republican-led effort to eliminate the diversity visa program and certain categories of family-based green cards, and then transform the remaining employment-based visas into a point system that favors heavily highly skilled, highly educated, English-speaking immigrants. According to federal data, most of the participants in fiscal year 2026 were from Africa, followed by nationals from Asia and Europe. Those who enter the US on a diversity visa are required to have completed the equivalent of high school education or “two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.” While individuals are selected for visas randomly, they still must meet security and eligibility requirements that all immigrants must clear to obtain their visas. In some cases, people already in the United States can also apply for the diversity visa program. “DV lottery winners who are already legally residing in the United States must apply through USCIS to adjust their status to permanent residence,” said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney. Thursday's announcement marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's ramped up immigration crackdown in recent weeks. Following the shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan national late last month, the administration took several steps to curb legal immigration, including reexamination of green cards issued to people from 19 countries of concern and the pause of all asylum decisions. Earlier this week, Trump signed a proclamation expanding the list of countries with full or partial travel restrictions to 39, increasing from the previous list of 19 countries.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she has "absolutely" no regrets about the 2020 MEALS Act connected to an alleged Minnesota fraud scheme, because it "did help feed kids." Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she has no regrets about supporting the MEALS Act during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the program becoming linked to Minnesota's alleged $250 million "Feeding Our Future" fraud scheme. "Do you regret pushing for that bill, the MEALS Act? Do you think it led to the fraud?" Nicholas Ballasy for Fox News Digital asked Omar on Capitol Hill. "Absolutely not, it did help feed kids," Omar said. Omar introduced the MEALS Act on March 11, 2020, to modify the Department of Agriculture's food and nutrition programs to allow certain waivers on requirements for school meal programs, including those that raised federal costs during school closures related to the pandemic. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she has "absolutely" no regrets about the 2020 MEALS Act, because "it did help feed kids." Minnesota has faced scrutiny for alleged mismanagement of federal funds accessed through these waivers, including in distributing money for the "Feeding Our Future" program, which authorities believe to be the largest fraud scheme in the history of the pandemic. FBI Director Kash Patel described it at the time as "one of the worst" in Minnesota history — and as of November 2025, more than 75 individuals have been charged in connection with the scheme, according to federal prosecutors. President Donald Trump has recently announced a flurry of new actions to crack down and investigate fraud schemes in Minnesota, which he has assailed as a "hub of money laundering activity," and cited as the basis of his decision to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of Somali migrants. (Jerry Holt/The Minnesota Star Tribune via Getty Images) Senior Trump administration officials announced fresh investigations this month, including a new Treasury Department probe into how taxpayer dollars were allegedly diverted to the terrorist organization al-Shabaab, according to Secretary Scott Bessent. Trump and other officials have zeroed in on these alleged fraud schemes, arguing that the criminal activity is a result of mismanagement and "incompetence" from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and former vice presidential candidate. "It's not surprising that the president has chosen to broadly target an entire community," Walz said of Trump's efforts, adding, "This is what he does to change the subject." Conspirators falsely claimed to have served millions of meals during the pandemic, but instead used the money for personal gain. "Stealing from the federal government equates to stealing from the American people — there is no simpler truth," FBI's special agent in charge, Alvin Winston, told Fox News Digital in a statement. Charging documents show that roughly 300 "food sites" in the state served little or no food, with the so-called "food vendors" and organizations fabricated to launder money intended to reimburse the cost of feeding children. They added that the investigation into the fraud remains ongoing, and that additional charges are expected, though they did not immediately share more details. "The egregious fraud unveiled in the Feeding our Future case epitomizes a profound betrayal of public trust," Patel told Fox News Digital earlier this year. "These individuals misappropriated hundreds of millions in federal funds intended to nourish vulnerable children during a time of crisis, redirecting those resources into luxury homes, high-end vehicles and extravagant lifestyles while families faced hardship," he added. President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Trump suggested earlier this month that Omar, who fled Somalia as a child, "shouldn't be allowed to be a congresswoman," prompting fierce backlash from some Democrats and from Minnesota's congressional delegation. Omar, for her part, said Trump's remarks were "vile." "His obsession with me is creepy," she said on social media. Ballasy later pressed Omar about another incident dominating headlines. He's saying there's no evidence," Ballasy said to Omar on Capitol Hill. The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rejected a viral claim from Omar that her son was pressed for proof of U.S. citizenship by agency personnel after stopping at a Minnesota Target over the weekend. Omar had told CBS' Twin Cities affiliate that her son was subjected to a traffic stop-type encounter by ICE agents but was ultimately let go without further issue after he was able to produce a U.S. passport or passport card. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons pushed back on the assertion on Tuesday, telling Fox News Digital the incident never happened. Because we've been asking for that information. We haven't gotten it from them, so if ICE is confirming now that they collect data and refusing to provide it to members of Congress, then that's an interesting admission." "ICE has absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son," Lyons said. "It speaks volumes that Congresswoman Omar is leveling this accusation with absolutely zero proof." Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins 'Saturday in America' to discuss claims that deported U.S. veterans have been deported, how they are partnering with the TSA to identify illegal immigrants and threats against her life. FBI Director Kash Patel announced on Friday that a post-doctoral researcher in the U.S. on a visa was charged with allegedly smuggling Escherichia coli (E. coli) into the country and making false statements about it. "This is yet another example of a researcher from China, given the privilege to work at a U.S. university, who then allegedly chose to take part in a scheme to circumvent U.S. laws and receive biological materials hidden in a package originating from China," Patel wrote on X. FBI Director Kash Patel conducts a news conference at the Department of Justice on Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, announcing the arrest of Brian Cole Jr., who allegedly placed pipe bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committee offices on Jan. 6, 2021. "If not properly controlled, E. coli and other biological materials could inflict devastating disease to U.S. crops and cause significant financial loss to the U.S. economy," he added. "Ensure your researchers know that there is a correct and legal way to obtain a license to import/export approved biological materials, and it must be followed without exception," Patel said. This is not the first time visa holders have been busted for allegedly smuggling materials for research since the Trump administration began its immigration crackdown in January 2025. In November, the Justice Department announced that three Chinese national scholars had been charged with conspiring to smuggle biological materials into the U.S. while working at a university laboratory. "Allegedly attempting to smuggle biological materials under the guise of ‘research' is a serious crime that threatens America's national and agricultural security," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. The agency identified the suspects as Xu Bai, 28, Fengfan Zhang, 27, and Zhiyong Zhang, 30, who, like Xiang, were participating in J-1 visa academic exchange programs. The three scholars, who conducted research at the University of Michigan's Shawn Xu Laboratory, allegedly received multiple shipments of concealed biological materials related to roundworms from a Chinese Ph.D. student in Wuhan, China, Chengxuan Han. Han had previously worked at the university and was convicted of smuggling and making false statements before being removed from the U.S. Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist and research associate at Harvard University, leaves the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse after she was released from U.S. federal custody, while awaiting trial in a criminal case in Boston, Mass., June 12, 2025. In February, Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist and Harvard University cancer researcher, was detained at Boston Logan International airport for allegedly smuggling frog embryos. Petrova's attorney, Gregory Romanovsky, told Fox News that his client was bringing back the embryos at the request of a professor at a French lab that was collaborating with Harvard. He said the sample was picked up in Paris and was supposed to be brought to Harvard. Romanovsky added that Petrova did not know she needed to claim the embryos at customs. "The individual was lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country," the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) wrote in a post on X about Petrova. "A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits." Petrova was released from federal custody in June. Fox News Digital's Bonny Chu, Sarah Rumpf-Whitten and Kitty Le Claire contributed to this report.

A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a pro-Trump legal group seeking access to a trove of federal judiciary documents, including from a body overseen by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts – putting an end to a protracted legal fight brought by Trump allies seeking to access key judicial documents. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee assigned to the case earlier this year, dismissed the long-shot lawsuit brought by the America First Legal Foundation, the pro-Trump group founded by White House policy adviser Stephen Miller after Trump's first term; Miller, now back in the White House, is no longer affiliated with AFL. McFadden ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, saying Thursday that two groups responsible for certain regulatory and administrative functions for the federal judiciary are an extension of the judicial branch, and therefore protected by the same exemptions to federal laws granted to the judiciary. "Nothing about either entity's structure suggests the president must supervise their employees or otherwise keep them ‘accountable,' as is the case for executive officers," McFadden said. Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Brett M. Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor are seen at the 60th inaugural ceremony on Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

Conrad, the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and sought access to a trove of judicial documents from both bodies under the Freedom of Information Act. AFL cited recent actions the Judicial Conference and Administrative Office had taken in 2023 to "accommodate" requests from Congress to investigate allegations of ethical improprieties by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and subsequently to create or adopt an "ethics code" for justices on the high court. "Under our constitutional tradition, accommodations with Congress are the province of the executive branch," AFL argued. White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. McFadden disagreed, rejecting the group's argument that "courts" under FOIA refers only to judges. "Indeed, if America First were right that only judges and ‘law clerks,' who ‘directly report to the judge,' count as part of ‘the courts,' numerous questions arise, and senseless line drawing ensues," he said in a memo opinion accompanying his order. "Rather, FOIA's exclusion reflects that courts include a full range of ‘judicial adjuncts,' from ‘clerks' to ‘court reporters,' who perform ‘tasks that are an integral part of the judicial process.'" Plaintiffs for AFL, led by attorney Will Scolinos, had argued in their lawsuit earlier this year that the Judicial Conference's duties are "executive functions" and functions they allege must be supervised by executive officers "who are appointed and accountable to other executive officers." Courts "definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond resolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions," the group had argued. Overseen by the chief justice, it issues policy recommendations and reports to Congress as needed. The U.S. Supreme Court building is seen in Washington, D.C.

The news comes as President Donald Trump, in his first year back in the White House, has relied heavily on executive orders to advance his agenda — a strategy that has accelerated implementation of campaign promises but also prompted a surge of legal challenges. Trump's actions sparked hundreds of federal lawsuits this year alone, sending tensions skyrocketing between the executive branch and the courts, including federal judges who have blocked or paused some of Trump's biggest priorities in his second term.

President Donald Trump joins military officials at Dover Air Force Base in Kent County, Del., for the solemn transfer of two U.S. soldiers killed in ISIS ambush in Syria. FIRST ON FOX: More than 100 House Republicans are demanding increased oversight of Syria as the U.S. prepares to repeal longstanding sanctions against the country. Reps. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., and Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., are leading 134 fellow GOP lawmakers in calling for guarantees that the Syrian government will adhere to terms in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that set the stage for repealing those sanctions, while warning the U.S. needs to be prepared to reverse that if Syria falters on its progress. "Many Members of Congress, committed to seeking peace, prosperity, and tolerance for religious minorities in the region, worked with the Trump Administration and House leadership to secure assurances that snapback conditions regarding the repeal of Syrian sanctions would be enforced if Syria does not comply with the terms highlighted in the repeal language," their joint statement read. President Donald Trump and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth salute as a U.S. Army carrier team moves a flag-draped transfer case containing the remains of Iowa National Guardsman Sgt. They said Congress was committed "to keeping a watchful eye on the new al-Sharaa Administration to ensure protections for religious and ethnic minorities in Syria." It comes after two members of the Iowa National Guard serving in Syria were killed in an ambush by an ISIS gunman. Interim Syria President Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks during the Concordia Annual Summit in New York, Sept. 22, 2025. Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa took power in Syria after the previous government led by Bashar al-Assad was toppled in 2024. The House GOP lawmakers said they "look forward" to being invited to Damascus themselves to see that his administration "has created a safe environment for the religious and ethnic minorities historically persecuted in the region." "We look forward to confirming that these terms have not been squandered by the Syrian government–whether by their President or by rogue military officials–and seeing for ourselves that the al-Sharaa Administration has created a safe environment for the religious and ethnic minorities historically persecuted in the region," they said. President Donald Trump signed the NDAA into law on Thursday evening. Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (AP) — When Donald Trump delivered the first White House address of his second presidency Wednesday night, all major U.S. networks beamed his image and voice onto their airwaves, cable feeds and online platforms. Americans ended up watching the Republican president stand in the Diplomatic Reception Room and deliver 18 minutes of aggressive, politically motivated arguments that misstated facts, blamed the nation's ills on his predecessor, exaggerated the results of his nearly 11 months in office and amplified his characteristically gargantuan, immeasurable promises about what's to come. “It's not that the Oval Office and the White House haven't been used for political speeches before,” said former NBC News executive Mark Lukasiewicz, who is dean of Hofstra University's communications school after more than a decade leading NBC's special broadcasts, including presidential addresses. “But, as with a great deal of what Donald Trump does as president, this was outside the norm,” Lukasiewicz said, adding that news executives are reluctant to flout the historical standard that “when the president feels he needs to speak to the nation, you need to let him speak.” The uneasy dynamics were further intensified because Trump spoke the same day that the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, told members of Congress that his agency, which has regulatory authority over media companies, is not in fact an independent agency as has been understood through generations of Republican and Democratic administrations. That's on top of Trump's penchant for browbeating individual journalists who cover him and suing news organizations to the tune of multimillion-dollar settlements, notably from CBS and ABC. Lukasiewicz, who left NBC soon after Trump's 2016 election, said “it is hard to imagine that those factors aren't on the minds of news executives and network executives making these decisions.” The networks also did not respond to Associated Press inquiries. Spokespeople at MS NOW and CNN, cable networks whose prime-time programming already is oriented to political coverage, declined comment. Presidential addresses often begin with the White House press secretary or communications director contacting networks' Washington bureau chiefs, asking for a specific amount of time and offering a general description of the topic. Lukasiewicz recalled that when President Barack Obama told the nation that 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden had been killed on his orders, his aides had told networks the president wanted to discuss a major national security matter. Such conversations are relayed up to network executives, who must weigh whether to preempt or delay programming, decisions that can affect advertising revenue. Networks typically grant the time, reasoning that they're relatively rare and historically have involved substantial matters. Trump, who relishes talking directly to voters via social media and regularly talks to reporters on Air Force One and elsewhere, has made fewer requests for network time than many of his predecessors; he had not asked at all since returning to the White House in January. Still, it's not a guaranteed yes, with Obama and President Joe Biden being denied requests in recent decades. Taken together, those posts triggered chatter in Washington and beyond about official wartime actions. Presidents also have made plenty of U.S.-centered speeches, many fairly described as a politician pitching his preferred domestic policies with an unchecked megaphone. Network leaders notably rejected Obama in 2014 when he wanted to talk about immigration policy while Congress was at an impasse over the matter. Lukasiewicz recalled being part of the executive team that rejected Obama's request to speak during his first term on the Affordable Care Act becoming law. In 2022, Biden spoke at length on his concerns about American democracy — but several networks did not carry his remarks from Philadelphia. By itself, the topic could be framed as a national concern above partisanship. Biden's effort, though, was complicated by the fact that he was talking about Trump and Trump's supporters who ransacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, at a time when they were being investigated and prosecuted. People familiar with how the process has worked in previous administrations said it would be defensible, since it was Trump's first address this term, for networks to grant his request even without clarity about the topic. By Wednesday afternoon and early evening, White House aides and some executive branch agencies had telegraphed to some journalists that the speech would be more oriented to the state of the nation nearly a year into Trump's presidency — a framing that would still put the speech within historical norms. He blamed Biden and Democrats for “the worst (inflation) in the history of our country,” but said “everything ... is falling rapidly.” Biden-era inflation was not the worst in history, inflation rates began falling before he left office and, though they are now at or much closer to historically routine levels, that still means prices are rising. The White House also offered charts that only Fox opted to show. Trump accused immigrants in Minnesota of stealing “billions and billions” of dollars and used the language of war to call Biden-era immigration levels an “invasion.” He claimed he'd secured $18 trillion in foreign business investments to the U.S. when his own White House puts the number closer to half that. He said he scored a landslide in 2024 — despite his Electoral College vote share ranking in the bottom third through 230 years of victorious presidents. “Those overlaying factors of the incredible pressure that this president can bring, and has shown himself completely willing to bring on these organizations and their corporate parents when he's unhappy — that's still part of the equation.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is turning to the power of President Donald Trump's endorsement to protect his fragile Senate majority and deliver another term for his most vulnerable incumbents. “We've gotten him to endorse in a lot of these races around the country, some where there are primaries and some where there aren't, but could be,” Thune said. But he acknowledged several races where he has been unable to get Trump off the sidelines, all but guaranteeing drawn-out primaries that could drain party resources and leave the eventual nominee bloodied. Thune is also vouching for Republicans in safely red seats, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), whose vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges as he left office in 2021 has become political fodder for a crowded primary field. Cassidy has since tried to repair his relationship with the president and hopes he will stay neutral. Trump's reluctance is grounded, in part, on his desire to pick a winner. He endorsed a record number of candidates in 2024, but often shies away from contests with no clear front-runner. In other cases, Trump's team rewards loyalty and has reportedly explored a possible primary challenge to Cassidy from Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA). But Republicans also understand the currency of Trump's endorsement with the party base and believe it is an undisputed help when it comes to Senate primaries. Cornyn, crediting Thune with asking Trump to back him “numerous” times, told the Washington Examiner, “We all know that if he endorsed me in the primary, that the primary would be over, but he's got a lot of other important things to think about and do.” In New Hampshire, Republicans managed to recruit John Sununu, a former senator and heir to a family political dynasty, and could have a late candidate in Minnesota, where ex-sportscaster Michele Tafoya is leaning toward entering in the new year. Thune will also benefit from an emerging truce between Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk, who briefly flirted with launching primary challenges against congressional Republicans after he was forced out as a White House adviser. Instead, Thune said Musk is opening up his wallet for Senate Republicans and has already cut checks for one of their “main entities.” As majority leader, Thune is tasked with fundraising for the Senate Leadership Fund and its related super PACs. Thune has separately raised money for North Carolina's Michael Whatley, attending fundraisers for him and a slate of Senate incumbents in Ohio, Texas, and beyond. Whatley is running to replace Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and already has the endorsement of Trump. Yet Thune has invited rare backlash as Republicans line up behind Sununu in New Hampshire's GOP primary. Thune declined to say whether he urged Scott Brown, the other Republican candidate, to bow out, only offering up that “we always have very candid conversations,” but he has repeatedly nodded toward Sununu, a former House colleague, as the more electable of the two. But for us, it's obviously going to be about who has the best chance of picking up a seat, which we think we have a really good shot at. And you know, clearly the polling right now is favorable for John Sununu.” In response, Brown took a veiled shot at Thune, claiming that “President Trump and his agenda are being served poorly by the GOP Senate.” “Rather than meddling in competitive primaries, Republican senators should get off their rear ends and start passing President Trump's agenda into law, especially with the House majority hanging on a razor's edge,” Brown said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill was great, but what's next in 2026? But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has managed to land a series of strong candidates who will force Republicans to spread resources across the map. There is even the possibility that Democrat Mary Peltola, who represented an at-large House seat until January, could run against Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) in Alaska. Thune is still holding out hope that Trump will engage in some of the more costly primaries and said he has discussed them all with Trump and his political team. But he argued Republicans are well-positioned to win next year and would emerge from the primary season with a slate of candidates who can maintain, or even grow, their majority. “I still think, like with Georgia, when that primary is resolved, I still think that's going to be a competitive race,” Thune said. “You know, I think Mike Rogers is in a great spot in Michigan, and we talked about New Hampshire and Sununu — I think there are some opportunities on the map.” Apart from candidates, Thune emphasized turning out Trump's base with a ground game that defies the voting slump common in a midterm year and a “record of accomplishment,” anchored to Trump's tax law, that Republicans plan to plaster on the airwaves.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Let's fix the two massive efficiency sinks in American life. The first thing that struck me about this year's most talked-about policy book, Abundance (perhaps you've heard of it? The book's cover art sketches a future where half of our planet is densely woven with the homes, clean energy, and other technologies required to fill every human need, liberating the other half to flourish as a preserve for the biosphere on which we all depend — wild animals, forests, contiguous stretches of wilderness. It's a beautiful ecomodernist image, suggesting that protecting what we might crudely call “nature” is an equal part of what it means to be prosperous, and that doing so is compatible with continued economic growth. It's a visual rebuke to those who argue that we must choose between the two. The US and its peer countries today are spectacularly rich — unimaginably so, from the vantage of nearly any point in human history — and it might be tempting to think that we have grown enough, that our environmental crisis is so grave that we should save our planet by shrinking our economy and freeing ourselves from useless junk. I understand the pull of that vision — but it's one that I think is illusory and politically calamitous, not to mention at odds with human freedom. A world where economic growth goes into reverse is a world that would see ever more brutal fighting over shrinking wealth, and it is far from guaranteed to benefit the planet. And we are not on track to manage it. It's not easy to reconcile these realities, but it is possible and necessary to do so in a way that's consistent with liberal democratic principles. • Meat and dairy, plus our extreme dependence on cars, are two huge efficiency sinks: they produce a big share of emissions and devour land, and they aren't essential to economic growth or human flourishing. • Shifting diets toward plant-based foods and freeing up land could act like a giant carbon-capture project, buying time to decarbonize. • Reducing car dependence would slash transport emissions, make land use more efficient, and make Americans healthier and safer — without sacrificing prosperity. But some of the most powerful levers we have to decouple economic growth from environmental impact challenge us to do something even harder — to begin outgrowing two central fixtures of American life that are as taken-for-granted as they are supremely inefficient: our extreme dependence on meat and cars. Changing those realities is so culturally and politically heretical in America that this case is almost never made in climate politics, but it deserves to be made nonetheless. And doing so will require examining the trade-offs that we too often treat as defaults. It's probably not news to you that cars and animal-based foods are bad for the planet — together they contribute around a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions both globally and within the US. Animal agriculture also devours more than a third of habitable land globally (a crucially important part of our planetary crisis) and 40 percent of land in the lower 48 US states, while car-dependent sprawl fragments and eats into what's left at the urban fringe. Mile-for-mile, traveling by rail transit in the US emits about a third as much as driving on average, while walking doesn't emit anything. For all that resource use, animal agriculture and autos are not indispensable to our economy or to our continued economic growth. The entire US agricultural sector, plus the manufacture and servicing of automobiles, make up a tiny share of our GDP; like other advanced economies, America's is largely service-based, employing workers in everything from health care to law firms to restaurants and retailers like Amazon and Walmart. But it is, unsurprisingly, those foundational parts of the economy that disproportionately drive resource use and environmental impact — and because they're a small share of the economy, we have a lot of room to change their composition without crashing GDP. If we shifted a chunk of our food production away from meat and dairy and toward plant-based foods, for example, the already economically tiny ag sector might shrink somewhat. Meanwhile, we would save a lot of greenhouse gas emissions and land, and it would be reasonable to infer that the food service and retail sectors, which make up a significantly larger share of US GDP than agriculture does, would function all the same because we'd still eat the same number of calories and buy the same amount of food. With less meat consumption, the US might even have a significantly bigger alternative protein sector, with cleaner, better jobs than farm or slaughterhouse work. Which is not to say there wouldn't be any losers in the short run — job losses and stranded capital in industries that are regionally concentrated and politically powerful. But those transitions can be managed, just as we have been managing the transition away from fossil fuels. This is exactly what decoupling — the idea that we can grow richer while decreasing emissions and other environmental impacts — looks like. The US, like a lot of other developed countries, has largely managed that in carbon emissions from energy consumption, which have fallen around 20 percent since 2005, even as the economy has grown about 50 percent in real terms. Agriculture has become more efficient, too, but it still lags on decoupling; the sector's emissions are mostly flat or rising. Road transport tells a similar story: cars and trucks have gotten more efficient, but total emissions from driving are still stuck near their mid-2000s levels. A megawatt is a megawatt, whether it's produced by coal or solar, while switching from steak to beans is not the same experience. But learning how to use resources more efficiently is, after all, a big part of how wealthy nations have become wealthy, including in these tougher sectors. Despite how inefficient our food system still is, the US has managed to significantly decrease how much land it uses for farming over the last century, while producing much more food. Now, you might be thinking, so what if American GDP doesn't depend on meat and cars? No one would say that heating and cooling shouldn't exist (well, the French might) just because they use a lot of energy and make up a tiny share of the economy. But every choice we make in the economy is a trade-off against something else, and everything we spend our limited carbon budget on is a choice to forgo something else. Our task is to decide whether high meat intake and extreme car dependence are worth that trade — whether they make up for their toll on the planet in contributions to our economy or to our flourishing as human beings. Estimates of the livestock industry's greenhouse gas emissions range from around 12 to 20 percent globally; in the US, it's around 7 percent (despite the lower percentage, per capita meat consumption is substantially higher in the US than it is globally — it's just that our other sources of emissions are even higher). But those numbers don't account for what climate scientists call the carbon opportunity cost of animal agriculture's land use. Much of it could instead be rewilded with climate-stabilizing ecosystems, which would support biodiversity and also happen to be among our best defenses against global warming because of how good they are at sequestering carbon. The canonical paper on the carbon opportunity cost of animal agriculture finds that a 70 percent reduction in global meat consumption, relative to projected consumption levels in 2050, would remove the equivalent of about nine years of carbon emissions, while a global plant-based diet would remove 16 years of emissions; another study concludes that a rapid phaseout of animal agriculture could effectively freeze increases in all greenhouse gases over the next 30 years, and offset most carbon emissions this century. It's worth pausing to appreciate just how miraculous that is. Freeing up even some of the land now used for meat and dairy turns it into a negative-emissions machine better than any existing carbon capture technology, giving us a carbon budget windfall that could ease the phaseout of fossil fuels and buy time for solving harder problems like decarbonizing aviation. We can think of car dependence as the other big resource black hole in US society. Globally, gas-powered cars are in retreat — a very good thing for both climate change and deadly air pollution, though the US is increasingly falling behind peer countries in auto electrification. Still, if it were just a matter of swapping out gas-guzzlers for EVs, auto transportation wouldn't be an obstacle to truly sustainable growth. But EVs alone aren't a silver bullet for repairing the environmental problems of cars. One influential paper on the subject found as much in 2020, concluding that, at any realistic pace of electrification, EV growth wouldn't be enough to meet climate targets, and even with universal adoption, EVs aren't emissions-free. These are scarce inputs that we also need to decarbonize the electric grid and build other green infrastructure. But as the lead author of that paper wrote in an accompanying commentary, “The real question is, do you even need a car?” In most of the country, Americans have no other convenient transportation options. The car-dependent urban form that dominates America forces us to build things spread far apart — sprawl, in other words — which forces us to use more land. As of 2010, according to one estimate, the US devoted a land area about the size of New Jersey to parking spots alone. Our cities and suburbs occupy less than one-tenth as much land as farming — about 3 percent of the US total — but they still matter for the environment, fragmenting the habitats on which wildlife and ecosystems depend. Plus, housing in the US is sprawling enough that some exurban communities stretch across outlying rural counties, occupying an unknown additional share of land that's not included in the 3 percent figure. Perhaps most damaging from an economic perspective, the sprawling development pattern that car dependence both enables and relies upon has driven the misallocation of valuable land toward low-density single-family homes, driving our national housing crisis. Cars are by no means the sole reason behind the housing shortage, but without mass car dependence, it would be vastly harder to lock so much of our land into inefficient uses. Urbanists sometimes like to say that the US prioritizes cars over people — that an alien arriving on Earth would probably think cars are our planet's apex species. In some senses, that's certainly true — the privileges that we've reserved for cars make it harder to meet the basic human need of housing, which makes us poorer and diminishes the agglomeration effects that make cities dynamic and productive. One widely cited paper estimated, astonishingly, that housing supply constraints, especially in the highest-productivity cities, cut US economic growth by 36 percent, relative to what it would have been otherwise, from 1964 to 2009. Imagine how much higher the GDP of Los Angeles would be if it doubled its housing stock and population and, with its freeways already maxed out, enabled millions more people to get around on foot, bike, and transit. And, of course, since autos and animal products are both very high in negative externalities, the benefits of reducing our collective dependence on them go well beyond the strictly economic or environmental. We would torture and kill fewer animals (and fewer people would have to spend their working lives doing the killing). The growth that brought us industrial modernity is an awe-inspiring thing: It's given us an abundance of choices, and it's made obsolete brutal ways of life that not long ago were a shorthand for prosperity, like coal mining or the hunting of whales to make industrial products. Prosperity can be measured concretely in rising incomes and lengthening lifespans, but it's also an evolving story we tell ourselves about what constitutes the good life, and what we're willing to trade to get it. With cars, at least, we might have the seeds of a different story. Dethroning the automobile in car-loving America remains a grueling, uphill battle, and I wouldn't necessarily call myself optimistic, but transportation reform flows quite naturally from the changes we already know we need to make to solve our housing shortage. The best way to reduce the number of miles we drive is to permit a greater density of homes anywhere where there's demand for it, especially in the parts of cities that already have the affordances of car-free or car-light life (and it's definitely not all or nothing — I own a car and can appreciate its conveniences, while driving maybe a quarter as much as the average American). It's one thing to show that we're not missing out on economic growth by forgoing meat, and quite another to persuade people that eating less of it isn't a sacrifice — something the plant-based movement hasn't yet figured out how to do. At bare minimum, we ought to be pouring public money into meat alternatives research. Right now, our livestock and our automotive herd squander the resources that could be used to make industrial modernity sustainable for everyone. Reclaiming even a fraction of that capacity would make the math of decoupling less brutal, freeing us to build whatever else we can imagine. This series was supported by a grant from Arnold Ventures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dugan was accused of helping an illegal immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in April, while he was in her courthouse for battery charges. Dugan was also found not guilty on a lesser misdemeanor charge of “concealing an individual from discovery and arrest,” reported Wisconsin's WISN-12. “While we are disappointed in today's outcome, the failure of the prosecution to secure convictions on both counts demonstrates the opportunity we have to clear Judge Dugan's name and show she did nothing wrong in this matter,” Dugan's defense team said in a prepared statement. “We have planned for this potential outcome and our defense of Judge Dugan is just beginning. Many Democratic politicians loudly criticized Dugan's arrest at the time and blasted President Donald Trump for doing so, claiming it was an example of aggressive governance and political overreach, with some even stating it was an example of Trump acting like a king. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) called Dugan's arrest “gravely serious,” “lawless behavior,” and asserted that “we do not have kings in this country.” “In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” said Baldwin in a statement on April 25. “By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. Tony Evers (D-WI) at the time was also critical of Dugan's arrest, blasting Trump's actions and comments. “In this country, people who are suspected of criminal wrongdoing are innocent until their guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt and they are found guilty by a jury of their peers — this is the fundamental demand of justice in America,” Evers said at the time. The maximum penalty for Dugan is reportedly five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Wednesday his administration is starting to send checks in the amount of $1,776 to nearly 1.5 million US service members, using money from the “billions of dollars” he says the government has collected through his tariffs. “Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed One Big, Beautiful Bill, tonight I am also proud to announce that more than … 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call ‘Warrior Dividend,' before Christmas,” Trump said Wednesday night in a televised address to the nation. Troops will receive $1,776 checks before Christmas, Trump announces But he alone can't decide how the revenue from his sweeping tariffs gets spent. All revenue the government collects, whether through ordinary taxes or tariffs, goes into a general fund managed by the Treasury department that is then used to pay the government's expenses, such as distributing tax refunds﻿. Any other use of the money has to be approved by Congress, which, so far, hasn't happened for tariff collections. “Money is fungible,” a White House spokesperson told CNN. “Just because Congress didn't specifically appropriate tariff revenue to be used for the Warrior Dividend doesn't change the fact that the government has more money available (because of tariffs) to pay for these sort of initiatives.” Congress did, however, sign off on Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which earmarked money for the checks. Regardless, not only is none of the $260 billion in tariff revenue being put toward that, but it is unlikely to be applied to anything (and certainly not everything) that Trump has promised. First off, about half of the tariff revenue collected this year, or as much as $129 billion, is tied to a landmark tariff case the Supreme Court is expected to soon issue a ruling on. If the justices rule against Trump, the government may have to issue billions of dollars in refunds to importers. But, refunds notwithstanding, here's everything else Trump, at various points, has promised that tariff revenue collected during his second term would be used for: While discussing refund checks, Trump has often brought up using tariff funds to help pay down the nation's almost $40 trillion in federal debt. But even if Trump used every cent of the tariff revenue collected during his second term, it would only be able to pay off less than 1% of the national debt. During a campaign event last year, Trump seemed to suggest that tariff revenue could be put toward making child care more affordable. “With child care … those numbers are small, relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just told you about,” Trump said at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York. Trump has said that any loss of government revenue that's associated with many of the tax cuts his administration has either floated or enacted, including new limitations on the portion of tips subject to taxes, will be made up for with tariff revenue. At a Cabinet meeting this month, for instance, Trump said: “I believe that at some point in the not‑too‑distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great.” Trump pledged to distribute “some of that tariff money” to farmers, many of whom have been hurt by tit-for-tat moves that countries, especially China, have taken in retaliation of higher tariffs on commodities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Request to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired. Caine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not. The guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military's counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean — including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported. The Joint Staff declined to comment for this story. Several senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months. A separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they're being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it's typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation. Other current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they're eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability. “A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,' and shouldn't be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they're given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year. More than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn't agree with his vision for the department. Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.” Maurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.” Widmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said. “It's a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn't make it the right or ethical one.” Experts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs. In a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University's security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.” But while officers shouldn't resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military's professional values and ideals are at risk. Maurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.” The Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported. Since September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. Lawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them. Some members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.</p>

(Adela Tesnow via AP) Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan with obstruction, a felony, and concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, in April. Dugan faces up to five years in prison when she's sentenced, but no date had been set as of late Thursday evening. The case inflamed tensions over Trump's immigration crackdown, with his administration branding Dugan an activist judge and Democrats countering that the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation. Dugan and her attorneys left the courtroom, ducked into a side conference room and closed the door without speaking to reporters. He said courthouse arrests are safer because people are screened for weapons and it isn't unfair for law enforcement to arrest wanted people in courthouses.

Nor is she a martyr for some greater cause.” U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche praised the verdict on X, saying nobody is above the law, even judges. According to a court filings that include an FBI affidavit and a federal grand jury indictment, immigration authorities traveled to the Milwaukee County courthouse on April 18 after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case. Dugan learned that agents were in the corridor outside her courtroom waiting for Flores-Ruiz. While the agents were gone, she addressed Flores-Ruiz's case off the record, told his attorney that he could attend his next hearing via Zoom and led Flores-Ruiz and the attorney out a private jury door. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported. An FBI agent who led the investigation testified that after agents left the corridor, she immediately moved Flores-Ruiz's case to the top of her docket, told him that he could appear for his next hearing via Zoom and led him out the private door. Prosecutors also played audio recordings from her courtroom in which she can be heard telling her court reporter that she'd take “the heat” for leading Flores-Ruiz out the back.</p>

(AP) — A business jet crashed Thursday while trying to return to a North Carolina airport shortly after takeoff, killing all seven people aboard, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family, authorities said. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said. Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. NASCAR said it was devastated by the news. The plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10 a.m., according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com. The ninth hole was covered with debris. That's way too low,'” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. At a news conference, Statesville Regional Airport manager John Ferguson says federal authorities are at the scene where a business jet crashed Thursday morning. First responders tend to the scene of a reported plane crash at a regional airport in Statesville, N.C., Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. The Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. In 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina. “The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That's who the Biffles were,” U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said. Wadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said. “He didn't know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. The joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were “deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.” With 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 U.S. crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The suspected gunman from Saturday's mass shooting at Brown University was found dead in Salem, New Hampshire, on Thursday evening. FBI and law enforcement officials surrounded the suspected shooter as he hid in a storage unit following a nearly six-day manhunt for the suspect. Authorities believe the suspect carried out the Brown University shooting, in which two students were killed and nine were injured, and the fatal shooting of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro two days later. The suspect was Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, a former Brown University student and Portuguese national, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez announced during a press conference on Thursday evening. POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTSNeves Valente attended Brown University from fall 2000 to spring 2001, Brown University President Christina Paxson said. During this time, Neves Valente enrolled in Brown's doctoral physics program before taking a leave of absence and ultimately withdrawing. Neves Valente was only enrolled in physics classes at the university. Neves Vilente entered the United States in August 2000 on an F-1 student visa and obtained U.S. legal permanent residency in 2017, according to authorities. Perez confirmed that authorities believe Neves Valente and Loureiro attended the same university in Portugal. Authorities believe Neves Valente acted alone and were unaware of his identity until Wednesday.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts was set to provide an update later in the evening on the investigation surrounding Loureiro's murder.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok inked a deal to sell its U.S. entity to a joint venture group with several American investors on Thursday, CEO Shou Zi Chew said in an internal company memo. The deal follows months of the Trump administration attempting to reach an agreement with Chinese-based TikTok owner ByteDance to delay a Supreme Court ruling that forced the U.S. entity to divest from ByteDance or face a nationwide ban. The ruling upheld a law passed by Congress in 2024 that required the TikTok ByteDance divestment. The deal involves an agreement between American companies Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-owned MGX to make up 45% of the joint venture, according to the memo. Existing ByteDance investors will make up 30.1% of the share, ByteDance itself will hold 19.9%, and the remaining 5% will be owned by other American investors in the joint venture. President Donald Trump had signed multiple executive orders to allow TikTok to continue its U.S. operations as negotiations took place. The White House released details of a deal negotiated by Trump in September that included Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX in the agreement. That deal positioned Oracle to provide security operations on the app and includes Silver Lake and MGX as key leaders. The security of the app has been of primary concern to U.S. leadership, as ByteDance is a Chinese-owned company. TikTok did not respond to the Washington Examiner's requests for comment.</p>
