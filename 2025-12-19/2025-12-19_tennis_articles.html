                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — The ATP Tour set out a new safeguarding policy Friday which aims to ensure players and staff feel safe from abuse on tour and know how to report inappropriate behavior.In a move which mirrors work done by the WTA in women's tennis, the ATP's code of conduct sets out how investigations should be conducted and a range of potential punishments, from reprimands up to permanently revoking access to its tournaments.The ATP also says it will launch training for players, coaches and staff throughout next year.Read more: The ATP is adding a heat rule like the one the women have had for more than 30 years"Everyone involved in our events — from players and their teams to staff and volunteers — deserves to feel safe, respected, and valued," chief executive Eno Polo said in a statement. By introducing clear protections against abuse, we're strengthening the culture of tennis and aligning our sport with global standards of governance and care. "The code of conduct covers areas like bullying, sexual harassment and violence, as well as behavior which could constitute an "abuse of trust" in a professional relationship.

It also commits players, coaches and tour personnel to report any concerns about abusive behavior and to tell the ATP's safeguarding director if they are facing investigations from police or social services about "any behavior constituting either a criminal offence or a safeguarding concern. The ATP said in 2023 that the investigation found "insufficient evidence" to substantiate domestic abuse allegations against Zverev, a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, who denied wrongdoing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She's the only player EVER to reel off three bagel sets to finish off winning a Grand Slam singles title.ByJohn BerkokPublished Dec 19, 2025 copy_link Iga Swiatek achieved a lot by winning Wimbledon this year—she became the first woman to win her first six Grand Slam finals since Monica Seles and the youngest woman to win Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces since Serena Williams, to name a few.But the way she won it was even rarer—in fact, it's never happened before, and it's very possible it will never happen again.By winning her semifinal match against Belinda Bencic, 6-2, 6-0, and her final match against Amanda Anisimova, 6-0, 6-0, she became the first tennis player ever—female or male—to reel off three bagel sets to finish off winning a Grand Slam singles title.

Two other players have finished off with two bagels.Dorothea Lambert Chambers won Wimbledon in 1911 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Dora Boothby, but that was when the Challenge Round format was in place, where the defending champion only had to play the final, so that was her only match of the event.And Steffi Graf won Roland Garros in 1988 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Natasha Zvereva, but she had a much tougher battle in her semifinal match, defeating Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 7-6 (3).Swiatek is the only player ever to clinch a Grand Slam title with three bagels in a row, and she actually won her last 20 games in a row at the All England Club this year—from 4-2 in the first set against Bencic, she didn't lose another game the rest of the way.And that, tennis fans, is our No. Dorothea Lambert Chambers won Wimbledon in 1911 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Dora Boothby, but that was when the Challenge Round format was in place, where the defending champion only had to play the final, so that was her only match of the event.And Steffi Graf won Roland Garros in 1988 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Natasha Zvereva, but she had a much tougher battle in her semifinal match, defeating Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 7-6 (3).Swiatek is the only player ever to clinch a Grand Slam title with three bagels in a row, and she actually won her last 20 games in a row at the All England Club this year—from 4-2 in the first set against Bencic, she didn't lose another game the rest of the way.And that, tennis fans, is our No. And Steffi Graf won Roland Garros in 1988 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Natasha Zvereva, but she had a much tougher battle in her semifinal match, defeating Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 7-6 (3).Swiatek is the only player ever to clinch a Grand Slam title with three bagels in a row, and she actually won her last 20 games in a row at the All England Club this year—from 4-2 in the first set against Bencic, she didn't lose another game the rest of the way.And that, tennis fans, is our No. Swiatek is the only player ever to clinch a Grand Slam title with three bagels in a row, and she actually won her last 20 games in a row at the All England Club this year—from 4-2 in the first set against Bencic, she didn't lose another game the rest of the way.And that, tennis fans, is our No. And that, tennis fans, is our No. 🔥🔥🔥🔥The only other woman to do that since 2000?</p>
