                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Red Devils captain has been told he - like Portugal team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo - is an easy target for scorn because of his “enormous” contribution at Old Trafford. Following a difficult start to the 2025-26 season, United have been in fine form in recent months under Ruben Amorim's stewardship. The 20-time champions are currently sixth in the Premier League and just two points outside of the Champions League places following a run of form which has seen them lose just one of their last 10 matches. However, while Fernandes has been become one of the league's best performers since moving to United from Portuguese giants Sporting CP in 2020, he has come in for criticism from time to time. While some say Fernandes' arm-waving is a sign of his passion and never-say-die attitude, others feel he should opt for a calmer approach when United are under pressure. In an interview with BOYLE Sports, Saha - who represented United between 2004 and 2008, winning four major honours - said: “Bruno Fernandes is always showing the tempo, showing the commitment, and showing class on a regular basis. “The kind of criticism this guy has been under just amazes me, it's a very cheap way to comment on football sometimes, just by claiming people should do this or do that. “Comparisons between Fernandes and Roy Keane are understandable because he is the focal point of this team. “That's why I think when you look at Bruno's contribution, it's just enormous, and it's not just about the numbers.

And I said, ‘Okay, you gave me something. I could have gone in a different way and probably won more trophies and [had more] people talking about me in a different way. Fernandes and United face a stern test when they travel to high-flying Aston Villa in the league on Sunday afternoon. Unai Emery's men are currently third in the table, having won their last six top-flight fixtures. Amorim's United will then round off 2025 with successive home games against Newcastle United and winless Wolves on Friday, 26 December and Tuesday, 30 December respectively.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the wake of FIFA's recent reveal of the 2026 World Cup schedule, representatives from a number of nations have visited Kansas City and Lawrence to check out both areas as potential “base camp” sites for their soccer teams. As The Star previously reported, reps from England, Germany, Colombia and South Korea have paid visits to Lawrence. The Star was told that Argentina and Algeria visited Lawrence last week. This is especially relevant as both are scheduled to play games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City — and a source close to the situation told The Star that Lawrence is a likely base camp location for a team playing in KC. Which team that might be is unknown, for now. Here's the list of the seven squad that will be playing matches in KC: Netherlands, Argentina, Algeria, Tunisia, Curaçao, Ecuador and Austria. With that, it's time for another Kansas Jayhawks Q&A. As KU moves toward conference play, each must provide something that this team lacks. Both players were supposed to carry the load in 2025-26, but neither is shooting better than 25% on 3-pointers. The path to more playing time starts with hitting shots. If they can't do that, it's hard to justify having either on the court. Does KU basketball have access to gatorade, bananas, or other advanced technology for hydration and cramping? Here's what coach Bill Self said when I asked him about it. “Everybody has an idea of (how to fix this), whether it's mustard packets or eating bananas or drinking this (drink) ... there's a lot of things that people can do. And sometimes your body just doesn't react how it reacts to a nephew or uncle('s remedy) in your family.” Nobody can really question it and make you prove your stomach doesn't hurt, so it's pretty safe. I didn't miss a ton of school days, either, though. My parents could usually figure out when I was lying, so I didn't try it too often. As for how this pertains to Peterson, I really do believe he has cramps and wants to play. For KU basketball, it's a healthy Darryn Peterson. For KU football, it's a little more complicated. The Jayhawks have a lot of needs to address, with 33 departing seniors and a number of players in the transfer portal. So, I think the best hope football-wise is that Kansas can bring in impact transfers at such positions of need as linebacker and defensive line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. After Tyler Adams was withdrawn only minutes into Bournemouth's 4-4 draw against Manchester United on Monday, Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola confirmed the worst. Adams suffered a torn MCL and could be out for around two to three months, which not only delivers a blow to Bournemouth, but could also put his participation in critical United States men's national team friendlies in March, facing Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, in doubt, and adds questions about his potential fitness for the World Cup itself. In his pre-match presser ahead of facing Burnley on Saturday, Iraola made it clear that losing Adams is a blow to the Cherries and it's something that may force a tactical rethink. "We've had some experiences before with other players. But straight away, when you see the mechanism, the action, we were feeling that there could be something there. I think he's also a very unique player, very specific player in what he does. Alex [Scott] has been playing there as a number six. But it's true that he's a player that is difficult to replace because he's very, very unique," Iraola continued. Those qualities are what have made Adams indispensable for club and country. Scott isn't a natural number six, and Cook is more of a possession number six than the defensive shield that Adams has been. He's also added a long shot to his game with two goals this season in 15 league appearances for Bournemouth. On the bright side, this injury isn't one that is currently set to keep Adams out of the 2026 World Cup, but that doesn't mean that there isn't reason for Mauricio Pochettino to be concerned as well. Pochettino has now managed 22 games for the USMNT since taking over in September of 2024. Adams has only been available for 10 of them, missing time with various injuries. The Argentine has worked on a contingency plan due to the USMNT also not having another defensive midfielder of Adams' quality, and he has introduced a back three to cover the midfield while progressing the ball out wide. A healthy Adams would give Pochettino tactical flexibility, being able to set up in a 4-2-3-1 against top teams without needing to worry about cover, but over the past few years, a healthy Adams has become more of a hope than an expectation. If Adams isn't 100% come the World Cup, then Pochettino will need to take a look at what his other options are in defensive midfield: Weston McKennie: Despite being in and out of the USMNT and having his position shuffled from being a winger, a 10 or a box-to-box midfielder, McKennie is still atop the central midfield depth charts for the USMNT. Few players can bring the magic like McKennie when it comes to unleashing devastating passes or arriving in the box to head in a goal. Tanner Tessmann: Growing as a player by the day at Lyon, Tessmann is likely the next man up as a defensive midfielder for the USMNT, but he's also been playing center back for the French side, which could make him valuable elsewhere in the World Cup squad. Tessmann's rise has been rapid since leaving Venezia for Lyon, and with the club taking part in the Europa League and pushing for a Champions League place in Ligue One, he's gaining experience that will translate to the heightened pressure of a World Cup on home soil. Aidan Morris: There was a time when it seemed like Morris would be the next man up if anything were to happen to a player like Adams, but injuries have stunted his season, while Middlesbrough has also gone through a managerial shift during the season as Kim Hellberg has taken over for Michael Carrick. Other players to consider: There's still a strong chance that Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan could start when the World Cup kicks off after his strong performances under Pochettino without McKennie, but no matter what, he's in a position to be a squad player for the USMNT as things kick off. Johnny Cardoso is another player who has struggled to stay healthy and break into the XI for Atletico Madrid, but if he does so ahead of the March international break, that's another player who could be an x-factor in the squad. Sebastian Berhalter has been the best player in the squad at set piece delivery, which needs to be taken into consideration, and while Yunus Musah is also struggling for playing time, given his talent level, there could be a conversation to have if he earns more playing time at Atalanta.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And for those who thought it was incongruous that two US marines should carry in the peace trophy, the original White House idea was that the soldiers should be next to Trump when he was presented with the award, but Fifa must have talked them out of it. No response had been received at the time of publication. Where does all the Fifa World Cup ticket money go? A not insignificant chunk will have gone on 500 officials from 211 countries being flown to Doha, Qatar, this week for a jamboree. Infantino has more than tripled the number of committees from nine to more than 30, providing hundreds of new officials with generous per diems of $500 (about £375) when attending meetings, as well as business-class flights and five-star hotels. Fifa's bill for the “inaugural committee plenary session” is expected to be £3million. Perhaps like his predecessor, Sepp Blatter, he realised that a bloated committee structure is a good way of handing out favours to the people who vote for him. Russian influence in Olympic sports continues despite the country's ban from the Games, with shooting now caught up in claims of a vote-buying controversy involving an oligarch. His defeated opponent, Karoliina Nissinen of Finland, registered a complaint after Ratner promised in his manifesto that a Russian oligarch, Vladimir Lisin, would provide each of the 51 member nations €200,000 (€23.1million, about £20.2million, in total) if they extended his presidency. Lisin was present at the vote in Armenia in October despite being forced to stand down as the ISSF president three years ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ratner has denied any wrongdoing in an email, dismissing the claims of “a defeated candidate”. He said Lisin has been “the main and traditional sponsor of the European and international shooting sports for over 15 years”. Nissinen objected to Ratner's offer, saying federations operating on an annual budget of as little as €50,000 per year were suddenly given a huge incentive to vote for him. Oldham rugby league club decided to mark their 150th anniversary with a commemorative shirt saying “150 — Stronger Together” on the back. The club have told fans who have bought them as Christmas presents that they will replace them for free once correctly spelt versions arrive in the new year, but insiders say many supporters have chosen to buy the duds as a collector's item. England's Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor are in the running to referee at the 2026 World Cup, having been chosen by Fifa to attend a seminar in March as part of the pre-selection process. France is the only other European country to have two referees selected. Another English official, Chris Kavanagh, has been promoted to Uefa's elite referees group, having been in charge of a number of Champions League games.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill said a Jersey congestion pricing toll is a possibility after talking to reporters at her second diner tour stop in Waldwick on Wednesday. Sherrill, a Democrat won last month's election to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, responded to a comment from a radio reporter that a resident suggested New Jersey drivers should not pay New York's $9 congestion pricing fee to go to FIFA World Cup events in New York City. “Or people coming to our state from New York will pay us a congestion toll so they can enjoy the game,” Sherrill replied. When asked if it's a possibility for the World Cup games, she said: “Yeah, certainly.” This isn't the first time a congestion pricing fee to enter New Jersey has been suggested after New York implemented a law passed in 2019 that led to the program that charges drivers a toll to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street and started on Jan. 5. Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop proposed a reverse toll on New Yorkers in April 2019 that would exempt New Jersey residents. He included that idea in his 2023 transportation platform when he ran for the Democratic nomination for governor. Fulop lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to Sherrill in June 2025. There are few examples of highway tolls being charged for a specific event. A toll agency in Washington State did the opposite on Dec. 11, when the Washington State Transportation Commission voted not to charge a $1 surcharge in addition to regular tolls to use the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle during the summer World Cup games. That idea was proposed by state lawmakers as a way to cover cost of handling additional traffic during the games in June and July. Kathy Hochul ordered the MTA to drop it. The reverse toll was mentioned after Sherrill was asked a question about New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani referring to the World Cup finals as a New York event. “With all due respect, maybe he doesn't know where the games are going to be played because that's in New Jersey,” she said, adding the state is proud to host the games and the fan zone in Liberty State Park in Jersey City. “Governor-elect Sherrill is fully committed to hosting the most exciting and successful World Cup Final in history,” said Sean Higgins, a Sherrill spokesman. “And she is equally committed to ensuring that New Jersey sees as much benefit from our investment as possible, both to the state and to its residents.” Sherrill, a former congresswoman, will take office Jan. 20.

RABAT, Morocco (AP) — Sébastien Haller, who led host nation Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations title in the last edition, has been ruled out of the tournament starting on Sunday because of injury.

The Ivorian Federation of Football said on social media on Friday that Haller will miss the event in Morocco because of an injury sustained while playing for Dutch team Utrecht. Haller reportedly injured his hamstring in a match against NAC Breda last Sunday.

He was to be replaced in the Ivorian squad by Aston Villa player Evann Guessand.

Haller missed the start of the 2023 Africa Cup because of an ankle injury but he returned to score winning goals against Congo in the semifinals and Nigeria in the final as the host team completed a remarkable turnaround after near elimination.

Haller became the team's hero one year after returning from cancer treatment.

Ivory Coast begins its title defense on Wednesday against Mozambique. Host Morocco plays the opening match against Comoros in Rabat on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The winner of the 2026 World Cup will receive $50 million from a $655 million prize pool, FIFA said Wednesday in announcing record financial rewards for teams in a tournament with ticket prices that have sparked outcries. The champion's figure is up from $42 million won by Argentina in 2022 and $38 million gained by France in 2018 but less than half of what Chelsea earned for winning the much less-hyped Club World Cup this year. FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2023 set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups — the next women's tournament is scheduled for 2027 in Brazil. The Club World Cup, controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar last summer, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. Chelsea won the top prize of up to $125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches. FIFA has a different distribution model for the national team and club tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs with higher wage costs than national teams. Beyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of soccer globally. Infantino said the World Cup will be “groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community.” In Europe, the Champions League also has a much bigger top prize than the European Championship for national teams. Both competitions are run by European soccer's governing body UEFA. In March it projected revenue for its current four-year cycle through 2026 at $13 billion, up from $7.5 billion for 2019-22. Teams advancing to the new round of 32 get $11 million and those reaching the round of 16 receive $15 million. Including participation fees, FIFA will distribute $727 million to the 48 federations. Each federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final. The U.S. Soccer Federation's 2022 collective bargaining agreements with the unions for its men's and women's national teams call for prize money for men in 2026 and women in 2027 to be pooled together, and 80% of the money to be distributed among the players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FC Bayern officially loses two world championship titles – a FIFA decision with far-reaching consequences. FC Bayern can no longer officially call themselves Club World Champions in future due to a fundamental reform of the FIFA Club World Cup, which has far-reaching consequences for all previous title holders – including the German record champions As part of this reorientation, FIFA has reclassified all previous Club World Cup titles won between 2000 and 2023. This decision is particularly controversial for FC Bayern, who won the FIFA Club World Cup twice – in 2013 and 2020, both a few months after their Champions League triumph. According to FIFA statistics, these successes will no longer be considered world championship titles in future Instead, all previous winners will now be listed as „FIFA Intercontinental Champions“. With this renaming, FIFA wants to make it clear that the new Club World Cup is not seen as a further development, but as a completely new competition. This competition effectively replaces the old Club World Cup on an annual basis However, in 2017 FIFA also retroactively awarded these winners the title of „Club World Champion“ – a decision that is at least called into question by the current reform In total, all Club World Cup winners between 2000 and 2023 will be affected</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RABAT, Morocco (AP) — The Africa Cup of Nations begins Sunday with host Morocco aiming to put on a spectacle befitting its quest to become a global soccer power. Twenty-four teams from across the continent will compete in nine new or completely renovated stadiums in six cities. Defending champion Ivory Coast enjoyed a hardly believable run to the title as host last time out, and Nigeria will hope to go one better after losing the final. Sadio Mané's Senegal is back again after winning the 2021 edition, and Egypt will hope speculation over Mohamed Salah's future does not distract the team from claiming a record-extending eighth continental crown. Every Africa Cup since 2013 has been moved because of problems with the original host. This tournament was initially meant to be played in the summer, but CAF agreed to postpone it so it wouldn't clash with FIFA's new Club World Cup competition. CAF switched the Africa Cup to a summer schedule in 2017, effective from the 2019 tournament in Egypt. Then the 2021 tournament that was postponed a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic was switched to January because of the “unfavorable climatic conditions” during summer in host nation Cameroon. Morocco, which won in 1976, is under pressure to claim what would be just its second Africa Cup title. The Atlas Lions begin their quest against tiny Comoros in the newly constructed 69,500-capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium on Sunday. Also in Group A are Mali and Zambia. Group B sees a clash between Egypt and South Africa, which eliminated Morocco at the last edition, while Angola and Zimbabwe will hope to upset the favorites. Nigeria will be expected to emerge from Group C, where the Super Eagles will face Tunisia, Uganda and Tanzania. Congo was only beaten by eventual winner Ivory Coast in the semifinals at the last edition. The Desert Foxes will face Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea and Sudan. Group F sees a tussle between defending champion Ivory Coast and five-time champion Cameroon, whose preparations have been overshadowed by the firing of the coach amid a dispute with federation president Samuel Eto'o. Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi's face beams from — it seems — every advertising display sign in Rabat. Time will tell if he recovers from an ankle injury to feature for the team. Salah will be the focus of attention in the Egypt camp amid speculation he could leave Liverpool after he vented his frustrations at his lack of playing time there. The Galatasaray forward's absence through injuries is a big reason the Super Eagles did not qualify for next year's World Cup. Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo will be key for Cameroon's hopes, and Yan Diomande is expected to sparkle for Ivory Coast after his brilliant start to the season for German club Leipzig. “AFCON is a fantastic international tournament that is only gaining greater recognition on the world footballing stage,” Richard Verow, beIN's chief sports officer, told The Associated Press. CAF published a full list of European broadcasters on its website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Cobb County, the Atlanta United Training facility will serve as a base camp. Teams will also train at Kennesaw State University and Paces Academy. COBB COUNTY, Ga. - Some of the teams in the FIFA World Cup will be training in Cobb County, and county leaders are expecting big crowds as fans try to get a glimpse of their favorite players. The county says there will be extra public safety, transportation and emergency management needs. To help with this, the county has applied for millions of dollars in federal grants, including one which would be used for training and overtime for personnel and another to enhance the county's ability to detect unauthorized drone activity. Cobb has experience when it comes to large sporting events. "You look at MLB All Star week, it was a condense area, this is going to be spread out," said Register. "You're going to have fans from across the globe. There will be many more meetings before the World Cup. "I'm honored to be part of a county that will host FIFA. I'm looking forward to a very enjoyable, safe event," Register.
