The Ns2b-Ns3 protease plays a crucial role in replicating the dengue virus, yet no effective treatment has been found to completely block its activity and prevent viral replication. To address this, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and in vitro studies to identify potential antiviral compounds. Our research revealed three promising compounds that successfully bound to key sites on the protease, offering new avenues for inhibiting dengue virus infection. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Hassan Kotey et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd. A pharmacophore model was employed to guide the screening process, and a threshold of 55 was set for the pharmacophore fit. Following this criterion, three compounds emerged as top candidates, having successfully met the specified threshold and demonstrating a strong alignment with the pharmacophore model. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Hassan Kotey et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd. Compound 3 exhibited a complete absence of bands. The University for Development Studies (UDS) is Ghana's first public University in the North. It was established by the Government of Ghana by PNDC Law 279 and gazette on 15th May, 1992. The pedagogical philosophy of UDS is said to have been borne out of a new thinking in higher education emphasizing the need for universities as teaching and research institutions to play more active role in addressing societal problems (especially rural areas) for speedy development. The University by its mandate and constituency has a pro-poor focus and this is reflected in its methodology of teaching, research and outreach services. The specific emphasis on practically-oriented, research and field-based training is aimed at contributing towards poverty reduction in order to accelerate national development.

It has not undergone peer review but has been reviewed to meet AZoNetwork's editorial quality standards.

High-throughput functional screening of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) accelerates antibody discovery, overcoming the slow, labor-intensive limitations of hybridoma and memory B cell screening, and capturing rare, high-affinity clones. Here, we present a new Xdrop protocol that enables rapid functional screening of plasma cells from immunized animals. With a throughput of over eight million droplets in a few minutes, Xdrop compartmentalizes single cells, along with the antibody discovery assay, inside FACS-compatible droplets. This approach preserves cell viability, detects secreted antibodies within droplets, and supports direct V(D)J repertoire analysis as well as recovery of antigen-specific cells. With a streamlined, same-day workflow, this method dramatically reduces discovery timelines and enhances the identification of functional antibody candidates.

Secreted human anti-TNFα-specific antibodies bind to the hTNFα-coated microspheres, allowing fluorescent detection via a labeled goat anti-mouse detection antibody, generating a concentrated and identifiable signal on the spheres. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Mette Juul Jacobsen et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd. Image of droplets containing the Xdrop ASC screening assay taken with Xcyto®5 (ChemoMetec). For imaging, cells were stained post-droplet production with Calcein Blue, AM. Cells secreting anti-hTNFα-antibodies clearly show an accumulated fluorescent signal on the TNFα-coated microspheres. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Mette Juul Jacobsen et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd. Gating strategy for sorting Xdrop DE50 droplets containing plasma cells sorted on Sony MA900 Cell Sorter with Large Particle Sorting upgrade. The DE50 droplets are identified on a scatter plot. Since only dead cells are labeled, both droplets containing live cells as well as empty droplets are gated. From these, droplets containing plasma cells that secrete anti-hTNFα antibodies clearly show an accumulated fluorescent signal from the AF594-labeled detection antibody. Heavy chain isotype distribution showing enrichment of IgG in TNFα-specific ASCs. Light chain isotype distribution frequency was uniform as expected. From approximately one million CD138+ B cells screened per mouse, droplets with the strongest TNFα-specific signal yielded ~16,000 (Mouse A) and ~10,000 (Mouse B) sorted droplets (Table 1). This represents roughly one-third of each mouse's plasma cell pool, suggesting over 10,000 sequences could be obtained in total. Sequencing showed a clear enrichment of class-switched IgG plasma cells within the antigen-specific fraction, whereas the non-screened ASCs displayed a more mixed profile dominated by IgM (Figure 5). This pattern indicates that the screening method preferentially isolates mature, class-switched plasma cells that are likely to secrete high-affinity anti-TNFα antibodies. Each cluster represents a unique clonotype, with cluster size proportional to its relative frequency within the repertoire. Expanded clonotypes are represented by larger clusters concentrated toward the centre, whereas rare clonotypes appear as smaller symbols at the periphery. The Xdrop ASC screen enriches specific clonotypes shared with the unscreened population, while others remain dominant only in unscreened ASCs and are not enriched by the screen. This study demonstrates a rapid, one-day workflow for screening and isolating targeted plasma cells based on their secreted antibody specificity, yielding thousands of high-quality V(D)J sequences. The method effectively enriches for class-switched, antigen-specific clonotypes, enabling focused analysis of functional antibody repertoires. Based on the number of paired V(D)J sequences obtained, it is estimated that over 10,000 sequences can be acquired from the full plasma cell population of the two animals. Samplix offers a cutting-edge droplet-based instrument for single-cell analysis in immunotherapy research. Their double emulsion technology enables seamless analysis and sorting on flow cytometers. Xdrop encapsulates living cells and reactive molecules in highly stable double-emulsion droplets that act as microenvironments for rapid cell–cell and cell–molecule interactions during incubation. The droplets are suitable for flow cytometry and sorting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leon Harris, 35, is intimately familiar with the devastation guns can inflict. He finds camaraderie with other gunshot survivors and in advocacy. Still, trauma remains lodged in his daily life. He moved his family out of Philadelphia to a leafy suburb in Delaware. Now he is thinking about buying a gun. Harris is one of tens of thousands of Americans killed or injured each year by gun violence, a public health crisis that escalated in the pandemic and churns a new victim into a hospital emergency room every half hour. Over the past two decades, the firearm industry has ramped up production and stepped up sales campaigns through social media influencers, conference presentations, and promotions. An industry trade group acknowledged that its traditional customer was "pale, male and stale" and in recent years began targeting Black people and other communities of color who are disproportionately victimized by gun violence. The Trump administration has moved to reduce federal oversight of gun businesses, heralding a new era announced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as "marked by transparency, accountability, and partnership with the firearms industry." They were nearly 14 times as likely to die by gun homicide than white people in 2021, researchers said, citing federal data. Washington has offered little relief: Guns remain one of few consumer products the federal government does not regulate for health and safety. "The politics of guns in the U.S. are so out of whack with proper priorities that should focus on health and safety and most fundamental rights to live," said attorney Jon Lowy, founder of Global Action on Gun Violence, who helped represent Mexico in an unsuccessful lawsuit against Smith & Wesson and other gunmakers that reached the Supreme Court. KFF Health News undertook an examination of gun violence during the pandemic, a period when firearm deaths reached an all-time high. The examination found that while public officials imposed restrictions intended to prevent covid's spread, politicians and regulators helped fuel gun sales — and another public health crisis. As state and local governments shut down schools, advised residents to stay home, and closed gyms, theaters, malls, and other businesses to stop covid's spread, President Donald Trump kept gun stores open, deeming them essential businesses critical to the functioning of society. White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to interview requests or answer questions about the Trump administration's efforts to reduce regulation of the firearm industry. During the pandemic, the federal government gave firearm businesses and groups more than $150 million in financial assistance through the Paycheck Protection Program, even as some businesses reported brisk sales, according to an analysis from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group. Federal officials said the program would keep people employed, but millions of dollars went to firearm companies that did not say whether it would save any jobs, the report said. About 1 in 5 American households bought a gun during the first two years of the pandemic, including millions of first-time buyers, according to survey data from NORC at the University of Chicago. Harris is keenly aware of what drives the demand. "Guns aren't going away unless we get to the root of people's fears," he said. Surveys show most Americans who own a gun feel it makes them safer. But public health data suggests that owning a gun doubles the risk of homicide and triples chances of suicide in a home. "There's no evidence that guns provide an increase in protection," said Kelly Drane, research director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. His mother, Crystal Anlage, said she fell to her knees and wailed in grief on her lawn when police delivered the news. She said Jacquez overcame years in the foster care system — living in 36 homes — before she and her husband, Matt, adopted him at age 16. Jacquez Anlage had just moved into his own apartment when he was shot. He loved animals and wanted to become a veterinary technician. He was kind and loving, Crystal Anlage said, with the 6-foot-4, 215-pound physique of the football and basketball player he'd been. Gun violence researchers say parents like Crystal Anlage carry trauma that destroys their sense of security. Anlage said she endures post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. But she has made something meaningful of her son's killing: She co-founded the Jacksonville Survivors Foundation, which works to raise awareness about the impact of homicide and to support grieving parents. "Jacquez's death can't be in vain," she said. His legacy and that of other young men killed by guns is muted by firearm manufacturers' powerful message of fear. During the pandemic, gun marketers told Americans they needed firearms to defend themselves against criminals, protesters, unreliable cops, and racial and political unrest, according to a petition filed by gun control advocacy groups with the Federal Trade Commission. In a since-deleted June 18, 2020, Instagram post from Lone Wolf Arms, an Idaho-based manufacturer, a protester is depicted being confronted by police officers in riot gear between the words "Defund Police? The caption says, "10% to 25% off demo guns and complete pistols." "You might be stockpiling up on food right now to get through this current crisis," she said, "but if you aren't preparing to defend your property when everything goes wrong, you're really just stockpiling for somebody else." Weapons sold at the beginning of the pandemic were more likely to wind up at crime scenes within a year than in any previous period, according to a report by Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee, citing ATF data. Gun manufacturers "used disturbing sales tactics" following mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, "while failing to take even basic steps to monitor the violence and destruction their products have unleashed," according to a separate memo released by congressional Democrats in July 2022 following a House Oversight and Reform Committee investigation of industry practices and profits. The firearm industry has marketed "to white supremacist and extremist organizations for years, playing on fears of government repression against gun owners and fomenting racial tensions," the House investigation said. "The increase in racially motivated violence has also led to rising rates of gun ownership among Black Americans, allowing the industry to profit from both white supremacists and their targets." The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for protecting consumers from deceptive and unfair business practices and has the power to take enforcement action. It issued warnings to companies that made unsubstantiated claims their products could prevent or treat covid, for instance. But when families of gun violence victims, lawmakers, and advocacy groups asked the FTC in 2022, during Biden's term, to investigate how firearms were marketed to children, people of color, and groups that espouse white supremacy, officials did not announce any public action. This summer, the National Shooting Sports Foundation pressed its case to the FTC and derided "a coordinated 'lawfare' campaign" that it said gun control groups have waged against "constitutionally-protected firearm advertising." FTC spokesperson Mitchell Katz declined to comment, saying in an email that the agency does not acknowledge or deny the existence of investigations. Serena Viswanathan, who retired as an FTC associate director in June, told KFF Health News that the agency lost at least a quarter of the staff in its advertising practices division after Trump came into office in January. In an August 2022 social media post, Smith & Wesson President and CEO Mark Smith said gun manufacturers were being wrongly blamed by some politicians for the pandemic surge in violence, saying cities experiencing violent crime had "promoted irresponsible, soft-on-crime policies that often treat criminals as victims and victims as criminals." He added, "Some now seek to prohibit firearm manufacturers and supporters of the 2nd Amendment from advertising products in a manner designed to remind law-abiding citizens that they have a Constitutional right to bear arms in defense of themselves and their families." In 2015, the National Shooting Sports Foundation gathered supporters at a conference in Savannah, Georgia, and urged the firearm industry to diversify its customer base, according to a YouTube video and reports from Everytown for Gun Safety and the Violence Policy Center. Competitive shooter Chris Cheng gave a presentation called "Diversity: The Next Big Opportunity." They said Hispanic shooters were "much more trusting of advertising and celebrities." The new sales pitch: guns for personal safety. They are selling the product as an antidote to fear and anxiety." Gun manufacturers were harshly criticized in the Oversight Committee's 2022 investigation for marketing products to people of color, as gun violence remains a leading cause of death for young Black and Latino men. At the same time, some companies also promoted assault rifles to white supremacist groups who believe a race war is imminent, the investigation found. Still, Philip Smith wants more Black people to get guns for protection. Smith said he was working as a human resources consultant a decade ago when he got the idea to form the National African American Gun Association, which helped the National Shooting Sports Foundation compile its report on communicating with Black consumers. After 10 years, Smith said, his group has about 45,000 members nationwide. Single members pay $39 a year and couples $59, which gives them access to discounts from the organization's corporate partners, including gunmakers, and raffles for gun giveaways, according to its website. The police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin helped spark early interest from doctors, lawyers, and others in joining the group, he said. But interest took off during the pandemic, he said, even among Democrats who had resisted the idea of owning a gun. "Hundreds of people called me and said, 'I don't agree with anything you're saying, but what kind of gun should I buy,'" Smith recalled. Smith, describing himself as "quiet, nerdy, and Afrocentric," said criticism of guns misses the point. "My ancestors bled for us to have this right," he said. But we should buy guns because there is a need. No one is forcing us to buy guns." Many of the cases haven't been solved by police. At a conference last year inside the Eagles' football stadium, victims of firearm violence or their relatives joined activists to share accounts of near-death experiences and the grief of losing loved ones. Paintings flanked the stage and the meeting space to commemorate people who had been fatally shot, nearly all young people of color, under messages such as "You are loved and missed forever" and "Those we love never leave." "We suffer from the disease of American amnesia," he said. Harris was on his way home from a job at Burlington Coat Factory nearly two decades ago when robbers followed him from a bus stop and demanded money. Harris had spent his early life fixing cars with his grandfather, when he wasn't at school or attending church. The only way I got through it was my faith in God." Harris endured years of rehabilitation and counseling for PTSD. As someone in a wheelchair, he said, he sometimes fears for his safety — and a gun may be one of the few ways to protect himself and his family. "I'm afraid of my trauma hurting someone else. That's the only reason I haven't gotten one yet."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Evidence from Spain's regional reforms suggests that delaying legal access to alcohol can support adolescent well-being. Study: Minimum legal drinking age and educational outcomes. A recent study in the Journal of Health Economics explores the impact of minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) changes on educational outcomes for teenagers, using different implementation timelines across Spain's regions. Alcohol use among European teenagers is notably higher than in other parts of the world. Nearly half of European adolescents aged 15 to 16 reported drinking alcohol in the past month, and 30 % engaged in at least one binge drinking episode during that time. In comparison, just 12 % of U.S. teens aged 14 to 17 drank alcohol, and only 6 % reported binge drinking over the same period. To curb alcohol use among adolescents, many European governments have introduced measures such as higher alcohol taxes, stricter licensing regulations, and tighter advertising restrictions. Over the past two decades, however, many European nations have raised the MLDA to 18, enacting broad reforms that limit minors' access to alcohol, restrict sales, and further regulate alcohol promotion. Research shows adolescent alcohol use negatively impacts brain development, academic performance, and long-term outcomes. Despite its importance, little empirical research has examined how MLDA laws affect educational outcomes, especially in Europe, where youth may be more vulnerable to alcohol's effects. Most studies focus on the US and show mixed results, suggesting European outcomes may differ due to cultural and legal differences and higher youth drinking rates. The current study focuses on reforms from 2003 to 2019, when four regions (Castile and Leon, Galicia, Asturias, and the Balearic Islands) implemented MLDA increases. This study used a difference-in-differences approach, which revealed medium-term educational effects and peer spillovers not captured by earlier US studies using regression discontinuity designs (RDD). Teenage alcohol and substance use were measured using Spain's High School Survey on Drug Use, a biennial, anonymous in-class survey of approximately 250,000 students from 2004 to 2021. During this period, alcohol use was widespread among Spanish teenagers, with 60% of those aged 14 to 17 having consumed alcohol in the previous month, 34 % engaging in binge drinking, and 24 % experiencing intoxication. Additionally, 19 % reported memory loss after drinking, 15 % struggled to focus at school, and 33% had hangovers. Information on educational outcomes was obtained from two sources. Academic performance was assessed using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a triennial OECD survey that used standardized tests and measured educational inputs, covering about 180,000 students from 2003 to 2022. Educational attainment was measured using the 2021 census, focusing on individuals born between 1987 and 2002 (approximately 600,000 people); 78 % completed secondary education, and 42 % attended or completed college. The effect of MLDA changes was estimated using a difference-in-differences approach with wild bootstrap standard errors. After the MLDA rose to 18, it became modestly harder for underage youth to get alcohol. Fewer teenagers bought alcohol in bars, but the majority obtained it through adults. Parents' attitudes remained the same, but more young people saw heavy drinking as a problem. The MLDA changes improved educational outcomes, raising average PISA scores by about 4 % of a standard deviation. The effect was stronger for children of highly educated parents, reflecting their greater reduction in alcohol use, although this was not statistically significant. However, these results were not explained by changes in school resources, class size, instructional hours, or student effort. Long-term, the MLDA changes did not affect secondary school completion, but there was suggestive evidence of a small increase in college attendance. Raising the MLDA was also associated with modest improvements in mental-health–related outcomes, as less access to alcohol was associated with lower use of anxiety or sleep medications. It must be noted that the MLDA increase did not significantly affect the use of other illegal substances, smoking, or cannabis. It also had no clear impact on teens' social lives or leisure activities such as going out, internet use, gaming, or sports. Raising the MLDA from 16 to 18 in Spain led to a decrease in underage drinking, which was consistent across age, gender, and region. Reductions in alcohol consumption were accompanied by improvements in academic performance and a decrease in the use of anxiety and sleep medications among teens. The findings suggest that, across Europe, stricter MLDA laws could effectively improve student outcomes at a relatively low cost.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premenopause or “before” menopause refers to the reproductive time in a cisgender woman's life when they have regular menstrual cycles. With the expanded approval to postmenopausal women under 65, Medical News Today spoke with three women's health experts to find out more about how Addyi works, its side effects, what does this approval mean for menopausal women, and any non-medication alternatives they suggest for low libido. “Addyi is a non hormonal medication that works on neurotransmitters in the brain to help regulate mood and increase sex drive,” Susan Marie Pacana, MD, minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon and OB/GYN at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, told MNT. “Addyi is a medication for women that, according to the manufacturer, increases sexual desire,” Prudence Hall, MD, an OB/GYN in private practice in Santa Monica, CA, and author of Radiant Again & Forever: Overcome Menopause & Restore Your Radiance, added. “After taking it for a month, dopamine and serotonin levels are apparently enhanced, which supposedly increases sexual desire.”— Prudence Hall, MD With the expanded approval for postmenopausal women under the age of 65, G. Thomas Ruiz, MD, a board certified OB/GYN at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told MNT that Addyi could now help a greater number of women. Pacana, who is also a Menopause Society Certified Practitioner, commented that the lack of medications for low libido has been a long-standing issue, but the new FDA approval for this treatment up to age 65 is a major step forward. “Women of all ages present to our office with complaints of low sex drive that affect their relationships, self-esteem, and body image,” she explained. “It often is accompanied by feelings of shame, frustration and guilt when women are unable to meet their partner's sexual expectations.” “Previously, I could prescribe it off-label for postmenopausal women, but they were unfairly denied insurance coverage. Now, with this official approval, we can finally expect insurers to cover this necessary treatment for a wider population of women.” — Susan Marie Pacana, MD Like all medications, Addyi has known potential side effects, including: However, Addyi also carries a “black box” warning from the FDA as when taken with alcohol or certain medications, Addyi can cause low blood pressure (severe hypotension) or a risk of fainting (syncope). Ruiz said it would be very helpful for the drug company to issue a simple handout of all the “do's and don'ts” associated with Addyi. “They've got to make it as least confusing for patients to use as possible, so a simple do's and don'ts information sheet would be useful,” he detailed. It is not uncommon for women to tell me that their desire is completely gone and that they can't even have an orgasm.” — Prudence Hall, MD Women report that their sexuality returns to youthful levels causing a resurgence of intimacy and contentment with themselves and their relationships,” Hall continued. For women, [i]t's a little bit more diffused and not as direct, so that arousal time may take 20 to 30 minutes.” — G. Thomas Ruiz, MD Foreplay may take all day — it's not a crazy thing to think about. “I also will also encourage women to practice with self stimulation so that they understand how their body works and they communicate that to their partner,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To date, more than 100 clinical trials with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived products have been initiated worldwide and an increasing number of potential hPSC-derived clinical products have entered early developmental pipelines. For off-the-shelf (allogeneic) products, the identification and selection of the right hPSC line early on during this process is of utmost importance as failure to do so may delay or completely stall product development. While developers acknowledge the importance of this issue, a comprehensive, accessible listing of globally available hPSC lines to inform cell line selection for clinical use has been elusive until now. To address this knowledge gap, Tenneille Ludwig, WiCell Research Institute, and Melissa Carpenter, Carpenter Consulting Corporation, have screened the scientific literature, websites, and gathered information from hPSC manufacturers to identify 166 hPSC lines for use in clinical applications which are currently available from 18 global distributors. Critical details about those cell lines including informed consent procedures, donor sex, blood and HLA type, quality standards applied, and modalities for licencing and distribution were compiled into a paper published today in the journal Stem Cell Reports.
