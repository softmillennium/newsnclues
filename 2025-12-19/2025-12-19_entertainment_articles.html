For production designer Cara Brower, the assignment wasn't about designing sets that were perfect historical recreations, but revealing a perfect window into Hedda's (Tessa Thompson) impish tastes and proclivities. “So when I met up with Nia, she wanted to mae a period film that was really unique and had its own voice and didn't look like anything else,” Brower said as part of IndieWire's recent crafts roundtable. “I dove deep into the socialites of the era, and then I could see that some of these houses were really flamboyant, and so then that gave me the freedom to do something that wasn't expected.” Related Stories How Production Designer Alexandra Schaller Brought the Dreamy Qualities of ‘Train Dreams' Down to Earth Jessica Sanders to Receive 2025 Lynn Shelton Of a Certain Age Grant Brower used that freedom to defy the conventions and colors of a typical English manor house in the exact same way the film's protagonist would have, too, burning through her hapless husband's (Tom Bateman) borrowed cash to make a house that looks rakishly cool and original, just as she is. Without stepping beyond pieces and designs that would be plausible for the post-war period, Brower packed each room with touches that Hedda would've chosen to stick it to the gentry lineage she feels cut off from.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today co-host Savannah Guthrie said that she will be absent from the show for a couple of weeks to have surgery on her vocal cords. Guthrie told viewers on Friday that she has “felt like Peter Brady these past few weeks and months. Some of you have noticed that my voice has been very scratchy and started to scratch a little bit like Peter Brady.” She was referring to an episode of The Brady Bunch in which Peter Brady's voice cracks just as he and his siblings are trying to establish singing careers. “I have found out what it is. It's not a big, big deal, but I am going to have a surgery real early in the new year and be off for a couple of weeks. So it's my last day for a little while. So I just want to let everyone know, and if you've been wondering, do I have the world's longest head cold? I have to be silent for a couple of weeks, totally silent,” she said, adding, “the jokes write themselves.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Laura Marcus (Death by Lightning, Sunrise on the Reaping) has been cast as a series regular in Netflix's Assassin's Creed. In the live-action series based on Ubisoft's bestselling video game franchise, she joins previously cast leads Toby Wallace and Lola Petticrew and fellow series regular Zachary Hart. Assassin's Creed is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny. No details about Marcus' role are being disclosed. Assassin's Creed is targeting a 2026 start of production in Italy, which serves as a setting of the series, with the exact time period unclear. Showrunners Roberto Patino and David Wiener executive produce alongside Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole. With more than 230 million units sold, Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the bestselling series in video game history. This marks Marcus' second Netflix series; she can be seen in the streamer's limited series Death By Lighting as former U.S. president James Garfield's (Michael Shannon) daughter Mollie Garfield. She recently recurred on Season 2 of Disney+'s Andor and next stars as Silka in The Hunger Games prequel Sunrise on the Reaping. English actress Marcus, whose series credits also include Starz's The Serpent Queen, BBC's Bad Education and The Jetty and Prime Video's The Devil's Hour, is repped by Conway Van Gelder Grant, Luber Roklin Entertainment and Michael A. Auerbach. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Clint Bentley's latest film, “Train Dreams,” has a hard balance to strike between the meditative, almost shy, and quite heartbreaking interiority of its protagonist, logger and lumberman Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton), and the harsh, cyclical world in which he lives. Every choice production designer Alexandra Schaller made needed to support both worlds that the film moves effortlessly between. ”We wanted a very documentary-like quality to the movie. We wanted the design to feel invisible,” Schaller told IndieWire as part of our recent craft roundtable. We listened to a lot of oral histories from the time.” Related Stories Jessica Sanders to Receive 2025 Lynn Shelton Of a Certain Age Grant Ebertfest Will Return for One Final Year It was these stories of men building cabins and drifting from job to job and fishing from the river that inspired Schaller to make choices that would speak to what it would actually be like to live in the Pacific Northwest of that time — not just the right items from a Sears catalogue, but a lived-in sense of what it would be like to live that particular life. There's a dreamlike quality woven through the narrative.” It's the more dreamlike movements of “Train Dreams” that inspired Schaller and her art team to elevate the period details slightly, to go a little bit further in terms of how colors match or create depth, to set off Grainier's memories and imagination.

The statement concluded, “What began as a commitment to compassion has evolved into a powerful force for meaningful change, particularly in championing global mental wellness across our communities.” Markle, 44, and Prince Harry, 41, launched the foundation in 2020 after stepping down from their royal duties.

Markle, who also runs her lifestyle brand, As Ever, and Prince Harry are also producing a film adaptation of Carley Fortune's novel “Meet Me at the Lake” for the streamer. However, Page Six previously reported that they have not yet hired a director or cast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Close to 70 years after German instrument company Höfner started selling an electric bass that looked like a violin, the company has filed for bankruptcy. “It is very sad to see Höfner go out of business,” McCartney wrote on Instagram. “They have been making instruments for over 100 years, and I bought my first Höfner bass in the Sixties. It also offers pleasing variations in tone that I enjoy. So commiserations to everyone at Höfner, and thank you for all your help over the years.” The Beatles‘ association with Höfner instruments goes back to their Quarrymen days. John Lennon's first “good” guitar, according to Mark Lewisohn's Beatles biography Tune In, was also a Club 40. The band's original bassist, Stuart Sutcliffe, started playing a Höfner President 333, which looked similar to the instrument McCartney would later make famous, in 1960. During times when Sutcliffe wasn't around, McCartney would pick up the 333 and play it upside down, as he is left-handed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“TODAY” host Savannah Guthrie announced on Friday, December 19, that she will be undergoing surgery that will force her to step away from her hosting role for weeks. Guthrie, 53, opened up about a health battle she has been dealing with for years. “Some of you have noticed that my voice has been very scratchy and started to crack a little bit,” Guthrie told viewers on Friday. “Well, I have found out what it is. During her recovery, Guthrie will have to remain “totally silent” for a couple weeks, which she joked would be an “early” Christmas gift for her family. Guthrie's cohost and longtime friend, Sheinelle Jones, revealed she previously underwent the same surgery. “The silver lining is you have permission to be still,” Jones shared. “A lot of the greats in the business have done it, maybe you'll come out singing like, I don't know, Celine Dion,” Jones joked. “This has been going on for years, honestly,” she told her cohosts. The mother of two was forced to take a break in 2019 to undergo eye surgery to reattach her right retina after her 3-year-old son accidentally hit her with a toy train. She added, “That was the first time I felt freaked out. I was hoping that they weren't going to get in there and see, ‘Oh, it's worse than we thought.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kobe Bryant didn't like what he was seeing. And, in several haunting instances, scenes aboard his helicopter. According to a source present at the screening, Bryant was visibly frustrated. “Kobe was like, ‘Yeah we're scrapping that and starting over,'” he recalls. At a moment when demand for prestige sports documentaries had been booming, it was more than gold — it was a Hope diamond. Just a few months later, of course, it would become even more valuable. A slew of prominent producers and directors, including two Oscar winners, have lined up with offers to shape it all into the documentary Bryant once imagined creating for himself. According to the filmmakers and others familiar with the talks, they've all run into the same stubborn obstacle: Vanessa Bryant, Kobe's widow, who, it turns out, has her own very specific vision for what sort of movie should be made. And it's not a film anyone else seems interested in making. “It's the white whale,” says one top producer of Bryant's final footage. “But it can't hold a director, and it's been sitting out there with this eternal promise that never seems to materialize.” Bryant's offices at Granity Studios did not look like what you might expect. Instead, there were framed images of Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and John Williams. Bryant's ambitions were not unusual among sports figures — plenty of athletes have chased Hollywood after retiring — but the scale and seriousness of his pivot were different. He wasn't looking to do cameos, brand deals or vanity projects. On THR‘s Awards Chatter podcast in 2017, Bryant was asked what his life would've looked like without basketball. His first major Hollywood collaboration was Muse, the 2015 Showtime doc he made with Gotham Chopra, co-founder of the documentary company Religion of Sports. Muse wasn't just Bryant's first serious Hollywood project, it was also the beginning of his relationship with Jake Bloch, the young director of photography he later hired to oversee the embedded crew filming his final season. His next project, the animated short Dear Basketball, pushed him further into the creative world he was building — and in a big way, winning a 2018 Academy Award. He expanded his team at Granity Studios, developing multiple projects. His scripted children's podcast, The Punies, was headed toward an animated TV series. In 2018, Bryant contacted McCollum about adapting The Wizenard Series: Training Camp, a children's book he co-wrote with Wesley King, into a Broadway musical. Bryant even explored working with Harry Potter director Chris Columbus on a film version. Along with Bloch, Bryant hired Jim Hession, a film editor who would later cut the 2023 Jon Batiste doc American Symphony, and Tony Hardmon, the cinematographer behind 2020's John Lewis: Good Trouble (both declined comment for this story, citing NDAs, as did numerous others contacted by THR). There were early disputes with the NBA, which enforces strict limits on who can shoot during games. As for what Bryant intended the documentary to be? Get a million hours of raw footage and then assess what he had and decide what to do,” says the Lakers source. Another collaborator recalls some uncertainty but notes Bryant was aware that a prestige documentary could bring in revenue to support his expanding creative ventures. Bryant's appearance in 2019's The Last Dance, the Emmy-winning Michael Jordan doc series that sold for $20 million and became a global sensation, may have also been an inspiration. “Kobe would have wanted to double that [$20 million],” says the Lakers source. “And if The Last Dance won three Emmys, Kobe would've wanted his to win five.” When Bryant's helicopter crashed into a Calabasas hillside on Jan. 26, 2020, the public impact was immediate and overwhelming. Twenty thousand people attended the official memorial, and millions watched or streamed it online. Murals of Bryant appeared not only across Southern California but around the world — more than 600 in total. In the years since, it's been Vanessa, Bryant's widow, who has become the central figure shaping and protecting his reputation — a new and sadly unexpected role. Throughout most of Bryant's playing career, and beyond, she had maintained a relatively low profile. “I wasn't privy to their conversations at home, but she only made a handful of appearances at Granity events,” notes Craig Greiwe, the former chief strategy officer at Rogers & Cowan PMK who oversaw accounts for both Bryant and Granity (and is one of the few collaborators who did not sign an NDA). And I've never once seen her speak publicly in support of any of the work he did after the NBA.” Today, though, Bryant's legacy appears to be an all-consuming occupation — and one she has often pursued with an army of lawyers beside her. For starters, she sued Los Angeles County in a U.S. district court after first responders circulated graphic crash-site photos; she ended up being awarded $44 million. And she prevailed in a legal dispute with Bryant's former business partner and onetime close friend Molly Carter over profits from his investment in the sports-drink company BodyArmor — a case that made international headlines when texts between Carter and Bryant entered the Orange County Superior Court record, including messages in which Carter referred to Kobe as a “douche nugget” and called Vanessa a “bitch.” Carter declined comment but according to Greiwe she “was one of the few people in the world who was always fiercely loyal to [Kobe] and to his vision, and that's why he trusted her,” adding that he believes the released texts were taken out of context. But they had each other's backs, and there's no question he trusted Molly to run his empire.” (A spokesperson for Vanessa disputes this characterization, insisting that “it is absolutely not true” that Bryant and Carter were friends). Adds a veteran sportswriter who covered Bryant: “I always heard that both in their marriage and outside of it he played the good cop and [Vanessa] was the bad cop. Multiple sources say she wants to turn it into an epic romance, with herself as the central love figure. “Vanessa knows how she wants it set up,” says one of those sources. In all fairness, it's not an entirely uncompelling narrative. Kobe and Vanessa met on the set of a 1999 rap video. Throughout the next 20 years, she sat beside him through triumphs and turbulence: his early rivalry with Shaquille O'Neal; the 2003 sexual assault case involving a 19-year-old hotel worker (charges were dropped when the accuser declined to testify, and Bryant later settled a civil suit); his estrangement from his parents, whom he sued in 2013 for auctioning memorabilia without permission (reports have suggested that Bryant's decision to marry Vanessa contributed to tensions with his family). Still, editing those thousands of hours of priceless footage into a romantic idyll is probably not the movie Bryant imagined making — and it's certainly not the movie Hollywood wants to make. What's more, Vanessa's influence is not limited to the 20th Season footage. One high-profile example: a doc being developed by Thunder Road Films' Basil Iwanyk and Select Films' Mark Ciardi, which draws heavily on taped interviews Bryant recorded at 17. When an early version of that film was shopped to buyers last year, interest was strong — until WME, which represents the Bryant estate, privately warned that purchasing it could jeopardize any future chance at accessing the 20th Season material. This sort of strong-arming — or, from Vanessa's point of view, safeguarding — clearly hasn't gone over well in Hollywood, where Vanessa has been climbing higher and higher on many filmmakers' life-is-too-short list. “Why is it that so many people are terrified to talk? I think it's clear that her actions have spelled the destruction of Kobe's legacy and his vision, at least the one he articulated to me,” says Greiwe. “All the things that he had planned for are gone.” A spokesman for the estate says that “Craig Greiwe has never met [Vanessa] Bryant and is making unfounded statements,” adding that Greiwe has previously made “disparaging remarks about Kobe and Vanessa.” The spokesman insists that whatever documentary is ultimately released will be “in line with Kobe's wishes and intent.” Of course, as executor of the estate, Vanessa Bryant — who declined to be interviewed for this story — is fully empowered to determine what, if any, documentary moves forward — and nobody could blame her if she ended up spiking the entire project. In 2020, Granity Studios shut down, abruptly halting nearly every creative project in development, (although, according to Vanessa's spokesperson, she kept as many staff members on the payroll as possible during COVID and fulfilled “Kobe's projects”). Those offices have since been taken over by a real estate brokerage firm. Former staffers — a publishing department, the development team and young employees who believed they were helping Bryant build something lasting — have scattered across the entertainment industry or left it entirely. “Kobe knew he had influence, but what he really wanted was to help kids who felt alone and offer them a path,” says McCollum. What is clear is that the raw material capturing one of the most enigmatic, driven and influential athletes of modern times possibly sits on a hard drive somewhere, or maybe in the cloud, waiting — perhaps indefinitely — to be unlocked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Amanda Seyfried, Laura Dern and Renate Reinsve joined in with intimate tales of getting drunk with a co-star and letting out a primal screen on camera. This year's Oscar frontrunners have more in common than usual. Start with their films, of course, where overlapping themes abound. The darker sides of motherhood, and the way grief seeps in, are front and center for Jennifer Lawrence‘s Die My Love, Jessie Buckley‘s Hamnet and even Amanda Seyfried‘s The Testament of Ann Lee — which trades more specifically in the grief of not being a mother. There are bad dads of every variety: Renate Reinsve‘s Sentimental Value (distant, narcissistic); Lawrence's Die My Love again (apathetic, bumbling); Cynthia Erivo‘s Wicked: For Good (megalomaniac). And though Laura Dern was on hand to discuss Is This Thing On?, it's worth mentioning that she also stars in Jay Kelly, the final boss of complicated fatherhood. Japan's Toho Moves to Capitalize on Europe's Anime Boom Colombia Boosts 2026 Tax Credit Allocation for Foreign Productions to Record $90 Million The actress' performances, though varied in breadth and scale, are all deeply personal to the women who embody these roles. Lawrence and Buckley found themselves unlocking a new connection to their own matrescence. Erivo's time as Elphaba mirrored her own journey to superstardom. Reinsve and Dern both reunited with dear friends (directors Joachim Trier and Bradley Cooper, respectively) behind the camera. And Seyfried worked through newfound levels of discomfort for Ann Lee‘s absurd (a compliment!) All six women gathered on a rainy Los Angeles afternoon to discuss their experiences onscreen — as it turns out, it's normal to feel embarrassed! — and in navigating the months-long road show that is compulsory to releasing a film these days. “I really appreciate when other actors do it, and I watch these interviews all the time because I'm so curious about other people's processes,” says Reinsve. “But doing it myself, it's weird and the opposite of what I do on set.” What is a favorite, or most rewarding, way that you have gotten to know a recent co-star? Jessie, I believe you have a great story about going out with Paul Mescal before Hamnet. JESSIE BUCKLEY I told you that in absolute secrecy. They play ABBA and all the old hits. We got really drunk and went out dancing, which is a good thing to do with Paul Mescal when you're getting to know him. JENNIFER LAWRENCE [Die My Love director] Lynne Ramsay had me and Rob Pattinson do interpretative dance lessons before we started filming. And then our first day on set was a naked scene where we were attacking each other like tigers. LAURA DERN Bradley Cooper and I are old friends, and so are Bradley and Will Arnett, so we just dove into a workshop. It's about a marriage, and in the first scene it's falling apart, so you have to come in feeling like you know everything. You're all in various stages of your careers, and I'm curious at what point you started to feel full autonomy and control over your circumstances in this business? ERIVO I feel as though we all have that at the beginning, but we just didn't know it. We relinquish the power to everybody else, and we're pressured into doing some things that we don't need or want to do — but from the beginning, our yeses and our nos are our own. I don't think the choice to do what I wanted was ever not there — it's just louder now. RENATE REINSVE I think the signals you get from inside yourself about what is right are really small in the beginning and get stronger and stronger the more you get scolded by experiences. These past few years, I finally feel like I'm on the right path, but it's taken a long time. Renate, you were offered a lot of romantic comedies after the success of The Worst Person in the World, but did you feel they weren't right for you? So instead I did A Different Man, which was more like a Charlie Kaufman world. It was the opposite of Worst Person. You feel like, “Oh, OK, I know my place in this world.” And that takes me back to the question of autonomy. It's complicated because you want to involve the other person, for people to be your true teammate and partners. Laura, your movie Is This Thing On? Is it easy for you all to find movies that are about women as opposed to a movie that just has women in it? LAWRENCE Do you care if it passes the Bechdel Test? Is there any sort of formula to finding, and then keeping, those long-standing director-actor collaborations? REINSVE Joachim Trier and I mutually felt on the set on Worst Person in the World that we had more things we wanted to explore together. We didn't really say it because it's up to him [whether we keep working together]. In Norway, it's really the director's vision and not so much an actor. It's almost the opposite, where if you're too famous or you become a star, it can get in the way of things. So Joachim and his co-writer Eskil Vogt had to decide if they wanted to work with me again. And then they did write that character [in Sentimental Value] for me. BUCKLEY Did your relationship change the second time around? REINSVE Yes, because Nora is really angry. I talked to him in a different tone. Growing as an artistic couple, the things you create grow, it seems like the best of both worlds. They say don't mix business with pleasure, don't mix business with relationships and love, but I don't agree with that because you're going to make something deeper and be fulfilled by it. Unless of course, somebody does something fucked up and you're not friends anymore. DERN Cynthia, I'm curious how the experience was in making the second iteration of this film. LAWRENCE So some days you're shooting for number two and some days you're shooting for one? ERIVO Sometimes all in the same day. When we shot the song “For Good,” we were meant to be shooting something for film one, but it was supposed to be outside, and it was raining. There's something lovely about being able to just let it be. LAWRENCE Well, at least you're green no matter what. [On X-Men,] we could never do that because sometimes I'd be blue, sometimes I'd be blond. They'd say, “We're going to try to shoot something else,” and it's like, “OK, just give me eight hours.” Since there's probably no world in which you could say, “I'm just not ready for that scene yet.” LAWRENCE I worked with one actor who did that. We didn't shoot the scene that day. Amanda, with all of the choreography and singing you did on The Testament of Ann Lee, did you always feel ready? SEYFRIED We did get this luxurious preparation period that you don't get for other genres. And thank God because my brain is not clicked into the movement. I am always very uncomfortable dancing. ERIVO I would never have known that you were uncomfortable. REINSVE Were you uncomfortable in that too? And it's internal because no one's got time for that [on set]. Jennifer, it seems as though there's a fair amount of improv involved in Die My Love, especially during the moments when your character is breaking down or acting out. I scratched at the wall and then in post, they peeled off the wallpaper for me. Once it got going, it was like I was living an intrusive thought out loud. How often do you want to take a shampoo bottle and just (mimes squeezing it out) and smash things? Do you ever feel like, in promoting this film, you have to be the poster child of the postpartum experience? LAWRENCE Not to sound stupid, but it is a privilege to talk about something that, 10 years ago, we weren't talking about. I had really bad postpartum with my second — whom I was actually pregnant with while we were making this [movie] — so I had to watch cuts of it while I was suffering from postpartum. More than any other movie I've made, it's very ripe for projection about your own relationships and family. But I've talked about postpartum a lot in the last six weeks, for sure. Does the subject matter of a film, and more specifically the subject matter that you'll be required to discuss ad nauseam during the press tour, ever influence your decision to take a role? REINSVE It's funny, I struggle with the period where you're like, “Oh, I have to articulate what I did a year ago.” You never think that you're going to be an advocate for anything when you're making the movie, and then you end up in conversations with people having similar experiences [to the movie]. BUCKLEY I find it can narrow the experience. Everybody can have a completely personal, unique relationship to whatever you've made. Sometimes I wish we didn't have to talk about it at all and could just put it out there and let it be. LAWRENCE We have to turn into a salesman. DERN Often people turn to the actors when the director doesn't want to tell you what his or her movie's about. And he was like, “You don't ever have to tell them anything about what we're making. You could just say that we had fun.” I was like, “Oh.” And, by the way, and then I betrayed that because I'm still trying to explain what our movie was about. LAWRENCE I really love that moment when he brought a cow. DERN Yes, for the first Oscar campaign. He did find it kind of insane what has happened with the promotion of movies. BUCKLEY I never want to project any idea of what the women I play are meant to be, I just want to go down the river with them and let them have their own voice with it. In the scene when Hamnet dies, you have this incredibly visceral scream-cry. How did you get yourself there that day? BUCKLEY Well, it wasn't in the script, that moment. I guess my job in exploring grief was to try and touch the edges of that in as honest a way possible. The little boy who plays Hamnet, Jacobi Jupe, is so extraordinary. We shot that setup maybe three times, and the scream came out on the third time. I'd created a really strong bond with this little boy, and it felt like that scream was ancient. It just came through, I have no idea how. How do you come out of something like that? BUCKLEY I have a pretty simple life outside of my work, and coming back to something grounded is really important to me. DERN As actors, we give ourselves permission to feel all the things because they're true, and then in life, culture teaches us not to have those feelings. Earlier, Amanda pointed out that no one here is an expert in whatever topic their movie is about — but what are you experts in? BUCKLEY It was small, yellow and flaccid. LAWRENCE If she says “flaccid” one more time, I'm leaving. ERIVO I feel like it's obvious, but music really is my second language. SEYFRIED You are an expert at finding notes and making them fucking throttle your soul. You are an expert at moving metaphorical mountains in people's bodies. I don't know how else to articulate it. I'd like to end by asking if any of you have a memory of what you bought yourself with your first Hollywood paycheck. BUCKLEY I think it was rent as well. SEYFRIED My favorite Louis Vuitton bag that I spent too much money on during an early movie was also stolen. And then the camera was stolen. I was so proud that I got to buy this for myself, so I put the tripod in the corner of my bedroom and used it as a coatrack for two years because I wanted it to matter. I had been studying photography, and I just sort of let go of the passion. DERN I think it's time to get myself a camera, guys.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, Cher, Fela Kuti, Paul Simon and Whitney Houston are the lifetime achievement recipients; Bernie Taupin, Eddie Palmieri and Sylvia Rhone are the Trustees Award honorees; and John Chowning is the Technical Grammy Award honoree. “It's a true honor to recognize this year's Special Merit Award recipients — an extraordinary group whose influence spans generations, genres and the very foundation of modern music,” Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, said in a statement. “Each of these honorees has made a profound and lasting impact, and we look forward to celebrating their remarkable achievements.” Palmieri, a Latin music legend, will be honored less than six months after he died at age 88. Simon joins the short list of people who have been honored both solo and in groups or duos. Houston receives the honor seven years after her cousin Dionne Warwick was honored. Incredibly, Taupin has yet to win a competitive Grammy. Lifetime Achievement Awards are presented to performers who have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording. Both are voted on by the academy's national trustees. Technical Grammy Awards are presented to individuals, companies, organizations or institutions who have made contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field. They are voted on by the Producers & Engineers Wing Advisory Council and chapter committees and ratified by the academy's national trustees. Cher will receive her lifetime achievement award 60 years after receiving her first Grammy nomination – best new artist as one-half of Sonny & Cher. Cher is an Oscar, Grammy, Primetime Emmy, and Golden Globe winner whose influence has shaped pop culture and fashion worldwide. Rising to fame with the Billboard Hot 100-topping hit “I Got You Babe,” she went on to land such solo hits as “Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves,” “Half-Breed,” “Dark Lady” and “If I Could Turn Back Time,” before taking on dance-pop with the Grammy-winning “Believe” (which was nominated for record of the year). As an actress, Cher earned acclaim in films such as Silkwood, Mask and Moonstruck, the latter bringing her an Oscar for best actress. Her world tours and Las Vegas residency have drawn millions of fans. She may be the youngest and hippest 79-year-old on planet Earth. Houston, who died in 2012 at age 48, earned worldwide renown as “The Voice.” Born into a dynasty of legendary singers, she rose from performing in New York clubs to signing with Clive Davis' Arista Records in 1983. Houston made history by stringing together seven consecutive No. A six-time Grammy winner, Houston was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2020. For nearly six decades, Carlos Santana, 78, has been a pioneering force in music, fusing Afro-Latin, blues, rock, and jazz into a sound that transcends genre, culture and generation. He and his band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. They made Grammy history in 2000, receiving eight Grammys in a single night, tying Michael Jackson for the single-year Grammy record. Their haul included album of the year for Supernatural and record of the year for “Smooth,” a propulsive smash featuring Rob Thomas. A 10-time Grammy and three-time Latin Grammy winner, Carlos Santana received Billboard‘s Century Award in 1996 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013. His Las Vegas residency at House of Blues is now in its 14th year. Khan is a 10-time Grammy winner, a 2023 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee and a creative innovator whose influence reaches across genres – pop, R&B, jazz, rock, country, gospel, dance, classical, indie, and beyond. Her biggest solo hit, a cover of Prince's “I Feel for You,” featured a rap by Grandmaster Melle Mel and a harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder, bridging generations of R&B artist and sensibilities. She remains a living force in music – an artist whose work and life continue to inspire, elevate and redefine what is possible. Simon, 84, has shaped the sound of contemporary music for 60 years. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982 and received that organization's top honor, the Johnny Mercer Award, in 1998. In 2023, Simon released Seven Psalms, receiving his 36th Grammy nomination (best folk album) and inspiring the documentary In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon. Fela Kuti, who died in 1997 at age 58, was a Nigerian musician, producer, arranger, political radical, outlaw, and the father of Afrobeats. A titanic sociopolitical voice, Afrobeat's revolutionary politics brought Fela into violent conflict with successive Nigerian military regimes. Fela's influence and music catalog have been widely celebrated and explored, including the podcast series Fela Kuti: Fear No Man and the Broadway musical Fela!, which received 11 Tony nominations in 2010, winning three awards. Incredibly, Taupin, 75, has yet to win a competitive Grammy. Best known for his legendary partnership with Elton John, Taupin helped create one of the best-selling singles of all time, “Candle in the Wind 1997.” His achievements have earned him the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, a dozen Ivor Novello Awards, an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2023, and a Commander of the British Empire honor. He and John were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992 and received that organization's top honor, the Johnny Mercer Award, in 2013. Palmieri, who died on Aug. 6 at age 88, was a visionary pianist, composer, arranger and bandleader who took Afro-Caribbean music to new horizons for more than seven decades. In 1961, he founded La Perfecta, replacing trumpets with trombones to forge a bold new sound that helped define modern salsa. He eventually received eight Grammy Awards and two Latin Grammys and was honored with the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the NEA Jazz Master distinction and induction into Lincoln Center's Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame. Rhone, 73, is a pioneering music executive whose five-decade career reshaped the recording industry and forged historic pathways for women and people of color. Rising from Harlem, she became the first woman to serve as CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company and went on to hold top executive roles across all three major music groups. She served in top posts at Atlantic, Elektra, Motown, and Epic, where she was named chairwoman and CEO in 2019. Rhone expanded the labels' global reach, overseeing career-defining releases across genres — from Travis Scott, Future, En Vogue, Metallica, Björk, and Tracy Chapman to Zara Larsson and Tyla — while playing a vital role in shaping the rise of hip-hop and championing female trailblazers including MC Lyte and Missy Elliott to Nicki Minaj. Chowning, 91, is a composer and computer-music innovator whose discovery of frequency modulation (FM) synthesis in 1967 revolutionized electronic sound. After studying with Nadia Boulanger and earning his doctorate at Stanford, he launched the university's early computer-music program and developed the first digital algorithm for surround-sound localization. Stanford's licensing of his FM patent to Yamaha led to the most successful synthesis engine in the history of electronic instruments. A co-founder of Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics in 1974, Chowning helped establish one of the world's leading hubs for computer-music research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grande previewed her "SNL" gig this weekend, including meeting Cher, and revealed what kind of present wrapper she is on Thursday night's (Dec. 18) "Late Night." She's, you know, kind of busy still promoting Wicked: For Good and her return to Saturday Night Live this weekend for the fifth time with musical guest Cher. But she did take time out on Thursday night (Dec. 18) to chat with Seth Meyers for the first time on Late Night, where she explained what kind of Christmas person she is while also revealing the one Wicked tie-in item that kind of gives her the willies. Alex Warren Wins Breakthrough of the Year at Inaugural TikTok Awards: Full Winners List 'The Voice' Singer Kata Hay Arrested for Vehicular Homicide Mrs. GREEN APPLE Look Back on Year Filled With Love and Gratitude Meyers, who thanked Grande for showing up in exactly the kind of outfit he'd expect from good witch Glinda, a long, gauzy princess dress fit for a ball, wondered if she had magical wrapping skills as well. “I think it looks… well-intentioned,” Grande admitted of her gift wrapping skills. And I do feel guilty about the amount of tape used. “My mission this year is to come up with a plant-based Zeppole. She would not like that, maybe I won't actually.” “First of all, my mom has everything,” Grande said. “Yeah, I think it's fair to say that's disturbing,” Meyers assured Grande. “That was when I knew, ‘Oh, this is big! Grande also revealed that she had just been introduced to this weekend's musical guest on SNL, Cher, who she had not met until they filmed the promos for the show earlier this week. “I mean, she's just the one and only. And she's just brilliant and I'm so excited,” Grande said of the music icon who will be marking her return to the sketch show for the first time in nearly 40 years this weekend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to The Late Show, Donald Trump won't be content until he completely ruins Christmas. Last night, Stephen Colbert aired an animated clip titled “Colbert's Canceled Christmas: The Last Noel,” taking aim at Trump's desire to ruin everything good. The video, narrated by Nick Offerman, centers on “King Jag Bag” (a.k.a. Trump) as he cancels Christmas, sends ICE to the North Pole, destroys Santa's workshop to build a new ballroom, and forces Santa into Alligator Elfcatraz. “No inch of that fellow was nice, kind, or thankful,” Offerman narrates. Santa and his elves find themselves locked up alongside the Sesame Street characters in a cell previously inhabited by “Donald Trump's best and only friend Jeffrey Elfstein.” There, they discover the “Elfstein list,” which Santa uses to try to take the president down. When he fails, a group of popular children's characters appear, call him a loser, and give Santa the power to boot Trump back to the White House. In July, after the network announced the late-night show would come to an end in May 2026, Colbert noted, “But they made one mistake. Melissa Hortman Died in a Shocking Act of Political Violence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Mills' legendary Live at Liquid Room mix, recorded during his 1995 DJ set at Tokyo's Liquidroom nightclub, has come to streaming for the first time. The mix is available to stream exclusively via Apple Music. Listen to it below. The 66-minute, 36-song Live at Liquid Room was condensed down from Mills's original three-hour set, and spans 17 of his own tracks—including an early version of what would become his calling-card single, “The Bells”—alongside contemporaries like Richie Hawtin, Robert Armani, and Joey Beltram. The mix was originally available in CD and cassette formats as the second entry in Sony Japan's short-lived Mix-Up series, but has never seen a widespread digital release.
