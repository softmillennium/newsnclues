            Some of the best suits in Hollywood have come out of the same modest street in London. Since the 19th century, Savile Row has been a mecca for bespoke men's suiting, and tailors in the area have created pieces for superstar actors such as Charlie Chaplin, Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck and Daniel Craig. But there's always room for more innovation.
    


            Just round the bend, one of Savile Row's youngest tailoring houses, HAX, is redefining the experience of getting a handmade suit — particularly for women. The operation is helmed by 27-year-old Hattie Glendenning, who worked at Savile Row on the weekends as a teenager, and who has now dressed celebrities from Sophie Turner to Lady Amelia Windsor in HAX pieces. “For a long time it felt like the tailoring world was quite stuffy,” Glendenning said in a recent interview. “It was really inaccessible. There wasn't much for women and the price points were so high.” Glendenning has made a name for herself by offering her female clients a service in an industry that is largely male dominated — both in terms of tailors and customers. “It's really important to sit down with someone, to make them feel relaxed,” she said. “It's quite a personal process.”
    


            Each HAX suit starts with a consultation. Glendenning takes measurements, and starts discussions on color, silhouette and fabric. “Do you want it to be slinky or do you want it to feel rigid?” she asks. “This is like a piece of armour we're creating.” Most of her fabrics come from the British cloth merchant Dugdale, which reworks archival fabrics from the mid-19th century, and operates in Huddersfield, in the North of England. “We would be nowhere without the cloth we use,” she said. “It plays the biggest role in the finished piece.” Whether customers are looking for an oversized, broad-shouldered power suit or something more quietly commanding, like a cinched bar jacket, nothing is out of bounds. “The options are endless, and the creativity can roam free,” she said. For one of her clients, Glendenning made a Austin Powers-style ‘70s-inspired gingham flared suit. “I don't think I've ever made the same suit twice,” she said.
    


            The spectrum of who she sees in her shop, she says, is wide, ranging from 18 year olds looking for their first ever suit in preparation for their first job, to those shopping for their wedding outfit, as well as older clients with a penchant for the tradition of made-to-measure. While her unique business has appealed to women, men shop there too. “It's so special,” she said, especially dressing bride-grooms for their nuptials. “You go through this wedding process with someone, and you have to very sadly wave goodbye at the end of it when they take that lovely suit,” said Glendenning. But sometimes, “those people walk back through the door for another occasion.”
    


            Created in the 1730s as an extension of the Burlington Estate, Savile Row began as a stylish though largely residential street, home to many wealthy military officers and statesmen. The need for precise tailoring drew experts from the North of England into the area, who set up shop to meet demand. Ironically, despite serving mainly men, the road was originally named after the 3rd Earl of Burlington's wife, Lady Dorothy Savile. One of the first shops to blend Savile Row tailoring with couture for women was Hardy Amies, which opened in 1945 and became Queen Elizabeth II's official dressmaker. But Savile Row didn't get its first female-owned tailor until 2016 when Kathryn Sargent founded her namesake store.
    


Would you dunk your wedding dress in dye?



            Today, Glendenning believes made-to-measure for women is essential. “If you look further back, women always used to have their clothes made,” she said. But modern shopping habits and off-the-rack fashion has meant most women buy something readymade and if necessary alter the garment to fit.
    


            Bespoke, she thinks, “is a confidence booster.” From perfectly fit trousers to jackets tailored to busts, “I feel my female clients when they come in,” she said. “It's like a sigh of relief.”

            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            The latest jobs report had its share of shutdown-related quirks, but a familiar theme cut through the noise: The US labor market is stuck in a rut.
    


            Employers are still hiring, but job growth is at one of its weakest paces in the past two decades.
    


            The “low-hire, low-fire” dynamics persisted in November, with an unemployment rate driven higher partly by more people looking for work but not finding it. Long-term unemployment increased, discouraged workers were on the rise, and economic disparities deepened.
    


            “Hiring, while certainly not on a freeze, is on hold; and people that have jobs are absolutely holding on to them with white knuckles,” Dan North, Allianz Trade's senior economist for North America, told CNN this week. “I see that as definitely a labor market that's stagnating.”
    


            So where does it go from here? Some economists say this low-gear state can continue for quite some time. But others note that it's only a matter of time before the labor market sees a major shift — and there are several ways that could happen. 



Unemployment rate hit a four-year high last month



            Although the labor market has cooled, the overall economy is still growing at a decent clip and productivity hasn't slipped.
    


            The US economy's job gains have averaged 55,000 a month, which may be reflective of the “pervasive uncertainty” caused by stark changes in US trade and immigration policy. But the American population is also going through its own transformation, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.
    


            The supply of labor is shrinking as the Baby Boomer generation ages out of the workforce and additional constraints are placed on immigration, he noted.
    


            And there's been a shift in the “breakeven rate” of employment. Put simply, the economy doesn't need to create as many jobs as it once did in order to sustain itself.
    


The No. 1 cause of America's affordability problem just got worse



            “My estimate is that we need to hire 50,000 a month to keep the labor market conditions stable,” Brusuelas told CNN. The economy will “grow at around 2%, financial conditions will be OK, and we'll probably ease off a little bit on the inflation side.”
    


            From an economics or capital markets perspective, that's a perfectly reasonable outcome and one that “could go on for years,” he said.
    


            However, “the K-shaped economy means that the disproportion of the benefits accrued from prosperity will not be distributed equally,” he added, meaning wealthier households will do better than poorer households as hiring slows.
    


            A big wild card right now is AI and how much it could reshape employment. In the near term, questions about the technology will continue to make businesses cautious about hiring, Pantheon Macroeconomics economists wrote in a note this week.
    


            “The longer-term implications for labor displacement and wage dynamics, however, remain an open question,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in a note Tuesday.
    


America's job market is turning into an exclusive airport lounge



            AI — alongside immigration enforcement and broader policy uncertainty — remains a headwind to labor market growth, said Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at St. Thomas University in St. Paul, Minnesota.
    


            “The question I ask myself is, ‘﻿What would be the conditions in which I think the labor market would ramp back up?' and some of those are policy-related,” he said. “I have a hard time seeing those resolving themselves anytime soon.”
    


            “For better or worse, I think we could be in this K-shaped economy for some time,” he added. “And I think the way out of it probably is that there's a recession before things get better, which is never what you want to hear if you're on the lower leg of the K.”
    


            The labor market could see hiring reaccelerate, said Cory Stahle, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab.
    


            It just may take a bit to take hold.
    


            “The US labor market is like a pretty big ship turned by a rudder,” he said. “Sometimes it takes a little time to turn around.”
    


            One force could be the recent interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, he said, noting that it typically takes about three to five quarters for monetary policy changes to work their way through the economy.
    


The surprising truth about AI's impact on jobs



            Another could be policy changes or anything else that eases Americans' uncertainty, which has drastically stifled hiring this year. Also at play are the impacts of the tax law set to take effect in 2026, RSM's Brusuelas said.
    


            “There's uncertainty around what rates are going to do, uncertainty around prices, uncertainty around general policy,” Stahle said. “Unless that fog of uncertainty is broken, we'll continue to see companies stumbling a little bit through that fog.”

            The paintings of contemporary visual artist Julie Mehretu hang in some of the world's most prestigious art institutions. Renowned for her large-scale abstract and multilayered landscape pieces that explore the themes of history and globalism, Mehretu has earned international acclaim.
    


            Yet, the Ethiopian-born, US-based artist is quick to acknowledge those who paved the way for her success. “We're here standing on the shoulders of giants, as we always are, and hopefully we can also create more of that space for so many others that deserve to be a part of it,” she told CNN's Larry Madowo during a visit to Nairobi.
    


            Creating space for others is exactly what Mehretu is doing. Right now, she and her team at the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), a pan-African artists network, are concluding a series of workshops held across Africa. “We're doing these workshops throughout the continent in five different cities, working on media arts, media and film and trying to really kind of interrogate that space in the kind of deeply mediated world we live in now,” she explained.
    

World-renowned contemporary visual artist Julie Mehretu is known for her large-scale abstract works exploring themes of history and globalism. In an interview with CNN's Larry Madowo in Nairobi, Kenya, Mehretu discusses her mission to help African creatives thrive.


How Ethiopian-born abstract artist Julie Mehretu is helping African artists



            The goal, she added, is “to be able to create a kind of cross-disciplinary, intergenerational conversation between countries and between artist spaces, so we can … not just amplify our voices, but also invent new forms that are just as rigorous and challenging.”
    


            The idea for the workshops originated from a project with BMW in 2018, when the carmaker selected Mehretu to create its 20th Art Car. Since 1975, the initiative has allowed famed international artists to transform BMW cars into “rolling sculptures,” giving them complete creative freedom.
    


            In participating, Mehretu joined the ranks of artists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. As with her other projects, Mehretu wanted this one to stand out, so she proposed an idea that would connect with her home continent. “One of the proposals I said to BMW was what if … we went from Cairo to Cape Town on this old idea of this Pan-African highway, and through that use the car as the common link between these places to then work with filmmakers in each country, to use the road and the car as the protagonists, and then be able to really have Africans tell their own stories?” she said.
    


            With this vision and BMW's financial support, Mehretu and her AFMAC co-founder, filmmaker Mehret Mandefro, partnered with local cultural institutions across Africa to conduct workshops aimed at “connecting and strengthening the artistic community within Africa.” The first stop was Lagos, Nigeria, in April 2025. The team then traveled to Tangier, Morocco; Nairobi, Kenya; and Dakar, Senegal, and will arrive in Cape Town, South Africa, next month.
    


            Each workshop will produce a new film, and at the end of the series, the films will be compiled to showcase contemporary African filmmaking. The compilation will debut alongside the BMW Art Car exhibition at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town next year.
    


            “The African continent is this place that has always drawn me back,” Mehretu said. “It's a place that I was born in. I've lived in Zimbabwe and Senegal, and I've traveled extensively throughout the continent. And so there's this immense possibility of what can happen but also what can happen with the pan-African kind of possibility, especially in the creative space.”
    


            As Mehretu wraps up the workshops, she is preparing to unveil another major project, one unlike anything she's done before. In 2024, the Obama Foundation announced that Mehretu had been selected to create a unique artwork for the presidential library in Chicago. Mehretu described the project as “exciting,” but also “unique” in its challenges.
    


            “I've never worked with glass before. The proposal was to make an artwork in this enormous glass window that goes up 34 stories of the building along the escalator,” she said. But with hard work, ingenuity, and perseverance, Mehretu and her team succeeded. When former President Barack Obama asks you to do something, “you say yes and you say, ‘OK, how fast?'” she jokes. The public will be able to see the work next spring.
    


            Mehretu's work is in prominent museums such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) in Washington, DC, the Met in New York, and the British Museum in London. But when asked about her legacy, Mehretu brings the focus back to working with others.
    


            She said she wants to be able to “participate in a bigger collective of many makers, painters, and creative artists, sculptors, video artists, media artists, filmmakers (and) musicians.” Mehretu added, “There's this other form of cultural reverberation; there is a collective we are all a part of, and hopefully that creates space for more of that possibility. And I'm excited for what the future holds.”

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has criticized the EU's decision to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion interest-free loan, warning that the move brings the bloc “closer to war.” He argued, however, that an alternative plan to seize Russian frozen assets would have been even worse.

Speaking early Friday after EU leaders agreed on the joint borrowing scheme, Orban described it as a fundamentally flawed decision that will burden European taxpayers without delivering realistic returns.

“It is a bad decision, which brings Europe closer to the war,” Orban said, as cited by Euronews. “It looks like a loan, but of course, the Ukrainians will never be able to pay it back. So it is basically losing money. And those who are behind that loan will take the responsibility and the financial consequences of that.”

Under the agreement, the EU will raise funds on capital markets to provide €90 billion in support for Ukraine in 2026-27. The compromise came after days of tense negotiations and the collapse of a more controversial proposal to use frozen Russian assets.

Hungary, along with Slovakia and the Czech Republic, secured opt-outs from the joint borrowing arrangement and will not take part in providing guarantees for the loan. Orban said Budapest agreed to lift its veto only after obtaining assurances that Hungary would not be involved financially.

“The loan required a unanimous decision, and finally we gave up the right to veto, and in exchange we got the opt-out,” Orban said, confirming that Hungary would not take part in the compromise scheme.

Despite his opposition to the final decision, the prime minister said the proposal to use frozen Russian assets to fund a ‘reparations loan' would have been far more dangerous.

“A reparations loan would mean a war immediately,” he warned. “Think about it: there are two parties warring against each other. You are a third one who goes there, taking away a huge amount of money from one and giving it to its enemy. What does it mean? It's war.”

The Hungarian leader has repeatedly accused Brussels of escalating the Ukraine conflict through financial and military support, while arguing that the EU should prioritize diplomacy and deescalation. Moscow has likewise condemned Western financial and military backing for Kiev, warning of legal and economic consequences.

US President Donald Trump has signed the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law, approving a record $901 billion in military spending while allocating $800 million in funding for Kiev over the next two years.

The bill, which sets Pentagon priorities for fiscal year 2026, authorizes roughly $8 billion more than the administration originally requested and marks the largest defense budget in US history. It includes funding for weapons procurement, troop pay, and major defense initiatives championed by Trump.

The Ukraine funding – $400 million per year under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative – amounts to a fraction of the overall package, representing less than 0.09% of total defense spending. Unlike direct transfers from existing US stockpiles, USAI funds are used to pay American defense companies to manufacture and procure new weapons and military equipment for Kiev.

The allocation comes amid renewed scrutiny of Kiev following a major corruption scandal that has shaken the country's leadership. Prosecutors recently uncovered a $100 million kickback scheme in Ukraine's energy sector, which relies heavily on Western financial support. The investigation reportedly implicated close associates of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, prompting the resignation of senior officials and fueling criticism in Washington over continued aid.

In addition to Ukraine aid, the law authorizes a nearly 4% pay raise for US service members, funds new ships, aircraft, and missile systems, and places new restrictions on certain US investments linked to China. It also backs Trump's push to reshape the Pentagon, codifying elements of his executive orders aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and funding the proposed Golden Dome missile-defense system.

The bill contains provisions related to Europe beyond Ukraine, including support for the Baltic Security Initiative and limits on the Pentagon's ability to significantly reduce US troop levels on the continent. These measures were included despite Trump's repeated criticism of European NATO members for relying too heavily on Washington.

The legislation also reflects growing congressional scrutiny of recent US military operations in the Caribbean. One clause withholds part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget until lawmakers receive unedited footage and orders related to strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels.

Trump has repeatedly argued that Washington should no longer pour vast sums of taxpayer money into Ukraine, insisting that his administration is instead pushing for a negotiated settlement with Russia. Moscow has condemned continued Western military support for Kiev, calling it one of the root causes of the conflict and a barrier to a ceasefire.

Eleven Nigerian soldiers who were detained in Burkina Faso for ten days have been released following diplomatic efforts between the two West African countries, Nigeria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Wednesday. 

The personnel were taken into custody on December 8 after a Nigerian military C-130 aircraft made an emergency landing in the southwestern city of Bobo-Dioulasso, about 910km from Benin's economic capital, Cotonou. 

Burkina Faso authorities said an initial investigation showed the aircraft had not received clearance to fly over the country. 

The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) – a bloc formed in 2023 by Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger –  condemned the aircraft's entry as an “unfriendly act” and accused Nigeria of violating the sovereignty of its member states. 

The incident occurred one day after the Nigerian army conducted operations to help prevent a coup in neighboring Benin. 

The soldiers were released after Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar issued an official apology to Burkina Faso, expressing regret over what he described as irregularities in flight authorization procedures. 

“The soldiers have been released. I just confirmed with our Head of Mission in Burkina Faso,” Nigerian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Kimiebi Ebienfa said. 

Tuggar also condemned what he described as “unhealthy comments” made by a Nigerian political party leader who had publicly accused Burkina Faso of mistreating the detained soldiers. “We dismiss these remarks and we sincerely apologize to the government of Burkina Faso,” reiterates Minister Tuggar, as quoted by Burkina24.

Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger withdrew from the West African regional bloc ECOWAS after tensions sparked by military takeovers in the three former French colonies. The three countries accused ECOWAS of serving as a tool for foreign powers, particularly France, after the bloc threatened military intervention to restore constitutional order in Niger. 

The AES has also previously alleged that Benin and Nigeria serve as logistical bases for foreign-backed efforts to destabilize the Sahel, a region plagued by a decade-long jihadist insurgency.

UNITED NATIONS, December 19. /TASS/. Budapest is ready to host a meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Donald Trump of the United States ""at any point of time,"" as it is also ready to provide a venue for a Ukraine peace summit, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in an interview with TASS.

""We are absolutely ready. We are ready at any point of time. We have made this commitment again, both in Washington and in Moscow,"" Szijjarto said in response to a relevant question. ""We understand in both capitals, that if there is something which is not being under dilemma, is the venue of the peace summit, which is a great honor for us, obviously,"" he added.

Hungary has maintained a pro-peace position since the onset of the conflict, the top diplomat noted, despite what he called ""enormous political attacks"" against Budapest.

On October 16, after a telephone conversation with Putin, Trump announced that they had agreed to meet in Budapest soon. However, the summit was later postponed indefinitely because the two sides could not agree on how to achieve a meaningful result in settling the Ukrainian conflict. Both Moscow and Washington said the meeting would take place when the conditions were right.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 19. /TASS/. Kirill Dmitriev, Special representative of the Russian president for economic cooperation with foreign countries, Chief Executive Officer of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has said that abandoning the EU's illegal scheme to use Russian assets to finance Ukraine would be a major victory for law and common sense.

""If true, shelving the EU's originally proposed illegal scheme to tap Russian foreign reserves to fund Ukraine is a major win for law + common sense - and for the voices of reason in Europe that protected EU/euro/ Euroclear,"" he wrote on the X social network.

According to Dmitriev, it was a ""major blow to EU warmongers"" led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

EC chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier that participants of the European Union summit had been unable to agree on the expropriation of frozen Russian assets under the guise of a reparations loan to Kiev. Instead of this option, the EU decided to finance Ukraine for the next two years in the amount of 90 bln euros through a pan-European loan at 0%.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Man known as ‘John' expected to be eligible for $50,000 reward from FBI for providing details on the suspect

The authorities dealing with the mass shooting at Brown University hailed on Friday a member of the public who came forward with information that helped crack the case and lead to the suspect.

A man known publicly so far only as “John” posted key information on the Reddit platform about an encounter with the suspect that caught the attention of investigators, while Reddit users urged him to go to the police with his tips.

The man approached a police officer in Providence, the Rhode Island capital where the Ivy League school is based, and said “I think you are looking for me,” according to authorities.

He is now expected to be eligible for the $50,000 reward offered by the FBI for information leading to the suspect in the Brown tragedy.

John reported an unusual encounter at the university with the person who turned out to be the suspect and said he also saw him acting oddly in relation to a rented gray Nissan car with Florida license plates.

“He was, in fact, critical to this and certainly everyone in Providence owes this individual a debt of gratitude,” Brett Smiley, the mayor of Providence, said in an interview with CNN on Friday morning.

“He came in and was fully forthcoming , provided key details ... We had disparate pieces of information and we had strong suspicions that these pieces of information fit together but it hadn't been corroborated and he was able to do that for us, and so it was really a critical turning point,” Smiley said.

The mayor added that John probably had legitimate fear for his safety after an image of him on surveillance footage was released by the authorities but “this was an individual who stepped up and stepped forward for all the right reasons.”

Smiley said that the motive of the dead suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, was not yet known, over the shooting at Brown, where he was briefly a graduate student 25 years ago, and the killing on Thursday of a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Investigators believe Valente was also responsible for shooting dead the MIT professor Nuno FG Loureiro at his home in the Boston suburbs.

The tipster, John, was reportedly of no fixed abode and was staying in the basement of the engineering building at Brown where he first bumped into Valente in a bathroom before the mass shooting last Saturday evening, the New York Post reported.

Experts decry ‘neocolonialist' Guinea-Bissau study after Trump administration changed advice for US babies

The Trump administration has indicated that it will fund a $1.6m study on hepatitis B vaccination of newborns in the west African country of Guinea-Bissau, where nearly one in five adults live with the virus – a move that researchers call “highly unethical” and “extremely risky”.

The news follows an official change in recommendations on hepatitis B vaccines at birth from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which called the shots an “individual” decision, despite decades of safe and effective vaccination and no evidence of harm. It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world.

“He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. “He will do everything he can to try and prove that.”

The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.”

Testing established vaccines in a country with high rates of hepatitis B and a fragile health system “reeks of a neocolonialist attitude” and risks expanding global mistrust of the US and science, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute.

When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action.

The study made an alarming claim: the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine caused death in young girls in Guinea-Bissau. It was published by a group of Danish researchers, including a married couple named Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn.

But when Kennedy made his announcement in 2025, he did not mention a 2022 paper from some of the same authors on the same topic finding completely different results, essentially nullifying the first study.

“We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote.

It is one example of their questionable research, which has drawn criticism from other researchers and journalists examining their findings.

Now those same researchers will be the ones carrying out the new study on hepatitis B vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. US funding will go to the Bandim Health Project, led by Aaby and Stabell Benn, at the University of Southern Denmark.

Aaby and Stabell Benn did not respond to the Guardian's inquiries about the details of the five-year study, set to begin in early 2026.

Babies in the randomized, controlled trial will or will not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Researchers will then compare early-life mortality, illness and development between the groups, according to the award announcement from the CDC.

The World Health Organization recommends giving the vaccine to all babies at birth, but Guinea-Bissau has struggled to roll out the shots to every newborn, instead recommending the dose at six weeks of age. The country has pledged to fill that gap and plans on recommending hepatitis B vaccines to all newborns in 2027.

It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. “It's highly unethical to choose to give a vaccine to some children but not others,” Offit said.

Yamey noted: “There's already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?”

The study does not appear to be looking at whether the vaccine is more effective at birth, which Jacobs said was “concerning” as “nowhere in this do they say that they're going to study the efficacy of the vaccine itself.”

Instead, the trial will examine whether there are “overall health effects” – not specific outcomes, such as preventing infection from the virus – when the shot is given at birth, according to the Bandim Health Project.

“This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”.

“It is not clear what the research question is. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said.

He also questioned whether participants could truly give informed consent, given the ethical concerns about how the study is being conducted.

In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Among adults, about 5% have a chronic infection.

In a recent study of toddlers in Guinea-Bissau, about 11.2% already had hepatitis B infection, which means not enough babies are getting the shots, said Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added.

“The priority should be to increase vaccination with the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and protect more babies from the risk posed by this virus,” Pollard said.

In the US, recommending the vaccine at birth to all babies – not just those who appeared to be at risk of infection – caused rates among children to drop precipitously, from 20,000 to about 20 a year.

“We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week.

The experts voiced concerns about how the study would take place. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place in Guinea-Bissau instead of the United States or Denmark, they said.

“Why on Earth is this study happening in a high-endemic setting where the birth dose matters the most?” Yamey asked.

In Denmark, where only three in 1,000 people have the virus, the shot is not currently recommended at birth either, which means the same study could be conducted there. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said.

The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said.

“In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it's still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “It seems to say we don't value your lives enough to continue to provide support overall, but we won't hesitate to experiment with your population.”

The study is single-blinded, which means the patients will not know who got the vaccine and who didn't, but the research team will – which can affect the way they collect and interpret the data. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. And the endpoints – “overall health effects” – are “very squishy”, which leaves the results vulnerable to manipulation, Jacobs said.

Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote about red flags in Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.”

“I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said.

The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has also written about major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn.

After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they're now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.”

“Because Robert F Kennedy Jr is an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said.

Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.”

In the meantime, children will bear the brunt of these decisions, Offit continued: “This breaks my heart. It really does. It's hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm's way by the administration.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:taipeitimes.com","Five structural trends transforming the global economy","https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2025/12/20/2003849197","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Slowing growth, escalating trade wars, tightening cross-border capital flows and intensifying migration pressures have dominated news headlines — and for good reason. Together, these forces threaten to undermine multilateralism and accelerate the rise of blocs such as the BRICS+ group of major emerging economies, setting the stage for a profound reordering of the global economy.

However, five additional structural trends could prove equally, if not more, transformative.

The first is demographic change. While the world's population is projected to peak at about 10.3 billion by the mid-2080s, that headline figure obscures powerful underlying shifts. The global population is aging rapidly, and with the ratio of working-age individuals to retirees expected to fall from 9.4 in 1997 to just 3.9 by 2050, pension systems and public finances are set to come under growing strain.

Population trends differ dramatically across nations. India has overtaken China as the world's most populous country, while China's population — about 1.4 billion — is expected to drop below 750 million by 2100. Italy's population is projected to fall from 60 million to 27 million over the same period, while Japan's could plummet from 128 million to 53 million. Nigeria's population, by contrast, is set to triple to 791 million, making it the world's second-most populous country after India.

The economic and geopolitical consequences could be profound. Hundreds of millions of people across the developing world are expected to enter the workforce over the next quarter of a century, just as many advanced economies face long-term demographic decline. The widening gap would intensify labor and economic pressures, fueling migration at a time when global systems are already grappling with record levels of displacement.

These demographic shifts would also alter global consumption patterns, particularly when it comes to energy and foodstuffs. India might be more populous than China, but China's per capita income — about US$13,300, nearly five times that of India — suggests that population growth is shifting toward lower-income economies consuming lower-value goods.

The second structural trend is artificial intelligence (AI)-driven labor-market disruption. While the AI super-cycle promises to boost productivity and growth, it could also displace millions of workers, particularly those in routine jobs involving repetitive tasks. Although economists' projections vary, even conservative estimates point to the emergence of a jobless underclass, with serious social and macroeconomic consequences.

Moreover, if AI-driven growth disproportionately benefits capital over labor, inequality would increase and governments would come under pressure to intervene. Consequently, corporations — particularly the technology sector — could face higher tax burdens to fund welfare programs, including universal basic income.

The third structural trend involves natural-resource constraints, which threaten to slow economic growth and widen geopolitical rifts. Copper, for example, is already in structural deficit and the International Energy Agency warns of a 30 percent shortfall by 2035 without significant investment in new mining projects. Other critical inputs such as lithium, nickel and cobalt face similar supply pressures, raising the risk of severe shortages that could cripple battery manufacturing and derail the transition to clean energy.

Water scarcity is another major resource constraint. About 25 percent of global agriculture takes place in high-water-stress areas, leaving food systems vulnerable to shortages and price spikes, and because water is also essential for cooling data centers and semiconductor manufacturing, rapid AI adoption would further strain supplies.

Fourth, risk appetite in the US has risen sharply, fueling a new wave of speculative investment. In contrast to the EU, the US regulatory environment continues to encourage greater risk-taking among both retail and institutional investors. As a result, stock markets remain near historic highs, with the S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio at about 30x — far above the historical average. Investors are also pouring more money into private equity, private credit, venture capital, cryptocurrencies, meme coins and gold (which has climbed by more than 50 percent over the past year).

The surge in short-term speculation is unlikely to slow, as baby boomers are projected to pass an estimated US$100 trillion to younger generations by 2048. This massive intergenerational wealth transfer would inject more investment capital into financial markets, inflating asset prices, even as the sheer volume of savings puts downward pressure on real interest rates.

The influx of new capital carries significant risks. Leveraged bets are increasingly routed through the shadow-banking system, far from regulatory oversight, creating vulnerabilities that could spill over into the real economy. The migration of credit activity from traditional banks weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy. Even if the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, those cuts might never reach borrowers, limiting policymakers' ability to stimulate growth.

Lastly, heightened risk aversion in the UK and Europe is becoming a structural problem in its own right. For decades, Europe's growth prospects have been weighed down by bureaucratic hurdles, stringent regulatory requirements and fragmented capital markets. The numbers speak for themselves: Venture-capital investment in the US is typically 8 to 10 times higher than in the EU, and about 70 percent of eurozone households say they are unwilling to take financial risks, compared with fewer than 40 percent of US households.

London's stock market underscores the depth of this financial malaise. In the first half of this year, companies raised just ￡160 million (US$214 million) in London listings — a 30-year low — pushing the City out of the world's top 20 initial public offering markets. UK pension funds have also reduced their domestic equity allocation from 53 percent to 6 percent over the past 25 years, shrinking the pool of capital available to British companies.

This is not simply a financial problem, as Europe's diminishing economic role is eroding its long-term competitiveness. Without a dramatic shift, the continent risks missing the AI super-cycle and becoming a technology colony rather than a driver of innovation.

Each of these five structural trends could transform the global economy — redrawing trade routes, redirecting investment flows, altering the distribution and pricing of key foodstuffs and critical minerals, and forcing governments to rethink supply-chain management, capital allocation and cross-border investment. The best-prepared decisionmakers would be those who recognize the stakes early and adjust accordingly.

Mayor vows consequences

Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez said that there would be consequences for those who attended the final on Wednesday to “generate violence” after 59 people were injured, including seven police officers, in clashes between rival fans. Violence broke out after Atletico Nacional defeated Medellin rival Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 in the second leg of the final at Estadio Atanasio Girardot to claim the title. Local police commander William Castano told news channel Teleantioquia that officers had seized weapons, flares and fireworks from fans during checks at the stadium. “It was necessary to apply the graduated use of force, to help prevent the occupation of the pitch by the fans, to control outbreaks of public order disturbances and to guarantee the safety of citizens attending the event,” Castano said.

Smeared in crimson and regret, and already mouthing sheepish apologies to the crowd, he disappeared down the steps, pursued by a stern-looking Matt Porter, the chief executive of Professional Darts Corp (PDC).

A lion and bear rescued from captivity in northern Albania arrived in animal sanctuaries in Germany, after authorities in Tirana discovered they were being illegally kept as pets on a private estate.

Erion, a three-year-old lion, and Flora, a two-year-old bear, are now starting a new life.

“We are very happy that the authorities confiscated the animals and that we now have the chance to bring them to Germany, where they can start over and live in species-appropriate conditions,” said Magdalena Scherk-Trettin, a senior project manager responsible for rescues at the international animal welfare organization Four Paws.

A team from Four Paws carried out the rescue after Albania's National Forestry Agency located the lion based on videos posted on TikTok by its owner.

Neither authorities nor the organization have named the person who was keeping them as pets.

The animals on Saturday last week ended a 70-hour journey through several European countries, with Erion now housed in a wild animal sanctuary in southeast Germany and Flora in a bear sanctuary in the north of the country, Four Paws said.

The organization said both animals had been in poor condition.

“An initial visual check determined that Flora is malnourished and has dental issues, so her recovery plan is already underway,” the organization said.

And when Erion was rescued, his mane had fallen out, for reasons that the veterinarians have not yet been able to determine, it said.

Despite the challenging journey, the rescue was worth it, Scherk-Trettin said. 

“We are delighted to see these animals begin their new lives,” they added.

Illegal wildlife trade remains a systemic problem in Albania and across the region, where bears in particular, as well as exotic animals, are kept in cages at restaurants or on private properties with little or no expert care.

Erion's and Flora's origins remain unclear. 

Four Paws said it believes the lion is a victim of illegal wildlife trafficking, while the bear was likely poached from the wild.

“The rescue highlights Albania's urgent need to tackle illegal wildlife trade and private keeping,” the organization said.

Weak legislation, legal loopholes and poor enforcement have contributed to the widespread private captivity and trade of wild animals in Albania, it said, adding that it estimates more than 60 big cats are still being kept in poor conditions in Albania.

Four Paws project manager Sajmir Shehu said the law lacks a stringent framework based on which organizations like his could prevent wild animals being kept in captivity.

The law also allows for animals to be confiscated if welfare or veterinary standards are not met, but imposes no sanctions on the owners of exotic pets.



                                                                                The Burmese junta has said that detained former leader Aung San Suu Kyi is “in good health,” a day after her son said he has received little information about the 80-year-old's condition and fears she could die without him knowing.
In an interview in Tokyo earlier this week, Kim Aris said he had not heard from his mother in years and believes she is being held incommunicado in the capital, Naypyidaw.
Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was detained after a 2021 military coup that ousted her elected civilian government and sparked a civil war. She is serving a                                    



                                                                                China yesterday held a low-key memorial ceremony for the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) not attending, despite a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan.
Beijing has raged at Tokyo since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi last month said that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Japan.
China and Japan have long sparred over their painful history. China consistently reminds its people of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in which it says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people in what was then its capital.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with his Polish counterpart Karol Nawrocki in Warsaw on Dec. 19, marking their first meeting since Nawrocki's inauguration.

Speaking at the press conference, Nawrocki said that his meeting with Zelensky is ""bad news for Russia."" The two leaders discussed security, economic, and historical matters.

""President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit is evidence that in strategic matters and security issues, Poland, Ukraine, and the countries of the region stand together,"" he added.

Nawrocki said that there is a sense in Poland that its aid to Ukraine since the start of the all-out war ""has not been sufficiently recognized."" Zelensky responded by once again expressing his gratitude to Warsaw.

""There are sometimes difficult moments in our societies, but as presidents, we must define policies that keep us united. Without our independence, Moscow will inevitably push further into Europe and will come for Poland,"" Zelensky said.  

According to the Ukrainian president, the two leaders' talks were centered around war-related issues. Kyiv proposed consultations with Warsaw on drone defense, as Russian drones have multiple times entered NATO airspace over the past year.

Nawrocki didn't exclude the possibility of delivering MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, and said he expects Kyiv to share drone production technologies with Poland in exchange. 

Zelensky's visit to Poland follows a trip to Brussels, where EU leaders approved a 90 billion euros ($105.5 billion) interest-free loan for Ukraine. Initially considering using frozen Russian assets, officials opted for an alternative financing approach after failing to reach a consensus.

""If Russia drags out the war, we will use the funds for defense,"" Zelensky said. ""If the world forces Russia to peace, we will use these funds exclusively for the rebuilding of the state.""

Later in the day, Zelensky also met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Since Nawrocki took office, relations between Kyiv and Warsaw have seen growing tensions, despite Poland's role as one of Ukraine's key allies since the start of the full-scale invasion.

While Nawrocki expressed support for Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression, he has also spoken critically about Kyiv's EU and NATO ambitions, often highlighting historical grievances.

The Volyn (Volhynian) massacre remains one of the most contentious issues in present day Polish-Ukrainian relations. The massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) members killed at least tens of thousands of Poles, while thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.

The first exhumation on Ukrainian soil since 2017 began this April in the former village of Puzhnyky, Ternopil Oblast, marking what officials on both sides called a breakthrough after years of a de facto moratorium.

Representatives from the National Memory Institutes of Ukraine and Poland held talks in Warsaw on Dec. 19.

""We respect the Polish perspective on the path of our nations, and we honor your memory of what has been. We count on your respect for our Ukrainian memory,"" said Zelensky.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to include comments from President Volodymyr Zelensky, European Council President Antonio Costa, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko, and further details about the loan.

European leaders on Dec. 19 approved an interest-free loan for Ukraine, providing a financial lifeline and securing a large portion of the cash-strapped country's financing needs for the next two years. 

""Today we approved a decision to provide 90 billion euros ($105.5 billion) to Ukraine for the next two years,"" Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council, said in a press conference.

EU officials had initially sought to underpin a large loan to Ukraine with immobilized Russian central bank reserves, but after failing to secure a consensus, they opted for an alternative financing approach.

The frozen-assets proposal fell apart at the eleventh hour amid divisions among EU leaders in Brussels. The approved loan will be backed instead by the EU budget, according to Costa. 

The agreement will lend the funds to Ukraine in 2026 and 2027, securing two-thirds of the country's financing needs. Kyiv was set to run out of cash by mid-2026.

""This (agreement) sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin: This war will not be worth it,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on X.

Costa said Ukraine will only repay the loan once Russia pays reparations, and that the immobilized assets could still be used to repay the loan.

""This is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience,"" President Zelensky said in a post on social media. 

""Thank you for the result and unity. Together, we are protecting the future of our continent,"" he added. 

Ukraine's finance minister, Serhii Marchenko, also welcomed the decision in a post on social media, adding that the funds ""will be directed toward budgetary and defense needs.""

In November, European estimates put Ukraine's unfunded military and budgetary needs at 135 billion euros ($160 billion). The agreement means that Kyiv still needs to secure roughly 45 billion euros ($50 billion) from its allies. 

Costa also left the door open to the reparations loan initiative, saying that the bloc would continue working on the plan. 

Later on Dec. 19 in a social media post following a meeting with G7 finance ministers, Marchenko called the $105 billion loan an ""interim measure,"" and urged the EU to keep working towards the reparations loan.

""The risks to Europe from a potential defeat of Ukraine far exceed the risks of introducing the reparations mechanism,” Marchenko said in a press release. 

The decision came down to the wire on Dec. 18 after a last sprint of preparatory meetings between EU envoys this week failed to reach consensus in the lead-up to the summit.

Advisers met on the sidelines of the summit throughout the entire day to try to get Belgium on board, Politico reported.

Belgium, which hosts the vast majority of the frozen assets, had been the most vocal opponent to the reparations loan plan. The country feared that it could be on the hook for one-third of its gross domestic product should Russia claw back the assets through legal action.

EU leaders spent hours discussing the technical and legal feasibility of structuring a loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Diplomats said the plan proved too complex and politically sensitive to resolve at this stage, prompting leaders to move forward with an alternative interest-free loan instead.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas had both said ahead of the meeting that the odds were ""50/50"" that the reparations loan succeeded.

In the leadup to the summit, the reparations loan had been seen as the most politically viable option, since the Commission had said that joint borrowing would require unanimity — widely expected to be blocked by Hungary and Slovakia. 

But the leaders found a workaround which ""will not have an impact on the financial obligations of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia,"" according to the conclusions of the summit posted by the European Council. 

As momentum built for the reparations loan ahead the summit, European countries voted to indefinitely immobilize the Russian assets on Dec. 12, using a provision in the EU treaties known as Article 122, usually reserved to help its members to deal with economic emergencies

By framing Russia's war in Ukraine as a source of significant economic difficulties, the EU leveraged the emergency clause as the legal basis of the indefinite freeze. Article 122 only requires a ""qualified majority,"" to vote in favor, meaning a minimum of 15 countries representing 55% of the bloc's population.

Usually, matters of foreign policy must be decided by unanimity.

The indefinite immobilization of the assets removed the risk that Hungary or Slovakia would veto the continued immobilization of the assets — which was previously subject to a bi-annual unanimous vote.

Holiday hosting guide | Why partying is good for us  | Favourite party memories  | Party tips from a pro | 

In this era of delivery apps and best new restaurants lists, Chelsea Fagan is somewhat of an anachronist. The millennial writer and co-founder of the Financial Diet website regularly invites friends over for meals and thinks others should, too. Her new book, Having People Over, is not a trad-wife guide, but rather an argument for hosting dinner parties as a way to resist late-stage capitalism and the loneliness epidemic. She spoke to The Globe and Mail from her home in Manhattan. 

The expense of hosting is a big reason millennials and Zoomers give for not having dinner parties. But you make the argument that hosting at home is often cheaper than going out for dinner.

It is just much less expensive in general to host in the home and to be hosted in the home. I think, when you look at the data, millennials and especially Gen Z have become accustomed to spending on restaurants, delivery, bars et cetera, essentially outsourcing the food experience to an extent that previous generations never have. Even more so than boomers today, who objectively have much more disposable income on average. And I think we've really become kind of inured to how expensive that actually is, and how much of our budget that dictates.

What is lost when we're choosing dinner delivery rather than having a friend come over and cooking a meal for them? 

I think we're losing several things. Obviously money, but I think we're losing a sense of intimacy and personal touch when we default to a restaurant. If people want a perfectly curated meal experience, where the food, the service, the ambiance, everything is at a professional level and requires no lift on their end, they can go to a restaurant. They come to someone's home not just to be with them in an intimate way and have quality time with them, but also to experience the world through their eyes. The homes that we create, the food that we serve, the experience that we curate, these are all unique. I think that there's just a real lack of humanity and the human touch that we experience when we're constantly defaulting to these professional third parties.

An honest mess: Is the pressure to deep clean for guests sabotaging our social time?

An overachiever's guide to holiday hosting

In your 20s, you were deep in credit card debt, but you still entertained pretty regularly. What did that look like?

These years really forced me to be creative and thoughtful in a way that I don't have to be any more. It was a lot of potlucks, it was a lot of pulling together what I had. It was a studio apartment, so we were eating dinner next to my bed. Everything was a little broken, a little chaotic, a little mismatched.

I feel like my worst guest experiences have been in the homes of people with a ton of money. You can make everything go away: all of the labour, all of the imperfections. I'm like, “This could have been at a restaurant, diva.” What makes the experience in a home enjoyable or unique is the personal, the handmade, the imperfect. Often, the more money we get, the less and less of that touch that we have.

Fagan says part of curating isn't just about you being a host, it's about people who show up.Chelsea Kyle/Supplied

We live in a culture of flaking, and sometimes people won't even tell you they're not coming to something they said they would. How do you navigate that?

As I've gotten older, I have less tolerance. I had a person who flaked on me earlier this year. It was a budding acquaintanceship, could be a friendship. I was just like, “This is my stop.” I didn't block her, but I muted her on everything. She sent me a half-apology the next day with a completely insane excuse. I am basically forgetting that she exists. 

Part of curating is not just about you being a host, it's about people who show up, it's about reciprocity, it's about investing in each other and creating a real community. The number of things I've showed up to in the dead of winter that I don't want to go to can't be counted. But you have to be a person of your word. You have to be a person who invests, because you'll want that returned. 

You're better off having five friends who show up, who treat you well, who invite you places, who include you, who think of you, than 50 people who are completely unreliable.

Marlowe Granados is the author of Happy Hour.

Recently, I gasped out of shock. I was at the National Ballet in Toronto for the opening night of Winter's Tale. Walking through the corridor in silks and fur, I was confronted with a group of people wearing… jeans. At first, I was confused, and then terribly dismayed. There are so few reasons to dress up in this modern age, and I was under the impression that attending the ballet was one of them. Think of it as wearing a team's jersey to a game (I participate in that ritual, too). 

If you're already out the door for something as exquisite as the ballet, why not make it a night to remember? Dorothy Draper, the 20th-century interior designer and impeccable hostess, would call this reluctance giving in to “the Will to be Dreary.” 

In her book Entertaining is Fun! she defines the saying as, “a morose little imp which whispers to us that something which we know would be fun would be too much trouble, will take too much time, is too expensive and probably wouldn't be as amusing after all.” 

‘Is that all there is?' In this new world, perhaps we need a little nostalgia, and a bit of naivety

My evenings at the ballet are what I always imagined the privileges of adulthood would look like. I love the ceremony of putting together an outfit, popping in pearl earrings, and before curtain, meeting a friend for a glass of champagne. For me, these elements together make the difference between just another night, and an occasion. No matter how many times I go to the ballet, I will always be excited. 

Draper writes that this kind of attitude demands you have a “flair for enjoyment.” You can certainly enjoy things, but do you have a flair for it? From what I have witnessed, there is a drought of verve and enthusiasm that must be amended, and we need to increase people's appetites. So, if I am to urge people to take one thing into the new year, it's a sense of occasion, no matter how casual the engagement is. Despite whatever gloom hangs over us, there's always an opportunity to witness signs of life. 

By setting the standard during a party, your guests will eagerly match it.istock/GettyImages/Getty Images

As a known social butterfly, I understand mingling is not everyone's strength, and people are out of practice. We have increasingly become accustomed to socializing through our phones, romantically and otherwise. Friendships have shifted to include the passivity of witnessing people's lives online, as opposed to making the effort to spend quality time with them. 

I'll admit, in this arena I have it easier than most, since I travel frequently and making plans has the urgency of catching me at the right place and the right time. But it is as simple as asking when someone is free. Maybe you've spent this holiday season seeing everyone you know and now believe you can take several months off from engagements. These past few weeks may have run you ragged, but you must keep spirits up through the long winter ahead. 

It doesn't matter the season, me and my friends believe in the importance of bringing a little conviviality through whatever door we waltz through. Having fun is good for you, and most importantly, it's infectious. It's about creating an atmosphere that is built out of optimism and vitality. 

If you don't want to venture out, invite your loved ones past the threshold and into your home. Do it in the dead of March when the idea of spring still feels like a far-off dream. 

This gives people something to look forward to. Not one for cooking? Me neither, but I do have beautiful jadeite platters that I can arrange delivered food on adequately. Don't want people to stay late? I like to add to my invitations an appropriate out time, phrased as “Carriages at x o'clock.”

If you stop yourself by giving a myriad of excuses not to do something, you give in to the “Will to be Dreary.” 

Recently, I had a birthday party at my local bar on a Monday evening. It was simple, I gave a time frame that I would be there as though it were my office hours. Some would advise against having a party on a Monday because the likelihood people would come seems low, but people did and they were glad for it! I buzzed around the entire bar giving pieces of cake to everyone, including strangers, because even though it was my birthday, I was still the host. 

Have dietary demands taken the fun out of dinner parties?

As Draper writes, “Every good hostess has a sense of showmanship.” That entire week after my birthday started off with an injection of vitality for at least 20 people, and I am now fielding texts to throw a little party with or without a reason again. 

If you set the standard, your guests will eagerly match it, having been craving an opportunity to do so. It's like when I met a friend for dinner and she says, “I wore these heels for you.” The shoes have been sitting in the back of her closet for months, but because I bring the atmosphere of an occasion, they're finally allowed a night out on the pavement. 

My favourite film to watch this time of year is a lesson to us all: 1999's 200 Cigarettes follows an ensemble of New Yorkers on New Year's Eve making it through several obstacles to get to the one party they've all been invited to. The host of said party, played by Martha Plimpton, frets that no one will come. She paces back and forth in a chartreuse dress, “What are they all, walking the streets out there like zombies because it's too uncool to be prompt?” 

She gives in to her worries and passes out of drunkenness. When she wakes up, she realizes she slept through the night and the party of her dreams already happened all around her. 

What was all that fretting good for? One of the guests, played by Kate Hudson, is outside her apartment hailing a cab to the party. A driver stops. Noticing her indecision about going out, he opens the car door and says, “Sweetheart, you know what you need to do, you need to get into this cab.” She shuffles around in a pink coat, “I do?” The driver does not stutter, “You've gotta say yes to your destiny… Live tonight!” 

Now, allow me to get the door for you.

Poland's President Karol Nawrocki made the remark after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, stressing the unity of the two countries. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin held his annual press conference in Moscow.

Keep reading for more on this and all the latest headlines, backgrounders and analysis from Russia's war in Ukraine on Friday, December 19:

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said progress has been made in talks to end the war in Ukraine, but there is still a way to go.

Speaking at his end-of-year press conference he stressed the negotiations are not about imposing a deal on anyone.

The US has been engaged in intense shuttle diplomacy after unveiling a plan last month to try to secure a ceasefire.

While Rubio spoke in Washington on Friday, Ukrainian and European officials were scheduled to hold consultations with their US counterparts.

""Today, in the United States, together with Lieutenant General Andriy Gnatov, we will begin another round of consultations with the American side,"" top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov said on social media.

""At the invitation of the American side, European partners are also involved in this format,"" Umerov said.

The US proposal has been revised by Ukraine, Europe, and Russia.

Rubio said the last sticking points are always the hardest to resolve.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the ""entire Polish Nation for the significant and consistent support"" in a tweet in Polish after meeting his Polish counterpart Karol Nawrocki in Warsaw.

Nawrocki had previously insisted that Zelenskyy visit Warsaw to thank Poland for its support before he would consider visiting Kyiv.

""Poles feel... that our effort, our multifaceted assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion has not been duly appreciated or understood,"" Nawrocki said at a press conference during Zelenskyy's visit Friday.

""That is what I conveyed during a firm, honest, but very cordial and courteous conversation with President Zelenskyy.""

Zelenskyy insisted that ""Ukraine has always been grateful to Poland and will remain so."" He also later tweeted his thanks to all Poles for their support. 

Nawrocki's remarks Friday and earlier in the week (see earlier entry) echoed criticism by US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance during a White House visit at the start of the year, when they argued Zelenskyy was insufficiently thankful.

After Friday's talks, Nawrocki said Zelenskyy's visit was ""bad news for Moscow"" as it demonstrated the unity between Ukraine and Poland. He added the meeting marked ""a new beginning in our mutual relations.""

Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready to help Poland on drone defense and share its experience countering Russian drones.

He also offered cooperation on maritime security and invited Nawrocki to Ukraine to view its defense manufacturing capabilities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow's forces have taken the upper hand in Ukraine and are advancing along the entire front.

At his tightly orchestrated annual news conference, which lasted nearly four and a half hours, Putin vowed Russia would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv rejects peace talks on Kremlin terms.

""The only thing I want to say is that we have always said this: we are ready and willing to end this conflict peacefully, based on the principles I outlined last June (2024) at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by addressing the root causes that led to this crisis.""

The term ""root causes"" refers to Russia's maximalist demands for peace, including Ukraine recognizing Russian control over occupied regions and Crimea, abandoning NATO ambitions, and limiting its military. Kyiv has repeatedly dismissed those conditions.

Putin praised Donald Trump's efforts to end the conflict, saying Russia has ""practically agreed"" to the US president's proposals.

""The ball is now fully and completely on the side of our Western opponents... first of all the head of the Kyiv regime and their European sponsors,"" Putin said.

The Russian leader also vowed to halt long-range strikes on Ukraine if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agrees to hold a presidential election. The offer is only valid for the voting day.

Putin dismissed Western claims that Russia plans to attack European nations as ""sheer nonsense.""

Not all EU member states backed the interest-free loan to support Ukraine's defense in the grinding war with Russia.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said it would only need to be repaid once Ukraine receives reparations.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki said at a press conference after meeting with Ukraine's Zelenskyy that the unity between their two countries was bad news for Russia.

""This visit ​proves ​that in strategic matters, our strategic cooperation in security matters, Poland, Ukraine, the ‍countries of the region, countries filled with ​democratic values, are united, and this ⁠has ​never been in doubt,"" Nawrocki told reporters.

He also said he is optimistic about the exchange of Polish MiG-29 ‌fighter jets ‌for ⁠Ukrainian anti-drone technology.

For his part, Zelenskyy told reporters that the defense of Ukraine was the same as the defense of Poland.

""Without our independence, Moscow will inevitably come for Poland. That's why it's important that we exist, it's important that you exist, it's very important that Ukraine and Poland exist, and it's important that we stand together,"" the Ukrainian president said.

He also invited his Polish counterpart to visit Kyiv. Nawrocki has not visited Ukraine since taking office earlier in the year.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the European Union (EU) commented on the EU's decision to refrain from using seized Russianassets to support Ukraine's army in the war with Moscow.

""The appropriate term for it is theft,"" Putin said at his annual end-of-year press conference, also calling the plan, which did not materialize, ""daylight robbery.""

""Why can't this ‍robbery be carried out? Because the consequences could be grave for the robbers.""

Putin said such a move would have undermined the trust in the euro zone.

The EU agreed on a €90 billion loan to Ukraine from its own budget, without using any Russian assets.

Ukraine's security authorities said on Friday that they had struck a tanker from Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet"" that aims to get around sanctions.

An official from Ukraine's SBU security service said the tanker was hit with Ukrainian drones more than 2,000 ‍kilometres (1,243 miles) from Ukraine in the Mediterranean Sea.

The source told the French AFP news agency that the attack was a ""new, unprecedented special operation,"" marking the first time such an operation had been carried out in the Mediterranean.

The tanker, named as Qendil, was reportedly empty at the time of the attack.

The report could not be independently verified.

Ukraine has received the remains of 1,003 deceased people that Russia said were Ukrainian soldiers killed fighting the Russian military, Kyiv's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said.

""Today, repatriation activities took place. 1,003 bodies, which the Russian side claims belong to Ukrainian servicemen, have been returned to Ukraine,"" the agency said in a statement on social media.

Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky confirmed the exchange, saying the Russian side had received the remains of 26 Russian soldiers.

The exchange of remains of killed soldiers is one of the few areas where the two sides maintain some cooperation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was greeted by his Polish counterpart, Karol Nawrocki, outside the presidential palace in Warsaw on Friday morning.

Poland has been a major supporter of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

However, rising antagonism toward Ukrainian refugees has sparked a shift among some right-wing voters who make up Nawrocki's base.

In western cities such as Lviv, far from Ukraine's front lines, resentment toward TCK mobilization units seems to be growing.

Officers say the work is deeply unpopular and psychologically crushing, but insist that they have no alternative as the front line remains in urgent need of soldiers.

Some residents nevertheless tell DW that mobilisation is essential, while social media videos of violent detentions have fuelled public anger and prompted authorities to open hundreds of investigations into alleged abuse of power.

The Ukrainian president is set to hold talks with the two top figures of Polish politics.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk is a pro-EU centrist who has been a firm supporter of Ukraine.

However, President Karol Nawrocki is a Trump-backed right-winger who is expected to be more responsive to growing anti-Ukrainian sentiments amid some right-wing voters.

""We should support Ukraine, and we do,"" Nawrocki said in an interview with the wp.pl news website published on Monday.

""At the same time, we ‍should... ensure that Ukraine treats Poland as a partner. The conflict has been going on for ​nearly four ​years, and I have the impression that we, Poles, often don't feel like partners in this relationship.""

Nawrocki marks a cooling of Polish-Ukrainian relations even though his right-wing predecessor was supportive of Kyiv thanks in part to their joint antagonism toward Russia.

Ahead of his trip to Warsaw, Zelenskyy said relations with Poland were ""very important,"" as he seeks to shore up support from key allies as the Trump administration continues to be an unreliable partner for Ukraine.

President Vladimir Putin kicked off his annual conference in which he fields questions from journalists and citizens by saying Russia is ""ready and willing"" to end the conflict, but adding that he does not believe Ukraine is ready for peace talks.

""So ‌far, we don't really ‌see ⁠such readiness. ... But still we see ... ‍certain signals, including from the ​Kyiv ​regime, that they are ready to engage in some kind of dialogue,"" Putin said.

Russia has repeatedly pushed for the annexation of Ukrainian land as a prerequisite for peace talks.

He also said, without providing evidence, that: ""Our troops are advancing along the entire line of contact... the enemy is retreating in all directions.""

Russia has previously claimed advances that have been denied, at least partially, by Ukraine, such as the taking of the town of Pokrovsk.

On the first day of the EU summit in Brussels, the 27-member bloc reached an agreement to fund a €90 billion ($105 billion) loan to finance Ukraine for the next two years.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had called for the loan to be funded by frozen Russian assets held in the European Union.

However, Belgium, where the vast majority of assets are being held, opposed the plan, fearing retaliation from Russia.

The US' Trump administration had also opposed the plan, with reports that it had been putting pressure on EU leaders.

The second option, to fund the loan from the EU budget, had been opposed by Hungary, which is the EU member with the closest ties to Russia. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban agreed to withdraw his opposition while also not contributing to the loan.

Slovakia and the Czech Republic have also opted out.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy thanked the EU for agreeing to fund his country and said the important thing was that the Russian assets remain frozen.

Moscow also appeared pleased with the result, with Russia's special envoy for investment and economic cooperation, Kirill Dmitriev, calling it a ""major blow"" for von der Leyen.

Welcome to our updates as we bring you the latest from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, we are awaiting a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Polish President Karol Nawrocki in Warsaw.

Poland's President Karol Nawrocki made the remark after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, stressing the unity of the two countries. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin held his annual press conference in Moscow.

Keep reading for more on this and all the latest headlines, backgrounders and analysis from Russia's war in Ukraine on Friday, December 19:

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said progress has been made in talks to end the war in Ukraine, but there is still a way to go.

Speaking at his end-of-year press conference he stressed the negotiations are not about imposing a deal on anyone.

The US has been engaged in intense shuttle diplomacy after unveiling a plan last month to try to secure a ceasefire.

While Rubio spoke in Washington on Friday, Ukrainian and European officials were scheduled to hold consultations with their US counterparts.

""Today, in the United States, together with Lieutenant General Andriy Gnatov, we will begin another round of consultations with the American side,"" top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov said on social media.

""At the invitation of the American side, European partners are also involved in this format,"" Umerov said.

The US proposal has been revised by Ukraine, Europe, and Russia.

Rubio said the last sticking points are always the hardest to resolve.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the ""entire Polish Nation for the significant and consistent support"" in a tweet in Polish after meeting his Polish counterpart Karol Nawrocki in Warsaw.

Nawrocki had previously insisted that Zelenskyy visit Warsaw to thank Poland for its support before he would consider visiting Kyiv.

""Poles feel... that our effort, our multifaceted assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion has not been duly appreciated or understood,"" Nawrocki said at a press conference during Zelenskyy's visit Friday.

""That is what I conveyed during a firm, honest, but very cordial and courteous conversation with President Zelenskyy.""

Zelenskyy insisted that ""Ukraine has always been grateful to Poland and will remain so."" He also later tweeted his thanks to all Poles for their support. 

Nawrocki's remarks Friday and earlier in the week (see earlier entry) echoed criticism by US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance during a White House visit at the start of the year, when they argued Zelenskyy was insufficiently thankful.

After Friday's talks, Nawrocki said Zelenskyy's visit was ""bad news for Moscow"" as it demonstrated the unity between Ukraine and Poland. He added the meeting marked ""a new beginning in our mutual relations.""

Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready to help Poland on drone defense and share its experience countering Russian drones.

He also offered cooperation on maritime security and invited Nawrocki to Ukraine to view its defense manufacturing capabilities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow's forces have taken the upper hand in Ukraine and are advancing along the entire front.

At his tightly orchestrated annual news conference, which lasted nearly four and a half hours, Putin vowed Russia would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv rejects peace talks on Kremlin terms.

""The only thing I want to say is that we have always said this: we are ready and willing to end this conflict peacefully, based on the principles I outlined last June (2024) at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by addressing the root causes that led to this crisis.""

The term ""root causes"" refers to Russia's maximalist demands for peace, including Ukraine recognizing Russian control over occupied regions and Crimea, abandoning NATO ambitions, and limiting its military. Kyiv has repeatedly dismissed those conditions.

Putin praised Donald Trump's efforts to end the conflict, saying Russia has ""practically agreed"" to the US president's proposals.

""The ball is now fully and completely on the side of our Western opponents... first of all the head of the Kyiv regime and their European sponsors,"" Putin said.

The Russian leader also vowed to halt long-range strikes on Ukraine if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agrees to hold a presidential election. The offer is only valid for the voting day.

Putin dismissed Western claims that Russia plans to attack European nations as ""sheer nonsense.""

Not all EU member states backed the interest-free loan to support Ukraine's defense in the grinding war with Russia.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said it would only need to be repaid once Ukraine receives reparations.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki said at a press conference after meeting with Ukraine's Zelenskyy that the unity between their two countries was bad news for Russia.

""This visit ​proves ​that in strategic matters, our strategic cooperation in security matters, Poland, Ukraine, the ‍countries of the region, countries filled with ​democratic values, are united, and this ⁠has ​never been in doubt,"" Nawrocki told reporters.

He also said he is optimistic about the exchange of Polish MiG-29 ‌fighter jets ‌for ⁠Ukrainian anti-drone technology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","German business bankruptcies hit decade high amid downturn","https://www.dw.com/en/german-business-bankruptcies-hit-decade-high-amid-downturn/a-75225534","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:24:50 GMT","

Business bankruptcies have climbed to an 11-year high, with small firms hardest hit by Germany's anemic growth. Economists warn of job losses but see tentative signs that the insolvency wave may be leveling off.

Data for the first three quarters of 2025 have shown that smaller German firms have borne the brunt of almost three years of economic downturn in Europe's biggest economy over the past three years.

On December 12, the chief analyst at the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), Volker Treier, told news agency Reuters that the ""wave of insolvencies continues."" He added that small and medium-sized enterprises in particular were ""running into difficulties.""

In a recent survey, DIHK found that nearly one in three companies with fewer than 20 employees expects its business situation to worsen. Such firms account for roughly 85% of all businesses in Germany.

Official figures confirm the trend, with Germany's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) stating on the very same day that German local courts recorded 18,125 corporate insolvency filings by the end of September, almost 12% more than in the same period last year.

This makes the number of company bankruptcies in the first three quarters of 2025 the highest since 2014.

The disproportionate exposure of small businesses to a stagnating economy comes as no surprise to insolvency researchers.

Steffen Müller, head of insolvency research at the Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH), says the recent wave of insolvencies ""overwhelmingly occurs in the small-business segment.""

The median insolvent company had employed around 10 people, he told DW, but added that ""most are even smaller.""

The broader financial stress is also visible beyond the corporate sector. Personal bankruptcies rose again this year, with 57,824 consumer insolvencies recorded in the first three quarters, up more than 8% year on year.

Although most bankruptcies involve small firms, the surge has also led to a sharp increase in the number of jobs lost or at risk. According to IWH estimates, around 170,000 positions are affected this year, up from fewer than 100,000 before the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Klaus-Heiner Röhl, an economist at the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, cautioned against overstating the impact on employment. ""Insolvencies do contribute to slightly higher unemployment,"" he told DW, ""but the development is not dramatic.""

IWH researcher Müller, however, expects the labor market effects to be more pronounced. His estimates point to around 200,000 affected jobs in 2025, roughly double the level seen in the years before the pandemic.

""Some of these positions are likely to be permanently lost because insolvencies lead to closures,"" he said.

At the same time, Müller stressed that the overall impact remains manageable, as jobs were often created elsewhere and workers would move from weaker firms to stronger ones during periods of market adjustment.

Both economists think the rise in insolvencies was broadly expected. ""An increase was foreseeable,"" Müller said, although the scale of the surge was ""somewhat surprising.""

Röhl agreed, pointing to Germany's prolonged economic stagnation. ""Given the persistent weakness in the economy, insolvency numbers could have been even higher,"" he said.

Röhl attributed the rise primarily to macroeconomic factors, citing nearly three years of ""stagnating or slightly declining economic output."" Elevated energy prices, Russia's war in Ukraine, and the transition toward climate neutralityhave further strained companies' finances.

However, Röhl added that it was ""difficult to quantify how much delayed policy reforms or late corporate adjustments have contributed to the problem.""

Müller also rejected assigning blame to any single factor. ""Insolvency reasons are always highly individual,"" he said, pointing to issues such as poor product choices, management conflicts, or disputes with key stakeholders. When these weaknesses coincide with rising costs, structural change, geopolitical uncertainty, and tariffs, ""insolvency occurs more quickly.""

According to Müller, it remains relatively rare for fundamentally sound and competitive companies to fail solely because of ""deteriorating external conditions.""

Germany's Association of Insolvency Administrators and Trustees (VID) struck a cautious note of optimism.

""After the catch-up effects from the pandemic and the associated increase in insolvencies, developments are beginning to normalize,"" VID chairman Christoph Niering told German news agency dpa recently. He emphasized that this does not yet amount to a turnaround, ""but there is light at the end of the tunnel.""

Müller expects insolvency numbers in 2026 to remain close to the elevated levels seen this year.

""That is only partly good news,"" he said, warning that Germany has entered a ""red zone."" The situation should not deteriorate much further because among bigger corporations insolvency levels are comparable to those last seen about 20 years ago.

Röhl also sees a potential easing ahead. If the German economy expands by around one percent next year, as several institutes forecast, he believes insolvency activity should decline as well.

""Structural challenges, however, will persist as US tariffs, competition from China, and high energy costs are not going away,"" he cautioned.

The man believed to be behind the mass shooting at Brown University has been found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility, authorities said. 

Claudio Neves Valente, 48, a Portuguese national who attended Brown 25 years ago, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Providence police chief Oscar Perez said on Thursday evening.

The shooter, who was found at a storage unit along with two guns, is believed to have acted alone.

“Tonight, our Providence neighbours can finally breathe a little bit easier,” Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters.

Investigators believe Valente is responsible for both the shooting at Brown, in which two students were killed, and the murder of Nuno FG Loureiro, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) science professor.

However, authorities have not formally confirmed a connection between the two shootings.

Loureiro, a 47-year-old theoretical physicist and fusion scientist, was found dead at home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Monday night just hours after Valente allegedly opened fire at Brown University.

He allegedly killed two and injured nine others in the attack at the Ivy League university's engineering building before getting away.

The two dead were identified as students Ella Cook, the vice president of Brown's College Republican and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an 18-year-old freshman.

Loureiro, who joined MIT in 2016, was appointed last year to lead MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Centre, where he aimed to advance clean energy technology and other research.

The centre, one of the school's largest labs, had more than 250 people working across seven buildings when he took charge.

The US ambassador to Portugal, John J Arrigo, expressed his condolences in an online post that honoured Loureiro for his leadership and contributions to science.

“It's not hyperbole to say MIT is where you go to find solutions to humanity's biggest problems,” Loureiro said when he was named to lead the plasma science lab last year. “Fusion energy will change the course of human history.”

In January, Lourerio was one of about 400 scientists who had been awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by Joe Biden.

The action by county commissioners “shows a blatant disregard for the expertise of librarians,” one critic said.

Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. Please support us with a tax-deductible donation today.

A board of commissioners in North Carolina decided earlier this month to dissolve the entire library board of trustees in response to that board refusing to remove a single book featuring a transgender child character from the shelves.

The 3-2 decision by the Randolph County Board of Commissioners was based, in part, on the debunked concept of “social contagion” — the belief that children, after seeing acceptance of LGBTQ people (particularly transgender people), will somehow become “infected” with the idea and seek to change their identities.

The book in question, “Call Me Max,” features a character who says he wants to be called a name that better matches his gender identity — Max. Randolph County library system alleged the book was “planting” the idea of being trans into children's minds. 

In October, in response to a parent's complaint about the book, the Randolph County Public Library's Board of Trustees voted 5-2 against removing or relocating the book in its libraries, with some trustee members describing such an action as being a “slippery slope” toward censorship. 

“We adhere to the rules for the disposition of materials,” one library trustee member, Betty Armfield, reportedly said at the commission meeting in December. “We have the responsibility to serve all sides of issues.”

Armfield added that it was “parents' responsibility to choose what they believe are appropriate books for their children.”

The commissioners' vote means that the commission itself will likely have to appoint new members to the library board of trustees. Critics condemned the decision as being extraordinary.

“It's a pretty dramatic response to wanting to have diverse and inclusive books on shelves,” said Kasey Meehan, director of the Freedom to Read program at PEN America.

Kyle Lukoff, the author of “Call Me Max,” shared in a social media post his distress at the trustees being removed.

“A library's entire board of trustees was fired and replaced because they refused to ban one of my books. It's so terrible,” Lukoff said on Instagram. “I just feel so bad for the people who live in that community and love their library.”

Over the past several years, school and community libraries have seen an increase in right-wing attempts to ban books, particularly those with LGBTQ and/or nonwhite characters. Bans on such books make it difficult for kids to feel seen and included, experts say.

“When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part,” Rudine Sims Bishop, sociology professor emerita at Ohio State University, wrote in a paper earlier this year.

Zane McNeill, former news writer at Truthout and current health equity and civil rights fellow at Lawyers for Good Government, also panned the Rudolph County commission's actions.

“From 2023 to 2024, 25 percent of banned books in the U.S. featured LGBTQ characters or themes,” McNeill said in a statement to Truthout. “Librarians and library boards nationwide pushed back, calling these bans what they are: censorship.”

McNeill added:

This response by the County Board of Commissioners to dissolve the Randolph County Public Library's Board of Trustees…shows a blatant disregard for the expertise of librarians, the importance of telling diverse stories, and the First Amendment right to share and encounter ideas. At a time when authoritarianism gains power by casting trans people as the ‘Other,' every local struggle — from libraries to courtrooms, universities, and state capitals — matters.



December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We've set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $211,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

The International Criminal Court and human rights groups on Thursday condemned new US sanctions on two more of the tribunal's judges, which brought the total number of sanctioned ICC jurists to 11 amid the Trump administration's escalating campaign of retaliation against people and institutions seeking to hold Israel and the United States accountable for their alleged crimes.

“Today, I am designating two International Criminal Court (ICC) judges, Gocha Lordkipanidze of Georgia and Erdenebalsuren Damdin of Mongolia, pursuant to Executive Order 14203, ‘Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court,'” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump's February edict.

“These individuals have directly engaged in efforts by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel's consent, including voting with the majority in favor of the ICC's ruling against Israel's appeal on December 15,” Rubio added, referencing Monday's rejection of an Israeli bid to block a probe into alleged war crimes committed during the genocidal two-year war on Gaza.

Although Israel and the US are not ICC members and do not recognize the Hague-based tribunal's jurisdiction, Palestine is a state party to the Rome Statute governing the court. The treaty says that individuals from nonsignatory nations can be held liable for crimes committed in the territory of a member state.

Last year, the ICC issued warrants for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza, including murder and forced starvation in a war that has left more than 250,000 Palestinians dead, wounded, or missing.

The Trump administration had previously sanctioned nine other ICC jurists: Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan (United Kingdom), Deputy Prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan (Fiji), Deputy Prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang (Senegal), Judge Solomy Balungi Bossa (Uganda), Judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza (Peru), Judge Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini-Gansou (Benin), Judge Beti Hohler (Slovenia), Judge Nicolas Yann Guillou (France), and Judge Kimberly Prost (Canada).

The affected judges have recently described how the US sanctions have left them and their families — who are also blacklisted — “wiped out economically and socially.”

Responding to the new US punitive measures, the ICC said Thursday that “these sanctions are a flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial institution which operates pursuant to the mandate conferred by its states parties from across regions.”

“Such measures targeting judges and prosecutors who were elected by the states parties undermine the rule of law,” the court continued. “When judicial actors are threatened for applying the law, it is the international legal order itself that is placed at risk.”

“As previously stated, the court stands firmly behind its personnel and behind victims of unimaginable atrocities,” the ICC added. “It will continue to carry out its mandate with independence and impartiality, in full accordance with the Rome Statute and in the interest of victims of international crimes.”

Human Rights Watch also slammed the new US sanctions, which the group called “the latest attempt by the Trump administration to blatantly interfere with independent justice.”

Amnesty International's Center for International Justice lamented that “once again, the US administration is attacking international justice — sanctioning two ICC judges. This cannot be normalized.”

“States must firmly oppose US threats and sanctions and uphold the court's ability to pursue accountability,” the group added, “even against the most powerful perpetrators.”

The federal government is appealing a case from Trump's first term to reinstate an asylum ban at the southern border.

Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

Immigrant justice advocates are worried that the Trump administration's attempt to reinstate an asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border through an appeal at the Supreme Court will put asylum seekers in harm's way.

Asylum is a way for people to escape dangerous conditions such as violence, war, consequences from climate change, or persecution for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Each year, tens of thousands of people present themselves at the border to seek asylum. In 2023, the U.S. granted asylum to 54,350 people.

“People have sought safety at the border from all over the world fleeing violence, persecution, and discrimination, and that is really why asylum is so critically important,” said Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA. “People are fleeing real life-threatening harms, and this is really the mechanism for them to find a way for safety.”

Under the first Trump administration, people seeking asylum at the United States-Mexico border would typically be met by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who would turn them away. While some cases of asylum seekers being turned away at the San Ysidro border crossing occurred in 2016, the turn-back policies, called “metering” by the government, weren't written and widely instituted until the first Trump administration. This turn-back policy created a humanitarian crisis at the border that impacted thousands of people seeking refuge from danger.

In response, immigrant justice lawyers representing 13 plaintiffs sued to overturn the asylum ban in Noem vs. Al Otro Lado in 2017. The lawsuit was filed in July 2017 by Al Otro Lado, along with the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, the American Immigration Council, and other organizations located near the border.

“Customs and Border Protection officers would confront people literally standing at the line and obstruct them from coming in,” said Melissa Crow, the director of litigation for the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, who has been involved with the case since 2017. “They thought that would somehow make their blocking of access to the asylum process legal.”

Under the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and U.S. immigration law, the U.S. has a legal obligation to provide asylum and pathways to citizenship to people who meet the qualifications for a refugee.

Crow said that when asylum seekers would try to cross the border at the time this ban was in place, they would be told that there was no capacity. She said that during the discovery phase of the trial, however, it was uncovered that the “excuses were pretextual.”

The case was originally heard in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego before the federal government attempted to appeal the case to the Ninth Circuit Court, but the judge affirmed that the turn-back policy is unlawful.

The Supreme Court expects to hear arguments in the spring, with a decision anticipated for the summer.

Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and expects to hear arguments in the spring, with a decision anticipated for the summer.

One of the plaintiffs in Noem vs. Al Otro Lado, an asylum seeker the legal team refers to as “Bianca Doe,” is a transgender woman who sought asylum at the U.S. border in early 2017 after suffering extreme physical and sexual violence in both Honduras, her home country, and Mexico. When she presented herself at an official port of entry, border officials turned her back. Fearing for her life in Tijuana and desperate to reach safety in the United States, she attempted to climb a fence on a beach to come into the United States, but a border officer threatened to call the Mexican police.

She wasn't allowed into the U.S. until Noem v. Al Otro Lado challenged the policy keeping her from entering the country. Now, advocates like Fischer worry that reimplementing the asylum ban would bring back that desperation and fear facing many asylum seekers, including unaccompanied children, she said, which allows bad actors to profit and take advantage of those vulnerabilities at the border.

“The ability for people to seek asylum at the border is really a life-or-death issue.”

“The ability for people to seek asylum at the border is really a life-or-death issue,” Fischer said. “People must have the ability to present themselves and be able to seek this critical protection. Policies that are intended to block access to asylum or deter people from seeking asylum really only add to the violence and chaos and the real struggles that people have at the border.”

While the government wants to turn back people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, not all asylum seekers are subject to the same crackdown. Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said the targeting of the southern border specifically — while European or white South African immigrants are allowed to continue seeking asylum — is due to U.S. racism. To her, the attack on asylum did not come as a surprise.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration accepted 59 white South African refugees, affirming their assertion of being victims of “racial discrimination,” while Black and Afghan refugees have been denied refuge in the U.S.

“We've already seen in our detention centers people with protected status be detained and attempted to be deported, so why would they not go after the big fish, asylum at large, and just cut off that mechanism unless it's for white folks of a certain class bracket that they would like to populate the United States,” Limón Garza said.

“We've already seen in our detention centers people with protected status be detained and attempted to be deported, so why would they not go after the big fish, asylum at large, and just cut off that mechanism.”

She also said that she has seen a decrease in the amount of people seeking asylum at the southern border since the start of the second Trump administration. She believes it's due to the increased kidnappings and raids in the U.S. “People are really second guessing, like, ‘Do I want to go to the United States?,' because if you're leaving danger, would you go to a place that's just as dangerous, if not more? Why would you want to go to a place where you would just end up in a detention center in horrible conditions?”

Limón Garza is also concerned that the attack on asylum at the southern border will open the door for broader attacks on asylum recipients in the U.S.: “It's all interconnected.”

“We have to look around, look at our resources, and make a plan so it doesn't go unchecked,” she said. “I don't know what we'll do yet, but we will respond.”

Fischer said that ending asylum would mean thrusting people back into the same danger they fled. Rather than trying to ban asylum, she said, the federal government should instead be building reception systems so that people who are arriving to seek safety have access to lawyers, social workers, and the resources they need to start putting down roots in their new communities, as well as more legal pathways to citizenship.

“I think as much as communities are really stepping up and stepping out to protect their immigrant friends and neighbors, it is really, really critical for the Trump administration to stop their mass deportation and mass detention machine and really turn a new lease on their treatment of people seeking safety in immigrant communities,” Fischer said.

 An Unlikely Partnership Could Allow Tokyo and Seoul to Counter China

 Ayumi Teraoka

When the leaders of China, Japan, and South Korea last met, in May 2024, observers viewed the meeting with a sense of relief. Japan and South Korea were emerging from one of the darkest periods in their bilateral relationship, when tensions over Japan's colonial legacy in Korea had become so intense that they derailed traditional areas of cooperation in security and trade. In 2018, leaders in Tokyo reported that a South Korean warship had locked its radar on a Japanese patrol plane, and in 2019 the two countries launched a tit-for-tat escalation, in which Tokyo tightened export controls and Seoul responded by threatening to stop sharing intelligence. The substantive but fragile rapprochement between the two U.S. allies starting in 2022 allowed them to engage a powerful and assertive Beijing in a two-against-one dynamic.

Strengthening the Japanese–South Korean partnership is increasingly important as China flexes its muscle in the region. In November, Beijing launched a pressure campaign against Japan in response to remarks by Sanae Takaichi, the newly inaugurated prime minister, suggesting that Tokyo could get involved militarily if China were to attack or blockade Taiwan. China suspended seafood imports from Japan, canceled Japanese concerts and movie releases, and advised citizens against traveling to Japan. The Japanese Defense Ministry also reported that Chinese fighter aircraft had locked their radar on Japanese planes. It's a familiar playbook for Beijing, which took many similar actions against South Korea when Seoul agreed to host a U.S. missile defense system, known as THAAD, in 2016–17. South Korea has so far stayed neutral in response to China's pressure campaign against Japan, which reveals the lengths that Seoul and Tokyo still have to go before they can team up to counter Beijing's coercion and deal with other pressing regional challenges, including newfound uncertainty about U.S. commitments and a strengthened axis of China, North Korea, and Russia.

The fate of Japanese–South Korean relations at this crucial moment may ultimately rest on the two countries' new leaders, who, at first glance, do not seem to be natural partners. South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, who took over in June, has strong credentials on the South Korean left, which traditionally seeks engagement with Pyongyang—and, by extension, better relations with Beijing—and is less focused on strengthening the trilateral security partnership with Japan and the United States. South Korean progressives are also more inclined to call attention to Japan's mistreatment of Koreans during its colonial rule and are willing to challenge existing bilateral arrangements for reparations. Meanwhile, Takaichi comes from the right wing of Japan's dominant Liberal Democratic Party and represents the group most resistant to accommodating what it sees as South Korea's continuous demands to address past injustices. She has visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, the memorial to Japanese soldiers that includes 14 convicted war criminals from World War II, and is a protégé of the former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose revisionist views on history inspired deep antipathy among the South Korean public.

But this unlikely duo could be precisely the partnership needed to put the Japanese–South Korean relationship on a more resilient footing. The differing coalitions they represent will allow them to build a partnership with broader and more durable political support at home. Cooperation that takes root under this type of pairing is more challenging than that between two like-minded leaders, of course, but when it succeeds, it is more likely to endure. Takaichi and Lee are thus uniquely positioned to stage what might be called “Nixon goes to China” moments in their countries: because they are not expected to try rapprochement, these two recently elected leaders have the potential to break the cycle of disruption in the Japanese–South Korean partnership and to establish a lasting basis of cooperation.

Upon Takaichi's inauguration in October, the South Korean left expressed apprehension about the right-wing policies they expected from her government. Likewise, when Lee won the election in June after President Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment, many Japanese observers questioned whether he would cooperate with Japan, given his earlier harsh denunciations of its historical actions and its release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean in 2023. Although Lee moderated his tone and adopted a friendlier posture toward Japan when he assumed office—choosing Tokyo rather than Washington or Beijing as his first foreign destination—many in Japan doubted he would maintain his conciliatory stance when dealing with a conservative politician such as Takaichi.

The mistrust and frustration have deep roots. Both countries have struggled to strike a sustainable bargain over Japan's colonial legacy in Korea, including whether and how Japan should offer apologies and compensation for its exploitation of “comfort women” and use of forced labor in wartime. South Korean court rulings challenging the 1965 bilateral settlement of historical claims have interrupted the two governments' diplomatic efforts to advance their strategic partnership. After the South Korean Constitutional Court held the government accountable for not doing enough to seek compensation from Tokyo on behalf of comfort women in 2011, and with his administration facing declining domestic support, the conservative President Lee Myung-bak retreated from his attempts to improve ties with Japan and adopted a more confrontational position. His conservative successor, Park Geun-hye, signed a new compensation package with Abe to support comfort women survivors in 2015, explicitly stating that the issue was resolved “finally and irreversibly.” Yet when the progressive Moon Jae-in took office in 2017, he discredited the deal, shattering Japan's trust in South Korea as a negotiating partner.



By the time the conservative Yoon became president in 2022 and sought rapprochement with Tokyo, Japanese officials were so fatigued that they initially hesitated to reciprocate. Japanese leaders had learned that deals struck with willing South Korean conservatives often reflected support from only half the electorate and could easily be undone when their political fortunes diminished or progressive successors took office. At the encouragement of the Biden administration, Yoon and then Prime Minister Fumio Kishida eventually restored shuttle diplomacy, intelligence sharing, and chip component exports, culminating in a historic Camp David joint statement in 2023 committing Japan, South Korea, and the United States to consult in the event of a regional contingency, implying that the countries would possibly coordinate to respond to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Yet many officials and analysts wondered whether these advances would survive another leadership transition or domestic political crisis in Seoul. For Japan, genuine reassurance could only come from someone least likely to offer it: a progressive South Korean leader.

South Korea, meanwhile, also needs a cooperative bargain with a conservative Japanese leader if any deal is to stick. In 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, a socialist, issued a statement of apology for Japan's wartime actions and colonial rule. The new generation of conservative politicians, including Abe and Takaichi, openly questioned the necessity of an apology and took issue with its content. Although both leaders ultimately upheld the Murayama statement as cabinet ministers, this backlash from Japan's right fueled South Korean suspicions about the sincerity of Japan's apology.

More recently, Kishida, who was prime minister from 2021 to 2024, and his successor, Shigeru Ishiba, who led Japan until he resigned in 2025, represented relatively liberal factions within the Liberal Democratic Party. But because of their liberal image, both faced pressure to appeal to more conservative forces. Kishida accommodated many conservative policy priorities, such as restarting nuclear power plants and expanding the military; Ishiba faced criticism from his right flank for being too conciliatory toward Beijing. When Ishiba met with Lee in August, conservative opinion leaders and Takaichi supporters doubted his willingness to take a firm stance to protect Japan's national interests, limiting his ability to act decisively to offer concessions to South Korea.

Takaichi, unlike her more liberal predecessors, can govern with both the authority and the legitimacy to engage Seoul without fear of being undermined by the political right in Tokyo. She is unlikely to offer new apologies or drastic concessions on historical issues beyond what Abe did when he expressed Japan's “deep repentance for the war” in a statement commemorating the war's 70th anniversary and proposed a one-time offer to compensate South Korea in the 2015 comfort women agreement. But Takaichi can pursue sustained dialogue with counterparts in Seoul and push to elevate the Japanese–South Korean relationship into a bilateral strategic partnership with the full backing of Japan's conservative establishment. With her coalition government securing a majority in the lower house of parliament in late November, Takaichi is positioned to gradually build a firmer domestic footing to carry out these efforts.

To govern effectively as a progressive amid increasingly polarized South Korean politics, meanwhile, Lee needs to secure centrist support. Improving the relationship with Japan is among his best options for implementing a pragmatic agenda. The foreign policy positions of his predecessor—especially rapprochement with Japan—were relatively popular among the South Korean public despite Yoon's troubled presidency and eventual impeachment. The Lee administration has therefore appointed moderates to key diplomatic posts, such as national security adviser, and Lee can further empower them while pushing back against more hard-line forces by demonstrating the tangible benefits of cooperation with Tokyo.

Luckily, Takaichi and Lee do not need to build a relationship from scratch. They can capitalize on the momentum of their predecessors. Kishida and Yoon agreed in 2023 to collaborate in fields of intense geopolitical competition, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and supply chain resilience. And after Ishiba and Lee met in August, a joint committee on science and technology cooperation between their two countries convened in November—the first such high-level meeting on the subject in 16 years.



The deteriorating security environment in the Indo-Pacific makes it even more necessary for these leaders to collaborate. In particular, Washington's renewed unpredictability and waning engagement in multilateral forums require Japan and South Korea to work together to sustain regional public goods and protect their interests. Yoon officially embraced Japan's vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, an Abe-era strategy for promoting a rules-based regional order that his successors have maintained and that Takaichi seeks to revitalize as the core of her foreign policy vision. Japan can promote South Korean leaders' efforts to join various minilateral and multilateral platforms, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free-trade pact that emerged from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and, in the long term, the G-7. Japan should also embrace South Korea's regular participation—even if only as an observer—in the security partnerships between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, known as the Quad, or between Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States, informally called “the Squad.” Adding South Korea to these coalitions will streamline overlapping partnership-building efforts and boost Tokyo's and Seoul's ability to pool resources and collectively build enough military, economic, and technological scale to compete with China and its allies.

Such outcomes are not guaranteed, however. The last time the two countries had a similar combination of leaders was from 2017 to 2020, when the conservative Abe led Japan and the progressive Moon was president of South Korea. Moon entered office determined to reverse his predecessor's successful efforts to improve ties with Tokyo, which soured relations from the outset and led to further tensions. There is also a risk that a diplomatic contingency, such as renewed disputes over a contested set of islands between the two countries known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan, could rile up nationalist sentiment and halt political momentum for cooperation.

But there is reason to believe that the current leadership pairing could herald genuine progress. When world leaders met for sideline meetings at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in October, Takaichi and Lee surprised their domestic audiences with an overwhelmingly positive encounter. The Japanese prime minister, who had expressed fondness for South Korean cosmetics, seaweed, and television dramas days earlier, bowed to the South Korean flag—a move considered respectful that was widely covered in the South Korean press. After the summit, the South Korean president, for his part, told a domestic audience that he was “no longer worried” about having Takaichi as his counterpart, a statement embraced by Japanese media. Lee is reportedly considering traveling to Tokyo to visit Takaichi in January 2026. By deepening cooperation across ideological lines and managing expectations, Tokyo and Seoul have a rare opportunity to construct an alignment resilient enough to withstand the political winds of the future.

            The Department of Homeland Security announced its intention to pause a visa program intended to admit certain individuals to the United States, though it's unclear whether it's been suspended entirely.
    


            The move comes after the suspect in the Brown University shooting was identified as a green-card holder who immigrated to the country through the program. It's the latest attempt by the administration to broadly tighten the US immigration system following domestic incidents.
    


            “At President (Donald) Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X late Thursday. DHS oversees the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
    


            Claudio Neves Valente, the suspect in Saturday's shooting at Brown University who is also accused of killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor on Monday, was found dead Thursday night.
    


            Valente was identified as a 48-year-old former Brown University student and Portuguese national. Noem said Thursday that he came to the United States in 2017 on a DV1 visa and received a green card.
    


            The State Department runs the diversity visa program, which is designed for individuals in countries that are determined by a formula to have a low enough level of immigration to the US. Those who arrive to the US under the program are also issued green cards. The issuance of those green cards is handled by DHS.
    


            The bulk of the program falls under the State Department, which would presumably be charged with pausing the program. It's unclear what direction Noem could provide, aside from pausing the issuance of green cards for those in the program.
    


            “The horrific incidents this week demonstrate the threat the diversity visa program poses to American security and safety, which President Trump has long worked to fix. The Department of State is working closely with Department of Homeland Security to put in place all necessary measures to protect America from this threat,” a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            CNN also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for additional details.
    


            The diversity visa program has long been a target of President Donald Trump's ire — he took aim at it during his first term after an Uzbek national who was a recipient of the program was suspected of killing eight people in a terrorist attack in New York City.
    


            At the time, Trump backed a Republican-led effort to eliminate the diversity visa program and certain categories of family-based green cards, and then transform the remaining employment-based visas into a point system that favors heavily highly skilled, highly educated, English-speaking immigrants.
    


            The diversity visa program offers green cards for people “from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States,” according to the State Department website.
    


            The US admits up to 55,000 immigrants each year as part of the program through random selection. The nationalities who have come through the program have evolved over the years. According to federal data, most of the participants in fiscal year 2026 were from Africa, followed by nationals from Asia and Europe.
    


            Those who enter the US on a diversity visa are required to have completed the equivalent of high school education or “two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.”
    


            While individuals are selected for visas randomly, they still must meet security and eligibility requirements that all immigrants must clear to obtain their visas.
    


            In some cases, people already in the United States can also apply for the diversity visa program.
    


            “DV lottery winners who are already legally residing in the United States must apply through USCIS to adjust their status to permanent residence,” said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney. “(State Department) not only administers the lottery but also issues the immigrant visas.”
    


            Thursday's announcement marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's ramped up immigration crackdown in recent weeks.
    


            Following the shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan national late last month, the administration took several steps to curb legal immigration, including reexamination of green cards issued to people from 19 countries of concern and the pause of all asylum decisions.
    


            Earlier this week, Trump signed a proclamation expanding the list of countries with full or partial travel restrictions to 39, increasing from the previous list of 19 countries.

            How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?
    


            Request to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired.
    


            That was the previously unreported guidance that Brig. Gen. Eric Widmar, the top lawyer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to the country's top general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, in November, according to sources familiar with the discussion.
    


            Caine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not.
    


            Widmar responded that they should consult with their legal adviser if they're unsure, the sources said. But ultimately, if they determine that an order is illegal, they should consider requesting retirement.
    


            The guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military's counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean — including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2.
    


            Caine is not in the chain of command. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported.
    


            The Joint Staff declined to comment for this story.
    


            Several senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months.
    


            Widmar's advice to Caine was meant to help inform the chairman's discussions with senior military officials should the issue come up, the sources said. The Democrats' video had become headline news, enraging Hegseth and sparking debates across the country.
    


            A separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they're being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it's typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation.
    


            Other current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they're eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability.
    


            “A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,' and shouldn't be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they're given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year.
    


            More than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn't agree with his vision for the department.
    


            But disagreeing with the direction of the military is different than viewing an order as illegal, legal experts said.
    


            Dan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.”
    


            Maurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.”
    


            Widmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said.
    


            “It's a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn't make it the right or ethical one.”
    


            Experts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs.
    


            In a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University's security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.”
    


            But while officers shouldn't resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military's professional values and ideals are at risk.
    


            And they should be willing to be fired for it. “Complete silence can be corrosive to good order and discipline and signal to the force that the military's professional values and norms are expendable,” they wrote.
    


            Maurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.”
    


            Those constraints have been apparent as the Pentagon has launched an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and one of the Democratic lawmakers seen in the video encouraging troops to disobey unlawful orders, which prompted Caine to seek the legal advice.
    


            As questions continue to swirl around the legality of the boat strike campaign, Widmar also advised Caine that Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to authorize lethal force to protect the nation, unless hostilities rise to the level of a full-blown war — in which case Congressional approval is required, the sources said.
    


            Whether the president's orders are legal to begin with, Widmar advised according to the sources, is a question only the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel can answer, due to the executive order Trump issued in February that says the president and the attorney general's “opinions on questions of law are controlling” on all executive branch employees  — to include US troops.
    


            The Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported.
    


            Since September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.
    


            Lawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them.
    


            Some members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.

            President Donald Trump said Wednesday his administration is starting to send checks in the amount of $1,776 to nearly 1.5 million US service members, using money from the “billions of dollars” he says the government has collected through his tariffs.
    


            “Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed One Big, Beautiful Bill, tonight I am also proud to announce that more than … 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call ‘Warrior Dividend,' before Christmas,” Trump said Wednesday night in a televised address to the nation.



Troops will receive $1,776 checks before Christmas, Trump announces



            But he alone can't decide how the revenue from his sweeping tariffs gets spent.
    


            All revenue the government collects, whether through ordinary taxes or tariffs, goes into a general fund managed by the Treasury department that is then used to pay the government's expenses, such as distributing tax refunds﻿. Any other use of the money has to be approved by Congress, which, so far, hasn't happened for tariff collections.
    


            “Money is fungible,” a White House spokesperson told CNN. “Just because Congress didn't specifically appropriate tariff revenue to be used for the Warrior Dividend doesn't change the fact that the government has more money available (because of tariffs) to pay for these sort of initiatives.” Congress did, however, sign off on Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which earmarked money for the checks.
    


            Regardless, not only is none of the $260 billion in tariff revenue being put toward that, but it is unlikely to be applied to anything (and certainly not everything) that Trump has promised. 



            First off, about half of the tariff revenue collected this year, or as much as $129 billion, is tied to a landmark tariff case the Supreme Court is expected to soon issue a ruling on. If the justices rule against Trump, the government may have to issue billions of dollars in refunds to importers.
    


            But, refunds notwithstanding, here's everything else Trump, at various points, has promised that tariff revenue collected during his second term would be used for:
    


            Last month, Trump posted on Truth Social: “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” Trump hasn't specified what that income cap would be.
    


            While discussing refund checks, Trump has often brought up using tariff funds to help pay down the nation's almost $40 trillion in federal debt. He has not specified how much he'd seek to pay down, but has said he'd “substantially” reduce the debt.
    


            But even if Trump used every cent of the tariff revenue collected during his second term, it would only be able to pay off less than 1% of the national debt.
    


            During a campaign event last year, Trump seemed to suggest that tariff revenue could be put toward making child care more affordable.
    


            “With child care … those numbers are small, relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just told you about,” Trump said at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York. The president spoke extensively about his tariff plans throughout the event.
    


            Trump has said that any loss of government revenue that's associated with many of the tax cuts his administration has either floated or enacted, including new limitations on the portion of tips subject to taxes, will be made up for with tariff revenue.
    


            At a Cabinet meeting this month, for instance, Trump said: “I believe that at some point in the not‑too‑distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great.” 



            Trump pledged to distribute “some of that tariff money” to farmers, many of whom have been hurt by tit-for-tat moves that countries, especially China, have taken in retaliation of higher tariffs on commodities.

President Donald Trump's glowing account of progress under his watch Wednesday was out of tune with the experience of price-squeezed Americans and the story told by some of his government's own statistics.

ATLANTA (AP) — When Donald Trump delivered the first White House address of his second presidency Wednesday night, all major U.S. networks beamed his image and voice onto their airwaves, cable feeds and online platforms.

Americans ended up watching the Republican president stand in the Diplomatic Reception Room and deliver 18 minutes of aggressive, politically motivated arguments that misstated facts, blamed the nation's ills on his predecessor, exaggerated the results of his nearly 11 months in office and amplified his characteristically gargantuan, immeasurable promises about what's to come. 

This was no commander in chief announcing a military action or discussing a critical national issue. It was a politician's defiant insistence that he's doing a better job than polls suggest most Americans believe. And the spectacle raises the question of whether network executives should grant airtime to the leader of the free world for a clearly political speech simply because he asks. 

“It's not that the Oval Office and the White House haven't been used for political speeches before,” said former NBC News executive Mark Lukasiewicz, who is dean of Hofstra University's communications school after more than a decade leading NBC's special broadcasts, including presidential addresses. 

“But, as with a great deal of what Donald Trump does as president, this was outside the norm,” Lukasiewicz said, adding that news executives are reluctant to flout the historical standard that “when the president feels he needs to speak to the nation, you need to let him speak.”




The uneasy dynamics were further intensified because Trump spoke the same day that the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, told members of Congress that his agency, which has regulatory authority over media companies, is not in fact an independent agency as has been understood through generations of Republican and Democratic administrations. That's on top of Trump's penchant for browbeating individual journalists who cover him and suing news organizations to the tune of multimillion-dollar settlements, notably from CBS and ABC.

Lukasiewicz, who left NBC soon after Trump's 2016 election, said “it is hard to imagine that those factors aren't on the minds of news executives and network executives making these decisions.”

The White House did not immediately reply to questions Thursday about the process that led to Wednesday's address. The networks also did not respond to Associated Press inquiries. Spokespeople at MS NOW and CNN, cable networks whose prime-time programming already is oriented to political coverage, declined comment.

Presidential addresses often begin with the White House press secretary or communications director contacting networks' Washington bureau chiefs, asking for a specific amount of time and offering a general description of the topic. Lukasiewicz recalled that when President Barack Obama told the nation that 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden had been killed on his orders, his aides had told networks the president wanted to discuss a major national security matter. 

Such conversations are relayed up to network executives, who must weigh whether to preempt or delay programming, decisions that can affect advertising revenue. Networks typically grant the time, reasoning that they're relatively rare and historically have involved substantial matters.

Trump, who relishes talking directly to voters via social media and regularly talks to reporters on Air Force One and elsewhere, has made fewer requests for network time than many of his predecessors; he had not asked at all since returning to the White House in January. 

Still, it's not a guaranteed yes, with Obama and President Joe Biden being denied requests in recent decades.

The president disclosed his plans Tuesday on Truth Social, his social media platform. That announcement came hours after his declaration, also on Truth Social, that the U.S. would accelerate its actions against Venezuela and boats the Trump administration insists are running drugs that reach U.S. soil.

Taken together, those posts triggered chatter in Washington and beyond about official wartime actions. Some newsrooms predictably linked his planned speech to his Venezuela commentary. Presidents, after all, regularly make major military announcements in addresses from the White House: John F. Kennedy on the Cuban missile crisis, Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam, Jimmy Carter on the Iran hostages, Ronald Reagan on the Cold War and U.S. maneuvers in Latin America.

Presidents also have made plenty of U.S.-centered speeches, many fairly described as a politician pitching his preferred domestic policies with an unchecked megaphone.

Network leaders notably rejected Obama in 2014 when he wanted to talk about immigration policy while Congress was at an impasse over the matter. Lukasiewicz recalled being part of the executive team that rejected Obama's request to speak during his first term on the Affordable Care Act becoming law. 

In 2022, Biden spoke at length on his concerns about American democracy — but several networks did not carry his remarks from Philadelphia. By itself, the topic could be framed as a national concern above partisanship. Biden's effort, though, was complicated by the fact that he was talking about Trump and Trump's supporters who ransacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, at a time when they were being investigated and prosecuted. 

It's not clear when — or if — the White House shared the substance of Trump's remarks with network leaders. People familiar with how the process has worked in previous administrations said it would be defensible, since it was Trump's first address this term, for networks to grant his request even without clarity about the topic. 

By Wednesday afternoon and early evening, White House aides and some executive branch agencies had telegraphed to some journalists that the speech would be more oriented to the state of the nation nearly a year into Trump's presidency — a framing that would still put the speech within historical norms. Trump, however, went beyond those traditional boundaries.

The United States was “laughed at” before he resumed the presidency in January, Trump insisted. He blamed Biden and Democrats for “the worst (inflation) in the history of our country,” but said “everything ... is falling rapidly.” Biden-era inflation was not the worst in history, inflation rates began falling before he left office and, though they are now at or much closer to historically routine levels, that still means prices are rising. 

The White House also offered charts that only Fox opted to show.

Trump accused immigrants in Minnesota of stealing “billions and billions” of dollars and used the language of war to call Biden-era immigration levels an “invasion.” He claimed he'd secured $18 trillion in foreign business investments to the U.S. when his own White House puts the number closer to half that. He said he scored a landslide in 2024 — despite his Electoral College vote share ranking in the bottom third through 230 years of victorious presidents. 

Asked whether the display could give TV executives pause in the future, Lukasiewicz pointed back to business realities. 

“I don't know,” he said. “Those overlaying factors of the incredible pressure that this president can bring, and has shown himself completely willing to bring on these organizations and their corporate parents when he's unhappy — that's still part of the equation.”

The head of the U.S. agency for enforcing workplace civil rights posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work.

“Are you a white male who has experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex? You may have a claim to recover money under federal civil rights laws,” U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Andrea Lucas, a vocal critic of diversity, equity and inclusion, wrote in an X post Wednesday evening with a video of herself. The post urged eligible workers to reach out to the agency “as soon as possible” and referred users to the agency's fact sheet on “DEI-related discrimination” for more information. 

Lucas' post, viewed millions of times, was shared about two hours after Vice President JD Vance posted an article he said “describes the evil of DEI and its consequences,” which also received millions of views. Lucas responded to Vance's post saying: “Absolutely right @JDVance. And precisely because this widespread, systemic, unlawful discrimination primarily harmed white men, elites didn't just turn a blind eye; they celebrated it. Absolutely unacceptable; unlawful; immoral.” 

She added that the EEOC “won't rest until this discrimination is eliminated.” 

A representative for Vance did not respond to a request for comment. Lucas said Thursday evening that “the gaslighting surrounding what DEI initiatives have entailed in practice ends now. We can't attack and remedy a problem if we refuse to call it out for what it is — race or sex discrimination — or acknowledge who is harmed.” 




She added that “the EEOC's doors are open to all,” and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “protects everyone, including white men.” 

Since being elevated to acting chair of the EEOC in January, Lucas has been shifting the agency's focus to prioritize “rooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination,” aligning with President Donald Trump's own anti-DEI executive orders. Trump named Lucas as the agency's chair in November.

Earlier this year, the EEOC along with the Department of Justice issued two “technical assistance” documents attempting to clarify what might constitute “DEI-related Discrimination at Work” and providing guidance on how workers can file complaints over such concerns. The documents took broad aim at practices such as training, employee resource groups and fellowship programs, warning such programs — depending on how they're constructed — could run afoul of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race and gender.

Those documents have been criticized by former agency commissioners as misleading for portraying DEI initiatives as legally fraught.

David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at the NYU School of Law, said Lucas's latest social media posts demonstrate a “fundamental misunderstanding of what DEI is.”

“It's really much more about creating a culture in which you get the most out of everyone who you're bringing on board, where everyone experiences fairness and equal opportunity, including white men and members of other groups,” Glasgow said.

The Meltzer Center tracks lawsuits that are likely to affect workplace DEI practices, including 57 cases of workplace discrimination. Although there are instances in which it occurs on a case-by-case basis, Glasgow said he has not seen “any kind of systematic evidence that white men are being discriminated against.”

He pointed out that Fortune 500 CEOs are overwhelmingly white men, and that relative to their share of the population, the demographic is overrepresented in corporate senior leadership, Congress, and beyond.

“If DEI has been this engine of discrimination against white men, I have to say it hasn't really been doing a very good job at achieving that,” Glasgow said.

Jenny Yang, a former EEOC chair and now a partner at law firm Outten & Golden, said it is “unusual” and “problematic” for the head of the agency to single out a particular demographic group for civil rights enforcement.

“It suggests some sort of priority treatment,” Yang said. “That's not something that sounds to me like equal opportunity for all.”

On the other hand, the agency has done the opposite for transgender workers, whose discrimination complaints have been deprioritized or dropped completely, Yang said. 

The EEOC has limited resources, and must accordingly prioritize which cases to pursue. But treating charges differently based on workers' identities goes against the mission of the agency, she said. 

“It worries me that a message is being sent that the EEOC only cares about some workers and not others,” Yang said.

The Bank of Japan raised its key policy rate to a 30-year high on Friday to help curb inflation, as widely expected, and financial markets took the move in stride. 

The 0.25 percentage point hike took the BOJ's benchmark short-term rate to 0.75%, its highest level since September 1995. It will raise costs for mortgages and other loans, but also boost yields on savings deposits. 

“It is highly likely that wages and prices will continue to rise moderately,” BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda told reporters. “Risks to the economy have diminished, but we must remain vigilant.”

Inflation has long remained above the BOJ's target of about 2%. It was 3% in November, excluding volatile fresh food costs. 

The 0.75% rate is still low by most standards, but the BOJ has kept that rate near or below zero for years, trying to pull the economy out of a deflationary funk. Since the pandemic, most other central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have raised rates to counter spiking inflation and then begun cutting them to help their slowing economies recover momentum. 

Japan's own economy contracted at a 2.3% annual rate in the last quarter, but improved business sentiment and price pressures have led the BOJ to relent and raise rates. Here are some things to know about its decision.




Since Japan's economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, the central bank has kept borrowing costs low to encourage more spending by businesses and consumers. 

Lower interest rates have also helped the central bank manage the country's massive national debt, which amounts to nearly triple the size of the economy. 

As Japan's population has aged and begun declining, its economy has slowed and that led to deflation, or falling prices due to weak demand. Even with cheap credit, investment has lagged, stunting economic growth. 

In early 2013, the central bank launched what was dubbed a “big bazooka” of monetary easing, cutting interest rates and purchasing government bonds and other securities to help channel more money into the economy. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the benchmark interest rate was at minus 0.1%. The BOJ only began raising it in 2024, the first hike in 17 years, after inflation stabilized above its target of about 2%. 

The Japanese yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar and many other major currencies. So Japanese consumers and companies pay more now for imported food, fuel and other items needed to keep the world's fourth largest economy running. 

The strong appetite for investing in dollar-denominated shares of companies linked to the artificial intelligence boom has also pulled money out of the yen and into dollars.

So inflation has risen faster than wages, squeezing household budgets and raising costs for businesses. 

Higher interest rates will raise the value of the yen against the dollar, likely drawing investment into Japan seeking higher yen-denominated yields. That could push the yen higher, given that the BOJ has signaled it expects to continue raising rates. 

“The BOJ's stance towards rate hikes reflects the fact that inflation is becoming entrenched,” Kei Fujimoto, a senior economist at SuMi Trust, said in a commentary. “If drivers such as a further depreciation of the yen accelerate inflation going forward, it is possible that the pace of rate hikes will also increase accordingly.”

The planned rate hike was reported by Japanese media ahead of time, giving investors a head start on adjusting their portfolios. 

Initially, the yen weakened after Friday's rate hike, as the dollar rose to 157 yen, nearly twice its level in 2012 and near its highest level this year. 

Still, even small changes in interest rates can have a big impact. Analysts have forecast that higher rates in Japan may undermine an investment strategy known as the “carry trade.” That involves investors borrowing cheaply in yen and then using that money to invest in higher paying assets elsewhere.

Carry trades are lucrative when stocks and other investments are climbing, but losses can snowball if many traders face pressure to sell stocks or other assets all at once. 

Higher rates in Japan may also crimp demand for other assets, including cryptocurrencies. Last week, expectations about the rate hike caused the price of bitcoin, for example, to drop below $86,000. It had bolted to record highs near $125,000 in early October. Bitcoin was trading at about $88,000 early Friday.

Judging the timing and scale of changes to interest rates and other monetary policies is the biggest challenge for central banks, given the time it takes for such moves to ripple throughout the real economy and financial markets. 

Like the Federal Reserve, Japan's central bank struggles to balance the need to boost business activity and create jobs with the imperative of containing inflation. 

The BOJ held off on raising rates earlier given uncertainties over how U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs might hit automakers and other exporters. A deal setting U.S. duties on imports from Japan at 15%, down from the earlier plan for a 25% rate, has helped ease those concerns. 

Ueda, the BOJ governor, noted that with inflation at about 3%, real interest rates remain in negative territory.

STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A business jet crashed Thursday while trying to return to a North Carolina airport shortly after takeoff, killing all seven people aboard, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family, authorities said.

The Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.

Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, nor was the reason for the plane's return to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.

Federal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters and single and multi-engine planes. It wasn't clear if Biffle was piloting the plane at the time of the crash.

Biffle was on the plane with his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, according to the highway patrol and a family statement. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.

“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002. 




NASCAR said it was devastated by the news.

“Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” NASCAR said. “His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.”

The plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10 a.m., according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.

Golfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.

“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That's way too low,'” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”

The Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. It has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers and two pilots.

In 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.

“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That's who the Biffles were,” U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.

Wadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.

“He didn't know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”

The joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were “deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.”

With 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 U.S. crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024. 

Major air disasters around the world in 2025 include the plane-helicopter collision that killed 67 in Washington, the Air India crash that killed 260 in India, and a crash in Russia's Far East that claimed 48 lives. Fourteen people, including 11 on the ground, died in a UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky.

EDWARDS, Colo. (AP) — Ski resorts are struggling to open runs, walk-through ice palaces can't be built, and the owner of a horse stable hopes that her customers will be satisfied with riding wagons instead of sleighs under majestic Rocky Mountain peaks. It's just been too warm in the West with not enough snow.

Meanwhile, the Midwest and Northeast have been blanketed by record snow this December, a payday for skiers who usually covet conditions out West.

In the Western mountains where snow is crucial for ski tourism — not to mention water for millions of acres (hectares) of crops and the daily needs of tens of millions of people — much less snow than usual has piled up.

“Mother Nature has been dealing a really hard deck,” said Kevin Cooper, president of the Kirkwood Ski Education Foundation, a ski racing organization at Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada line.

Only a small percentage of lifts were open and snow depths were well below average at Lake Tahoe resorts, just one example of warm weather causing well-below-average snowpack in almost all of the West.

In Utah, warmth has indefinitely postponed this winter's Midway Ice Castles, an attraction 45 minutes east of Salt Lake City that requires cold temperatures to freeze water into building-size, palatial features. Temperatures in the area that will host part of the 2034 Winter Olympics have averaged 7-10 degrees (3-5 degrees Celsius) above normal in recent weeks, according to the National Weather Service.

Near Vail, Colorado, Bearcat Stables owner Nicole Godley hopes wagons will be a good-enough substitute for sleighs for rides through mountain scenery.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“It's the same experience, the same ride, the same horses,” Godley said. “It's more about, you know, just these giant horses and the Western rustic feel.”




In the Northwest, torrential rain has washed out roads and bridges and flooded homes. Heavy mountain snow finally arrived late this week in Washington state but flood-damaged roads that might not be fixed for months now block access to some ski resorts.

In Oregon, the Upper Deschutes Basin has had the slowest start to snow accumulation in records dating to 1981. Oregon, Idaho and western Colorado had their warmest Novembers on record, with temperatures ranging from 6-8.5 degrees (2-4 degrees Celsius) warmer than average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Continued warmth could bring yet another year of drought and wildfires to the West. Most of the region except large parts of Colorado and Oregon has seen decent precipitation but as rain instead of snow, pointed out NOAA drought information coordinator Jason Gerlich.

That not only doesn't help skiers but farmers, ranchers and people from Denver to Los Angeles who rely on snowpack water for their daily existence. Rain runs off all at once at times when it's not necessarily needed.

“That snowpack is one of our largest reservoirs for water supply across the West,” Gerlich said.

Climate scientists agree that limiting global warming is critical to staving off the snow-to-rain trend.

In the northeastern U.S., meanwhile, below-normal temperatures have meant snow instead of rain. Parts of Vermont have almost triple and Ohio double the snowfall they had this time last year.

Vermont's Killington Resort and Pico Mountain, had about 100 trails open for “by far the best conditions I have ever seen for this time of year,” said Josh Reed, resort spokesman who has lived in Killington for a decade.

New Hampshire ski areas opening early include Cannon Mountain, with over 50 inches (127 centimeters) to date. In northern Vermont, Elena Veatch, 31, already has cross-country skied more this fall than she has over the past two years.

“I don't take a good New England winter for granted with our warming climate,” Veatch said.

Out West, it's still far too early to rule out hope for snow. A single big storm can “turn things around rather quickly,” pointed out Gerlich, the NOAA coordinator.

Lake Tahoe's snow forecast over Thanksgiving week didn't pan out but Cooper with the ski racing group is eyeing possibly several feet (1-2 meters) in the long-term forecast.

“That would be so cool!” Cooper said.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — A jury found a Wisconsin judge accused of helping a Mexican immigrant dodge federal authorities guilty of obstruction Thursday, marking a victory for President Donald Trump as he continues his sweeping immigration crackdown across the country.

Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan with obstruction, a felony, and concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, in April. The jury acquitted her on the concealment count, but she still faces up to five years in prison on the obstruction count.

The jury returned the verdicts after deliberating for six hours. Dugan faces up to five years in prison when she's sentenced, but no date had been set as of late Thursday evening.

The case inflamed tensions over Trump's immigration crackdown, with his administration branding Dugan an activist judge and Democrats countering that the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.

Dugan and her attorneys left the courtroom, ducked into a side conference room and closed the door without speaking to reporters. Steve Biskupic, her lead attorney, later told reporters that he was disappointed with the ruling and didn't understand how the jury could have reached a split verdict since the elements of both charges were virtually the same. 

U.S. Attorney Brad Schimel denied the case was political and urged people to accept the verdict peacefully. He said courthouse arrests are safer because people are screened for weapons and it isn't unfair for law enforcement to arrest wanted people in courthouses.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“Some have sought to make this about a larger political battle,” Schimel said. “While this case is serious for all involved, it is ultimately about a single day, a single bad day, in a public courthouse. The defendant is certainly not evil. Nor is she a martyr for some greater cause.”




U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche praised the verdict on X, saying nobody is above the law, even judges.

According to a court filings that include an FBI affidavit and a federal grand jury indictment, immigration authorities traveled to the Milwaukee County courthouse on April 18 after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.

Dugan learned that agents were in the corridor outside her courtroom waiting for Flores-Ruiz. She left the courtroom to confront them, falsely telling them their administrative warrant for Flores-Ruiz wasn't sufficient grounds to arrest him and directing them to go to the chief judge's office.

While the agents were gone, she addressed Flores-Ruiz's case off the record, told his attorney that he could attend his next hearing via Zoom and led Flores-Ruiz and the attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.

Prosecutors worked during Dugan's trial to show that she directed agents to the chief judge's office to create an opening for Flores-Ruiz to escape.

An FBI agent who led the investigation testified that after agents left the corridor, she immediately moved Flores-Ruiz's case to the top of her docket, told him that he could appear for his next hearing via Zoom and led him out the private door.

Prosecutors also played audio recordings from her courtroom in which she can be heard telling her court reporter that she'd take “the heat” for leading Flores-Ruiz out the back.

Her attorneys countered that she was trying to follow courthouse protocols that called for court employees to report any immigration agents to their supervisors and she didn't intentionally try to obstruct the arrest team.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins 'Saturday in America' to discuss claims that deported U.S. veterans have been deported, how they are partnering with the TSA to identify illegal immigrants and threats against her life.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced on Friday that a post-doctoral researcher in the U.S. on a visa was charged with allegedly smuggling Escherichia coli (E. coli) into the country and making false statements about it.

Patel identified the post-doctoral researcher as Youhuang Xiang, but did not name the university involved in the case.

""This is yet another example of a researcher from China, given the privilege to work at a U.S. university, who then allegedly chose to take part in a scheme to circumvent U.S. laws and receive biological materials hidden in a package originating from China,"" Patel wrote on X.

""If not properly controlled, E. coli and other biological materials could inflict devastating disease to U.S. crops and cause significant financial loss to the U.S. economy,"" he added.

Patel applauded the FBI Indianapolis and Chicago field offices for their work on the case and thanked U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The FBI director also sent a warning to universities, urging them to be ""vigilant of this trend.""

""Ensure your researchers know that there is a correct and legal way to obtain a license to import/export approved biological materials, and it must be followed without exception,"" Patel said.

This is not the first time visa holders have been busted for allegedly smuggling materials for research since the Trump administration began its immigration crackdown in January 2025.

In November, the Justice Department announced that three Chinese national scholars had been charged with conspiring to smuggle biological materials into the U.S. while working at a university laboratory. They allegedly made false statements to CBP officers in order to import materials related to roundworms from China.

""Allegedly attempting to smuggle biological materials under the guise of ‘research' is a serious crime that threatens America's national and agricultural security,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.

The agency identified the suspects as Xu Bai, 28, Fengfan Zhang, 27, and Zhiyong Zhang, 30, who, like Xiang, were participating in J-1 visa academic exchange programs.

The three scholars, who conducted research at the University of Michigan's Shawn Xu Laboratory, allegedly received multiple shipments of concealed biological materials related to roundworms from a Chinese Ph.D. student in Wuhan, China, Chengxuan Han.

Han had previously worked at the university and was convicted of smuggling and making false statements before being removed from the U.S.

IVY LEAGUE BIO SMUGGLING SUSPECT WITH TIES TO AMERICAN ADVERSARY GETS BREAK FROM FEDERAL JUDGE

In February, Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist and Harvard University cancer researcher, was detained at Boston Logan International airport for allegedly smuggling frog embryos.

Petrova's attorney, Gregory Romanovsky, told Fox News that his client was bringing back the embryos at the request of a professor at a French lab that was collaborating with Harvard. He said the sample was picked up in Paris and was supposed to be brought to Harvard. Romanovsky added that Petrova did not know she needed to claim the embryos at customs.

""The individual was lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country,"" the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) wrote in a post on X about Petrova. ""A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits.""

Petrova was released from federal custody in June.

In this segment from ""American Kitchen,"" chef and restaurateur David Burke prepares three different sauces and his signature popovers. (credit: Fox Nation, ""American Kitchen"" 

Fox Nation's new culinary series ""American Kitchen"" has award-winning chef and restaurateur David Burke stepping into the spotlight with a dish that's festive, nostalgic and deceptively simple: his signature popovers.

The segment gives viewers an inside look at one of Burke's longtime restaurant favorites — a towering, golden popover baked until crisp on the outside and airy at the center. Though rooted in the classic Yorkshire pudding, Burke's version brings an unmistakably American twist.

""Popovers are basically Yorkshire puddings made from the drippings of roast beef. We're not making it that way today, but we have a great popover recipe,"" Burke tells viewers as he begins mixing the batter. The chef describes it as similar to a thick crêpe batter.

1 tbsp unsalted butter, softened 

3 eggs

1¼ cup milk 

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 tbsp melted unsalted butter 

½ tsp salt

1 tbsp mixed, minced, fresh herbs such as parsley, chervil, tarragon and chives

Burke's popovers are ""fluffy and crispy and delicious,"" the celebrity chef says. (Fox Nation)

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

2. Using softened butter, generously coat six 6 oz ramekins or large muffin cups. Set aside.

3. Combine the eggs, milk, melted butter and herbs in a medium bowl. Whisk to blend.

4. Combine the flour and salt in a separate bowl. 

5. Pour the egg mixture over the flour — and using a spoon, mix together until well blended. 

6. Fill the prepared ramekins or muffin cups three-quarters full. Place the filled ramekins on a baking sheet in the preheated oven, and bake for 15 minutes. 

7. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees, and continue to bake the Popovers for an additional 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and beautifully puffed. 

8. Remove them from the oven and serve warm.

A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a pro-Trump legal group seeking access to a trove of federal judiciary documents, including from a body overseen by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts – putting an end to a protracted legal fight brought by Trump allies seeking to access key judicial documents. 

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee assigned to the case earlier this year, dismissed the long-shot lawsuit brought by the America First Legal Foundation, the pro-Trump group founded by White House policy adviser Stephen Miller after Trump's first term; Miller, now back in the White House, is no longer affiliated with AFL.

McFadden ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, saying Thursday that two groups responsible for certain regulatory and administrative functions for the federal judiciary are an extension of the judicial branch, and therefore protected by the same exemptions to federal laws granted to the judiciary.

""Nothing about either entity's structure suggests the president must supervise their employees or otherwise keep them ‘accountable,' as is the case for executive officers,"" McFadden said.

(Ricky Carioti /The Washington Post via Getty Images)

The lawsuit by AFL was first reported by Fox News Digital earlier this year. It named both Chief Justice Roberts in his capacity as the official head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, and Robert J. Conrad, the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and sought access to a trove of judicial documents from both bodies under the Freedom of Information Act.

AFL accused both groups of performing regulatory actions that the lawsuit argued exceeded the scope of the ""core functions"" of the judiciary, and which it argued should subject the groups to the FOIA requests as a result.

AFL cited recent actions the Judicial Conference and Administrative Office had taken in 2023 to ""accommodate"" requests from Congress to investigate allegations of ethical improprieties by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and subsequently to create or adopt an ""ethics code"" for justices on the high court.

""Under our constitutional tradition, accommodations with Congress are the province of the executive branch,"" AFL argued.

""The Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are therefore executive agencies,"" and must therefore be overseen by the president, not the courts, they said.

McFadden disagreed, rejecting the group's argument that ""courts"" under FOIA refers only to judges. He concluded that both the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are components of the judicial branch and therefore exempt from FOIA.

""Indeed, if America First were right that only judges and ‘law clerks,' who ‘directly report to the judge,' count as part of ‘the courts,' numerous questions arise, and senseless line drawing ensues,"" he said in a memo opinion accompanying his order. ""Rather, FOIA's exclusion reflects that courts include a full range of ‘judicial adjuncts,' from ‘clerks' to ‘court reporters,' who perform ‘tasks that are an integral part of the judicial process.'"" 

Plaintiffs for AFL, led by attorney Will Scolinos, had argued in their lawsuit earlier this year that the Judicial Conference's duties are ""executive functions"" and functions they allege must be supervised by executive officers ""who are appointed and accountable to other executive officers."" 

Courts ""definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond resolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions,"" the group had argued.

The U.S. Judicial Conference is the national policymaking body for the courts. Overseen by the chief justice, it issues policy recommendations and reports to Congress as needed.

The Administrative Office for the U.S. Courts, meanwhile, operates under the guidance and supervision of the Judicial Conference. Its role is to provide administrative support to the federal courts on certain administrative issues and for day-to-day logistics, including setting budgets and organizing data, among other things.

The news comes as President Donald Trump, in his first year back in the White House, has relied heavily on executive orders to advance his agenda — a strategy that has accelerated implementation of campaign promises but also prompted a surge of legal challenges.

Trump's actions sparked hundreds of federal lawsuits this year alone, sending tensions skyrocketing between the executive branch and the courts, including federal judges who have blocked or paused some of Trump's biggest priorities in his second term.

President Donald Trump joins military officials at Dover Air Force Base in Kent County, Del., for the solemn transfer of two U.S. soldiers killed in ISIS ambush in Syria.

FIRST ON FOX: More than 100 House Republicans are demanding increased oversight of Syria as the U.S. prepares to repeal longstanding sanctions against the country.

Reps. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., and Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., are leading 134 fellow GOP lawmakers in calling for guarantees that the Syrian government will adhere to terms in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that set the stage for repealing those sanctions, while warning the U.S. needs to be prepared to reverse that if Syria falters on its progress.

""Many Members of Congress, committed to seeking peace, prosperity, and tolerance for religious minorities in the region, worked with the Trump Administration and House leadership to secure assurances that snapback conditions regarding the repeal of Syrian sanctions would be enforced if Syria does not comply with the terms highlighted in the repeal language,"" their joint statement read.

""The mass murder of the Syrian Christians, Druze, Alawites, Kurds, and other religious and ethnic minorities must be a thing of the past.""

They said Congress was committed ""to keeping a watchful eye on the new al-Sharaa Administration to ensure protections for religious and ethnic minorities in Syria.""

It comes after two members of the Iowa National Guard serving in Syria were killed in an ambush by an ISIS gunman.

Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa took power in Syria after the previous government led by Bashar al-Assad was toppled in 2024.

The new leader has sought friendlier relations with the West, even visiting the White House in November of this year.

The House GOP lawmakers said they ""look forward"" to being invited to Damascus themselves to see that his administration ""has created a safe environment for the religious and ethnic minorities historically persecuted in the region.""

""We look forward to confirming that these terms have not been squandered by the Syrian government–whether by their President or by rogue military officials–and seeing for ourselves that the al-Sharaa Administration has created a safe environment for the religious and ethnic minorities historically persecuted in the region,"" they said.

""As Members of Congress, we understand that the Syrian government's adherence to the conditions laid out in the NDAA's sanction repeal language is essential for lasting peace in the Middle East and Syria's prosperity.""

President Donald Trump signed the NDAA into law on Thursday evening.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she has ""absolutely"" no regrets about the 2020 MEALS Act connected to an alleged Minnesota fraud scheme, because it ""did help feed kids."" (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy)

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she has no regrets about supporting the MEALS Act during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the program becoming linked to Minnesota's alleged $250 million ""Feeding Our Future"" fraud scheme.

""Do you regret pushing for that bill, the MEALS Act? Do you think it led to the fraud?"" Nicholas Ballasy for Fox News Digital asked Omar on Capitol Hill.

""Absolutely not, it did help feed kids,"" Omar said.

Omar introduced the MEALS Act on March 11, 2020, to modify the Department of Agriculture's food and nutrition programs to allow certain waivers on requirements for school meal programs, including those that raised federal costs during school closures related to the pandemic.

Minnesota has faced scrutiny for alleged mismanagement of federal funds accessed through these waivers, including in distributing money for the ""Feeding Our Future"" program, which authorities believe to be the largest fraud scheme in the history of the pandemic.

The scheme allegedly exploited the U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision to waive many of its standard requirements for the Federal Child Nutrition Program during the pandemic, including relaxing its requirement for non-school-based distributors to participate in the program.

Fox News Digital first reported on the status of the fraud in July. FBI Director Kash Patel described it at the time as ""one of the worst"" in Minnesota history — and as of November 2025, more than 75 individuals have been charged in connection with the scheme, according to federal prosecutors.

President Donald Trump has recently announced a flurry of new actions to crack down and investigate fraud schemes in Minnesota, which he has assailed as a ""hub of money laundering activity,"" and cited as the basis of his decision to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of Somali migrants.

Senior Trump administration officials announced fresh investigations this month, including a new Treasury Department probe into how taxpayer dollars were allegedly diverted to the terrorist organization al-Shabaab, according to Secretary Scott Bessent. 

Trump and other officials have zeroed in on these alleged fraud schemes, arguing that the criminal activity is a result of mismanagement and ""incompetence"" from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and former vice presidential candidate.

""It's not surprising that the president has chosen to broadly target an entire community,"" Walz said of Trump's efforts, adding, ""This is what he does to change the subject."" 

Conspirators falsely claimed to have served millions of meals during the pandemic, but instead used the money for personal gain. They also are accused of fabricating invoices, submitting fake attendance records and falsely distributing thousands of meals from hundreds of so-called food distribution ""sites"" across the state.

Some of the individuals are part of Minnesota's Somali diaspora, which is the largest in the U.S., though the ringleader of the scheme is not.

""Stealing from the federal government equates to stealing from the American people — there is no simpler truth,"" FBI's special agent in charge, Alvin Winston, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Charging documents show that roughly 300 ""food sites"" in the state served little or no food, with the so-called ""food vendors"" and organizations fabricated to launder money intended to reimburse the cost of feeding children.

FBI officials told Fox News that the investigation and resulting trials and indictments continue to impact the state, and have already touched off legislative reform in Minnesota.

They added that the investigation into the fraud remains ongoing, and that additional charges are expected, though they did not immediately share more details.

""The egregious fraud unveiled in the Feeding our Future case epitomizes a profound betrayal of public trust,"" Patel told Fox News Digital earlier this year. 

""These individuals misappropriated hundreds of millions in federal funds intended to nourish vulnerable children during a time of crisis, redirecting those resources into luxury homes, high-end vehicles and extravagant lifestyles while families faced hardship,"" he added.

Trump suggested earlier this month that Omar, who fled Somalia as a child, ""shouldn't be allowed to be a congresswoman,"" prompting fierce backlash from some Democrats and from Minnesota's congressional delegation. 

Omar, for her part, said Trump's remarks were ""vile."" 

""His obsession with me is creepy,"" she said on social media. ""I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.""

ICE REJECTS OMAR CLAIM SON WAS PULLED OVER BY FEDS, PRESSED FOR CITIZENSHIP PROOF: ‘ABSOLUTELY ZERO RECORD'

Ballasy later pressed Omar about another incident dominating headlines.

""Congresswoman, the ICE director is saying now that your son was not pulled over by ICE. He's saying there's no evidence,"" Ballasy said to Omar on Capitol Hill.

The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rejected a viral claim from Omar that her son was pressed for proof of U.S. citizenship by agency personnel after stopping at a Minnesota Target over the weekend.

Omar had told CBS' Twin Cities affiliate that her son was subjected to a traffic stop-type encounter by ICE agents but was ultimately let go without further issue after he was able to produce a U.S. passport or passport card.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons pushed back on the assertion on Tuesday, telling Fox News Digital the incident never happened.

""How do they know that?"" Omar countered. ""How do they know that? Is he saying he has documentations of all the people they pulled over? Because we've been asking for that information. We haven't gotten it from them, so if ICE is confirming now that they collect data and refusing to provide it to members of Congress, then that's an interesting admission.""

""ICE has absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son,"" Lyons said.

""It speaks volumes that Congresswoman Omar is leveling this accusation with absolutely zero proof.""

Lyons called Omar's comments to the local outlet a ""ridiculous effort"" to demonize federal law enforcement. He also said her rhetoric contributes to a spike in threats against ICE personnel, citing a 1,150% increase in assaults and an 8,000% increase in death threats.

When asked to respond to Lyons' comment, Omar told Ballasy, ""Well, their crackdown has terrorized my community, so they need to stop.""

Officials brief the public on the investigation after Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Authorities have identified the suspect in Saturday's mass shooting at Brown University, which left two students dead and nine injured during a finals week review session, as the same man believed to have carried out the murder of a renowned nuclear scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology days later.

His name is Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, according to Providence police. 

He was found dead Thursday evening, authorities announced at a press briefing Thursday evening, after law enforcement officers in tactical gear were seen outside a storage unit linked to him in Salem, New Hampshire, for hours.

Neves-Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national and studied at Brown from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2001 to study physics, according to Brown President Christina Paxson. But he went on a leave of absence and ultimately withdrew in 2003.

A man with the same name was also terminated from a monitor position at the Instituto Superior Tecnico in Portugal in 2000, school records show. Authorities said they believe he is the same person as the killer. 

That's also the same university attended by the renowned MIT nuclear physics professor Nuno Loureiro, who suffered fatal gunshot wounds Monday at his home in Massachusetts, about 50 miles away from Brown.

Rhode Island authorities said that the investigation was being handled by Massachusetts authorities, who would speak for themselves. Leah B. Foley, the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, later confirmed that Neves-Valente was suspected in Loureiro's murder too.

""This evening at approximately 9 p.m., federal agents breached a storage locker in Salem, New Hampshire, in search of Claudio Neves-Valente, a Portuguese national we believed shot and killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor in Brookline, Massachusetts,"" she told reporters in a separate news briefing. ""Federal agents found Neves-Valente dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""

The Brown shooting happened around 4 p.m. Saturday at a finals week study session at the Barus and Holley Building on the eastern edge of campus. A motive remains unclear, and the investigation is ongoing, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters.

The building has long hosted physics and engineering classes, according to Paxson. 

""I think it's safe to assume that this man, when he was a student, spent a great deal of time in that building for classes and other activities as a Ph.D. student in physics,"" Paxson said. ""He has no current active affiliation with the university or campus presence.""

Detectives initially questioned a person of interest at a hotel outside town but ruled him out as a suspect, according to authorities.

Police spent days canvassing the neighborhood for surveillance video, which turned up images of a person of interest — a masked, stocky figure who stood around 5 feet, 8 inches tall and walked with an odd gait.

Susan Constantine, a body language expert, said one key marker is how the person of interest's right leg bows inward while his toe points outward as he walks.

Then they shared images of a second person who they said may have information about the person they were seeking and asked for the public's help identifying both of them.

Six of the surviving victims remained hospitalized as of Thursday afternoon in stable condition.

The two killed were identified as Ella Cook of Alabama and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov of Virginia.

The surrounding community spent days waiting for answers, with residents on edge after the school sent students home early in the wake of the shooting.

EXCLUSIVE — Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is turning to the power of President Donald Trump's endorsement to protect his fragile Senate majority and deliver another term for his most vulnerable incumbents.

In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Thune said he is working “very closely” with the White House ahead of the midterm elections, with the goal of minimizing the number of races in which Republicans are stuck in bruising Senate primaries.

“We've gotten him to endorse in a lot of these races around the country, some where there are primaries and some where there aren't, but could be,” Thune said. “And I think just having the president's endorsement, particularly for a lot of our incumbents, is a welcome development politically, and certainly should make the prospect of a primary a lot less and certainly a lot less expensive.”

THUNE KEEPS DOOR OPEN TO MIKE JOHNSON'S GOP-ONLY HEALTHCARE PUSH

Thune, responsible for steering a constellation of outside groups that will spend heavily to defend the GOP's Senate majority, cited the success he has had in clearing the primary field with Trump's help, naming North Carolina and Iowa, two GOP states where the incumbent is retiring, and Michigan, one of their top pickup opportunities.

But he acknowledged several races where he has been unable to get Trump off the sidelines, all but guaranteeing drawn-out primaries that could drain party resources and leave the eventual nominee bloodied.

At the top of the list is Texas, where four-term incumbent Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) is fending off two big-name primary challengers. Thune is also vouching for Republicans in safely red seats, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), whose vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges as he left office in 2021 has become political fodder for a crowded primary field.

Cassidy has since tried to repair his relationship with the president and hopes he will stay neutral.

“Where we've got incumbents running, we're endorsing and supporting them and hoping eventually the president comes around to the same position,” Thune said.

Trump's reluctance is grounded, in part, on his desire to pick a winner. He endorsed a record number of candidates in 2024, but often shies away from contests with no clear front-runner. In other cases, Trump's team rewards loyalty and has reportedly explored a possible primary challenge to Cassidy from Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA).

Trump's involvement has, in the past, hobbled Republicans' chances of capturing winnable seats, as was the case in Arizona last year or Georgia the cycle before, with general election losses blamed on his backing of flawed candidates.

But Republicans also understand the currency of Trump's endorsement with the party base and believe it is an undisputed help when it comes to Senate primaries.

Cornyn, crediting Thune with asking Trump to back him “numerous” times, told the Washington Examiner, “We all know that if he endorsed me in the primary, that the primary would be over, but he's got a lot of other important things to think about and do.”

Thune's outreach to the White House is taking place alongside the twin jobs of recruitment and fundraising. Thune was unable to land Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) in Georgia, opening up a mud-slinging, three-way primary for the seat of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), but the majority leader has found success elsewhere on the Senate map.

In New Hampshire, Republicans managed to recruit John Sununu, a former senator and heir to a family political dynasty, and could have a late candidate in Minnesota, where ex-sportscaster Michele Tafoya is leaning toward entering in the new year.

Thune will also benefit from an emerging truce between Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk, who briefly flirted with launching primary challenges against congressional Republicans after he was forced out as a White House adviser.

NETANYAHU SAYS HE WARNED AUSTRALIA OF POLICIES FUELING ‘ANTISEMITIC FIRE' MONTHS BEFORE SHOOTING

Instead, Thune said Musk is opening up his wallet for Senate Republicans and has already cut checks for one of their “main entities.” As majority leader, Thune is tasked with fundraising for the Senate Leadership Fund and its related super PACs.

“He's been very helpful,” Thune said. “I welcome that obviously, and the more he wants to do, the more we welcome.”

Thune added, “He's weighing in early, and I hope he weighs in often, in a big way, because the stakes I don't think could be higher in 2026.”

Thune has separately raised money for North Carolina's Michael Whatley, attending fundraisers for him and a slate of Senate incumbents in Ohio, Texas, and beyond. Whatley is running to replace Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and already has the endorsement of Trump.

“He's been all over,” Tillis said of Thune. “He's been to North Carolina already. It's a tough job, but he's absolutely focused on it.”

As of now, Thune is staying out of the primary in Georgia, though he said Kemp offers him updates on the state of the race on a “fairly regular basis.” He has also stayed neutral in Kentucky, where Republicans are choosing a successor to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the former majority leader.

Yet Thune has invited rare backlash as Republicans line up behind Sununu in New Hampshire's GOP primary.

Thune declined to say whether he urged Scott Brown, the other Republican candidate, to bow out, only offering up that “we always have very candid conversations,” but he has repeatedly nodded toward Sununu, a former House colleague, as the more electable of the two.

“I mean, Scott's a friend of mine,” Thune said. “And so, you know, those are always challenging, difficult circumstances when you get friends who are running. But for us, it's obviously going to be about who has the best chance of picking up a seat, which we think we have a really good shot at. And you know, clearly the polling right now is favorable for John Sununu.”

FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

In response, Brown took a veiled shot at Thune, claiming that “President Trump and his agenda are being served poorly by the GOP Senate.”

“Rather than meddling in competitive primaries, Republican senators should get off their rear ends and start passing President Trump's agenda into law, especially with the House majority hanging on a razor's edge,” Brown said.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill was great, but what's next in 2026? If there is a plan, no one knows what it is,” he added.

Thune's level of involvement in Senate primaries underscores the stakes of next year's election, where Trump stands to lose full control of Washington if either the House or Senate falls to Democrats.

Republicans feel somewhat comfortable that they will be able to retain the Senate, given the smaller set of competitive seats this cycle and the size of their 53-seat majority. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has managed to land a series of strong candidates who will force Republicans to spread resources across the map.

Schumer secured Gov. Janet Mills (D-ME) to challenge Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the most vulnerable Republican of the 2026 cycle, plus former Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina and former Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio.

There is even the possibility that Democrat Mary Peltola, who represented an at-large House seat until January, could run against Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) in Alaska. Sullivan is among the Republicans Trump has endorsed at the urging of Thune.

Thune is still holding out hope that Trump will engage in some of the more costly primaries and said he has discussed them all with Trump and his political team.

TRUMP PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS: NOTABLE ACTS OF CLEMENCY IN HIS SECOND TERM

“At some point, my assumption is, when he believes it's advantageous, politically advantageous to do it, maybe he'll weigh in,” Thune said.

But he argued Republicans are well-positioned to win next year and would emerge from the primary season with a slate of candidates who can maintain, or even grow, their majority.

“I still think, like with Georgia, when that primary is resolved, I still think that's going to be a competitive race,” Thune said. “You know, I think Mike Rogers is in a great spot in Michigan, and we talked about New Hampshire and Sununu — I think there are some opportunities on the map.”

Apart from candidates, Thune emphasized turning out Trump's base with a ground game that defies the voting slump common in a midterm year and a “record of accomplishment,” anchored to Trump's tax law, that Republicans plan to plaster on the airwaves.

THUNE CLEARS GOP MINIBUS LOGJAM WITH HELP FROM TRUMP

Thune declined to predict how many seats Republicans would have in the next Congress but said he tries to “underpromise and overdeliver.”

“You know, our goal, obviously, is to keep the majority, and anything we can do that would build on or expand on it would be frosting on the cake,” Thune added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The suspected gunman from Saturday's mass shooting at Brown University was found dead in Salem, New Hampshire, on Thursday evening.

FBI and law enforcement officials surrounded the suspected shooter as he hid in a storage unit following a nearly six-day manhunt for the suspect. Authorities believe the suspect carried out the Brown University shooting, in which two students were killed and nine were injured, and the fatal shooting of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro two days later.

The suspect was Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, a former Brown University student and Portuguese national, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez announced during a press conference on Thursday evening. Perez said the suspect died by suicide.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTSNeves Valente attended Brown University from fall 2000 to spring 2001, Brown University President Christina Paxson said. During this time, Neves Valente enrolled in Brown's doctoral physics program before taking a leave of absence and ultimately withdrawing. Neves Valente was only enrolled in physics classes at the university.

Neves Vilente entered the United States in August 2000 on an F-1 student visa and obtained U.S. legal permanent residency in 2017, according to authorities. Neves Vilente's last known address was in Miami.Loureiro was a professor of physics and of nuclear science and engineering at MIT and was also originally from Portugal. Perez confirmed that authorities believe Neves Valente and Loureiro attended the same university in Portugal.

TikTok inked a deal to sell its U.S. entity to a joint venture group with several American investors on Thursday, CEO Shou Zi Chew said in an internal company memo.

The deal follows months of the Trump administration attempting to reach an agreement with Chinese-based TikTok owner ByteDance to delay a Supreme Court ruling that forced the U.S. entity to divest from ByteDance or face a nationwide ban. The ruling upheld a law passed by Congress in 2024 that required the TikTok ByteDance divestment.

The deal involves an agreement between American companies Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-owned MGX to make up 45% of the joint venture, according to the memo. Existing ByteDance investors will make up 30.1% of the share, ByteDance itself will hold 19.9%, and the remaining 5% will be owned by other American investors in the joint venture.

President Donald Trump had signed multiple executive orders to allow TikTok to continue its U.S. operations as negotiations took place. The White House released details of a deal negotiated by Trump in September that included Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX in the agreement. That deal positioned Oracle to provide security operations on the app and includes Silver Lake and MGX as key leaders.

The security of the app has been of primary concern to U.S. leadership, as ByteDance is a Chinese-owned company.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Rescheduling Marijuana Is an Enormous Mistake","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/trump-marijuana-rescheduling-tax/685317/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:09:00 GMT","

Trump's executive order does little more than offer a tax cut to an industry that profits from addiction.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order today that committed the Justice Department to “rescheduling” marijuana. Although the order won't legalize pot, it will relax a series of restrictions that the federal government has long enforced. The move has a broad coalition of supporters, including many progressives, who say that it will enable medical research and alleviate mass incarceration. But in reality, rescheduling marijauna will do little more than hand a tax break to the corporations that spent millions of dollars lobbying for it.

The term rescheduling comes from the Controlled Substances Act, the legal foundation of America's drug-control regime. Under the CSA, controlled drugs (as opposed to uncontrolled ones, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen) are sorted into five schedules. For decades, the government has listed marijuana under Schedule I, which it reserves for drugs that have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. If the administration's plan goes through, marijuana will shift to Schedule III, a classification for drugs that have a medical use and a relatively low potential for abuse or dependence.

Jonathan Caulkins and Keith Humphreys: Legal weed didn't deliver on its promises 

Such a move would clearly defy the current science on marijuana. Contrary to conventional wisdom, pot—especially today's highly potent product—is both addictive and harmful. Figures vary, but the CDC estimates that about 30 percent of users become addicted. Moreover, research has linked marijuana use to a range of health risks. Recent meta-analyses have found strong and persistent associations between marijuana use and heart disease, stroke, lung disease, loss of IQ, psychotic events, and schizophrenia. Overdosing on marijuana may be all but impossible, but the drug is no less risky than mescaline and certain psychoactive components of khat, both of which the government classifies under Schedule I.

What about marijuana's medical applications? Forty states already permit doctors to recommend marijuana, and many Americans use it for a variety of issues, including insomnia and chronic pain. But scientific research simply doesn't back up the claim that marijuana is medicine. A recent paper published in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 30 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and concluded that “evidence from randomized clinical trials does not support the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for most conditions for which it is promoted.” Some marijuana patients may find relief because of a placebo effect or temporary intoxication. But the assertion that the cannabis plant can treat underlying pathologies is, at best, premature.

Trump and others at today's signing ceremony claimed that rescheduling marijuana will facilitate greater research, which may well show that pot has genuine medical uses. But even though Schedule III substances are generally easier to study than Schedule I substances, reclassifying marijuana won't make researching it much easier. This is because a law that Congress passed in 2022 to ease marijuana research already supersedes the restrictions imposed by the drug's schedule status, as the Congressional Research Service observed last year. If marijuana is rescheduled, Congress would need to modify or repeal that law to actually make researchers' lives easier—a heavier political lift. Alternatively, the administration could use its ample statutory power to facilitate marijuana research without rescheduling the drug.

Some may expect that rescheduling marijuana will help keep its users out of prison. Indeed, Schedule III drugs are generally subject to lighter penalties than are Schedule I drugs. But as the Congressional Research Service has noted, many of the penalties for marijuana offenses apply regardless of its schedule status, so reclassification won't soften pot-related laws, which result in few prison sentences anyway.

If rescheduling won't make research easier or keep people out of prison, why do it at all? One answer: money. Marijuana giants such as Trulieve, whose CEO has enjoyed significant access to the White House, stand to make billions from rescheduling thanks to an obscure provision of the tax code, 26 USC 280E. According to that clause, businesses cannot deduct from their taxes any expense accrued from trafficking a controlled substance. That's why some state-legal marijuana conglomerates pay effective tax rates of up to 70 percent. Importantly, though, 280E applies only to Schedule I and II substances. Move pot to Schedule III, and that tax burden vanishes. (This may explain why the administration didn't move marijuana to Schedule II even though it has repeatedly acknowledged that pot is dangerous.) In other words, an industry worth an estimated $34 billion is about to get an enormous tax cut.

Dan Brooks: The lonely new vices of American life

Marijuana companies have spent big to get to this point. They poured at least $1 million into Trump's inauguration, paid for a $1-million-a-plate dinner with the president, and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get MAGA influencers to advocate for rescheduling. Trump, a teetotaler whose brother suffered from addiction, has expressed plenty of skepticism about pot. But industry executives seem to have persuaded him: Some of them were reportedly on a call with the president when he said that he would move forward with rescheduling.

Today's executive order will empower an often-predatory industry that sells addictive and hazardous products to millions of Americans. Business is already booming: As of 2022, some 18 million Americans use marijuana daily or almost daily, and about 19 million have a “cannabis use disorder,” according to federal survey data. In addition to the previously mentioned health harms, these users are also at risk of social isolation, disconnection, and family struggles, as Annie Lowrey documented in The Atlantic in 2018.

Rescheduling will not lead to meaningfully more research, more healing, or more Americans avoiding prison. But it will likely lead to more people living with a dangerous habit. And it will certainly lead to more money for a massive industry. Big Marijuana is about to get even bigger.

When state funds are invested, the economics of operating a child care center change. So can the players.

Despite working in child care for 25 years, Crystal Romero has never seen a shift like the one taking place in New Mexico. “Twenty years ago, I had to furnish classrooms by shopping at thrift stores and yard sales, sanding things myself and repainting them,” she said.

Today, Romero and her husband own and manage Early Learning Academy, which consists of four child care centers in the Albuquerque region; they are under contract to add two more locations in 2026. With approximately 165 employees and close to 700 children enrolled, Romero says they are the highest-paying child care program in the state, and all employees are eligible for full benefits, including health, vision, dental, and retirement. In October, Romero announced, to cheers and shrieks, that every staff member would get a $5 an hour raise.

All this is possible because of New Mexico's investment in child care, first through American Rescue Plan dollars, then through higher child care subsidies and now with the state's universal child care program. (The program isn't perfect, as subsidies aren't reaching all the families that qualify and the state may not have enough providers to meet demand, but it's a laudable effort.)

The state's subsidy pays for full-time child care, even if children only show up for three or four days each week. By studying her average daily attendance records, Romero is able to enroll more students while keeping her staffing levels the same, and without going over the state-mandated teacher-to-child ratios. She keeps floaters on hand to allow her staff to take breaks, so in the rare event of more students showing up, she can still provide appropriate cover.

As part of its community program, ELA hosts an annual event where every child gets a brand new pair of shoes. “Nikes and Air Jordans,” she explained. “We gave away 500 at this location,” she says, of the original Early Learning Academy in west Albuquerque. This year, they sponsored a Make-A-Wish request for a child in their community with a brain tumor and paid $8,500 to send the family to Disney World. Her staff lounges have free snacks and leather recliners, and photos along the wall where she and her husband are pictured at local university basketball games and community events on behalf of their organization.

Child care has long been an industry known for slim margins. But an influx of government funding can change the business model of any sector — and New Mexico isn't the only state changing the economics of owning and operating a child care center.

Vermont has invested in child care through Act 76, which has increased the number of families qualifying for subsidies and raised the subsidy rate for providers. Massachusetts has set aside $475 million per year for grants to child care providers. Connecticut created the state's Early Childhood Education Endowment to expand access to child care, funded by up to $300 million annually from the state budget's surplus with the option to add funds each year.

“As more public money becomes available in child care, that is going to be what attracts different players,” said Elliot Haspel, a senior fellow at Capita. (Haspel is also a fellow at the Better Life Lab at New America, where I work.) “It does pose a policy challenge — how does [providing child care] square with profit-seeking?”

Increased state funding has done more than raise salaries at local child care centers. It's also attracted an influx of interest from businesses. As child care providers grow their profit margins, they are now able to increase their spending and become more lucrative customers. And as child care centers become more profitable and have opportunities to expand, they also become more attractive to investors.

Specifically, child care centers have attracted increased interest from private equity. Private equity groups pool financial resources to invest in a business with the intention of maximizing profit, often in the short term. They have long had a role in child care, but became a more prominent force in 2022, when the American Rescue Plan directed significant government funds to keep child care centers afloat. Today, investor-backed chains control between 10 and 12 percent of the licensed child care market, and typically target higher-income populations so they can charge higher fees.

Profit-seeking isn't inherently at odds with child care, and can be one of the drivers in adding more spaces for children or jobs for educators. In Romero's case, it has motivated her to expand her business and pay staff competitive wages.

But watchdog groups like the Open Markets Institute have been critical of rapid growth spearheaded by certain investor-backed chains, with their heavy emphasis on maximizing enrollment and minimizing operational costs. Both factors can come at the cost of quality care.

In some instances, private equity groups have purchased an ownership stake in child care centers and then proceeded to dismantle them to promote profitability. The groups sell the land and then require the center to lease it back, while pushing for maximum enrollment and cutting staff hours and student spots, leading to high turnover.

As their share of the market has grown, the investment-backed chains have also taken on a larger role in influencing policy. A 2022 New York Times article found that even though a consortium of investor-backed chains publicly supported the child care provisions in Build Back Better, during meetings with senators and staff, the group “reacted skeptically” to a plan to subsidize tuition for middle- and upper-income families, and raised concerns in its financial disclosures that the legislation would lead to limited profits.

Another group whose interest in child care has grown alongside the state and federal funding is the educational technology sector. EdTech businesses, some of which have the support of venture capital, have proliferated in the last five years, according to Elizabeth Leiwant, VP of public policy and research at Neighborhood Villages, an early education systems change organization based in Massachusetts.

“As providers have more money to spend, they are looking for ways to do things more effectively and efficiently,” Leiwant said.

Some EdTech offerings, like bookkeeping software, can be extremely beneficial to providers, Leiwant says, many of whom got into the work because of their background in early childhood education and may be less prepared or thrilled to manage the business aspects. But Leiwant has also been contacted by venture capital funders looking for feedback on technology that provides educational curriculum for classrooms, or targeted advertising to connect parents to available child care spots. Leiwant notes that there were far fewer such EdTech products — and certainly less venture capital interest — before substantial government funds created a new market. “It led EdTech firms to pay attention to this space in a new way,” she says.

Across the country, most child care providers make slim profits. Workers make low wages; the average pay is $15 an hour, and most states still put only a small amount of funding into their child care systems. What Romero is doing — expanding, making money, paying her staff well, and providing generous benefits — is a relatively new phenomenon, and not everyone is thrilled about it.

Romero gets “lots of flack from people who say you are using state money to get rich.” But she believes these critiques uphold a double standard. Child care is one of many industries, including health care and education, that receive state or federal funding. Plus, child care work is disproportionately performed by women of color and at wages so low that workers often experience food insecurity and qualify for public benefits. It is often underrepresented in media coverage and in popular culture, TV, and movies. It wasn't until the Covid-19 pandemic that child care began showing up in news stories as a necessary part of a functioning economy. “I don't see any other industry that receives state money that feels like they can't do well,” Romero says.

But as child care gets more attention and becomes more profitable, advocates hope to create guardrails to prevent profit-seeking at the expense of quality and stability. One solution comes from Massachusetts. When Massachusetts made its annual $475 million in child care grants permanent, Leiwant helped create restrictions on larger for-profit firms. These include caps on the amount of grant funding that large for-profit programs can receive (1 percent of total grant funds), requirements to spend a certain percentage on staff salaries and benefits to ensure decent wages, and a willingness to enroll children who receive the state subsidy at every program site.

Massachusetts' rules do not distinguish between groups that are investor-backed, like the largest child care chains, and private for-profit institutions with multiple locations, like Romero's (in New Mexico). The only distinction is the size: the guardrails are in place for child care providers that have 10 or more locations in the state. Leiwant said that one of the largest child care and aftercare providers in the state, the YMCA, is a nonprofit organization.

The goal is that providers can make a living, Leiwant said. “But first you should be paying attention to the quality of the program you are providing and having quality education. If you make money on top of that, it's great - but that is the last rung, not the first rung.”

Ultimately, Romero is proud of the work she has done and the expansion of Early Learning Academy. She believes the quality of the product is what drives their success. For her, compensating and taking care of her staff is the top priority, and the substantial state funding allows her to do that.

“Staff come first before our families, because if they are happy and treated right and feel safe and secure, that is going to be received with our children and families when they enroll,” she said. If not, it leads to burnout. “If the staff are not happy, the families will reap the consequences, and I can't have it.”

Let's fix the two massive efficiency sinks in American life.

The first thing that struck me about this year's most talked-about policy book, Abundance (perhaps you've heard of it?), is a detail almost no one talks about.

The book's cover art sketches a future where half of our planet is densely woven with the homes, clean energy, and other technologies required to fill every human need, liberating the other half to flourish as a preserve for the biosphere on which we all depend — wild animals, forests, contiguous stretches of wilderness.

It's a beautiful ecomodernist image, suggesting that protecting what we might crudely call “nature” is an equal part of what it means to be prosperous, and that doing so is compatible with continued economic growth. It's a visual rebuke to those who argue that we must choose between the two.

How would we do it?

The US and its peer countries today are spectacularly rich — unimaginably so, from the vantage of nearly any point in human history — and it might be tempting to think that we have grown enough, that our environmental crisis is so grave that we should save our planet by shrinking our economy and freeing ourselves from useless junk. I understand the pull of that vision — but it's one that I think is illusory and politically calamitous, not to mention at odds with human freedom. A world where economic growth goes into reverse is a world that would see ever more brutal fighting over shrinking wealth, and it is far from guaranteed to benefit the planet.

Yet that doesn't change the essential problem: Climate change and the destruction of the natural world pose grave immediate threats to humans, and to the nonhuman life that is valuable in itself. And we are not on track to manage it.

It's not easy to reconcile these realities, but it is possible and necessary to do so in a way that's consistent with liberal democratic principles. Instead of deliberately shrinking national income, we can seek out the areas of greatest inefficiency in our economy and chart a path that gets the most economic gain for the least environmental harm. If growing the economy without torching the planet is feasible in principle — and I think it is — then we should fight for it to grow in the best direction possible.

• Meat and dairy, plus our extreme dependence on cars, are two huge efficiency sinks: they produce a big share of emissions and devour land, and they aren't essential to economic growth or human flourishing.

• Shifting diets toward plant-based foods and freeing up land could act like a giant carbon-capture project, buying time to decarbonize.

• Reducing car dependence would slash transport emissions, make land use more efficient, and make Americans healthier and safer — without sacrificing prosperity.

We'll need to build out renewables at breakneck speed and electrify everything we can, of course. But some of the most powerful levers we have to decouple economic growth from environmental impact challenge us to do something even harder — to begin outgrowing two central fixtures of American life that are as taken-for-granted as they are supremely inefficient: our extreme dependence on meat and cars.

Changing those realities is so culturally and politically heretical in America that this case is almost never made in climate politics, but it deserves to be made nonetheless. And doing so will require examining the trade-offs that we too often treat as defaults.

It's probably not news to you that cars and animal-based foods are bad for the planet — together they contribute around a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions both globally and within the US. Animal agriculture also devours more than a third of habitable land globally (a crucially important part of our planetary crisis) and 40 percent of land in the lower 48 US states, while car-dependent sprawl fragments and eats into what's left at the urban fringe.

We obviously need food and transportation, but meat and cars convert our planet's resources into those necessities much more wastefully than the alternatives: plant-based food, walking, public transportation, and so on. And in a climate-constrained economy that still needs to grow, we don't have room to waste. Beef emits roughly 70 times more greenhouse gases per calorie than beans and 31 times more than tofu; poultry emits 10 times more than beans and four to five times more than tofu. Mile-for-mile, traveling by rail transit in the US emits about a third as much as driving on average, while walking doesn't emit anything.

For all that resource use, animal agriculture and autos are not indispensable to our economy or to our continued economic growth.

The entire US agricultural sector, plus the manufacture and servicing of automobiles, make up a tiny share of our GDP; like other advanced economies, America's is largely service-based, employing workers in everything from health care to law firms to restaurants and retailers like Amazon and Walmart. Of course, agriculture, energy, and manufacturing are foundational to everything else in the economy — without farming, Chipotle and Trader Joe's would have no food to sell, and more importantly, we would starve. To say that agriculture isn't a major part of our economy isn't to say that it's not really important to having an economy.

But it is, unsurprisingly, those foundational parts of the economy that disproportionately drive resource use and environmental impact — and because they're a small share of the economy, we have a lot of room to change their composition without crashing GDP.

If we shifted a chunk of our food production away from meat and dairy and toward plant-based foods, for example, the already economically tiny ag sector might shrink somewhat. Meanwhile, we would save a lot of greenhouse gas emissions and land, and it would be reasonable to infer that the food service and retail sectors, which make up a significantly larger share of US GDP than agriculture does, would function all the same because we'd still eat the same number of calories and buy the same amount of food. With less meat consumption, the US might even have a significantly bigger alternative protein sector, with cleaner, better jobs than farm or slaughterhouse work.

Which is not to say there wouldn't be any losers in the short run — job losses and stranded capital in industries that are regionally concentrated and politically powerful. But those transitions can be managed, just as we have been managing the transition away from fossil fuels.

This is exactly what decoupling — the idea that we can grow richer while decreasing emissions and other environmental impacts — looks like. The US, like a lot of other developed countries, has largely managed that in carbon emissions from energy consumption, which have fallen around 20 percent since 2005, even as the economy has grown about 50 percent in real terms. Agriculture has become more efficient, too, but it still lags on decoupling; the sector's emissions are mostly flat or rising. Road transport tells a similar story: cars and trucks have gotten more efficient, but total emissions from driving are still stuck near their mid-2000s levels.

Admittedly, it's easier to decouple for energy than it is to change the way we eat or move around. A megawatt is a megawatt, whether it's produced by coal or solar, while switching from steak to beans is not the same experience. But learning how to use resources more efficiently is, after all, a big part of how wealthy nations have become wealthy, including in these tougher sectors. Despite how inefficient our food system still is, the US has managed to significantly decrease how much land it uses for farming over the last century, while producing much more food. We could go much further if we weren't so reliant on eating animals.

Now, you might be thinking, so what if American GDP doesn't depend on meat and cars? People like them, and they're part of what it means to be rich and comfortable in the modern world. And you would have a point. No one would say that heating and cooling shouldn't exist (well, the French might) just because they use a lot of energy and make up a tiny share of the economy.

But every choice we make in the economy is a trade-off against something else, and everything we spend our limited carbon budget on is a choice to forgo something else. Our task is to decide whether high meat intake and extreme car dependence are worth that trade — whether they make up for their toll on the planet in contributions to our economy or to our flourishing as human beings.

We can start with animal agriculture, because however bad for the planet it looks on first impression, it's actually worse.

Estimates of the livestock industry's greenhouse gas emissions range from around 12 to 20 percent globally; in the US, it's around 7 percent (despite the lower percentage, per capita meat consumption is substantially higher in the US than it is globally — it's just that our other sources of emissions are even higher). But those numbers don't account for what climate scientists call the carbon opportunity cost of animal agriculture's land use.

Recall that farming animals for food takes up a massive amount of land, because we need space for the animals and for the crops needed to feed them. Meat and dairy production hogs 80 percent of all agricultural land to produce what amounts to 17 percent of global calories. Much of it could instead be rewilded with climate-stabilizing ecosystems, which would support biodiversity and also happen to be among our best defenses against global warming because of how good they are at sequestering carbon.

How big would the impact be? The canonical paper on the carbon opportunity cost of animal agriculture finds that a 70 percent reduction in global meat consumption, relative to projected consumption levels in 2050, would remove the equivalent of about nine years of carbon emissions, while a global plant-based diet would remove 16 years of emissions; another study concludes that a rapid phaseout of animal agriculture could effectively freeze increases in all greenhouse gases over the next 30 years, and offset most carbon emissions this century.

It's worth pausing to appreciate just how miraculous that is. Freeing up even some of the land now used for meat and dairy turns it into a negative-emissions machine better than any existing carbon capture technology, giving us a carbon budget windfall that could ease the phaseout of fossil fuels and buy time for solving harder problems like decarbonizing aviation. This is as close as it gets to a free lunch, as long as you're willing to make it a vegan lunch.

We can think of car dependence as the other big resource black hole in US society.

Transportation is the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and cars are the biggest source within that category, accounting for about 16 percent of all US emissions. Globally, gas-powered cars are in retreat — a very good thing for both climate change and deadly air pollution, though the US is increasingly falling behind peer countries in auto electrification.

Still, if it were just a matter of swapping out gas-guzzlers for EVs, auto transportation wouldn't be an obstacle to truly sustainable growth. But EVs alone aren't a silver bullet for repairing the environmental problems of cars.

One influential paper on the subject found as much in 2020, concluding that, at any realistic pace of electrification, EV growth wouldn't be enough to meet climate targets, and even with universal adoption, EVs aren't emissions-free. They take lots of energy to make — especially those heavy batteries — and an enormous amount of steel and critical minerals. These are scarce inputs that we also need to decarbonize the electric grid and build other green infrastructure.

That isn't to say that EVs aren't better for the climate than gas-powered vehicles — they absolutely are. But as the lead author of that paper wrote in an accompanying commentary, “The real question is, do you even need a car?”

The problem is not the existence of cars, but our total dependence on them. In most of the country, Americans have no other convenient transportation options. And remember, we're trying to optimize for the least resources used for the most economic upside. Organizing society around the movement of hundreds of millions of two-ton metal boxes is… obviously not that, and the reasons why go well beyond emissions from the cars themselves. The car-dependent urban form that dominates America forces us to build things spread far apart — sprawl, in other words — which forces us to use more land. As of 2010, according to one estimate, the US devoted a land area about the size of New Jersey to parking spots alone.

Our cities and suburbs occupy less than one-tenth as much land as farming — about 3 percent of the US total — but they still matter for the environment, fragmenting the habitats on which wildlife and ecosystems depend. Plus, housing in the US is sprawling enough that some exurban communities stretch across outlying rural counties, occupying an unknown additional share of land that's not included in the 3 percent figure.

Perhaps most damaging from an economic perspective, the sprawling development pattern that car dependence both enables and relies upon has driven the misallocation of valuable land toward low-density single-family homes, driving our national housing crisis. Cars are by no means the sole reason behind the housing shortage, but without mass car dependence, it would be vastly harder to lock so much of our land into inefficient uses. Meanwhile, Americans pay dearly for car dependence in the form of costly infrastructure and tens of thousands of traffic deaths each year.

Urbanists sometimes like to say that the US prioritizes cars over people — that an alien arriving on Earth would probably think cars are our planet's apex species. In some senses, that's certainly true — the privileges that we've reserved for cars make it harder to meet the basic human need of housing, which makes us poorer and diminishes the agglomeration effects that make cities dynamic and productive. One widely cited paper estimated, astonishingly, that housing supply constraints, especially in the highest-productivity cities, cut US economic growth by 36 percent, relative to what it would have been otherwise, from 1964 to 2009. Imagine how much higher the GDP of Los Angeles would be if it doubled its housing stock and population and, with its freeways already maxed out, enabled millions more people to get around on foot, bike, and transit.

And, of course, since autos and animal products are both very high in negative externalities, the benefits of reducing our collective dependence on them go well beyond the strictly economic or environmental. Americans would spend less money managing chronic disease and die fewer premature deaths (in the case of meat and dairy, probably, and in the case of cars, undoubtedly). We would torture and kill fewer animals (and fewer people would have to spend their working lives doing the killing). We would help keep antibiotics working, and we might even prevent the next pandemic.

The growth that brought us industrial modernity is an awe-inspiring thing: It's given us an abundance of choices, and it's made obsolete brutal ways of life that not long ago were a shorthand for prosperity, like coal mining or the hunting of whales to make industrial products. Prosperity can be measured concretely in rising incomes and lengthening lifespans, but it's also an evolving story we tell ourselves about what constitutes the good life, and what we're willing to trade to get it.

With cars, at least, we might have the seeds of a different story. Dethroning the automobile in car-loving America remains a grueling, uphill battle, and I wouldn't necessarily call myself optimistic, but transportation reform flows quite naturally from the changes we already know we need to make to solve our housing shortage.

The best way to reduce the number of miles we drive is to permit a greater density of homes anywhere where there's demand for it, especially in the parts of cities that already have the affordances of car-free or car-light life (and it's definitely not all or nothing — I own a car and can appreciate its conveniences, while driving maybe a quarter as much as the average American). The housing abundance movement is winning the intellectual argument necessary to change policy in that direction. And maybe most crucially, we know many Americans want to live in these places — some of the most in-demand homes in the country are in walkable neighborhoods. If we make it easy to build lots of housing in the centers of growing cities, people will move there.

But animal agriculture, barring a game-changing breakthrough in cell-cultivated meat, is a somewhat different story. It's one thing to show that we're not missing out on economic growth by forgoing meat, and quite another to persuade people that eating less of it isn't a sacrifice — something the plant-based movement hasn't yet figured out how to do. At bare minimum, we ought to be pouring public money into meat alternatives research. There's no shortage of clever policy ideas to nudge consumer choices in the right direction — but for them to succeed rather than backfire terribly, people have to want it. And to that end, I'd encourage anyone to discover the abundance of a low- or no-meat diet, which is an easier choice to make in most of America than escaping car dependence.

Right now, our livestock and our automotive herd squander the resources that could be used to make industrial modernity sustainable for everyone. We grow less than we might because we waste so much on cars and meat. Reclaiming even a fraction of that capacity would make the math of decoupling less brutal, freeing us to build whatever else we can imagine. There's no guarantee we'll make that choice, or make it in time — but the choice is ours.

Business Insider Edition 

The United States has sharply criticised South Africa over what it described as the detention, harassment and “doxxing” of American officials linked to a controversial refugee programme involving white Afrikaners, escalating a diplomatic row that has already drawn international attention.


        In a strongly worded statement published by the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in South Africa under the header “Doxxing and Harassment of American Officials by the South African Government,” Washington said it condemned “in the strongest terms” the actions taken against U.S. personnel carrying out humanitarian duties.
    


        The statement follows an earlier report by Business Insider Africa that Kenyan nationals were caught in the middle of a growing dispute between South African authorities and U.S.-linked actors over the Afrikaner refugee programme, which has become a flashpoint in broader political tensions between Pretoria and Washington.
    


        According to the report, the South African Department of Home Affairs conducted a raid in Johannesburg following intelligence reports that some Kenyans had recently entered South Africa on tourist visas but were found performing paid work at a centre handling applications for ""so-called Afrikaner refugees.”
    


        After the raid, seven Kenyan nationals found working illegally at the facility processing refugee applications for the United States were deported and barred from entering South Africa for five years
    


        According to the U.S. government, South African authorities recently detained American officials engaged in lawful humanitarian work, while also publicly releasing their passport details.
    


        Washington described the disclosure of personal identifying information as “an unacceptable form of harassment” that placed its officials in danger.
    


        “This can only be seen as an attempt to intimidate U.S. government personnel in South Africa on official business,” the statement said, adding that the United States would not tolerate threats or intimidation directed at its officials or citizens operating legally abroad.
    


        The U.S. warned that failure by the South African government to hold those responsible accountable would lead to “severe consequences,” signalling that the issue could spill into broader diplomatic or policy responses if unresolved.
    


        According to the CNN, two US government employees were briefly detained during the raid, though South Africa's statement said no American officials were arrested
    


        The episode deepens already strained relations between South Africa and the United States, which have faced friction in recent years over foreign policy alignment, human rights positions, and Pretoria's stance on global geopolitical conflicts.
    


        The Afrikaner refugee programme has become particularly sensitive, with South African officials pushing back against narratives they argue misrepresent domestic conditions, while Washington frames its involvement as humanitarian.
    


        For now, the South African government has yet to issue a detailed public response to the U.S. statement.
    


        However, the unusually direct language from Washington suggests growing impatience and raises the stakes for bilateral relations at a time when both countries are navigating an increasingly tense global diplomatic environment.

Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.

In the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was ""looking to control costs.""

The Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.

""They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,"" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.

Nvidia and Capital One discussed ""AI factory and neo-clouds,"" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.

Neoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.

The Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.

Large companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.

""We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,"" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.

""Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,"" an AWS spokesperson said. ""It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.""

Capital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.

The documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.

When that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was ""using old data to reach outdated conclusions,"" noting that ""AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.""

In this article

Palo Alto Networks will migrate key internal workloads to Google Cloud as part of a new multibillion-dollar agreement, the companies announced on Friday.

The companies said the deal is an expansion of their existing strategic partnership and will deepen their engineering collaboration. 

Palo Alto Networks is now using Google's Gemini artificial intelligence models to power its copilots, and it is also using Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform, according to a release.  

""Every board is asking how to harness AI's power without exposing the business to new threats,"" BJ Jenkins, president of Palo Alto Networks, said in a statement. ""This partnership answers that question.""

Palo Alto Networks, which offers a range of cybersecurity products, already has more than 75 joint integrations with Google Cloud and has completed $2 billion in sales through the Google Cloud Marketplace.

As part of the new phase of the partnership, Palo Alto Networks customers will be able to protect live AI workloads and data on Google Cloud, maintain security policies, accelerate Google Cloud adoption and simplify and unify their security solutions, the companies said. 

Shares of Palo Alto Networks were up 1% on Friday. Google shares were mostly flat. 

""This latest expansion of our partnership will ensure that our joint customers have access to the right solutions to secure their most critical AI infrastructure and develop new AI agents with security built in from the start,"" Google Cloud President Matt Renner said in a statement.

In this article

Oracle's stock jumped 7% Friday after the cloud provider joined a group of investors slated to lead TikTok's U.S. operations. 

In a memo to employees Thursday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the social media company's U.S. division will be run by a joint venture that includes Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The deal is expected to close on Jan. 22.

The agreement prevents the popular social platform from getting banned after President Joe Biden signed a law requiring a divestiture of the company's U.S. unit due to national security concerns. 

President Donald Trump extended the deadline for a deal on multiple occasions and signed an executive order in September that approved a potential plan for China-based ByteDance to divest.

Oracle will be tasked with auditing and validating that TikTok follows ""agreed upon National Security Terms,"" according to the memo. 

China has not publicly confirmed the investment deal, but reports in Chinese state media suggest that the deal will go through, CNBC's Eunice Yoon said. State-run media reported comments from a pro-Beijing professor, who said the deal was in line with the country's laws and is ""not a sale of the algorithm.

Oracle's cloud-based computing centers will also house sensitive U.S. data.

In a note to clients on Friday, Evercore ISI called the news a ""nice win"" for the cloud company with upside potential. 

""We continue to believe the recent pullback represents an interesting entry point with investors that can take a 6-12 month view,"" analysts wrote. 

The deal comes at the end of what has been a chaotic 2025 for the cloud provider and a massive pullback in shares in recent months over concerns about its AI infrastructure spending. 

Earlier this week, shares slumped on a report that talks over a $10 billion data center deal with Blue Owl Capital had reached a standstill. That exacerbated concerns over the massive — and potentially risky — funding plans behind the artificial intelligence data center buildout. 

Oracle shares are up 8% this year and have pulled back more than 20% over the last month.

In this article

UnitedHealth Group on Friday released the first results from a sprawling independent audit of its business practices and committed to a wide range of steps to track and implement improvements in three specific areas. 

The health-care giant said it has adopted 23 ongoing ""action plans"" to put in place and monitor recommended improvements, with oversight by its internal audit and advisory services team. Around 65% of those actions will be complete by the end of 2025, while 100% of those plans will be finished by the end of March next year. 

The results come as private insurers try to rebuild trust with the American public after fierce, pent-up backlash over their practices and the broader U.S. health-care system. Critics say insurer business tactics have made it harder for some patients to access and pay for care. The company owns UnitedHealthcare, the nation's largest and most powerful insurer. 

While the announcement on Friday is a step toward improving the business, it's unclear how much it will change the public's view on the company and the broader industry.

UnitedHealth in July announced that two independent consultancies had launched a third-party review of its business policies and performance metrics. That same day, UnitedHealth also confirmed that it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices. 

The independent audit marked one of Steve Hemsley's earliest steps as CEO after he took the reins in May, following the abrupt departure of Andrew Witty.

""We hope that you see these assessments as a commitment to setting a new standard of transparency for the health care marketplace, as we believe that you and every person who engages with our health system deserves to understand how we go about our work,"" Hemsley said in a letter Friday. 

""We know that our actions and decisions have significant impacts on patients, care providers and the broader health system, and we are determined to hold ourselves to the highest standard,"" he added. 

FTI Consulting reviewed UnitedHealthcare's approaches to risk assessment operations within its Medicare Advantage programs, which refers to how the company rates the health status of members in those privately run plans. The firm also examined the company's care services management policies, procedures and processes. 

Consulting firm the Analysis Group also assessed the policies and processes of Optum Rx – the company's pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM  – for ensuring prescription discounts from drug manufacturers are ""accurately collected and distributed to clients."" PBMs are middlemen who negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, create lists of medications covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions.

Hemsley said the firms determined that the company's policies and practices are ""robust, rigorous and generally sound; and, in many respects, industry leading."" But he noted that they also provided recommendations for improvements. 

For example, a review by the Analysis Group found that OptumRx has ""implemented a comprehensive and well-structured framework that governs all stages of manufacturer discount administration."" 

The assessment identified at least 25 distinct ""controls"" in place that collectively lower the risk of miscalculating or delaying the distribution of discounts owed to clients and collecting incomplete discounts from drugmakers, said Aaron Yeater, managing principal at the Boston office of Analysis Group, in a document Friday. 

The review found ""no deficiencies or need for corrective measures"" but recommended ways to enhance Optum Rx's practices. That includes strengthening Optum Rx's escalation processes for resolving nonpayment and dispute cases through communication with manufacturers. Among UnitedHealth's action plans is to develop a formal policy that supports procedures for addressing those cases. 

Yeater noted that he examined the business processes and not the legal and regulatory issues the company is facing with its PBM. 

Meanwhile, FTI Consulting found that UnitedHealth scored better than its peers by several measures when it came to Medicaid and Medicare. But the firm pointed to slow decision-making on authorizations, documentation issues and the need to better address the findings raised in regulatory audits. 

Beyond these first results, UnitedHealth said it will share the findings from a review of medical records of diagnosis codes during the first quarter. The company will also report on its processes to craft what it calls ""evidence-based medical policy"" by the middle of the year. 

Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down more than 35% for the year after it suspended its 2025 forecast amid skyrocketing medical costs, announced the surprise exit of Witty and grappled with the probes into its Medicare Advantage business. It followed a difficult 2024 marked by a historic cyberattack and public blowback after the murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, Brian Thompson.

Correction: UnitedHealth Group had a difficult 2024. An earlier version misstated the year.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller had a ""strong interview"" for the central bank chair position with President Donald Trump in which the two discussed the labor market in depth and how to jump-start job creation, according to senior administration officials.

The interview took place in the president's residence and concluded shortly before Trump addressed the nation on the economy Wednesday night. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino also attended the interview.

Blackrock's Rick Rieder will be interviewed at Mar-a-Lago for the Fed chair job the last week of the year, the officials said. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is no longer a candidate for the job, they also said.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, the favorite for the job in prediction markets, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh have previously been interviewed by Trump.

The officials said the conversation about jobs with Waller showed concern and criticism was misplaced that the president was seeking a candidate based on the criteria that the next Fed chair would bow to the whims of Trump on rates. They said the president's interest in the interviews with candidates had been broad-based across a series of economic issues.

Last week, Trump told The Wall Street Journal he thought the Fed chair should consult with him on rates. ""It doesn't mean—I don't think he should do exactly what we say,"" the president said. ""But certainly we're—I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.""

In the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump praised Waller in response to a reporter's question. ""I think he's great. I mean, he's been a man who has been there a long time, somebody that I was very involved with."" Trump interviewed Waller in 2019 and nominated him to be a Fed governor.

Despite the praise of Waller and the positive description of the interview, there was no indication that he was a favorite candidate for the job. It was only clear that the process of interviews continues with the obvious implication that the president had yet to make a decision. The officials said the interviews are following a ""highly organized process.""

In his speech Wednesday, Trump said, ""I will soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further.""

In an interview on Wednesday with CNBC at the Yale CEO Summit in New York, which took place before he met with the president, Waller said he believed rates could decline by 50 to 100 basis points below the current level because he expects inflation to drop and was concerned about the weak job market.

Waller dissented in July when the Fed kept rates on hold, a move that seemed prescient with the Fed then starting cuts in September and taking rates down another two times before year-end.

No details were provided of what the two men discussed about jobs, but the conversation suggests Trump could be more focused on the issue. The recent November jobs report showed a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.6% from 4.4% in September while payroll growth slowed to a crawl.

In his speech Wednesday, Trump said that ""there are more people working today than at any time in American history. And 100 percent of all jobs created since I took office have been in the private sector.""

Since January, the private sector has added 687,000 jobs and the government has lost 188,000 as part of sweeping job cuts by the administration.

On a lighter note, the president was said to have been seriously impressed when informed that Waller could dead lift 350 pounds.

In this article

U.S. crude oil prices were stable on Friday after President Donald Trump told NBC News that he will not rule out war with OPEC member Venezuela. 

""I don't rule it out, no,"" Trump told the news outlet in a phone interview. He declined to say whether overthrowing President Nicolas Maduro is his goal. 

""He knows exactly what I want,"" Trump told NBC. ""He knows better than anybody.""

The oil market right now is not indicating a major risk of a supply disruption. U.S. crude oil rose 29 cents, or 0.5%, to $56.44 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was up 31 cents, or 0.5% to $60.31. 

The U.S. benchmark fell to four year lows earlier this week as traders priced in the possibility of a peace agreement in Ukraine that would bring more Russian crude into a well supplied market.

Trump has been ramping up pressure on Maduro. He ordered a blockade of sanctions oil tankers off the South American nation's coast after seizing a vessel a last week. 

The U.S. has staged a major military buildup in the Caribbean and launched deadly strikes on boats that it claims are trafficking drugs to the U.S. The legality of those strikes is disputed and has been the subject of scrutiny by Congress. 

Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler. Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler.

There's a new leader in college sports — the University of Texas at Austin.

The school's athletic program, which tops CNBC's valuation rankings, is now worth $1.48 billion, 16% more than last year. In fiscal 2024, the program generated aggregate revenue of $332 million, more than any other school and 23% more than in the previous year, according to figures from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database at Syracuse University. The biggest source of revenue for UT's athletic program was $137 million from donors, according to the database. That's 53% more than in 2023. 

Last year's most valuable athletic program, Ohio State University, fell to No. 2, with a value of $1.35 billion, 2% more than a year ago. The program's revenue fell 9%, to $255 million, in fiscal 2024 due to a 20% decrease in ticket revenue, according to the Knight-Newhouse database. The drop occurred primarily because the school had two fewer home football games during the 2023-24 season than it did in 2022-23, an Ohio State spokesperson told CNBC.

CNBC's 75 most valuable athletic programs for 2025 are worth a combined $51.22 billion, 13% more than the value of the top 75 in last year's rankings. This year's combined programs had aggregate revenue of $11.84 billion in fiscal 2024, 8% more than 2024's programs posted the previous year, according to the Department of Education's Equity in Athletics Data Analysis and the Knight-Newhouse database. 

The value of college athletic programs is being fueled in large part by escalating media rights deals for football and basketball. The Big 12 conference, for example, began a six-year television extension of its media rights agreements with Fox and ESPN this season that will pay the conference an average of $380 million a year, nearly double what it got from its previous media rights deal, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. 

Beginning in 2026, ESPN will pay an average of $1.3 billion a year for the College Football Playoff, more than twice its previous deal, according to JP Morgan. And starting in 2026, Notre Dame's new four-year media rights deal with NBC will pay the school an average of $50 million a year, more than double the amount in its current agreement with the network, according to JP Morgan and a person knowledgeable about the deal who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

There's more room for growth. 

""College football is at the apex, right below the NFL, and will eventually go to a 16-team playoff [from 12], because that's where the money is,"" said Patrick Crakes, principal of Crakes Media, a media rights and distribution advisory firm that works with media companies, sports teams and leagues.

As CNBC reported a year ago, private capital is interested in tapping into college sports. The schools could use outside capital to fund the class action settlement in which the NCAA and the Power Five conferences will pay $2.78 billion in back damages, over a 10-year period, to thousands of Division I athletes. 

Outside capital could also fund the more than $20 million a year in revenue share the schools will now pay to their current student-athletes. Opendorse — a company that helps facilitate name, image and likeness, or NIL, deals for college athletes — projected in a report that the NIL market for college athletes will grow from $1.17 billion in 2024 to $2.55 billion in 2026.

As CNBC reported, earlier this month the University of Utah announced it will be the first college athletic department to accept private equity money.

A deal that would have UC Investments, which manages assets held by the University of California system's endowment and pension funds, pay the Big Ten $2.4 billion for 10% of the conference's media and sponsorship rights stalled in October. The New York Times reported in November that UC Investments put the deal on hold due to continued public opposition from two of the conference's schools, the University of Michigan and the University of Southern California. 

The rankings exclude military academies and are limited to schools that participate in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision, or FBS, which tend to attract top players.

The revenue figures were obtained from the Department of Education's Equity in Athletics Data Analysis and the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database for fiscal year 2024. 

To compile the values of college athletic programs, CNBC consulted AthleticDirectorU, which has an expansive database of college athletic program financials and information. AthleticDirectorU's publisher, Jason Belzer, has advised universities on NIL and private equity deals. Belzer is a venture partner for Sequence Equity, a private-capital firm that has pitched a plan to make the playoffs of the NCAA's Division I Football Championship Subdivision, or FCS, a separate entity outside the purview of the NCAA. 

CNBC's list reflects the current enterprise value of each program, starting with a base revenue multiple of four for all institutions, and then adjusting the multiple for variables, including conference affiliation, estimated NIL spend, school subsidies, number of alumni and other factors that can catalyze revenue growth and profitability.

To determine the rankings, CNBC and Belzer incorporated the expertise of several people knowledgeable about athletic program valuations who asked not to be named in order to freely discuss details of the programs.

Figures in this article and the chart reflect CNBC's rounding of the numbers.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.

Noem posted on X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program ""to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.""

On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.

Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.

Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Chief of Police Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.

""There's no longer a threat to the public,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. 

Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.

""In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,"" she wrote on X.

The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.

The program is a lottery. Visas are randomly allocated to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Wall Street could be in for a wild trading day when options on four types of securities expire: index options, single stock options, index futures and index futures options. ""Quadruple witching"" day happens just four times a year and this one's set to be a monster.

Here's what to know:

Nike shares were down sharply in premarket trading after the sportswear giant warned sales would fall in the current quarter and executives pointed to continued challenges in China.

Nike said it expects fiscal third-quarter revenue to drop by a low single-digit percentage, with modest growth in North America, and forecast gross margins will shrink 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points, including a 3.15 percentage point hit from tariffs.

Investors were hoping for more but it wasn't all bad news out of Nike. Strong North America sales helped offset the plunge in China and results came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. CEO Elliott Hill called it the company's ""middle inning of our comeback.""

President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that directs federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century.

Once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the order moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification: substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.

Shares of cannabis companies fell following the announcement, likely from worries of new competition.

Separately, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University had been granted one.

Wall Street expected dealmaking to roar back after President Trump's return to office this year but the reality was closer to fits and starts, reports CNBC's Lillian Rizzo.

There were roughly 13,900 transactions in the U.S. through Dec. 15 this year, compared with 15,940 deals during the same period in 2024, the last year of the Biden administration, according to Pitchbook data.

Executives and bankers had prepared for a looser regulatory environment and a robust pipeline for mergers and acquisitions. Instead, they were met with tariff uncertainty, high interest rates and an unpredictable process for winning over the Trump administration.

The year did include high-profile megadeals — Union Pacific's proposed acquisition of Norfolk Southern for $85 billion; Netflix's proposed takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $72 billion; the pending take-private of Electronic Arts.

There's a new leader in college sports — the University of Texas at Austin. The school's athletic program topped CNBC's valuation rankings and is now worth $1.48 billion, 16% more than last year.

In fiscal 2024, the program generated aggregate revenue of $332 million, more than any other school and 23% more than in the previous year, according to figures from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database at Syracuse University, up 53% from 2023.

Last year's most valuable athletic program, Ohio State University, fell to No. 2 with a value of $1.35 billion, 2% more than a year ago. Read the full 75-school ranking here.

In this article

BioMarin Pharmaceutical said on ⁠Friday it would acquire Amicus ‍Therapeutics ‍for about $4.8 ‍billion, expanding its presence in rare metabolic diseases.

The ‍drugmaker will ‍pay $14.50 per share for Amicus, a premium of 33.1% to the stock's last close. Shares of Amicus surged 30%, ‌while ‌BioMarin rose nearly 5% in ​premarket trading.

The deal strengthens BioMarin's portfolio with Amicus' approved genetic disorder treatments, including Galafold, an oral drug for Fabry disease, which is ⁠caused by a faulty gene that leads to a buildup of fatty substances in cells.

Amicus also markets a combination therapy, Pombiliti and Opfolda, for Pompe disease, a genetic condition in which a complex sugar called glycogen builds up in the body's cells.

Amicus also has U.S. rights to DMX-200, a potential treatment for a type of kidney disease known as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

BioMarin intends to finance the deal through a combination of cash on hand ‍and about $3.7 billion of non-convertible debt financing.

The company's total ‌cash and investments at the end ⁠of September 30 were about $2 billion.

The acquisition, which is expected to close in the second quarter ‍of 2026, will add revenue immediately after the transaction closes, BioMarin said.

The deal is also expected to add to adjusted profit in the first 12 months after close and be substantially accretive beginning ⁠in 2027, the company said.

Options are showing that Bitcoin is heading into the final weeks of 2025 under intense pressure, with around $23 billion in contracts set to expire next Friday that threaten to amplify already-elevated volatility.

The amount accounts for more than half of all the open interest on Deribit, the largest Bitcoin options venue.

Oops, something went wrong

Standard Chartered has significantly tempered its bullish price projections for Bitcoin over the next five years.

“I still see Bitcoin continuing to print fresh all-time highs going forward, but I think the pace will be slower than previously expected,” Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick said in an email last week.

Kendrick said in a Dec. 9 note that Standard Chartered was forced to reassess its price targets amid Bitcoin's recent price action. The asset has fallen as much as 36% from a record price of about $126,000 reached in October to about $80,000 in a drawdown sparked by U.S. tariff threats on China and drying liquidity.

Kendrick said in the note that the drawdown was “normal,” citing two similar corrections since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved trading of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024. However, the correction means Standard Chartered's previous near-term targets are wrong, he said.

Standard Chartered now sees Bitcoin finishing this year at $100,000, down from its previous prediction of $200,000. For 2026, it now sees Bitcoin finishing the year at $150,000, down 50% from $300,000 earlier.

Meanwhile, the firm has dropped its 2027 target from $400,000 to $225,000 and its 2028 target from $500,000 to $300,000. In 2029, its target is also no longer $500,000 but $400,000.

Standard Chartered is predicting a slower pace of Bitcoin growth, as it no longer expects purchases from digital asset treasury companies. These companies were able to accumulate Bitcoin without diluting shareholders by trading at a premium to their underlying holdings. Now, as valuations shrink, Kendrick said he expects to see these companies consolidate.

With treasury companies out of the equation, Kendrick said in the note that the primary Bitcoin price driver left is ETF flows. He added that the Bitcoin ETF market would likely take several years to mature as investor access broadens and investment committees make up their mind.

Meanwhile, Standard Chartered rejected any suggestion that Bitcoin is at the beginning of an extended correction in line with its historical four-year cycle. The cycle has seen the asset experience a boom and bust once every four years, correlating with the so-called “halvening.” The halvening refers to a programmed event that halves the new Bitcoin supply roughly every four years.

“This time is really different,” Kendrick said, suggesting that ETF buying would be able to support the asset's price.

Bitcoin was most recently trading at $87,000.

ZUG, Switzerland, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Ethereum's market is one of the most competitive corners of DeFi, and it has virtually no ""meme""-driven trading activity. This makes it easier to measure the more organic market volumes, where low fees and the trading of core assets such as ETH, BTC (wrapped), and stablecoins are predominant.

This week, Curve Finance delivered one of the clearest signals that it stands among the top players in this scene.




Top Ethereum DEXs by fees (30-day view, DeFiLlama)

According to DeFiLlama's data, Curve now ranks among the top Ethereum DEXs in terms of fees metrics over the past 30 days, overtaking other long-standing leaders in the space.

One thing that is particularly notable here is how much the scale has shifted. Around this time last year, Curve accounted for roughly 1.6% of all DEX fees charged on Ethereum. Today, its share stands at about 44%, marking the most significant overturn in fee dominance that DeFi has seen in 2025.

These figures highlight rising trader activity and fees paid by users on Curve. But it should be noted that this is not a reflection of profit or yield distributed among liquidity providers or the protocol itself.

There are several factors that drove this growth. Trading activity around Curve's native crvUSD stablecoin has increased sharply, pushing volumes higher and reinforcing the protocol's position as a core venue for on-chain stablecoin liquidity. By trading volume (24H), crvUSD has moved into the top 5 stablecoins, superseded only by major leaders like USDT and USDC. This reflects its rapid adoption and growing role in on-chain liquidity.

At the same time, integration with Yield Basis has concentrated the largest on-chain Bitcoin liquidity in DeFi on Curve, with the protocol now hosting three of the deepest on-chain BTC liquidity pools used by Yield Basis protocol. The pools rank at the very top by both TVL and depth, well ahead of BTC pools on other DEXs.

Here's how Michael Egorov, founder of Curve Finance, has commented on this shift: ""DeFi users are increasingly prioritising sustainable revenue models over short-term speculation. We're seeing a clear move away from hype-driven trading and towards protocols with transparent economics and real yield. This change in long-term behaviour is reshaping where liquidity and volume ultimately settle.""

Oops, something went wrong

Top cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced that it has delisted 9 altcoins as the year rounds up.

The affected cryptocurrencies are BUZZ, DARK, FROG, GORK, MIRAI, PERRY, RFC, SNAI, TERMINUS and their delisting is effective immediately.

Binance encourages anyone who wishes to engage with these digital assets to carry out due diligence to avoid being scammed.

On December 19, Binance published a notice to users informing them that it will no longer have BUZZ, DARK, FROG, GORK, MIRAI, PERRY, RFC, SNAI, TERMINUS on its Alpha platform.

It went further to explain that each of these cryptocurrencies failed to adhere to Binance Alpha's standards. Hence, the company's decision to delist each one of them.

For the exchange, making such a move reflects its dedication towards fostering innovation and transparency while prioritizing user protection.

“Please do your own research before making any trades for the aforementioned token to avoid any scams and ensure safety of your funds,” Binance wrote on its website.

In the meantime, sales of the aforementioned tokens on Binance Alpha will still be allowed, even though they've been removed from the platform.

Such delistings are common on Binance. During routine checks, any token that fails to meet the platform's standards is removed.

On the other hand, it occasionally lists new tokens believed to have prospects and long-term value. Exactly a year ago, WazirX's WRX was pulled down from Binance, causing the token to plunge.

Just recently, Binance released a transparency report, providing updates on its listings across Alpha, futures, and spot markets.

It also talked about community alerts for fraudulent third-party impersonation, offering a reward of up to $5 million for evidence against these fake intermediaries.

To uphold a transparent and structured listing framework, token teams are required to submit listing applications exclusively through their official channels.

This is not to say that Binance is authorizing external brokers or intermediaries to negotiate or influence listing outcomes.

For a very long time, these individuals or firms misrepresented themselves as Binance-affiliated facilitators.

October and November have already shaken the crypto market well. Between broken hopes and brutal retreats, these two months have blown hot and mostly cold. And now December doesn't hold back: a new wave of volatility hits investors, already on edge. The gift season doesn't seem to have found its way to digital wallets yet.

The overall capitalization of the crypto market just dropped below 3 trillion dollars, more precisely to 2.93 trillion dollars, its lowest level since April. Since its October peak estimated at 4.4 trillion dollars, over 33% of value has evaporated. Over the same period, BTC has lost ground but remains more resilient than altcoins. On Thursday, bitcoin was trading around $88,200, while other cryptos sank faster.

XRP, Solana, and Cardano record marked declines, sometimes close to 20% over the week. In an alarming tweet, Michaël van de Poppe mentions a “possible capitulation” on altcoins. According to him, a short collapse could precede a quick rebound, but caution is advised.

The macroeconomic climate also weighs heavily. The Bank of Japan announced a rate hike to 0.75%, an event watched closely by global markets. While this monetary tightening worries, bitcoin nevertheless rose 2.3% after the announcement. A sign of strength? Maybe. But nervousness remains palpable.

Fear is omnipresent on social networks. As Santiment indicates in their December 13 analysis:

Commentary is mainly showing fear after Bitcoin bounced to $90.2K yesterday, and then quickly retraced to $84.8K. Bearish commentary like #selling, #sold, #bearish, or #lower are notably higher across X, Reddit, & Telegram.

Beyond the ambient stress, an unexpected dynamic emerges: Bitcoin ETFs register a significant influx of capital. In a few days, more than 457 million dollars have been injected into these regulated investment vehicles. This renewed institutional interest suggests some actors are already betting on a near recovery of BTC.

Giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, far from being timid, are strengthening their positions despite the volatility. This trend contrasts with outflows observed in other products backed by Ethereum or Solana. Altcoins, still too exposed to risk, struggle to reassure traditional investors.

On the retail trader side, conflicting signals abound. For some, widespread fear is precisely the right moment to enter. Santiment highlights: prices tend to move opposite to social consensus. An overly pessimistic crowd would therefore be an imminent accumulation signal for the most patient.

But not everything hinges on bitcoin. XRP ETFs have just crossed the billion dollars mark in cumulative value. A strong signal that shows interest in alternative cryptos also resists the storm. Enough to nourish, even in the current uncertainty, hope for a rebound extended to the entire crypto market.

As the crypto markets enter the weekend, volatility is slowly rising. The Bitcoin price is consolidating above the pivotal support zone after absorbing the short-term sellers, and XRP continues to maintain its stability. After weeks of volatility and forced liquidations, several large-cap altcoins are now trading in zones that historically coincide with late-stage sell pressure, not the start of fresh downtrends. Chainlink LINKUSDT, Sei SEIUSDT, and Sui SUIUSDT are all flashing similar signals on higher timeframes. 

Momentum Is Compressing, Not Collapsing

Recent volatility has pushed several large-cap altcoins into deeply compressed momentum zones, but the structure does not resemble the start of a fresh breakdown. Instead of accelerating lower, price action is stabilizing as selling pressure fades and longer-term holders step in near key support levels.

On the weekly timeframe, all three assets are trading with RSI readings in the low-to-mid 30s:

Historically, these momentum levels tend to appear after prolonged selling, when downside acceleration slows, and marginal sellers are largely exhausted. Importantly, RSI is not signalling strong bullish momentum yet—but it is showing that there is little left to sell aggressively at current levels.

This distinction matters. Bear markets usually begin with momentum expanding lower, not compressing near long-term support.

Supply Is Absorbing—Why This Matters Going Forward

Price action across LINK, SEI, and SUI shows a clear shift from distribution to stabilisation. Despite recent volatility, none of these assets has broken decisively below their higher-timeframe support zones. Pullbacks attract steady demand, suggesting the long-term holders will absorb the remaining supply, rather than panic sellers.

This behaviour is inconsistent with the early stages of a bear market, where support typically gives way under sustained pressure. Instead, fading sell intensity points to a base forming, improving the odds of recovery attempts over further aggressive downside. While 2026 outcomes will still depend on macro conditions and leadership from Bitcoin and Ethereum, the current structure favours consolidation and upside exploration rather than continued distribution.

The Bottom Line!

The current signals across LINK, SEI, and SUI point less toward an exhausting trend and more toward distribution. With momentum compressed, key supports holding, and sell pressure fading, the probability favors stabilization and recovery. A gradual grind higher or range expansion appears more likely than a sharp breakout, as markets remain sensitive to macro cues and Bitcoin's direction.

Looking into early 2026, outcomes will be shaped by liquidity conditions and broader risk appetite. If macro stability improves and Bitcoin holds structure, these large-cap altcoins are positioned to recover meaningfully from current levels, even if a full return to all-time highs remains a longer-term process rather than an immediate outcome.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","State of the Blockchain 2025: Market Review & Outlook","https://www.coindesk.com/research/state-of-the-blockchain-2025","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:33:38 GMT","

2025 was defined by a stark divergence: structural progress collided with stagnant price action. Institutional milestones were reached and TVL increased across most major ecosystems, yet the majority of large-cap Layer-1 tokens finished the year with negative or flat returns.

This report analyzes the structural decoupling between network usage and token performance. We examine 10 major blockchain ecosystems, exploring protocol versus application revenues, key ecosystem narratives, mechanics driving institutional adoption, and the trends to watch as we head into 2026.

2025 has been a year of divergence between structural progress and market performance. While regulatory clarity and institutional validation have reached new milestones, price performance has stagnated. L1 tokens are a primary example, broadly underperforming despite a backdrop of accelerating political approvals and expanding institutional products.

Performance among leading ecosystem tokens has been weak, with almost every asset - excluding one or two outliers - posting negative yearly returns.

This underperformance contrasts with network fundamentals: seven of the eight selected ecosystems recorded Total Value Locked (TVL) growth in native token terms and four of the eight experienced a rise in daily activity.

However, this growth was not reflected in the base layers. Chain Fees were down for all eight ecosystems, confirming a clear disconnect in value accrual to the chains themselves.

Instead, value flowed to the application layer: six ecosystems saw app revenue growth, with ecosystems like Near posting a +190% increase. Despite L1s capturing 90% of the market share (in terms of market cap), they now only collect 12% of fees (down from 60% in 2025). This trend highlights the market's maturing selectivity, where value capture is increasingly isolated to successful apps rather than automatically accruing to the underlying Layer 1 token.

The macro backdrop for 2026 is structurally supportive, driven by expected rate cuts that should lead to reduced borrowing costs and theoretically, boost risk on assets liquidity.

The divergence between declining chain fees and growing app revenue in 2025 suggests that market structure could be heading toward an inversion in value capture. As L1 security and throughput become commoditized, capital will increasingly flow to the application layer to find returns, confirming that selective, application-level narratives will remain the primary sources of performance.

Bitcoin entered 2025 on a wave of optimism, buoyed by expectations of a more favorable regulatory stance under President Donald Trump. That enthusiasm, however, was short-lived, as renewed trade tensions - particularly tariffs on China and other major partners - reintroduced macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility.

After surging to a record high of $126.2k - a rally propelled by unprecedented adoption, particularly among corporate treasuries - Bitcoin has since staged a sharp retreat as risk appetite wanes and investors reassess the shifting economic landscape. The asset is currently trading near $90.3k, down 3.45% year-to-date. Despite this price drawdown, Bitcoin's market dominance has actually strengthened, climbing from 58.1% to 59.4%, indicating a flight to quality within the crypto sector even amidst the downturn.

Much of Bitcoin's price appreciation from April to October was driven by the accelerating adoption of BTC by publicly listed companies. As the influx of new corporate entrants began to plateau, the momentum behind the rally lulled. This dynamic was starkly visible between August and November, where the slowdown in public company accumulation coincided directly with the easing of upward price pressure.

Bitcoin's price momentum also began to stall in August, a shift likely influenced by long-term holders selling their assets. According to Whale Alert, since July, 25 whale addresses that had been inactive for more than a decade moved coins on-chain, suggesting profit-taking or repositioning by early holders. This reintroduction of long-dormant BTC into the market added incremental sell-side pressure at a time when broader demand was already softening.

One of the most dominant narratives of 2025 is Bitcoin's decisive break from its traditional four-year market cycle. This divergence signals a fundamental shift in the asset's market structure, driven by the surge in institutional participation. As professional trading strategies and deep-pocketed capital increasingly dictate market flows, Bitcoin's price action appears to be evolving beyond the predictable, halving-driven rhythm of previous cycles.

2025 saw the institutional adoption of Bitcoin shift from spot ETFs to public treasury companies. While spot BTC ETF flows remained strong (with U.S. spot ETFs seeing an aggregate net inflow of $23.6B), public treasury companies saw a larger inflow for the last five consecutive quarters.

Today, 196 public companies have disclosed Bitcoin BTC$87,031.54 holdings. These digital asset treasury (DAT) companies typically aim to increase their BTC held per share through several mechanisms: issuing debt, acquiring BTC at a discount via locked-token arrangements with foundations or counterparties, or leveraging their existing crypto through lending and derivatives strategies.

However, the mNAV ratio - which measures a company's market capitalization relative to its net asset value-has fallen below 1.00 for most DATs, including Michael Saylor's Strategy. This deterioration limits their ability to issue new shares to buy more BTC. In certain edge cases, it may even incentivize companies to sell BTC to repurchase their own shares, reversing their intended accumulation strategy.

Despite these constraints, we expect both the number of public treasury holders and their aggregate BTC holdings to continue rising over time. At the same time, we anticipate larger, more capital-efficient players will begin acquiring smaller or less efficient DATs as the sector consolidates.

On the ETF side, while recent large outflows have coincided with local market tops, we expect continued net inflows in the coming year as access to digital assets broadens. The integration of crypto ETFs into mainstream platforms operated by large asset managers, including firms such as Vanguard, reduces friction for institutional allocators and expands the potential investor base.

Currently, ETFs and DATs collectively hold about 12.8% of the total BTC supply, with global ETFs accounting for 7.42%. This reflects a 35% increase from the start of the year.

Assuming a similar growth rate in institutional adoption of BTC, we expect the combined ETFs and DATs holdings to reach 15% - 20% by the end of 2026 - continuing to absorb BTC at a rate that exceeds new supply, resulting in a higher institutional share of free float.

KPIs to monitor:

While BTC has managed to perform well at times in 2025, it has largely underperformed Gold in a year marred with macroeconomic uncertainty. The BTC/Gold price ratio has declined from 36 to 21 while the market cap ratio has fallen from 10% to 6%.

Analyzing the correlation between BTC and other major asset classes such as SPX, NASDAQ and gold, Bitcoin has behaved increasingly like a high-beta risk asset, not a clean hedge, especially in short horizons. This divergence was most pronounced during the peak of the tariff crisis, with BTC–SPX correlation exceeding 0.80 while BTC-gold correlation declined to roughly –0.75, suggesting Bitcoin was increasingly trading as a risk-sensitive asset rather than a defensive hedge during that period.

We expect Bitcoin to continue like a high-beta risk asset, rather than a hedge next year, demonstrated by higher correlation to risk assets (>0.6 with SPX) and weaker correlation with gold during stress regimes.

KPIs to monitor:

Bitcoin's relatively long block times and limited throughput mean it remains an imperfect solution for everyday peer-to-peer payments - especially in a market increasingly dominated by stablecoins and high-performance alternative Layer-1s. While Bitcoin's on-chain transaction count has dropped from the Ordinals-driven highs seen in 2024, activity remains meaningfully elevated compared to prior years. Network fees have also eased from last year's peak, a trend that likely reflects softer transactional demand rather than major efficiency gains from protocol upgrades. Today, most miner revenues are generated from the block subsidy while transaction fees account for just 1% of the total revenue.

With each halving reducing the block subsidy - now at 3.125 BTC - miners are increasingly reliant on sustained Bitcoin price appreciation to remain profitable. In practice, Bitcoin's price would need to reliably double every four years just to keep miner revenue flat, an increasingly difficult assumption. Reflecting this pressure, roughly 15 publicly listed mining companies have announced partial or full pivots toward AI-focused data-center infrastructure over the past two years. Among the world's top ten miners, 7 of them are already relying on AI-related revenue to weather the bear market, with seven generating income from AI/HPC operations and the remainder in planning stages.

The underlying economics highlight why this shift is accelerating. Despite network hashrate reaching a record 1.1 ZH/s in October, Bitcoin's price declined to around $81,000, pushing hashrate prices below $35/PH/s - well below the median public miner cost of roughly $44.8/PH/s reported in third-quarter filings. As a result, even the most efficient operators are operating near breakeven, with payback periods stretching beyond 1,200 days and financing costs continuing to rise.

Against this backdrop, the role of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem-particularly emerging BTC Layer-2 solutions and the growing BTCFi sector-becomes even more critical. These innovations have the potential to meaningfully increase on-chain economic activity and, by extension, transaction fees, which will be essential for the long-term sustainability of the mining industry as block rewards continue to decline.

With institutional accumulation now well-established, the narrative has shifted from simple exposure to capital efficiency. While institutions have validated Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, they remain bound by a fiduciary mandate to maximize returns. In traditional markets, capital is never allowed to stagnate: bonds accrue interest, equities distribute dividends, and even idle cash is swept into money market funds. Bitcoin, until recently, earned nothing.

The total value locked on BTCFi and BTC Layer 2s has reached nearly $8B in 2025 highlighting the rising demand and product market fit for this sector. However, not all BTCFi or scaling solutions contribute to transaction fees on Bitcoin. Some of these developments and improvements that make Bitcoin more practical as a payments layer, simultaneously reducing the revenue available to secure the base layer long-term.

The systems that matter most for miner sustainability are those that generate recurring, unavoidable, and economically meaningful on-chain transactions.

Stacks is a well-known example: its Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism requires Stacks miners to make direct Bitcoin transactions to bid for the right to mint STX blocks. This creates persistent L1 demand tied to network activity.

Babylon is expanding rapidly as a modular BTC staking primitive. Babylon uses Bitcoin for two essential functions: checkpoint commitments where PoS chains post cryptographic checkpoints to Bitcoin L1 to inherit Bitcoin-grade security and staking commitments where stakers publish lockups, unbonding events and slashing-related attestations on Bitcoin.These operations occur frequently and at scale as Babylon expands to secure multiple chains. Babylon is the largest BTC associated protocol with a TVL of nearly $5B.

Emerging Bitcoin rollups like Citrea, and Bitlayer - enabled by innovations like BitVM - operate similarly to Ethereum rollups: They execute transactions off-chain, but post state roots, fraud proofs, or compressed data to Bitcoin L1 for settlement.

The next decade will determine whether Bitcoin can maintain a credible, market-based security budget after the block subsidy becomes too small to sustain miners. BTCFi ecosystems and scaling solutions that require Bitcoin L1 for settlement, proof, metadata, or consensus offer the most realistic path to long-term sustainability.

As a result, we expect BTC Layer 2s and BTCFi to demonstrate sustainable product-market fit, reflected in rising economic activity and TVL.

KPIs to monitor:

With the rollout of Bitcoin Core 30 in November, node operators using the software's default settings began accepting unconfirmed transactions containing OP_RETURN data up to 100,000 bytes - a dramatic jump from the previous 80-byte limit.

The expanded allowance makes it far easier to embed non-monetary data, including large files like images, directly into the blockchain's transaction structure. The increase in OP_RETURN is in response to people enabling data that exceeds 80-byte limit using alternative hacks such as fake spendable output taproot payloads or pushing data directly to miners by bypassing the mempool relay.

This sweeping change, made in a single step, sparked heated debate across the Bitcoin community, with many expressing concerns about its implications for blockspace usage and network resources. In response, a growing number of operators have migrated to Bitcoin Knots, a more conservative Bitcoin Core derivative. The shift has been significant: the number of public Knots nodes surged from around 400 to more than 5,000, now representing about 22% of all publicly reachable nodes.

While the debate around whether non financial data on Bitcoin blockchain is beneficial continues, data has proven that the likes of Ordinals has a significant impact on the Miner's Revenues. At the peak of Ordinals back in April 2024, Transaction fees accounted for 50% of the miner revenues, a significant amount compared to the 1% contribution currently. As a result, the return of Ordinals and Inscriptions could revive transaction fees as a significant portion of miner revenue.

As alternative networks and stablecoins have proven to be better suited for blockchain-based payments, expanding the OP_RETURN limit to 100,000 bytes is likely to unlock richer use cases for protocols built on top of Bitcoin. Allowing more data per transaction increases design flexibility, enabling more expressive, feature-rich applications to be layered onto the Bitcoin network.

We expect Ordinals, Inscriptions, and related protocol innovations to be an area of interest in the coming year. Although Ordinals activity has remained subdued in 2025, a resurgence would be constructive for miner economics, boosting transaction fee revenue and helping offset the ongoing decline in block subsidy dependence.

KPIs to monitor:

Quantum computing has long been dismissed as a “forever-30-years-away” technology. But in 2025, that narrative broke. A sharp acceleration in quantum development - driven by dramatic gains in gate fidelity, viable error correction, progress in logical-qubit systems, and a surge in commercial research investment - has brought the prospect of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) into the realm of the plausible. For the first time, a machine capable of breaking elliptic-curve cryptography could realistically emerge in the late 2020s or early 2030s.

Governments are already acting accordingly: major national standards bodies are operating on a 2030-2035 transition timeline for post-quantum security, and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), through its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative, explicitly forecasts utility-scale quantum computing around 2033.

A CRQC would be catastrophic for Bitcoin's current security assumptions. It would break ECDSA and Schnorr signatures by using Shor's algorithm to derive private keys from visible public keys - compromising the foundation of Bitcoin's ownership model. While Bitcoin's hashing functions (e.g., SHA-256) remain quantum-resilient, the moment a public key is revealed on-chain, it becomes vulnerable. This includes not just the addresses where public keys already appear in the UTXO set, but also every transaction in flight: when a spend is broadcast, the public key is exposed, enabling a theoretical quantum “re-sign and steal” attack before confirmation.

Three major categories of Bitcoin already fall into the high-risk bucket:

Altogether, 32% of all circulating bitcoin - nearly $600B - is vulnerable the moment a CRQC comes online, and this number will only grow as more long-held coins are spent for the first time.

Bitcoin's conservative approach to protocol changes means sweeping upgrades are rare, but not impossible. Past changes such as SegWit and Taproot show that Bitcoin can evolve when needed - though each required years of discussion, testing, and coordination. Given SegWit's 2.5-year activation timeline and Taproot's 3.5 years, the community would need to begin work soon on any transition toward quantum-resistant cryptography. This would likely involve evaluating candidate post-quantum signature schemes, introducing new address types, and initiating a voluntary migration path for users.

While 2026 is not expected to produce a quantum machine capable of breaking ECDSA - the rapid progress observed in 2025 makes it clear that the window for preparation is narrowing. As a result, we anticipate significantly expanded discussion, research, and early proposal work on Bitcoin's post-quantum future beginning next year.

KPIs to monitor:

In 2025, Ethereum provided a bit of divergence between fundamentals and price action: ‘core' fundamentals picked up while price action lagged and base-layer revenue collapsed.

As of December 1, 2025, ETH is down 10% year-to-date, underperforming BTC (down 3%). Despite this price weakness, Total Value Locked (TVL) rose from 25m to 31m ETH, while monthly DEX volumes climbed from $67B in Q4 2024 to $86B in Q4 2025. Stablecoin market capitalization also increased from $111B to $166B, confirming substantial new capital inflows into the ecosystem.

Despite the ecosystem's growth, Layer 1 revenue (L1 fees) has declined from an average of $100M monthly to below $15M (Q4 comparison). Interestingly, app revenue (fees captured by dApps) has remained consistent over the past 12 months ($80M monthly). This divergence is a sign that Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap is working as intended.

This divergence confirms that Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap is working as intended, with network value capture intentionally shifting away from the base chain to Layer 2s, validating the utility delivered by key upgrades like Pectra (May 2025) and Fusaka (December 2025).

ETH's price generally tends to move in line with Ethereum's chain revenue i.e. a decline in trend or scale of chain revenue should result in the same for ETH price - going by historical trends. Q3 2025 saw a divergence as ETH price appreciation substantially outpaced the pickup in chain revenue.

This outperformance was driven by the inception of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) dedicated to holding ETH. This trend began in mid-July 2025 - initiating a sustained period of capital inflow. The subsequent decline in ETH price post October 2025 aligns directly with a slowdown in these institutional flows.

Collectively, these entities hold approximately 3.5% of the total circulating ETH supply, positioning them as significant drivers of ETH price action. Assuming a 90% decline in quarterly growth rates (given the QoQ growth rate growth has dropped from 200% (Q3) to -6% (Q4 - ongoing), a 90% decline is a relatively safe base case), institutions are still expected to capture ~4% of Ethereum's circulating supply. Assuming no other real source of liquidity shows up, institutions will continue to play a role in ETH's price in 2026.

KPIs to monitor:

The dominant position of Ethereum in stablecoin yield generation is evident not only in the comparative average yield across top liquidity pools on Ethereum versus Solana and 3-month T-bill rates, but also in supporting market metrics. The stablecoin market capitalization on Ethereum reinforces this narrative, growing significantly from an estimated $115B to $171B as of the end of November 2025.

This rate is maintained by protocols employing fundamentally different yield generation methods. Yields are sourced from three distinct categories:

Bullish environments tend to expand the spread between the funding rates (say on BTC) and treasury bill yields. Hence, the future of the stable yield narrative is tied to the macro environment and the performance of synthetic stablecoins, led by Ethena (USDe/sUSDe).

Ethena saw its TVL decline significantly in late 2025 (falling from $14.8B to $7.6B), driven by a decline in yield (to ~4.6%) that placed it below competing borrowing costs (like Aave's 5.4% USDC rate). This decline perfectly aligns with a softening basis trade and less aggressive funding rates in the crypto market.

An expected interest rate cut environment will cause Real-World Yields (RWA/T-Bill rates) to decline. This would make the risk-adjusted returns of synthetic stables more competitive. The core expectation is that as the crypto market sentiment turns bullish, funding rates will flip positive and spike, pushing Ethena's yields up, attracting capital, and driving its TVL back up.

Protocols like Pendle continue to serve as the most liquid proxy for trading this yield volatility, as its success is heavily dependent on the high yields of underlying assets like Ethena's sUSDe - given 41% of Pendle's TVL at the moment is USDe or sUSDe.

This creates a clear risk: if crypto activity fails to pick up, crypto-native yields will struggle against off-chain yields, making a substantial portion of the stable yield market reliant on a renewed bull environment.

KPIs to monitor:

The on-chain lending market can be split into two distinct segments: Pure DeFi Money Markets for overcollateralized retail lending, and On-Chain Institutional Credit for direct loans to companies (private credit). This division suggests that no single protocol can currently dominate both, as institutional lending requires established relationships and a proven track record. This institutional segment is tapping into a massive opportunity, as private credit is a multi-trillion-dollar industry in traditional finance, offering a crucial source of non-RWA stable yield in DeFi.

Maple Finance (Syrup) is the current leader in this institutional space, with its TVL growing from $500M to over $4B. Maple provides unique structured credit solutions-fixed-term, crypto-backed working capital specifically for crypto-native firms, positioning it between traditional RWA and standard DeFi lending.

The protocol's long-term potential is high, possibly targeting the prior CeFi lending peak of $69B. The expectation for 2026 is continued growth, potentially exceeding $10B in deposits.

However, the primary concern remains the risk of reputational harm and yield uncertainty stemming from incidents like the Maple/Core injunction. Despite these risks, Maple is expected to maintain its growth due to the essential nature of institutional lending and the current lack of viable competitors.

KPIs to monitor:

2025 saw continuation of dominance by monolithic lending protocols (particularly Aave) relative to modular lending protocols - which continue to maintain their 10% market share in terms of active loans on Ethereum.

The Ethereum decentralized lending market remains dominated by Aave, with active loans increasing from approximately $10B at the beginning of 2025 to $20-25B as of November. Aave has concurrently extended its market share from 71% to an approximate 82%.

The other real growth story has been Euler, which is a modular lending protocol and has seen its TVL going up from $200M to just over $800M this year. Euler now accounts for 30% of the market share on Ethereum within modular lending protocols (Morpho).

The growth of modular lending is closely tied to the role of Risk Curators - entities responsible for setting parameters and creating markets for new, exotic collateral. The TVL managed by these risk curators saw a significant pickup - growing from $1B at the start of 2025 to a peak of $10B.

This growth was sharply curtailed in Q4, with curator-led TVL declining to roughly $6B. This drop was directly linked to the fallout from the Stream Finance incident, which exposed vulnerabilities and systemic risk in these newly created, incentive-driven lending markets. This blowup confirmed the fragile nature of some pools and the dangers of over-reliance on incentives.

The expectation is that modular lending will continue to become more prominent, but its growth rate will likely moderate following the recent failures. The Stream Finance incident will likely lead to a necessary reduction in risk curator-led markets and a more cautious approach from liquidity providers. Despite the setback, the long-term thesis - that the ecosystem needs flexible, efficient lending rails for its expanding asset base - remains valid.

KPIs to monitor:

Looking at quarter by quarter app level revenue generated on-chain on a subset of chains (Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, BSC, Bitcoin and Tron) reveals a structural trend toward a revenue-driven growth phase. Aggregate quarterly revenue has surged from $3.9bn in Q1 2025 to over $6bn in Q4 2025, validating the market's shift toward high-monetization protocols.

Interestingly, Ethereum's share of app revenue has been gradually going down since the start of 2024 - down from 50% to just 25% in Q4 2025.

Ethereum's ecosystem revenue is concentrated around lending, liquid staking (and re-staking) and yield generation protocols, as evident by total revenue earned by protocols in 2025 (chart below).

When you apply the context of emissions/incentives being given - the net figure looks different. For protocols where incentives data is available (via DeFillama), only three out of seven are actually profitable post incentives (Lido, Sky and Aave). This raises concerns regarding the long-term revenue sustainability of the remaining protocols, which appear to rely heavily on subsidies to drive activity.

The market's shift toward a revenue-centric valuation framework represents a structural maturation, prioritizing protocols that demonstrate genuine commercial viability. We expect this trend to persist, ultimately filtering out projects that rely on unsustainable token incentives to mask a lack of organic demand. While a prolonged sector downturn remains a theoretical risk, the robust growth observed over the past year renders a bearish reversal unlikely in the near term.

KPIs to monitor:

The tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) was a core growth narrative in 2025, driven by both institutional adoption and the creation of crypto-native financial primitives. The overall value of tokenized RWAs grew significantly, increasing from approximately $291M to $669M over the past year, with nearly half of that value currently residing on Ethereum.

Ethereum is the preferred settlement rail for compliant institutional capital and public markets, with 50% of all total value of tokenized stocks being on Ethereum.

BlackRock's BUIDL Fund became the benchmark for the tokenized U.S. Treasury market. It went from $615M to peak near $2.9B by mid-year, commanding over 40% of the tokenized U.S. Treasury sector.

Tokenized Equities: Platforms like Ondo Finance ($349.1M total value) and Backed Finance (xStocks, $163.9M total value) facilitated the launch of blue-chip equities like Apple ($AAPL) and Nvidia ($NVDA).

The RWA opportunity is vast (potentially multi-trillion-dollar) due to clear advantages like fractionalization and 24/7 markets. With BTC (and broader crypto) underperforming stocks year to date (BTC being down -3% while SP500 up 17%) - the expectation is that assuming this trend continues, even crypto native entities would likely be open to trading more equity - especially given that some of the platforms allow for permissionless trading.

While growth is expected to continue, current trading volumes remain extremely low (less than $1m a day for tokenized stocks on Backed Finance), highlighting the nascent stage of the asset class.

KPIs to monitor:

Privacy protocols saw clear activity spikes, confirming a persistent user base that values anonymity. Ethereum-based privacy protocols such as Railgun saw its TVL go up from $75m to $90m while privacy-based DEX aggregator Houdiniswap saw volumes increase significantly, rising from approximately $916M to over $2B this year.

This is compounded by the success of platforms that integrate privacy at the infrastructural level, such as the Brave browser. Brave has scaled to 104M Monthly Active Users (MAUs) and 46.3M Daily Active Users (DAUs), demonstrating real user growth. The associated token (Basic Attention Token - BAT) has somewhat been responsive to this growth - with the token up 13% since the start of the year.

Brave's integration of the ZCASH shielded transaction feature on the Brave Wallet and its built-in Leo AI - which analyzes webpages without retaining user data or relying on third-party ads - aligns the protocol with the narratives of Privacy x AI.

The second half of this narrative is the integration of crypto holdings into daily life, which is currently centered on crypto-linked debit cards (""cash cards"") provided by centralized and semi-decentralized entities. The on-chain side of this utility is captured by the growth in Crypto Card volumes (deposits and spends). While currently dominated by centralized providers (EtherFi, Gnosis), the trend shows a clear demand for users to utilize their holdings.

The core expectation is the merger of these two themes: users will value privacy coupled with the ability to spend/utilize their holdings with the least friction. Future growth depends on the emergence of new, decentralized ""neobanks"" that can successfully offer private on-chain spending with the convenience and regulatory framework of traditional financial cards.

The sustainability of crypto-linked payment cards (""cash cards"") presents a core financial concern, primarily revolving around the associated take rate. These platforms necessitate extremely large daily transaction volumes for their business model to be viable.

Should the current monthly transfer volumes fail to increase significantly, the economic model for these cards, particularly for emerging decentralized ""neobanks,"" may prove unsustainable. Despite this inherent dependency on scaling transaction volume, the prevalent trend suggests an expectation that monthly transfer volumes will continue to increase over the coming year.

KPIs to monitor:

For Cardano, 2025 was defined by a struggle on both market and DeFi fronts. The asset was a market laggard, with ADA falling 51% YTD, significantly underperforming BTC, ETH, and other major L1s. This price action was reinforced by declining DeFi metrics: Total Value Locked (TVL) fell 15% (from 536M to 472M ADA) and Spot DEX volumes plummeted 77% for the year.

Despite the market struggles, the network showed consistent commitment to its research-driven roadmap. Monthly active developers saw a slight increase from 654 to 680 this year, with Cardano (278) maintaining a competitive ranking above chains like Optimism and BNB Chain in terms of full-time developer count.

2025 also marked Cardano's successful transition to fully decentralized governance, with the key catalyst being the Plomin Hard Fork on January 29, 2025. Plomin finalized the implementation of the CIP-1694 governance model, enabling the full set of governance actions and activating the Delegated Representative (DRep) role.

The Foundation launched the DRep Delegation Program, initially allocating 140M ADA to Developer and Builder DReps. A planned expansion was revealed in September, allocating a further 220M ADA to Adoption and Operations DReps in early 2026. To increase accessibility, the Foundation released an open-source voting tool and partnered with Griffin AI to launch the Proposal Examiner.

The Cardano Foundation's roadmap for 2026 clearly signals a targeted shift to address the DeFi and RWA adoption gaps:

Interoperable, Programmable Tokens: The focus will be on addressing network standards to grow the RWA sector. This includes completing and promoting CIP-0113 and CIP-0143 to enable fully interoperable and programmable tokens on the network.

Next-Gen Payments: The Foundation will work with the Masumi team to adopt the latest x402 payments framework. This internet-native solution aims to facilitate simple, seamless agent-to-agent payments and remove friction from the user experience, supporting the long-term goal of DeFi adoption.

The primary technical narrative for Cardano in 2025 was the push for commercial-grade scalability, moving the ecosystem past its foundational development phases and directly addressing long-standing criticisms regarding speed and throughput.

The development of Hydra, Cardano's Layer 2 scaling solution (off-chain state channels), was the network's most significant technical milestone. The narrative centered on Hydra enabling fast, low-cost off-chain transactions, demonstrating a credible path to unlocking high-speed applications like decentralized gaming, micro-payments, and high-frequency DeFi.

Hydra v1 is currently production ready and its use in Midnight's (privacy based blockchain) token generation event (NIGHT token) in Q3 2025 demonstrates its readiness for development grade applications. Hydra is expected to see continued adoption by builders within the Cardano ecosystem and become a more prominent part of the blockchain ecosystem in 2026.

KPIs to monitor:

The expansion of the Bitcoin financial ecosystem (BTCFi) was a strategic narrative for Cardano in 2025, driven by the goal of accessing Bitcoin's liquidity.

Cardano positioned this expansion using its Extended UTXO (eUTXO) architecture for integration. The network's BTCFi focus was on eliminating centralized risk inherent in traditional bridges by developing cryptographic solutions.

This included a BitVM Bridge Partnership, where Cardano's L2, Sundial, partnered with Bitlayer to design a BitVM-based bridge. This architecture directly addresses distrust of centralized wrappers (like WBTC) by creating a secure, two-way channel that does not rely on third-party custodians for asset transfer.

Further UTXO-Native Innovation was seen in protocols like BitcoinOS, which demonstrated bridgeless BTC transfers via the BitSNARK protocol, issuing non-custodial xBTC that exists as native UTXOs on Cardano. Additionally, Fairgate's Cardinal protocol used BitVMX to bridge Ordinals to Cardano Native Tokens, leveraging the shared UTXO structure and verifiable cryptography.

The BTCFi narrative grants Cardano access to Bitcoin's liquidity, potentially providing an avenue that could see its DeFi TVL grow in the future. This process is validated by technologies like BitVM and BitSNARK, ensuring the integration maintains a cryptographically verifiable, high-assurance security standard aligned with both ecosystems. We need to see more of this implementation and data before coming to conclusions on how beneficial this can be for Cardano.

KPIs to monitor:

While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were approved earlier in the cycle, anticipation for a Cardano ETF emerged as a key narrative in 2025. This was largely driven by NYSE Arca's February filing to list the Grayscale Cardano Trust ETF (GADA). The SEC's formal acknowledgement initiated the review process, further signaling interest from institutional players.

Throughout mid-2025, prediction markets consistently priced the odds of an ADA ETF approval at high levels (e.g., as high as 95%), signaling strong market confidence in Cardano's ability to clear regulatory hurdles.

The SEC's final decision deadline for the Grayscale ETF was widely anticipated for October 26, 2025. However, due to external factors, the final ruling has been postponed and is now expected to fall into 2026.

As of late 2025, the ETF has not yet been approved. Institutional interest is evident through various pending applications (including Grayscale, VanEck, and Hashdex).

2026 Expectation: The final ruling is now expected to be part of a wave of altcoin ETF decisions in early 2026. This outcome will likely serve as a significant catalyst, making the ETF approval status a critical monitoring KPI for the start of the next year.

KPIs to monitor:

Midnight is Input Output's privacy‑focused “partner chain” for Cardano – a zero‑knowledge L1 designed to offer what the company describes as “rational privacy,” or selective, programmable data protection that can satisfy both users and regulators.

Midnight's core thesis is that most real‑world blockchain use cases require nuanced privacy, not total transparency or full anonymity. The network uses zero‑knowledge proofs to separate public and private data, allowing applications to selectively reveal information to auditors, regulators, or counterparties without exposing everything on‑chain.

As of late 2025, Midnight remains in an advanced pre‑mainnet phase.

The roadmap outlines a multi-gate rollout for 2026:

The utility and governance token, NIGHT, officially launched as a Cardano Native Asset on December 4, 2025. The launch, framed as the Hilo phase, provides immediate liquidity and enables future governance.

The Glacier Drop and Scavenger Mine distribution phases set an industry record for participation volume. The distribution registered over 4.5B NIGHT claims across more than 8M unique addresses. The dual-phase distribution targeted holders across eight major chains (ADA, BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, AVAX, BAT) and was explicitly framed as having no VC or team allocation.

The dual-token model differentiates itself by establishing DUST (the shielded transaction fuel) as a non-transferable, decaying resource. This design choice is aimed at eliminating regulatory risks associated with anonymous value transfer, allowing the network to provide privacy for data without providing a shield for illicit uses.

KPIs to track:

The original TypeScript-inspired language, Compact, was integrated into a comprehensive web-based IDE and later merged into the Minokawa language under the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT). This move reinforces the goal of abstracting ZK complexity and making development accessible to mainstream web developers.

The network secured a partnership with OpenZeppelin to develop smart contract libraries for the Compact language, including equivalents of standards like ERC20 and ERC721 adapted for the Midnight environment. This speeds up development and integration.

We expect Midnight to target product‑market fit in ZK‑native verticals – such as identity, compliance‑aware DeFi, and privacy‑preserving data markets – with Compact becoming a credible alternative to Solidity and Rust for developers who prioritise data protection.

KPIs to track:

XRP is a digital asset purpose-built for payments, powering the XRP Ledger (XRPL) - a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered for fast, low-cost global value transfer. XRPL delivers native functionality such as a built-in decentralized exchange, multi-asset support, and robust operational reliability, making it well-suited for enterprise-grade payment networks.

Ripple is one of the few major tokens currently trading above its yearly open, delivering a 3.68% year-to-date return and reaching $2.16 as of November 30th - outperforming BTC, ETH, and SOL. The asset also set a new all-time high of $3.67 in July.

On-chain activity has shown mixed dynamics: total transactions have declined 7.81% compared to 2024, while chain fees have surged 212% year-to-date, with both metrics peaking in January. XRPL's total value locked has continued to expand, rising 37.4% to $75.5M. Stablecoin market capitalization on the ledger has grown to $306M, dominated by RLUSD with a 77% share. The network has also attracted a wave of new stablecoin issuers, including Circle's USDC, Quontoz's EURQ and USDQ, StraitsX's XSGD, Schuman Financial's EUROP, Barza Crypto's USDB and BBRL, and AUDFC Pty Ltd's AUDD.

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on XRPL has reached an all-time high in 2025, growing to $208M in value. U.S. Treasury debt and private credit remain the largest categories, with $158M and $138M in TVL respectively.

Ripple has also continued strengthening the XRPL's infrastructure to modernize its programmability and broaden its developer ecosystem. On June 30th, the XRPL EVM sidechain officially launched, offering full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility while maintaining seamless interoperability with the main XRPL. This advancement significantly enhances XRPL's competitiveness by enabling more sophisticated DeFi and RWA applications that require a richer smart contract environment than the base ledger can natively support.

Ripple also introduced a permissioned DEX designed for institutional use cases, compliance-sensitive order flows, and regulated liquidity providers. A permissioned DEX allows network participants to define rules so that only approved users with the required credentials can interact with specific offers within a designated group, known as a Permissioned Domain.

When Ripple entered the industry, their focus was to modernize global cross-border payments using XRPL as a high-speed settlement backbone. Ripple has historically occupied a nearly uncontested category in enterprise payments as no other public blockchain had credible payments infrastructure, banking partnerships, licensing scope or serious regulatory posture.

Ripple's early emphasis on compliance such as ISO 20022, enterprise integrations, fiat connectivity, and corridor depth gave it a first-mover advantage in global remittances and B2B payments. RippleNet has now partnered with over 300 financial institutions globally.

However, the rapid rise of stablecoins created open, global settlement rails accessible to any application, not just banks or remittance providers. This means Solana, Base, and other public blockchains are now able to offer real-time, near-zero-cost settlement without needing a corporate intermediary like Ripple. Moreover, 2025 also saw the rise of stablecoin chains like Tether backed Plasma and Stable, Circle's Arc and Stripe's Tempo have resulted in a more competitive blockchain payments landscape. Many of these chains, particularly Stripe's Tempo, offer near-zero fees, instant finality, programmable compliance, and merchant networks that Ripple cannot fully replicate.

Over the past two years, Ripple has transformed its product strategy by building a comprehensive five-pillar institutional stack, evolving well beyond its original focus on cross-border payments. Anchored by the XRP Ledger, Ripple now operates across a significantly broader financial infrastructure footprint.

Custody: Ripple entered institutional custody at scale with its $250M acquisition of Switzerland-based Metaco in 2023, bringing with it 75 regulatory licenses worldwide. This was further strengthened through the acquisition of London-based Palisade, whose lightweight, high-speed wallet-as-a-service platform now complements Ripple Custody.

Payments & Stablecoins: In August 2025, Ripple acquired Rail - an enterprise-grade stablecoin payments platform with deep integrations into card networks, ACH, and domestic instant-payment systems for $200M. Rail serves as the foundation of Ripple's expanded payments and stablecoin capabilities.

Treasury Management: Ripple's purchase of GTreasury in October for $1B added a direct on-ramp into corporate liquidity workflows, positioning the company to sit at the center of enterprise treasury operation

Prime Brokerage: Ripple accelerated into institutional market infrastructure with the $1.25B acquisition of Hidden Road in April, rebranding it as Ripple Prime. Today, Ripple Prime processes $3T annually, moves $10B per day, and facilitates 50M transactions daily - instantly placing Ripple among the largest players in digital-asset prime brokerage.

Together, these acquisitions have expanded Ripple into four new business lines - payments, custody, prime brokerage, and stablecoins - substantially enhancing the scope and strategic value of its solutions. More importantly, Ripple is betting on the synergy of these components: a unified, closed-loop institutional stack that offers seamless payment, custody, compliance, and settlement infrastructure to fintechs and enterprises.

As a result, we expect Ripple to shift from being viewed primarily as a cross-border payments company to a full-scale digital financial infrastructure provider, with non-payments business lines contributing meaningfully alongside traditional ODL and P2P corridor revenue.

KPIs to monitor:

Ripple introduced RLUSD in 2025 as a fully regulated, USD-backed stablecoin designed to operate natively on the XRP Ledger while integrating seamlessly with Ripple's expanding enterprise infrastructure stack. Within its first year, RLUSD surpassed $1B in circulating supply - a milestone that underscores strong early demand and meaningful institutional and B2B adoption.

Today, RLUSD has a market capitalization of $1.26B, with 82% of the supply circulating on Ethereum and the remainder on XRPL. The supply concentration on Ethereum reflects Ripple's strategy to tap into the deep pools of enterprise liquidity that already exist there. However, the launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain now enables RLUSD to move frictionlessly between Ethereum and XRPL.

This development is strategically significant: RLUSD on XRPL can reduce or even eliminate the dependency on XRP for corridor settlement - addressing long-standing challenges tied to XRP's volatility and liquidity requirements. It also creates a gateway for more Ethereum-based capital to flow into the XRPL ecosystem as RLUSD adoption grows.

Ripple has partnered with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to broaden RLUSD's utility footprint. Notably, RLUSD now supports blockchain-based settlement for the Gemini Credit Card, and serves as a primary base asset for trading pairs on the Gemini exchange. Year-to-date, RLUSD pairs have generated $36.2B in centralized-exchange trading volume - highlighting the stablecoin's rapid integration into institutional market structure.

Looking ahead, RLUSD is positioned for continued expansion as a core component of Ripple's financial infrastructure. In 2026, we expect RLUSD to surpass $2.5B in market capitalization, driven by growing utility, deeper enterprise adoption, and its central role in Ripple's payment and settlement ecosystem.

KPIs to monitor:

Despite spending nearly a decade as a top-10 global crypto asset, XRP has long lacked many of the core features that define modern Layer-1 ecosystems due to a lack of native smart contracts on XRPL. Unlike BTC, ETH, SOL, and other leading networks, the XRP Ledger has historically been missing native on-chain yield opportunities, robust DeFi primitives, collateralized borrowing and lending markets, structured products, and institutional-grade vaulting solutions.

The absence of these foundational components has left a significant share of XRP's supply effectively idle. This has resulted in one of the largest pools of dormant liquidity - across both retail and institutional holders - in the entire digital asset market. Consequently, XRP represents one of the most underdeveloped yet potentially high-value TAMs in the sector, poised for substantial activation as the ecosystem evolves.

The launch of Doppler Finance in February - introduced as the first XRPFi protocol - marked a watershed moment for the XRP Ledger's evolving financial ecosystem. For the first time, XRP holders gained access to native yield opportunities through Doppler Vaults and Doppler Lending, unlocking functionality previously absent from the network.

Doppler sources its yields through a blend of CeDeFi-driven, institutional-grade strategies, including arbitrage and spot-perpetual basis trades, bringing sophisticated market infrastructure to the XRPL. In October, Doppler Vaults integrated into Bitget Earn, giving Bitget Earn users access to new yield XRP opportunities, securely and transparently. In parallel, the protocol generates on-chain yields via XRP lending markets and stablecoin-based yield mechanisms, creating a diversified and sustainable reward structure for participants.

In addition, the introduction of Extensions represents a major technical leap for the XRPL. Extensions allow developers to attach modular code to existing ledger primitives, enhancing functionality without requiring entirely new smart contracts. This approach preserves XRPL's efficiency and security model while unlocking far more expressive on-chain logic.

The first Extension, Smart Escrows, enables developers to define sophisticated release conditions - such as notary approvals, credential-based authentication, or other programmable triggers - before an escrow can be unlocked. Smart Escrows are scheduled for release in Q1 2026, and will serve as the foundation for a broader programmability roadmap.

Following this milestone, Ripple plans to launch a full smart contract devnet, marking the most significant expansion of XRPL's developer capabilities in its history and setting the stage for a new wave of advanced financial applications.

Recently approved Multipurpose Tokens, Credentials, and AMM Clawback make XRPL fit for institutional adoption by providing necessary identity, financial compliance and privacy features. As mentioned earlier, the total value locked of RWA on XRP reached a new all-time high in 2025. Today, there are 47 real world assets on the chain, accounting for $358M in TVL.

A native lending protocol (XLS-66) is also in development on XRPL, whereby users could lend and borrow supported assets, such as XRP, wBTC, and wETH, using single-asset vaults.

We expect the XRPFi ecosystem to reach a new all-time high in 2026, with total TVL surpassing $200M, supported by expanding yield markets, protocol adoption, and the rollout of new infrastructure primitives. In parallel, we anticipate the value of real-world assets (RWAs) tokenized on XRPL to exceed $1B, reflecting growing institutional participation and enhanced programmability on the network.

KPIs to monitor:

Among major altcoins, XRP has consistently ranked among the strongest assets in terms of institutional and mainstream adoption, standing alongside BTC, ETH, and SOL. It's therefore no surprise that XRP has become one of the largest digital-asset product markets by assets under management. Today, 24 structured investment products hold a combined $3.20B in AUM, underscoring XRP's enduring appeal to both institutional allocators and sophisticated investors. The same trend is reflected in the popularity of XRP products on CME since its launch on the exchange in May, with $40B in volume traded across its three products.

This, coupled with the approval of generic listing frameworks which widens the scope for multiple assets to be included without additional bespoke rule-making hints at more ETFs for altcoins including XRP. This is important as the two of three largest ETF issuers in the U.S - Blackrock and Fidelity are yet to file for a XRP ETF, representing material untapped capital potential for XRP.

XRP was also one of the many altcoins that benefitted from the digital asset treasury company narrative. Several companies have adopted XRP as their core treasury asset with Evernorth, a newly formed U.S company building a $1.1B warchest to acquire XRP. To date, the company holds 473M XRP, accounting for 0.473% of the total XRP supply.

VivoPower was another notable name that acquired exposure to 211M XRP position through budgeted $100M acquisition of Ripple shares at an 86% discount. The company has since announced partnership with Doppler Finance and Flare to maximize return on crypto treasury strategy.

We expect to see an expansion in XRP ETP listings in 2026, alongside the launch of additional XRP-focused DATs. As yield opportunities on XRPL continue to develop through XRPFi, we also anticipate more DATs will allocate into the ecosystem to capture incremental returns.

KPIs to monitor for invalidation:

BNB Chain (BSC) was one of the standout L1s of 2025, successfully translating fundamental and technical strength into superior market performance.

BNB was up 28% through the end of November 2025, significantly outperforming BTC, ETH, and all other major L1s. Price performance was directly supported by accelerating fundamentals: TVL was up 27% year-to-date, and spot DEX volumes saw a 3x increase in Q4 compared to the previous year. This success translated to the application layer, with app revenue also seeing a 3x increase this quarter, reaching $55M.

This performance was enabled by fundamental re-engineering of the network through two major hard forks: Lorentz (April 2025) and Maxwell (June 2025).

Speed and Finality: The Lorentz upgrade reduced block latency for high-frequency trading applications. The subsequent Maxwell upgrade established a consistent 0.75-second average block time and 1.875-second finality. This drastic reduction in time-to-finality enabled on-chain order books to effectively compete with Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) on execution speed.

Cost Reduction: The combination of these upgrades resulted in a 90% decrease in network fees, settling around 0.05 gwei. This significantly lowered the barrier to entry for high-frequency algorithmic traders and served as a necessary precondition for the high-volume migration observed later in the year

The success of Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges (Perp DEXs) was the primary DeFi narrative for BNB Chain in 2025, driven by Aster DEX. Aster was arguably the largest narrative on BSC this year. It currently commands a significant market presence, with weekly volumes of approximately $42B, placing it at a level comparable to or even exceeding competitors like Hyperliquid. As of the end of 2025, Aster accounts for 20% of all global perps volume.

Perp DEX activity is highly seasonal and correlated with bullish crypto market sentiment. Assuming a bullish trend, Aster is expected to maintain its dominance on BSC and continue competing with global leaders like Hyperliquid and Lighter.

A major factor in this momentum is the continuation of its points program, which sustains activity by incentivizing a subset of entities to ""farm"" for the future token (a trend common across competitors).

As the main DEX on BSC, Aster's local dominance will likely persist - especially given the 2026 roadmap released by the team showcases the inclusion of private transactions (shield mode), RWA perps and fiat on/off ramp.

KPIs to monitor:

As of November 2025, roughly 90% of all DEX volume on BSC is composed of long-tail tokens (i.e., non-utility tokens). This figure represents a major structural shift, with long tail tokens representing 60% of the market just 12 months prior. This highlights the meme/long-tail trade as a growing market narrative on BSC.

While launchpads like Four.meme contributed to this surge, seeing weekly volumes spike to a peak of $1.8B in October 2025, this growth was not sustained, dropping to under $300M by the end of November. This volatility makes centralized launchpads a less reliable proxy for the underlying long-tail trend.

The ultimate infrastructure play for this long-tail activity is the core DEX: Pancakeswap. Most of the trades originated by launchpads and speculative activity are ultimately directed to Pancakeswap.

Pancakeswap volumes surged from $5B weekly at the start of the year to $11B by the end of November (a 2x increase). This growth followed a major change in tokenomics earlier in the year, where daily CAKE emissions were cut from 29,000 CAKE/day to 14,500 CAKE/day.

With its improved tokenomics and status as one of the more competitively valued DEXs (from a Price-to-Revenue perspective), Pancakeswap is expected to be the most sustained proxy for exposure to the BSC meme/long-tail narrative.

KPIs to monitor:

The Prediction Markets narrative was a highly dominant theme across crypto in 2025, led by Polymarket and Kalshi. On BNB Chain, Opinion quickly established itself as the local volume leader, though its underlying user metrics raise questions about the long-term sustainability of this dominance.

Opinion currently ranks as third in revenue on BSC (behind Pancakeswap and Four.meme) over the past 30 days. Initially built on Monad but launching its mainnet on BNB, Opinion combines an AI oracle with on-chain orderbook infrastructure. The core source of this volume surge is the OPINION Point System (PTS) weekly rewards program.

Opinion's high trading volumes contrast sharply with its low transaction count and user base. This low transactional depth implies one of two things: either the volumes are not organic, or the dollar value per user is extremely large (indicating whale dominance)

Prediction markets are expected to remain a dominant narrative in crypto. However, for Opinion specifically, its future viability hinges on converting incentive-driven volume into sticky, organic user activity, thereby establishing a non-incentive-based moat.

KPIs to monitor:

The integration of USD1 on BSC was one of the more prominent narratives on the chain. USD1 - a dollar pegged stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, saw rapid adoption driven less by decentralized usage and more by massive capital injection tied to institutional and political relationships.

BNB Chain Dominance: BNB Chain was the core hub for this activity, maintaining a 68% dominance of USD1's market capitalization by the end of November 2025.

The stablecoin's launch and immediate scale were accelerated by the landmark $2B investment by Abu Dhabi's MGX fund into Binance, which was strategically closed using USD1. This transaction instantly established the stablecoin's initial liquidity and profile.

World Liberty Financial's association with U.S. political figures has introduced a distinct 'political alignment' narrative to the ecosystem. By hosting the primary liquidity for this U.S.-compliant stablecoin, BNB Chain gains a notable, non-technical advantage. This effectively creates a strategic buffer, serving as a bridge between the decentralized ecosystem and traditional, politically-adjacent finance.

One of the core beneficiaries has been Lista DAO (a lending protocol on BSC), where USD1 is currently the second most borrowed asset - indicating emerging DeFi utility.

Still, the expectation here is that growth of USD1 will continue to be driven by large, centralized, institutional flows (like the MGX deal), rather than organic DeFi usage.

The primary risk is political. Any major shift in U.S. political leadership or regulatory sentiment toward the stablecoin's affiliated figures could instantly jeopardize its compliance status and cause massive capital flight, given the centralized nature of the initial capital base.

Solana entered 2025 with significant momentum, supported by exceptional on-chain activity and strong thematic tailwinds across memecoins, AI agents and next-generation market infrastructure. This surge in usage followed a breakout year in 2024, positioning Solana as one of the most dynamic ecosystems in crypto.

The year began with a dramatic acceleration in speculative activity, culminating in a January peak driven in part by high-profile cultural catalysts - most notably U.S. President Donald Trump issuing his TRUMP memecoin on Solana. This event accelerated user inflows and contributed to Solana reaching a new all-time high of $295.6, reinforcing its status as the ecosystem of choice for high-throughput, retail-driven flows.

However, this exuberance quickly gave way to a sharp retracement. The launch of several extractive token projects, including LIBRA, absorbed substantial liquidity from the broader ecosystem, weakening market depth and amplifying downside volatility. At the same time, renewed macroeconomic uncertainty - heightened by escalating tariffs, shifting rate expectations, and risk-off sentiment - placed further pressure on SOL's price.

While Solana briefly recovered to the $260 range during the peak of the DATs narrative, the rally proved short-lived. As of the latest reading, SOL trades near $133, representing a -29.7% year-to-date performance - a reflection of both macro headwinds and ecosystem-level liquidity imbalances.

Despite this volatility, Solana's foundational strengths remain intact. Network usage across DeFi, payments, consumer applications, and emergent agent frameworks continues to demonstrate resilience. While the total value locked in terms of USD value has dropped 35.3% to $18.4B, the TVL measured in SOL has increased 56.5% to near all-time highs at 138M SOL. The stablecoins market capitalization on the chain has surged by 186% to $15B.

Moreover, structural catalysts - from improvements in network reliability to the growth of internet-native capital markets and DePIN infrastructure - position Solana for renewed traction as market conditions stabilize. Solana still leads other networks in terms of active users, DEX trading volume, tokens created and App Revenue although these metrics have peaked earlier in the year.

Solana is approaching one of its most significant technical upgrades with Alpenglow, a next-generation consensus protocol proposed by Anza. The upgrade targets a dramatic reduction in finality - from ~12.8 seconds to 100-150 ms - positioning Solana among the fastest production networks. Alpenglow combines Rotor, an optimized data-propagation system, and Votor, an off-chain voting mechanism that removes vote fees, lowers validator costs, reduces on-chain data load, and enhances long-term scalability and decentralization. In parallel, SIMD-0411 proposes doubling the chain's disinflation rate without reducing rewards or adding new incentives.

Solana is also expanding its real-world commercial presence through partnerships with PayPal, Shopify, Stripe, Visa, Cash App, and Western Union, with a strong focus on stablecoin payments and next-generation settlement infrastructure. Major fintechs are increasingly adopting Solana not just for DeFi, but as a primary low-cost, high-throughput payment rail. These integrations reflect a broader shift: Solana is evolving from a speculative trading ecosystem into a widely used, global-scale transactional network.

In 2025, Solana has also benefited significantly from institutional capital inflows through ETFs and digital asset treasury (DAT) vehicles - one of the key catalysts behind SOL's rebound from its April lows to its September highs. Over the year, Solana-focused structured products recorded $3.42B in net inflows, solidifying SOL's position as the third-largest digital asset by AUM, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In the United States, six spot Solana ETFs have launched since November, all offering staking-enabled yield of roughly 7%, making them comparatively more attractive than BTC and ETH products. Collectively, these ETFs hold $638M in AUM, with Bitwise's BSOL commanding an outsized 93% share, underscoring early concentration among institutional allocators.

Treasury adoption has expanded alongside ETF growth. As of December, 16 publicly listed companies have disclosed Solana holdings. Forward Industries stands out as the largest Solana-focused DAT, accumulating nearly 7M SOL - equivalent to 1.12% of total circulating supply - a strong expression of long-term institutional confidence in the asset. Other notable DAT participants include The Solana Company, DeFi Development Corp, Upexi, and Sharps Technology, each holding between 0.325% and 0.375% of total supply, further reinforcing Solana's rising prominence within corporate treasury strategies.

With the approval of generic ETF listing language for digital asset products, we expect a broader range of Solana ETFs to receive regulatory clearance and begin trading. Combined with Solana's attractive native staking yield, which enhances the productivity of ETF-held assets, we anticipate a meaningful acceleration in institutional inflows throughout 2026. For ETFs specifically, we project AUM to exceed $2B, while the share of SOL held by publicly listed companies is expected to rise from under 3% today to more than 5% by year-end 2026.

One of crypto's greatest sources of future demand lies in hyperfinancialization. Assets that were once illiquid or inaccessible - equity stakes, real estate, even opinions - can now be tokenized and traded on digital markets. This shift is already underway: the total value locked in Real World Assets has doubled this year, surpassing $36B. McKinsey estimates that nearly $2T in assets are on track to be tokenized on-chain by 2030.

Within this broader shift, Solana is positioned to benefit from this trend as it offers a high-throughput environment suitable for frequent and low-cost settlement. Its architecture provides a programmable foundation for asset issuance that differs from contract-heavy models on other chains. Instead of relying on multiple custom smart contracts, Solana incorporates many of the building blocks for compliant asset management directly into its token standard.

This design allows issuers to define and enforce transfer rules, incorporate investor verification processes, automate certain reporting functions, and support more complex corporate actions with reduced manual intervention. These features aim to simplify asset administration while offering transparency and operational efficiency as more traditional assets move on-chain.

Alluding to this trend, the TVL of RWA on Solana has grown by 305% to $761M. While this represents a small share of the total RWA which is currently dominated by Ethereum, the data hints at high potential value capture in future. Meanwhile, Solana accounts for 36% of the tokenized stocks on-chain through its integrations with xStocks.

We expect RWA TVL on Solana to grow substantially in 2026, surpassing $2B, driven by accelerating adoption of tokenized financial products and enterprise-grade settlement use cases. At the same time, we anticipate Solana's market share of tokenized equities to exceed 50%, supported by the network's superior settlement performance and cost efficiency relative to alternative chains.

KPIs to monitor:

As global financial activity continues migrating on-chain - with the DEX-to-CEX volume ratio now surpassing 30%, Solana's decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem is positioned to be one of the primary beneficiaries of this structural shift. Solana already leads the industry across DEX trading volume, active users, and new token issuance, reflecting the network's advantage in throughput, latency, and cost efficiency.

While trading activity during the 2025 peak was heavily influenced by speculative memecoins and long-tail assets - representing nearly 90% of total DEX volume in January - this composition has shifted meaningfully. As of December, memecoins account for only 60% of volume, signaling a transition toward more diverse and higher-quality market participation across the Solana ecosystem.

The emergence of Internet Capital Markets (ICMs) and Ownership Coins, pioneered by MetaDAO, introduce a structurally more sophisticated form of on-chain trading by embedding governance, capital allocation, and legally enforceable execution directly into token design. Ownership Coins such as Avici and Umbra utilize futarchy-based governance systems that link market pricing to decision-making outcomes, while accompanying legal frameworks require the underlying entities to execute on proposals approved by token holders. In this model, trading activity becomes a mechanism for informed capital allocation rather than pure speculation.

Alongside these developments, high-volume speculative venues continue to play a central role. Pumpswap maintains roughly 40% of Solana's DEX market share, with its fee mechanisms generating close to $1M per day in buybacks of the native $PUMP token - underscoring the scale of on-chain demand and positioning the protocol as one of the ecosystem's most economically robust applications.

We believe speculation will remain a persistent feature of digital asset markets, and as overall conditions improve, the share of trading volume attributed to memecoins and long-tail assets is likely to rise accordingly. However, as the ecosystem continues to mature - driven by deeper liquidity, more sophisticated participants, and broader real-world use cases - we expect these assets to represent a smaller proportion of total market activity than what was observed earlier in the year, even if absolute volumes increase.

It is worth noting that a significant share of decentralized exchange activity on Solana now flows through aggregators, with Jupiter facilitating approximately 22.4% of total trading volume. In 2025, the protocol generated $157M in fees from its aggregator product alone. Jupiter also maintains a substantial footprint in Solana's perpetuals trading market, holding roughly 50% dominance over the past six months. Although recent competition from Pacifica has begun to erode this share, perpetuals have still produced $833M in fees for Jupiter, with 25% of those fees distributed to the protocol treasury and JLP holders.

Beyond trading, Jupiter earns revenue from a portfolio of additional products - including Jupiter Lend, Prediction, Staked SOL, DCA, and Studio - which together have contributed roughly $250M in revenue year-to-date. At its current valuation, Jupiter trades at a price-to-revenue ratio of 4.03x, a level that appears comparatively attractive when measured against other major DEX platforms such as Hyperliquid (7.77x), Drift (5.34x), and Aerodrome (4.73x).

A notable development within Solana's AMM landscape is the rise of Proprietary AMMs, which mark a meaningful evolution in on-chain liquidity design. By embedding optimized trading strategies directly into the runtime, PropAMMs remove the latency inherent in off-chain execution and deliver tighter, more competitive pricing - approaching the efficiency of leading centralized exchanges. As of today, PropAMMs represent approximately 50% of total DEX volume, with HumidFi emerging as the dominant player in this category.

Because protocols like HumidiFi operate without a user-facing interface, traders interact with them indirectly through Jupiter's off-chain routing and quoting engine, which dynamically sources liquidity across PropAMMs and traditional pools. This architecture allows users to benefit from advanced, high-performance execution strategies while maintaining the simplicity of a unified trading interface.

While PropAMMs are generally not optimal for highly volatile or long-tail assets such as newly launched memecoins, we nevertheless expect PropAMMs to become the dominant AMM architecture on Solana, as measured by trading-volume market share. Their superior execution efficiency, tighter pricing, and integration with advanced routing systems position them to capture an increasing share of aggregate liquidity.

Despite Solana being the second-largest ecosystem for on-chain lending, its lending market remains relatively underdeveloped when compared with Ethereum, which anchors roughly $40B in TVL across its lending protocols. Given Solana's clear dominance in trading, stablecoins, and DEX activity, lending remains one of the most structurally underserved verticals - where latent user demand significantly exceeds current protocol capacity.

Historically, Kamino has been the flagship lending platform on Solana, comprising a comprehensive suite of structured yield vaults, risk-managed automated strategies, and capital-efficient lending products. It currently holds $2.3B in TVL, representing approximately 70% of Solana's total lending market.

The competitive landscape shifted materially in August with the launch of JupLend, developed in partnership with Fluid. JupLend has rapidly surpassed $1B in TVL, propelled by Jupiter's unparalleled user moat. As the central hub for retail and institutional order flow - spanning DEX aggregation, perpetual futures, liquid staking, wallets, launchpads, prediction markets, and now lending - Jupiter's ecosystem provides JupLend with distribution and engagement advantages that would struggle to be replicated by a standalone lending protocol.

While we anticipate JupLend will overtake Kamino in market share by the end of 2026, the competitive dynamics within Solana's lending ecosystem are more likely to drive total market expansion rather than a winner-take-most outcome. Both Kamino and Jupiter are well-positioned to jointly broaden Solana's lending TAM, attract borrowers migrating from other chains, and support a wider range of collateral types as the ecosystem matures.

Looking ahead, we expect Solana-based lending protocols to continue gaining market share relative to Ethereum, driven by Solana's deep trading flows, growing stablecoin economy, and high user engagement. Within the ecosystem, JupLend is positioned to emerge as the dominant lending platform, benefiting from Jupiter's unmatched distribution network and its central role in Solana's broader user and liquidity funnel.

KPIs to monitor:

Liquid staking has emerged as a major growth sector within the Solana ecosystem, with nearly $10B in TVL, though it still represents only 16% of global liquid staking activity across all chains. Solana has long offered a compelling staking profile - driven by attractive supply inflation dynamics that translate into yields near 7% APY - and liquid staking derivatives (LSTs) amplify this value by enabling staked SOL to be reused across DeFi for borrowing, lending, leveraged strategies, and complex yield construction. With 67.7% of all SOL currently staked, the LST sector still has substantial room to scale.

JitoSOL began 2025 as the dominant LST, leveraging MEV-powered rewards, early integrations, and first-mover advantage to capture 36% market share. However, as new LSTs have launched and matured, JitoSOL's dominance has declined to 23%, reflecting a more competitive and diversified market. LSTs have also become a new avenue for DATs to deploy capital into the Solana ecosystem, exemplified by Forward Industries' fwdSOL product.

A standout beneficiary of this trend is Sanctum, which is helping redefine Solana's LST landscape. Unlike Ethereum - where Lido's stETH controls roughly 60% of the market - Solana's liquid staking ecosystem is far more fragmented, composable, and competitive. Sanctum's mission is to enable an “infinite LSTs” environment, where potentially thousands of LST variants can coexist, all interoperable and fully liquid through Sanctum's routing layer. This model allows validators, projects, DATs, and infrastructure providers to differentiate themselves by issuing bespoke LSTs that appeal to specific communities or yield profiles.

For example, while native staking yields are broadly uniform across validators, certain providers have introduced differentiated reward structures. Laine, for instance, distributed additional block rewards to laineSOL holders - resulting in yields more than double those available through standard native staking. This highlights the flexibility and innovation possible within Solana's LST ecosystem and underscores why the sector is poised for further expansion.

We expect Solana's liquid staking market share to expand from 10% to 15% in 2026, mirroring the growth trajectory observed in 2025. In parallel, the number of LSTs on Solana is projected to increase from 34 to more than 50, as developers, validators, and ecosystem participants continue to leverage Sanctum's “infinite LST” architecture to launch differentiated staking derivatives.

KPIs to monitor:

Solana's stablecoin footprint expanded significantly in 2025, underscoring the network's growing importance as a settlement layer for both retail and institutional flows. The total market capitalization of stablecoins on Solana surpassed $15B, reaching a new all-time high. More than 50 distinct stablecoins now circulate on the network, with USDC representing 69% of the total supply. Solana's appeal is driven by its extremely low transaction fees and sub-second confirmation times, which make it an ideal environment for high-volume payments and capital movement.

USDC on Solana has emerged as Circle's premier deployment for fast, low-cost on-chain payments and DeFi liquidity. Solana now leads all blockchains in monthly USDC senders, representing one-third of global active USDC users. Since October 2023, monthly USDC senders on Solana have grown 10x, from roughly 300,000 to more than 3M.

October marked a milestone month for USDC activity on Solana, with $626B in adjusted transaction volume - a 4.6x increase from the previous month and the highest level ever recorded. Peer-to-peer USDC transfers also hit a record $98B, further signaling the shift in user behavior.

The takeaway is clear: Solana's stablecoin economy is transitioning from speculative trading toward real, utility-driven payment flows. The network's combination of performance, cost-efficiency, and developer tooling positions it as one of the most important stablecoin settlement environments in the market today.

Solana's 2025 partnerships with traditional payments and finance companies highlights the chain's focus on distribution partners and embedded presence inside global fintech apps. In 2025 alone, Western Union announced its plan to launch U.S. Dollar Payment Token (USDPT), its new stablecoin on Solana. Cash App with 57M users announced their plans to enable USDC payments early 2026, all powered by Solana. Revolut has expanded its crypto payment tools by integrating Solana for direct transfers, withdrawals, and staking.

While Solana is likely to face competition from the new stablechains such as Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc, Solana has the advantage of being a consumer ecosystem with DeFi-native integration, consumer applications and millions of active addresses.

We expect Solana to further solidify its position as a top-tier global network for stablecoin issuance and payment settlement in 2026, supported by continued expansion in stablecoin supply and accelerating real-world transactional demand.

KPIs to monitor:

Solana is uniquely well-positioned to support DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) deployments where token incentives to crowdsource physical infrastructure like wireless networks, mapping, and sensors. DePIN applications require low fees, high throughput, and near-real-time settlement because devices continuously stream data and execute micropayments. Solana's technical profile fits these requirements better than most chains, which is why it already hosts 70+ DePIN projects and millions of connected nodes.

However, the core today is tokenomics: high emissions are often required to bootstrap participation, which creates sustained sell pressure and weak token performance. Helium illustrates this well - the network recently reached an all-time high in annualized income after deciding to burn its MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) subscription revenue. Yet the token continues to decline, as emissions still outweigh revenue capture. This makes DePIN a high-potential but very forward-looking sector.

The whole DEPIN sector is currently a $12B market cap sector which the World Economic Forum projects to grow to $3.5T by 2028, highlighting the growth potential of the sector. One of the catalysts ahead for the DePIN sector is the upcoming humanoid robotics wave where crowdsourced physical data could improve AI perception and coordination, with blockchains handling incentives and settlement. Looking ahead, DePIN networks could become data and sensor layers for robotics and autonomous systems - a subsector now referred to as Decentralized Physical AI Infrastructure (DePAI).

DePIN's fundamentals are improving, but tokenomics remain the gating factor. If that challenge is resolved over time, Solana is well positioned to be one of the core infrastructure layers supporting both physical networks and physical AI. Nevertheless, we expect Solana's market share within the DePIN sector to expand from 12% to more than 15% in 2026, supported by a steady pipeline of new DePIN deployments and Solana's technical advantages for real-world infrastructure networks.

KPIs to monitor:

AI Agents and foundational model tokens were among the most prominent narratives of 2024, with projects such as ai16z and Virtuals Protocol reaching peak valuations near $3B. However, the market cycle proved short-lived: as speculative enthusiasm faded, many of these tokens retraced more than 90% from their all-time highs.

Despite this correction, the broader technological arc remains intact. The global shift toward an agentic computing paradigm is unmistakable, and the convergence of blockchain infrastructure and AI agents is emerging as a compelling long-term theme. Blockchains offer critical primitives that address many of the structural limitations of autonomous AI systems - verifiable identity, permissionless coordination, transparent decision frameworks, programmable money, and instant settlement - all of which become essential in a machine-driven economy.

Solana is particularly well-positioned to serve as a foundational execution layer for AI agents due to its parallelized runtime, high throughput, sub-second latency, and minimal transaction costs. These attributes allow autonomous agents to operate continuously, execute high-frequency interactions, and manage real-time economic activity at scale. As a result, Solana - alongside Base - now hosts the largest number of on-chain AI agents, reflecting early developer preference and strong ecosystem alignment with this emerging frontier.

A rapidly emerging narrative in 2025 is the rise of the x402 protocol, which enables frictionless micropayments across the internet - allowing value to move as seamlessly as data packets. x402 represents a fundamental shift in payment architecture: moving away from human-mediated, subscription-based models toward real-time, machine-to-machine (M2M) economic activity. With x402, agents can pay per request for data, services, and model access - without API keys, pre-funding requirements, or custodial intermediaries. This unlocks entirely new use cases: AI agents can purchase market data in real time, autonomous systems can settle for computational resources instantly, and microtransactions become economically viable at massive scale.

Recent ecosystem data illustrates how quickly this paradigm is taking hold. While Base initially processed nearly 100% of x402 transactions, Solana has rapidly emerged as a major settlement layer for the protocol. Over the past month, Solana's share of x402 activity has climbed toward a 50/50 split, and in recent days the network has handled more than 95% of total dollar volume. This shift reflects Solana's inherent strengths - low fees, high throughput, and sub-second finality - which are critical for high-intensity machine to machine payment flows.

We expect AI agents and decentralized AI infrastructure to emerge as a defining theme in 2026, with Solana continuing to lead speculative and early-stage adoption within this category. The maturation of agentic systems, combined with Solana's performance advantages, positions the network as a natural execution layer for autonomous economic activity.

Similarly, we anticipate x402-enabled micropayments to become a prominent narrative as machine-to-machine interactions gain traction. As integrations proliferate across AI agent frameworks, Solana is well positioned to overtake Base as the dominant settlement layer for x402 payments, supported by its low-latency, high-throughput architecture.

The Zcash ecosystem experienced a breakout year in 2025, driven primarily by a resurgent privacy narrative that fueled a 458% rally. This momentum was mirrored in network fundamentals: shielded supply more than doubled (from 2m to 4.6m) and transaction levels rose from 21k to 45k, with shielded transfers accounting for 20% of total activity. Notably, ZEC briefly flipped Monero XMR$434.07 to become the largest privacy asset by market cap. As of late November 2025, ZEC held a 41.5% market share, positioning it just behind XMR (47%).

Shielded ZEC supply nearly tripled in 2025, reaching roughly 4.8M ZEC, or about nearly 30% of circulating supply. Z→Z transactions (shielded to shielded transfers that are fully private on both sides) have risen to 20% of network volume, up from low single digits three years ago.

Zashi served as a driver of these moves as it made privacy the default. The wallet auto-shields incoming funds, refuses unshielded spending, and rotates receiving addresses automatically.

This is the first time Zcash's privacy UX feels consumer-grade. A typical user can shield, swap, and spend in under two minutes, and fee friction is negligible. As the shielded pool expands, the anonymity set strengthens, and each new user benefits from the privacy created by those before them and creates a compounding loop.

At current growth rates, Zcash is on track for shielded flows to overtake transparent flows by 2026, marking a structural shift in how the network is used.

KPIs to monitor:

Zashi's CrossPay effectively positions Zcash as a cross-chain privacy router. It enables users to spend ZEC privately while recipients settle in ETH, USDC, BTC, or other supported assets—bypassing the need for bridges and preventing metadata leakage.

This is powered by NEAR Intents, a system using a solver that pays the destination asset on the destination chain and receives ZEC from the sender's shielded address. The solver never learns who the sender is. ZEC weekly volumes via Near intents have averaged over $100m in weekly volumes in November 2025 alone - accounting for roughly 12% of all Near intents volumes.

The expectation here is that given the interest in privacy and the longer term thesis around the importance of privacy, this metric will likely continue to rise - hence, monitoring it is a good proxy to keep tabs on ZCash's cross chain interest.

KPIs to monitor:

The ZCash developers fully believe that quantum computing will become a real threat for ZCash and other blockchains - even though there is no clarity on when this might happen.

ZCash's shielded transactions already achieve post-quantum privacy in many cases - quantum adversaries cannot compromise on-chain anonymity. This is mostly due to ZCash's use of zero knowledge proofs.

The only tangible concern for the protocol lies around the potential vulnerability of elliptic curve cryptography. As per the developers, “These cryptographic breakthroughs would put the soundness of our protocol in jeopardy, which would possibly allow counterfeiting or (somewhat equivalently) theft of user funds, though not necessarily pose a risk to user privacy”.

Quantum computing is not a 2025 narrative and may not even be a 2026 threat but it is an important narrative to follow - especially given the above context. Protocol designers at the electric Coin Company (developers behind ZCash) have spent time in the past year developing techniques in Zcash's shielded transactions (for Orchard) for quantum recoverability.

The core integration here - a change in the way wallets work - is expected to be done in 2026. Post this integration, if quantum computers do suddenly appear then users can safely recover their funds.

Other improvements in the pipeline include working on a general purpose long-term storage protocol that allows users to fortify their (cold storage) funds.

KPIs to monitor:

Despite AVAX price falling approximately 62% through November 2025 - a decline consistent with non-Ethereum/Solana alt-L1s - the network's adoption metrics showed positive growth. TVL increased from 49M AVAX to 123M AVAX while spot DEX volumes rose from an average of $6B to $10B (Q4 comparison).

This contradiction highlights that, fundamentally, the network succeeded in attracting capital and activity, with app revenue growing organically from $3.2M to $4.5M. This sustained increase in core utility suggests that the market volatility and price decline were driven by broader market deleveraging against speculative L1s, rather than a failure of the Avalanche network itself.

Avalanche's stablecoin market cap did not expand in 2025 (declining from $2.2B to $1.7B), but the composition shift was the primary narrative. This change signaled the network's successful pivot toward becoming the institutional-grade rail for Real-World Assets (RWAs).

New compliant stablecoins like BlackRock's BUIDL and Avant's avUSD now collectively account for over 20% of the top six stablecoins by market cap, eroding the dominance of older assets like USDC and USDT.

avUSD is paired with savUSD, a yield-bearing variant that integrates DeFi-native strategies with Real-World Assets (RWAs). This structure, designed for institutional-grade access, allows capital to earn compliant yield without leaving the Avalanche ecosystem.

Institutional players like Nonco built FX On-Chain, an infrastructure directly on Avalanche that automates compliant conversions between USD-backed and local currency-backed assets (e.g., AUSD). This eliminates off-chain friction, creating efficient rails for payments, remittances, and treasury operations.

Avalanche now supports over $700M in tokenized RWAs. The deployment of Grove's $250M on-chain credit (with Janus Henderson) and Skybridge's $300M in tokenized assets more than doubled the network's tokenized value, building on a roster that includes funds from Apollo, WisdomTree, KKR, and BlackRock.

BlackRock's BUIDL fund, issued via Securitize, brings U.S. Treasury ownership on-chain, and on Avalanche, it can be used as DeFi collateral through sTokens.

Avalanche attracted this institutional flow by offering sub-second finality for predictable settlement and launching key upgrades like Octane (which cut gas costs) and Firewood (which targets high-throughput state access). The Subnet architecture further enables institutions to deploy tailored, compliance-aware environments. The expectation is that this trend will sustain in 2026.

KPIs to monitor:

The Liquid Staking (LST) narrative on Avalanche in 2025 focused on transforming staked AVAX into highly flexible and scalable collateral. The sector saw robust growth, with the market leader Benqi increasing its staked AVAX from 20M to 33M this year.

This success was built on increasing LST utility, with platforms like Suzaku (230k AVAX in TVL) enabling users to restake their AVAX LSTs to secure emerging Avalanche L1s (Subnets) , which validates the network's modular architecture and its superior composability and speed.

The long-term value of LSTs lies in their role within on-chain capital allocation, which bridges the gap between basic DeFi yield and institutional-grade finance. Protocols like Upshift are emerging as specialized allocators, offering managed vaults that automate market-making and yield optimization.

More crucially, Upshift is developing a cross-chain prime brokerage that will allow users to borrow, lend, trade, and settle across chains using liquid-staked collateral, including OTC perps and structured swaps. Similarly, Turtle Club is positioned as a sophisticated distribution protocol aiming to offer a safeguarding layer in DeFi with collective due diligence, though its initial TVL saw a decline from 9M to under 4M AVAX by year-end.

This entire LST ecosystem also provides the necessary leverage and capital efficiency to fuel the RWA narrative. LSTs create productive capital from a static asset (staked AVAX); this capital is then used as collateral to interact with the RWA sector.

As the on-chain capital allocators (like Upshift) continue to mature, they will increasingly facilitate the deployment of this crypto-native capital into compliant assets, reinforcing the RWA narrative and scaling institutional exposure on Avalanche. The expectation is that the usability of LSTs will continue to expand into complex, institutional-grade products, confirming the essential role of LSTs in Avalanche's capital stack.

The core concern here is: LSTs and LRTs have hit a stagnation point on other chains such as Ethereum - this is likely to happen on Avalanche too given the usability of LSTs is limited - and unless we see extreme growth in protocols such as Turtle Club/Upshift - would likely limit the upside for LSTs on Avalanche.

Avalanche's spot DEX volumes saw material growth in 2025, rising from an average of $6B in Q4 2024 to over $10B in Q4 2025. The key narrative shifted to the dominance and market structure within this volume, favoring native protocols employing the concentrated liquidity and emissions models.

We also saw a tiny meme launchpad phase on Avalanche - The ""Arena Phase"" - a short-lived meme launchpad narrative on Avalanche - which has collapsed, with monthly volumes dropping sharply from a peak of $300M in May 2025 to only $3M in November 2025.

The market is increasingly dominated by two native protocols, Pharaoh (utilizing the ve(3,3) model) and Blackhole, which currently generate roughly equivalent trading volumes.

While volumes are similar, the structural expectation is that the Pharaoh ve(3,3) model will dominate the liquidity landscape over time, similar to the observed effect of ve(3,3) protocols (e.g., Aerodrome) capturing share against traditional Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

KPIs to monitor:

The Gaming narrative on Avalanche in 2025 was dominated by the interest in Maplestory, though the lack of corresponding token activity suggests the narrative remains fundamentally unverified and unsustainable.

The primary driver was the MapleStory Universe (MSU), an Avalanche-based Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), which delivered significant growth in user activity. Activity saw a huge jump in June 2025, with the ecosystem's Monthly Active Wallets (MAW) increasing by more than 100% to over 1.36M from just 600,000 in May.

Despite the impressive user numbers, the narrative is challenged by the failure of these users to translate into sustainable, measurable economic activity:

Overall expectation is that this divergence between reported fundamentals for Maplestory and the token performance will likely continue.

KPIs to monitor:

NEAR is a high-throughput, low-latency layer-1 blockchain built with a strong focus on usability, scalability, and developer abstraction. Its architecture combines sharded execution, native account abstraction, a chain-abstraction layer, and AI-ready infrastructure. Together, these components position NEAR as a coordination layer that seamlessly abstracts away underlying chains and supports the next generation of AI-powered agents.

Like many altcoins, NEAR too has faced significant market pressure this year. Its price has fallen 63.2% year-to-date, currently trading at $1.81. On-chain activity has also softened in 2025: total transactions have declined 12.0% to 1.90B, while fees generated on the network have dropped 56.6% to $2.94M compared with 2024.

Despite the steep decline in token price, NEAR has continued to advance its core infrastructure and performance capabilities. The network recently reduced block times to 600ms, with finality achieved in just 1.2 seconds. Enabled by the “optimistic block” upgrade introduced in Nightshade 2.0, this enhancement allows shards to begin processing transactions without waiting for full block propagation - effectively cutting latency in half. In parallel, NEAR expanded from six to nine shards in 2025, boosting overall network throughput by roughly 33%.

NEAR has also refined its tokenomics model. On October 30, 2025, the network reduced its annual token inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%, resulting in approximately 60M new tokens entering circulation each year. Correspondingly, staking rewards for validators securing the network were adjusted from 9% to 4.75%, based on the assumption that half of the total token supply remains staked.

At the same time, NEAR has continued to broaden its ecosystem through growing collaborations with Privy, Everclear, KyberSwap, Infinex, Zcash, CowSwap and others - partnerships that reinforce its long-term vision of a chain-abstracted, AI-enabled blockchain network.

Chain abstraction refers to simplifying interactions across multiple blockchain networks by hiding underlying technical complexity from both users and developers. As cross-chain interoperability has grown into one of crypto's biggest challenges, NEAR has introduced an elegant solution. Just as the invention of money abstracted away the limitations of barter, chain abstraction removes the friction of navigating a multi-chain world.

With NEAR Intents and chain signatures, anyone can seamlessly interact with any supported blockchain from any other supported chain. For example, NEAR Intents makes it possible for a user to pay with shielded ZCash while a merchant receives stablecoins on Solana - fast, inexpensive, and without either party having to understand the technical steps happening behind the scenes. Chain signatures extend this capability by allowing NEAR accounts, including smart contracts, to sign and execute transactions across numerous blockchain protocols using derivation paths, multi-chain smart contracts, and a secure multi-party computation service.

NEAR Intents is already leading the industry-wide shift toward chain abstraction. The framework has been adopted by dozens of protocols and applications - including Zashi Wallet and Raydium - and is facilitating real, meaningful usage. To date, NEAR Intents has powered more than 10M swaps, generated over $10M in fees, and enabled more than $6.5B in transfers. In short, NEAR has delivered chain abstraction not as a theory, but as a production-ready, widely-used reality. Since the start of the year, Near has integrated with 15 more blockchain networks, bringing the total number of chains integrated with Near Intents to 24.

We expect continued expansion of NEAR Intents adoption in 2026, with more blockchains integrating NEAR's chain-signature infrastructure and total transfer volume increasing at an exponential pace as cross-chain abstraction gains traction.

KPIs to monitor:

NEAR's origins are deeply rooted in artificial intelligence. Before it ever touched blockchains, the project began as NEAR.AI, an AI startup founded by Alexander Skidanov. Its evolution into a blockchain platform was shaped by the belief that AI would ultimately require an open, scalable, user-sovereign infrastructure. NEAR's trajectory is further defined by its cofounder Illia Polosukhin, who co-authored Attention Is All You Need, the foundational paper that sparked the Large Language Model revolution.

As the world moves toward an AI agentic economy, individuals may rely on many specialized autonomous agents to perform tasks on their behalf-managing assets, executing workflows, processing information, or interacting across chains. Supporting this future requires a blockchain capable of scaling elastically while remaining secure and decentralized. NEAR's sharding architecture delivers this foundation. By splitting network state into parallel shards, NEAR achieves high throughput and low-cost computation, similar to how large tech companies like Google and Amazon use sharding for global-scale systems. Each account lives on a specific shard, allowing NEAR to increase capacity as demand grows and support AI-level transaction volumes. On December 8th, NEAR announced that the blockchain has achieved 1M transactions per second (TPS) in a publicly verifiable benchmark.

On this base layer, NEAR is building a comprehensive stack for AI-native applications. Foundation-led initiatives such as Shade Agents enable developers to build decentralized, trustless AI agents that can operate accounts and assets across multiple blockchains. Paired with the MCP Server -an open-source toolkit with more than 20 integration modules-AI agents can sign transactions, manage keys, execute swaps, and interact with contracts in a standardized, secure way.

Currently there are over 50 teams actively building AI-driven applications, research projects, and tooling on Near, laying the groundwork for being a leader in the decentralized AI space.These include emerging AI marketplaces and services - Bitte, Public AI, Fraction, IQ, Intellex, and more-forming the early architecture of an agent-driven ecosystem.

In December, NEAR introduced two new AI-focused products - NEAR AI Cloud and Private Chat - further strengthening its position as an AI-native blockchain ecosystem. NEAR AI Cloud enables users to run AI models with full privacy, offering verifiable private inference through hardware-enforced security. By leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) alongside on-chain verification, it ensures that computations remain confidential, tamper-proof, and entirely under the user's control - all while providing access to leading AI models without compromising sensitive data.

Private Chat, a ChatGPT-like LLM assistant built on this infrastructure, extends these guarantees to everyday interactions. Conversations are processed privately within NEAR AI Cloud, ensuring that user data remains secure and inaccessible to third parties.

With scalable infrastructure, agent frameworks, and developer tooling converging, AI is positioned to become one of NEAR's most important narratives over the next year. The network is no longer just AI-friendly - it is architected for AI-native applications that demand autonomy, privacy, and massive throughput.

We expect the Near to establish real product-market fit in Crypto x AI with 2 or more AI-native applications reaching meaningful usage and AI-driven workloads making up more than 5% of NEAR's total transactions.

KPIs to monitor:

Despite the decline in the dollar value of assets across the NEAR ecosystem - from $246M to roughly $169M - the network's underlying capacity to support applications and protocols that achieve genuine product-market fit remains intact. This durability is rooted in NEAR's long-term strategy of building a developer-centric, intent-driven infrastructure stack, enabling applications to tap into chain abstraction, seamless cross-chain execution, and highly efficient runtime environments.

The benefits of this architecture are now materializing. In November, NEAR App Fees reached an all-time high, signaling a decisive shift from foundational infrastructure development to sustained real-world usage. Both DeFi protocols and consumer applications are increasingly leveraging NEAR's unique capabilities, reinforcing its position as an ecosystem designed not just to scale - but to empower applications that can scale with it.

At the center of the ecosystem's acceleration is Rhea Finance, the unified protocol formed from the merger of Ref Finance and Burrow Finance. Now commanding 51% of NEAR's ecosystem TVL, Rhea embodies the network-level advantages enabled by NEAR's infrastructure. By integrating NEAR Intents, Rhea offers frictionless liquidity aggregation and cross-chain execution - a capability amplified by the recent privacy tailwinds created through CrossPay swaps with Zcash, which allow users to transact across chains with increased confidentiality. This positions Rhea not merely as a DeFi hub, but as NEAR's most comprehensive liquidity and execution center, bridging Bitcoin, NEAR, and EVM ecosystems into a unified environment.

Liquid staking remains a second anchor of NEAR's DeFi landscape. Meta Pool (65M NEAR), LiNEAR Protocol (53M NEAR), and TruFin Protocol (16M NEAR) continue to attract meaningful inflows, benefiting from NEAR's low-latency execution and predictable transaction costs. These protocols integrate seamlessly with the broader ecosystem, reinforcing yield-generating strategies and supplying high-quality collateral to Rhea and other DeFi primitives. Meanwhile, early interest in tokenized real-world assets is emerging through KAIO, now holding 13M NEAR in TVL.

Wallets are also benefiting from NEAR's architectural advantages. Hot Wallet and Sweat Wallet, both of which rely on MPC-based flows, have incorporated Chain Signatures and NEAR Intents to streamline cross-chain and cross-application activity. Hot Protocol, the MPC network underpinning Hot Wallet, enables smart contracts to securely create and manage private keys, aligning security with ease of use. Sweat Wallet, backed by Sweat Economy, continues expanding a movement-driven token ecosystem, powered by NEAR's ability to handle large-scale interactions without compromising user experience.

Templar Finance further highlights NEAR's architectural advantage with its Cypher Lending, a product designed to natively extend credit across chains. Cypher lending enables users to borrow stablecoins such as USDC or USDT against native assets from other ecosystems - including BTC, ZEC, Solana, and Stellar - without bridges, wrapped assets, custodians, KYC, or intermediaries. Rather than importing risk through wrapped collateral, assets remain on their origin chains while credit is issued through NEAR. This is made possible by NEAR's Chain Signatures and MPC, which enable secure, intent-driven cross-chain execution while preserving user sovereignty and privacy.

Taken together, these trends reinforce a clear structural trajectory: NEAR has built a foundational infrastructure stack that applications can exploit for scalability, privacy-enhanced cross-chain execution, and frictionless user experiences. As more protocols integrate NEAR Intents and benefit from privacy-forward flows like CrossPay + Zcash, we expect application-layer TVL on NEAR to expand meaningfully.

We expect NEAR's ecosystem TVL to expand from 160M NEAR to over 200M NEAR in 2026, mirroring the growth pace achieved in 2025 and supported by deeper DeFi engagement and stablecoin adoption.

Eight months after the North Carolina House gave the green light to the state treasurer to invest a small percentage of the state's pension fund in cryptocurrencies, a legislative committee met Wednesday to explore alternative uses for blockchain and digital assets.

Rep. David Willis acknowledged that while there's still a big learning curve for many legislators, there is also great opportunity.

“We're here to talk about real-world applications that can be used for government efficiency and accountability,” said Willis.

The Union County Republican said North Carolina needs to position itself to leverage the technology and be at the forefront of an industry that's going to create new jobs and new companies.

Michael Postupak, the policy engagement manager for the nonprofit Blockchain Association, told lawmakers that to understand the benefits, it helps to visualize blocks in a blockchain as data where new transactions can be added. New blocks of data are connected through cryptography, essentially a unique digital fingerprint or ‘hash.' And as more blocks are added, more cryptography enters the system, becoming a much stronger record.

Postupak said owners have full control of their digital assets with a public address and a private digital key.

“Blockchains are powered by a global, decentralized distributed network of computers that verify, secure and digitally store information,” Postupak explained. “With these networks being supported by hundreds, if not thousands, of computers globally, the chance that there's ever a network failure is almost zero.”

“So, who are these decentralized computers? How do we know that's a trustworthy source?” asked Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake).

Postupak said the number of computers in the network prevents the information from being tampered with. In Bitcoin's vast network of thousands of computers, to take control of the network, you would have to have control over 50% of the computers in that network, he said.

“Could we use this blockchain technology for voting online?” Dahle asked. “Would that make it safer for casting ballots or for military people to cast ballots from overseas?”

“I know that's something that countries and municipalities around the world are looking at,” said Postupak, who added he would need more time to research the question.

Anthony Janocko with New York-based Ava Labs, said California's DMV is a good example of how governments can use the technology. Their blockchain infrastructure has been enormously successful in digitizing 42 million car titles.

“That's another way you can think about digital assets — it's basically taking something that exists in the real world, then applying it to the framework of blockchain technology, allowing for some of the digital ownership and provability of those assets online,” said Janocko.

In the case of the California DMV, residents had access to verifiable digital credentials and the ability to check on the status of their digital titles.

“Each event or digital asset or title in its lifecycle process was basically being tacked onto the blockchain,” Janocko explained.“When users or DMV workers need to look up certain titles, they're able to see that full history.”

Janocko said the end result is an auditable log of all the previous transactions that exist on a ledger, reducing time during an audit or reconciliation. He said it's a far better system than a traditional database, which often cannot be shared across agencies.

“What the blockchain solved with this case is, it created a tamper-proof system of record of ownership of vehicles, allowing for real-time updates and verification of history of those specific titles,” he said.

Janocko said the blockchain infrastructure is not about rebuilding government systems from scratch. Rather, it's about adding a modern shared system of records underneath that can be referenced with a high degree of integrity.

Wyoming is exploring blockchain technology with the first state-issued stable token. In its pilot, real-time government contractor payments using the token, managed on a blockchain network, reduced the timelines for payouts from 45 days to just a few seconds.

John Bridge of the Atlanta-based firm Trust Stamp said blockchain is being used in Africa to digitize property records and improve accountability.

A permissioned blockchain allows multiple agencies to access the records, with the chain recording if any errors were made, when a correction occurred, and who made the correction.

“We're able to see that full data. That increases transparency and trust in the system. And then it also speeds up the sales and transfers,” explained Bridge.

Baltimore County is using the technology in a pilot project to more accurately assess distressed properties, said Bridge. Payment and delinquency events can be tracked more easily, improving collections efficiency.

Improving services at the DMV and revenue collection are two areas that hold great appeal for North Carolina lawmakers heading into 2026.

While Wednesday's committee hearing was for informational purposes, Rep. Willis said it was clear that blockchain technology is the future of data retention.

“This isn't just a fad. Whatever we can do to help get ahead and craft what that's going to look like and for the betterment of North Carolina and the efficiency of our government, we're all for it,” said Willis.

By CryptoNinjas Editorial Team

In the last few years, casino gaming has started to change faster than anyone expected. Players once lined up at smoky tables; now they tap shiny apps on their phones. Behind this new scene stands a rising star: blockchain. When mixed with the thrill of slots and cards, the result is the modern crypto casino, a place where code, not people, runs the game. Early adopters cheer the change because they want games that feel fair, fast, and borderless. Yet many still wonder what tomorrow will look like. Will chips turn into tokens? Will dealers be replaced by smart contracts? This article explores the future of casino gaming on blockchain, showing how trust, rewards, speed, and even regulation may shift in ways that make gambling both safer and more exciting for players around the world. From play-to-earn models to virtual reality tables, a new chapter is opening, and the cards are already on the digital felt.

Blockchain's greatest contribution to casino gaming is trust-building within its code. Traditional online houses require players to trust that operators shuffle fairly and deliver as promised, but blockchain gives casino gamers the confidence that trust will always exist between each participant and operator. With a distributed ledger, each spin, shuffle, and payout is recorded publicly, so no one can change them behind closed doors – making cheating significantly harder and auditing much simpler. Furthermore, smart contracts make this possible because rules reside directly on the blockchain instead of sitting behind locked server rooms. When a player wins, the program releases their prize automatically without staff having any chance to delay or change it. Cryptographic proofs such as “provably fair” hashes allow curious players to independently verify each game on their screens. People no longer require a math degree; step-by-step guides demonstrate how to copy a seed number and verify its result. As the network is global, this transparent model works whether users live in Lagos, Lima or London. Trust no longer remains an unproven marketing claim – rather, it becomes an integral technical feature. When faith returns in fairness online betting becomes much safer.  

One of the most exciting developments associated with blockchain casinos is the rise of play-to-earn models. Under such systems, every hand or spin can deliver small tokens into a player's wallet even if he or she loses the main bet. Houses set aside part of their revenue to create loyalty pools and convert an evening of entertainment into an income source. Tokens may offer voting rights over game settings, entry to special tournaments, or a share of future profits. Because rewards sit on blockchain, they can move freely between wallets allowing players to trade them for other coins or real-world cash. Some projects even allow gamblers to reinvest the tokens back into the platform in exchange for a share of its rake, turning each gambler into an individual mini-shareholder. This shift blurs the distinction between customer and owner, encouraging longer sessions and stronger community ties. Additionally, this approach opens doors to creative promotions such as limited-edition NFT jackpots that celebrate major events or famous card hands. As these ideas spread further outward, whole ecosystems of tip bots, side games, and community jackpots spring up around core tables in an effort to turn your casino into a vibrant social hub.

Traditional online casinos often rely on bank wires or card networks with hidden fees and long wait times; blockchain can remove many of these roadblocks quickly; when sending crypto to fund an account it could settle within seconds or minutes instead of taking days to clear out of escrow. Smart contracts can even use stablecoin deposits as deposits, protecting their balance from price swings while still remaining on-chain. Lower fees mean smaller minimum bets and faster micro-payouts which attract casual players who previously felt priced out; as well as global access. Teenagers living in rural Vietnam with smartphones and cheap data plans can join the same blackjack table as retirees from Spain without fear of the chips freezing mid-hand or any central bank intervening to freeze them mid-game; of course, casinos must still abide by local regulations while the tech itself doesn't care about borders. As a result, they create an international lobby where chat windows incorporate various languages and cultures, creating an energetic experience unattainable in traditional venues. Furthermore, faster rails enable operators to stream live dealer games in high definition to give a player the impression that they are at their table even while traveling across the country on public transit.

Though blockchain casinos appear promising, they still face hurdles that may hamper their growth. Scalability is one such barrier; popular networks often clog during peak usage periods and turn instant bets into long waits and an increase in gas fees as a result. Layer-two solutions and faster chains such as Solana or Polygon aim to solve this issue, but their race remains ongoing. Regulation presents another complication; governments worry about money laundering and underage gambling so they create complex regulations which vary from one country to the next. Licensed operators are exploring “on-chain KYC,” in which users keep their identity tokens hidden in private wallets and disclose them only to approved auditors. User experience needs improvement as wallet extensions, seed phrases, and gas settings might disorient those more used to simple email logins. Designers have developed one-click sign-up forms that obscure crypto-jargon behind familiar buttons. Looking ahead, experts forecast an amalgamation between virtual reality and chain casinos, where players walk through three-dimensional halls while smart contracts take care of pots and payouts; once these puzzles have been solved, casinos could take on less the form of websites than more like massive multiplayer worlds powered by self-running code.

Home - Artificial Intelligence


December 19, 2025 @ 7:59 am By Tony Zerucha 



The Web3 and Fintech communities shared their thoughts on payments, blockchain, and more before jetting off for the holidays.

“CFOs are no longer asking if blockchain will be used in B2B payments—they're asking how fast they can transition to it. 

“With cross-border transactions still slow and expensive, stablecoins are emerging as a CFO-friendly solution that reduces FX slippage, accelerates settlement, and provides 24/7/365 liquidity. 

“As payment networks remove transaction fees and automate AR/AP workflows, finance leaders are reframing payments as a margin-enhancing function.   “In an era of bank outages, geopolitical disruptions, and fragmented payment partners, finance teams are reducing single-point-of-failure risk. Decentralized networks—are becoming a strategic hedge for treasury operations.”

– Jeremy Almond, CEO of Paystand

“The Fed Reserve will reduce interest rates by 1.75% by the end of 2026. The recent small reductions by the Fed still leave the Fed Funds rate about 185 basis points above historical levels. Powell is likely to reduce rates by another 50 basis points before the end of his term, with his successor returning rates to the historical norm. The net result will be lower borrowing costs, higher employment, and greater economic growth.

“The Fed Funds rate and what businesses pay for credit are highly coupled. Getting Fed Funds back in line will be a stimulus for greater business lending.

“Ahead of rate changes, potential borrowers (especially small business owners who have struggled to access capital with elevated interest rates) should prepare necessary materials for loan applications. When used properly, debt capital can be used for more than just added liquidity — it can support greater business expansion and profitability.”

– Pat Reily co-founder, Uplinq

“The geopolitical volatility will potentially stabilize in the new year. Risk around tariff uncertainty and interest rates will ease, unlocking stronger opportunities for business investment and global expansion. Heading into 2026, business leaders can stay ahead by closely tracking opportunities (and risks), and acting quickly when new opportunities emerge.

“As an entrepreneur who's navigated through economic volatility before, resilient growth always comes back to first principles thinking: strong value propositions and healthy unit economics. Companies that expand market share by solving real customer needs will thrive. Those that rely on ‘buying market share' can only sustain it for so long before they run out of capital and inevitably fall behind.”

– Chen Amit, CEO, Tipalti

“In 2026, UX isn't about having the most widgets. It's about how intuitive and easy solutions are to implement and use. Mid-sized companies are increasingly complex, and they expect straightforward technology that allows them to scale efficiently with improved visibility and control over business risk.”

“Despite some rhetoric, the world is becoming even more global, and so is the supply chain. As companies add international subsidiaries, they need banking, currencies, and payment capabilities that can cross borders. This means cash flow visibility will become much more critical and challenging, even as implementing increased global regulation and security standards creates greater complexity.”

– Robert Israch, president, Tipalti

“Another major challenge for businesses operating across volatile currency markets is leveraging stablecoins for global treasury management. For markets like Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa, stablecoins offer a practical solution for transparent, rapid value transfer while maintaining dollar balances locally.”

“Geopolitical volatility and rapid shifts in sanctions and regulations will be the dominant risks, with Venezuela serving as a prime example. For globally scaled companies, risk and compliance have become moving targets that require continuous adaptation. The challenge is staying abreast of rapid regulatory shifts to effectively manage currency exposure and develop hedging strategies.”

– Manish Vrishaketu, chief customer and operating officer, Tipalti

“In 2026, the key will be balancing dual mandates of investing in long-term innovation while driving efficient, profitable growth. Owners will need to move beyond a single annual budget to continuous, multi-scenario rolling forecasts.

“The CFO is already a vital role as the steward of financial health and compliance, but that role is expanding to become more of a ‘chief value officer' and architect of enterprise value. This should include co-owning digital transformation and acting as the primary translator and storyteller of business strategy for the investor community. The CFO needs to become the primary partner to the CEO, leveraging a single source of financial and operational data to drive cross-functional alignment, with an equal voice in decision-making.

“As we move into 2026, CFOs will also increasingly be viewed as ‘chief reality officers,' with their primary deliverables being confidence and readiness. Investors and boards will measure them not just by the accuracy of the past, but by the agility of their forecasting and the speed at which they can model and pivot the business in real-time.”

– Alex Cedro, VP of finance, Tipalti

“The biggest gap today is not the blockchain itself, but the persistent overestimation of what blockchain alone can actually solve. Blockchain guarantees immutability, not truth. It can ensure that a record has not been altered, but it cannot verify whether the original data is accurate, complete, or free from manipulation at the point of capture. In renewable energy and agriculture, the real bottleneck remains the lack of standardized, high-quality, georeferenced, and independently verifiable data.

“Most renewable certificate and environmental verification systems remain stuck in pilot phases because they still depend on inconsistent reporting standards, manual inputs, and fragmented verification processes. When upstream data is weak, blockchain does not fix the problem; it simply preserves flawed information permanently. The technology is often marketed as a final solution, when in reality it is only one integrity layer within a much larger verification system.

“The shift now underway, and likely to accelerate into 2026, is the convergence of blockchain with satellite monitoring, IoT sensors, AI-based risk models, and government-grade regulatory frameworks. In this integrated context, blockchain stops being the headline and becomes the backend infrastructure for auditability. By 2026, we should see fewer ‘blockchain-for-green' experiments and more fully automated, standardized, and end-to-end MRV (monitoring, reporting, and verification) systems where the real innovation lies in measurement and validation, not in the ledger itself.

“2026 can indeed become a real turning point for verification systems, but that will depend far less on blockchain itself and far more on the maturity of data integrity. What will define this moment is not the adoption of another technology layer, but the ability of the sector to deploy reliable digital measurement and validation systems at scale across energy, agriculture, and land use in a way that remains economically viable; without that, the entire effort becomes unsustainable.

“To achieve this, companies must also be able to take a critical view of their own processes and truly understand on-the-ground realities. Even the most advanced IT team adds little value if the organization does not understand how challenging real-world data collection can be in remote areas, or is not prepared to operate offline when connectivity simply is not available.

“There are encouraging signs. Satellite monitoring is now continuous and affordable, IoT sensors are cheaper and more robust, AI-based risk detection is reaching operational maturity, and regulators are beginning to build real digital environmental compliance frameworks. If these elements are integrated into standardized, end-to-end verification flows, blockchain naturally finds its place as an audit infrastructure. In that case, 2026 could mark the transition from experimentation to institutional-grade verification.

“At the same time, if the industry continues to prioritize token-driven narratives without fixing the weakness of data at the source, the risk of scaling greenwashing is very real. Blockchain does not stop poor data from entering the system. If projects remain dependent on self-reported information, manual checks, or opaque methodologies, the technology only makes those distortions more permanent, not more credible.

“So 2026 is not an automatic inflection point. It becomes one only if measurement, validation, and regulatory acceptance evolve at the expected pace. If they do, blockchain will fade from the spotlight and operate quietly as part of the trust infrastructure. If they do not, the same tools risk being used to scale greenwashing in digital form.”

– Jon Trask, CEO of blockchain-based enterprise system Dimitra

“The industry is currently obsessed with trying to settle every single transaction on-chain but the real solution is to allow parties to interact directly, without 30,000 computers supervising every step. 

“We need to fill the gap in Web3 stacks with trustless peer-to-peer communication that moves the security of DLT into the application level rather than relying on full blockchain verification for everything. 

“This high-performance Layer 3 architecture can create a complete system that finally realizes Satoshi's vision by making trading faster and safer through direct off-chain interactions.”

“The key problem Web3 faces is that trading remains centralized and dependent on trusting platform operators – yet the industry cannot mature in a system devoid of compliance and TradFi integrations. 

“A viable goal for the next cycle is TrustFi which solves this by embedding advanced decentralized solutions directly into TradFi rather than trying to circumvent it. Another way to integrate these worlds is for banking institutions to implement DeFi technology from the inside and scale that model for others. This approach allows traditional brokers to finally enter the digital asset sector and advise institutional clients, making the market more organized and protected by established financial systems.

“The next wave of value creation in Web3 will be driven by a new utility layer where developers build high-frequency applications that give the network substance, much like how the iOS app ecosystem defined the iPhone. 

“I would say we are at a similar stage to the Internet in the year 2000. To move beyond this early phase we must remove technical friction through account abstraction so users can access services with standard credentials instead of managing complex wallets. 

“This will enable immediate real-world usage like instant payments without block delays and create the environment for the next unicorn to be a fully automated organization that runs entirely on smart contracts, while its founders manage it from the beach.”

– Alexis Sirkia, chairman of Yellow Network

Walking into a casino has always been about flashing a shiny card, shaking a host's hand, or lining up at the front desk. Now a new pass is entering the scene: the NFT. Short for non-fungible token, an NFT can sit in a crypto wallet and still open real doors in the gaming world. Sportsbook fans interested in mixing tech with table games should swing by www.norge-casino.com for fresh ideas on modern RTP figures. By turning membership cards into digital collectibles, operators hope to make entry faster, safer, and a lot more fun. Each token acts like a barcode that cannot be copied, so only the true owner gets the perks. From early access to slot launches to invites for secret blackjack streams, NFT-based access is rewriting the house rules. First of all, the process happens on devices people already use daily, so there are no new gadgets to learn. This article breaks down how the system works, why casinos love it, and what everyday players stand to gain. Grab a seat and discover why the future of membership might live on the blockchain.

An NFT is a unique bit of code stored on a public blockchain. Because every token has its own serial number, it cannot be swapped like-for-like with another. That trait makes it perfect for acting as a digital key. When a casino mints a batch of membership NFTs, each one carries a record of the perks linked to it. Scanning the token is as simple as letting a mobile wallet app sign a small message. The blockchain then confirms ownership in seconds, giving the green light to doors, websites, or even a private poker lobby. Unlike plastic loyalty cards, these keys never wear out or end up lost in pockets. If a player sells or gifts the token, the benefits move with it, and the ledger still shows a clear chain of custody. That transparency helps casinos spot fraud fast while giving players proof that their VIP status is real and trackable.

For operators, switching to token-gated entry solves several headaches at once. First, it slashes printing and shipping costs tied to plastic cards or paper vouchers. A smart contract can issue thousands of NFTs in minutes, with no cardboard stacks to store. Second, the tokens open new income channels. Casinos can program a royalty into the contract, earning a small fee every time a membership changes hands on a marketplace. That ongoing revenue did not exist with old loyalty cards, which usually ended in the trash. Third, NFTs unlock better data. Because each on-chain action is public, marketing teams can see how often a token is traded, staked, or used to log in. Those insights help them shape events that keep high rollers coming back. Last but not least, security gets a boost. Fake IDs and copied cards are almost impossible with blockchain verification, cutting the risk of chargebacks and underage play. All together, the shift brings leaner budgets and cleaner operations. Another hidden bonus is marketing buzz. Early adopters can advertise themselves as forward-thinking venues, earning free press in crypto blogs and mainstream tech outlets that love futuristic success stories.

While casinos enjoy smoother systems, players are the true stars of the NFT show. The most obvious perk is portability. A single wallet app on a phone can hold dozens of casino passes, saving room in a purse or pocket. Some venues even sync their tokens with door scanners, letting guests walk straight to the buffet without lining up. Another advantage is provable rarity. Limited-edition NFTs can grant special status, like “Gold Tier 100,” and owners can see the supply cap on the chain. That knowledge makes the badge feel real and can raise its resale value if the holder ever wants to cash out. Plus, tokens often double as fun collectibles. Artwork from a famous designer on the face of the NFT can spark conversation at tables or online forums. Some casinos even tie tokens to charity drives, letting holders direct a slice of profits to good causes. Finally, membership moves become player-friendly. If someone takes a long break from gaming, they can loan or sell the token, turning dormant perks into quick cash instead of letting points expire.

The story of NFT memberships is only in its first chapter, and the next pages promise even bigger twists. Tech teams are testing dynamic tokens that level up as a player meets certain goals. Imagine a chip icon on the NFT that changes color after a million loyalty points, unlocking a free hotel suite on the spot. Cross-casino partnerships are also on the horizon. A traveler could flash one token in Las Vegas on Monday and use the same pass for complimentary drinks in Macau on Friday. Because blockchains are borderless, sharing reward logic between brands is far simpler than merging two bulky card systems. Regulators are watching closely, and clear rules will need to form around age checks, tax reporting, and problem-gaming limits. Yet the upside seems strong. By blending scarcity, mobility, and instant proof, NFTs give casinos and their guests a shared language that works both online and in the real world. As adoption grows, the house might not be the only one that always wins.

Willemstad, Curaçao, December 14th, 2025, Chainwire

 

Whale.io  has officially launched the $WHALE NFT collection on Solana, introducing the next phase of the platform's native token rollout and bringing the community one step closer to the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE).

The $WHALE NFTs – presented as fully tradable digital cards – represent a new value layer within the Whale ecosystem. Each card holds a fixed amount of $WHALE tokens locked on-chain and backed 1:1, making them redeemable at any time for the underlying tokens. Minting is now live exclusively at mintwhale.io , where users can acquire these asset-backed cards and begin trading immediately on secondary marketplaces such as Magic Eden.

This format transforms $WHALE into a hybrid asset: a collectible card that behaves like a traditional NFT while carrying real, instantly verifiable token value. Cards can be freely transferred, sold, or held, with the assurance that the locked $WHALE can always be unlocked and returned to the Whale.io platform when needed.

Key Benefits of the $WHALE NFT Model

Because every card is transparently backed by real $WHALE, value remains anchored and fully verifiable on-chain at all times.

Utility Already Live

$WHALE continues to serve as the native currency across Whale Originals titles, including Crock Dentist and Blackjack. Holders use it for gameplay, Battlepass purchases, staking rewards, and exclusive in-platform features – a utility that is available today and will expand significantly after TGE.

Next Steps on the Roadmap

Upcoming features include a Staking mechanism (locking liquid $WHALE into cards) and a dedicated Token Swapping interface for one-click redemption. Whale.io has also reaffirmed its commitment to regular market buybacks followed by permanent token burns to support long-term token health.

Participation Now Open

The $WHALE NFT collection is available for minting exclusively at mintwhale.io. Detailed card tiers, pricing, and redemption instructions are displayed on the site. All on-chain activity remains fully transparent through Whale.io's established Treasury wallets.

Community members are invited to follow @Whalegames_en on X for real-time mint updates, secondary market insights, and announcements on future roadmap milestones.

About Whale.io

Whale.io  is an online casino and sportsbook platform, recognized for its proprietary Whale Originals games and innovative reward systems. With $WHALE at its core, the platform combines provably fair gaming with community-owned economics and transparent tokenomics.

For complete details on the $WHALE NFT collection, users can visit mintwhale.io  or whale.io .

Bankless founder predicts a 2026 shift toward Wall Street tokenization, the return of regulated ICOs, and invisible DeFi integration.

Summary is AI generated, newsroom reviewed.

Hoffman predicts tokenization will become the Wall Street default.

Regulated ICOs may return as legal frameworks improve globally.

Stablecoin-based super-apps will use Ethereum as a banking backend.

Quantum computing risks might enter mainstream crypto conversations soon.

Bankless founder David Hoffman has laid out a bold roadmap for crypto in 2026. He argues that Wall Street's shift to on-chain, the return of ICOs and deeper DeFi integration will reshape the industry's next cycle. His predictions land as regulators soften their stance and institutions move from testing to execution. Rather than hype-driven forecasts, Hoffman framed his outlook around infrastructure, regulation and incentives already forming across crypto and traditional finance.

Hoffman believes 2026 will mark the point where tokenization becomes standard, not experimental. He pointed to recent comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and regulators signaling that capital markets will increasingly live on-chain. Large asset managers already operate tokenized funds. That momentum is shifting toward equities, credit and structured products. 

吴说获悉，Bankless 创始人 David Hoffman 发布对 2026 年的市场预测称，代币化将成为核心趋势，华尔街在监管环境趋于明确的背景下将加速推进传统资产上链；随着监管容忍度提升，合规条件改善后 ICO 可能重新出现。他还指出，以以太坊作为银行层的稳定币新银行与 DeFi 的融合将持续推进。Hoffman…

Bankless founder argues Wall Street now has the regulatory clarity it previously lacked. As a result, institutions no longer ask if assets go on-chain, but how fast. He also raised open questions. Will platforms like Securitize and Superstate dominate issuance? Or will banks prefer to issue and control tokens themselves? Either way, Hoffman expects tokenized assets to become a core market, not a side product.

Hoffman predicts ICOs will return after years of regulatory freeze. He described yield farming, points programs and airdrop games as inefficient substitutes for direct capital formation. According to the Bankless founder, the difference now is legal groundwork. He highlighted Aztec Network's recent on-chain token sale, which included a legal opinion classifying its token as non-security. The sale ran fully on-chain through Uniswap's CCA framework, without intermediaries. That model, he argued, restores the original promise of ICOs: direct access between builders and the public. However, David Hoffman warned that quality matters. Poor projects could still poison the model if standards slip.

Hoffman also expects rapid growth in stablecoin-based “new banks” that use Ethereum as their backend. He cited Coinbase's integration of DeFi products as proof that users can access lending and trading without knowing they're using DeFi. He believes these fintech-style apps will expand into full financial super-apps. Unlike traditional banks, stablecoin platforms can reward users with tokens at near-zero cost, turning customers into stakeholders. As UX improves and blockchains disappear from the surface, Hoffman sees DeFi becoming invisible but essential.

On the speculative side, Bankless founder warned that robotics-related tokens could see hype-driven rallies, similar to past AI token manias. He stressed that real robotics value remains concentrated in private companies and large incumbents, not small-cap tokens.

Finally, he flagged quantum computing as a slow but serious threat. While not imminent, Hoffman expects quantum security risks to enter mainstream crypto discussions in 2026, especially around dormant Bitcoin wallets and cryptographic standards. In short, David Hoffman's message was clear. The next cycle is less about memes and more about plumbing. Crypto's future, he argued, will be built quietly before it explodes loudly.

19 Dec 2025

Coordinator of the EU-Supervisory Digital Finance Academy (EU-SDFA), Adjunct Professor at the LUMSA University and Associate Fellow at Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI) - Italy

After years of a hesitant and uncertain trajectory, the European Central Bank (ECB) has significantly accelerated its efforts on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Within just a few months, the ECB has decided to move forward with the final phase and roadmap for issuing the digital euro, its retail CBDC (rCBDC) intended for use by the general public. At the same time, it approved the launch of two wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) projects—Pontes and Appia—developed under the “New Technologies for Central Bank Money Settlement” initiative, designed exclusively for interbank transactions between financial institutions. Such a significant shift in speed has been largely driven by external pressures. First, as argued by Draghi in his report on the Future of European Competitiveness, “dependencies are becoming vulnerabilities.”[2] The EU is highly dependent on foreign providers for its retail card-based transactions, with two-thirds of its internal transactions processed by US-based Visa and Mastercard. Simultaneously, as clearly shown in 2018 with the US unilateral sanctions against Iran, global wholesale systems continue to rely heavily on the US dollar and US-based institutions.

In this framework, while only 40% of extra-EU imports are invoiced in euros, 51% are in dollars—largely due to dollar-denominated oil imports. This imbalance, combined with the fact that over 90% of large-value dollar transactions are settled via US-based systems like CHIPS and Fedwire, underlines the EU's reliance on the US dollar and US financial infrastructure.[3] This latter aspect is also closely connected to the euro's international role. While the ECB has historically maintained a passive stance, neither encouraging nor obstructing the euro's global adoption,[4] this approach shifted in 2018 with the “Towards a Stronger International Role of the Euro” communication, which recognized the euro's underutilization in global markets while simultaneously highlighting its potential to strengthen the EU's financial and political influence in an increasingly multipolar world.[5] Despite the euro's position as the world's second-largest international currency, its reliance is evident in various domains, from trade invoicing to payment infrastructure, which reinforces vulnerabilities that limit the EU's strategic autonomy.[6]

Second, the growing interest in alternative digital assets has become a source of concern for EU policymakers. The wake-up call came with the announcement of Facebook's Libra project in 2019, which signaled the disruptive potential of privately issued global stablecoins. Today, however, the more systemic risk lies in the US administration's regulatory supportive stance toward dollar-based stablecoins and the resulting increase in market-driven new initiatives. These digital assets could serve as vectors for expanding the global footprint of the US dollar through alternative digital channels, including in EU markets. This could pose financial stability risks, including the threat of euro deposit substitution and the potential for a systemic run on redemptions with global spillovers.[7] Furthermore, it could challenge the EU internal market in both retail and wholesale transactions: widespread use of dollar-backed stablecoins could further consolidate the dollar's dominance and create competition with central bank money as an alternative settlement asset in emerging markets for tokenized securities.

Despite the ECB's rCBDC and wCBDC initiatives having distinct operational frameworks and objectives, they both aim to strengthen the EU's monetary power in a growing multipolar world. This conceptual framework encompasses the dual concepts of autonomy and influence.[8] The former refers to a state's ability to reduce the exposure of its monetary system to external pressures (autonomy), while the latter refers to its capacity to shape the global financial system in its favor (influence). Adopting this lens, the digital euro project is primarily a mechanism for autonomy by establishing a pan-European retail payment infrastructure, while euro wCBDC explorations represent an emerging, if tentative, attempt to mitigate future risks of dependency while exercising international leadership. These objectives are not mutually exclusive but emerge through different institutional pathways and political conditions.

1. Wholesale and Retail Digital Euro: Timeline and Pipeline

The digital euro project is a legislative proposal currently under discussion. The ECB began exploring this concept by publishing a “Report on a Digital Euro” in October 2020. In July 2021, the ECB Governing Council officially launched the digital euro project. The project consists of three phases: the Investigation phase (October 2021 – October 2023), the Preparation phase (November 2023 – October 2025), and the Implementation phase (starting November 2025). In October 2025, the ECB decided to move to the next phase of the project. Since the official issuance of the digital euro by the ECB Governing Council is contingent on the adoption of a legislative act, it also communicated that—if legislation is in place by 2026—a pilot exercise could begin in 2027, with the Eurosystem potentially ready for a first issuance of the digital euro by 2029. In this sense, parallel to the ECB's preparatory work, the European Commission published the Digital Euro Package in June 2023. At this stage, these proposals are in the early stages of the legislative process, with no formal position agreed upon by the European Parliament or the Council.[9]

While there is always confusion, the ECB's work on a wholesale digital euro is progressing in parallel—and yet complementary—with its development of the digital euro for retail use. Officially referred to as “New Technologies for Central Bank Settlement,” this initiative explores innovations in wholesale financial transactions and interbank settlement mechanisms. A form of wholesale CBDC already exists, as central banks currently provide digital settlement assets to financial institutions. However, the ECB's efforts seek to enhance these systems through new technological advancements. Exploring new technologies for wholesale transactions builds upon TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System), which is the Eurosystem's infrastructure for settling large-value payments in euros in real time.

Since 2023, the ECB has begun exploring the potential application of DLT solutions in central bank money settlement, resulting in the development of three interoperability-type solutions for exploratory work. First, the TIPS Hash-Link Service Description establishes an interoperability bridge between a DLT platform and the TIPS payment system (a copy of TIPS was used for experimentation purposes). Second, the Trigger Solution Documentation acts as a technical bridge between market DLT platforms and the Eurosystem's T2 RTGS. Third, the Full DLT Interoperability enables the settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money directly on a DLT platform by tokenizing central bank money and integrating it with the Eurosystem's RTGS (T2). Between May and November 2024, the Eurosystem conducted a series of trials and experiments involving over 200 transactions valued at €1.59 billion. A total of 64 participants, including central banks, financial market participants, and DLT operators, completed more than 40 trials and experiments. The trials involved actual settlements using central bank money, while the experiments used mock transactions for testing purposes.

In February 2025, following the lessons learned from the three pilots, the ECB decided to proceed with a dual track. Pontes is designed as a short- to medium-term pilot project, scheduled for implementation by the end of the third quarter of 2026. Pontes employs a dual-settlement model enabling transactions to settle either on the Eurosystem's DLT platform, utilizing tokenized central bank money, or via T2 RTGS for traditional cash settlement. This approach leverages lessons learned from the 2024 exploratory phase, integrating interoperability solutions while aligning with TARGET's operational, legal, and technical standards. A long-term pilot for Pontes is planned for launch by the end of Q3 2026 and will build upon components already proven in 2024 experiments. Appia, in contrast, represents a long-term vision, with no planned timeline.[10]

2. Monetary Power in Action

In the retail payments and settlements domain, autonomy has become a pressing policy objective due to existing dependencies on foreign providers for card payment schemes and mobile payment apps, as well as emerging risks related to US-denominated stablecoins. This is clearly shown by the shifting narrative behind the digital euro. The ECB's initial engagement framed its rationale within a behavioral logic: evolving consumer preferences and the progressive decline of cash in point-of-sale transactions. While empirically grounded—cash usage fell from 72% in 2019 to 52% in 2024—online payments now represent 21% of all daily transactions and 36% of the total transaction value.[11] This narrative presents digitization only as a neutral, demand-driven transformation.

However, this transition to cashless payments is not merely a technological or market trend but a reconfiguration of the power balance, exposing a critical structural vulnerability. This dynamic raises fundamental questions about the EU's monetary power in an era when payment infrastructure is both a strategic asset and a vector of geopolitical dependency.[12] This logic applies directly to the eurozone, where 13 of 20 member states lack domestic card schemes and must co-badge with foreign ones to operate within their borders.[13] Even national systems, such as Italy's Bancomat or France's Cartes Bancaires, rely on international networks for interoperability, rendering European transactions vulnerable to extraterritorial regulation and policy misalignment, as foreign entities operate within legal and political jurisdictions that may not always align with European strategic interests.

Over the past years, the ECB has undergone a marked shift in how it frames the political and strategic significance of the digital euro project. The ECB started to position its project not simply as a complement to cash but as a lever for reinforcing European monetary sovereignty. From a technical point of view, the ECB believes that a digital euro infrastructure might rebalance its autonomy in digital payments, enabling a public infrastructure to regain control over private foreign providers. In practice, the current card payment system utilizes payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, which facilitate electronic transactions between cardholders, merchants, issuing banks (the cardholder's bank), and acquiring banks (the merchant's bank). When a cardholder initiates a purchase, a payment network acts as an intermediary, routing the transaction details from the merchant to the issuing bank for authorization. The issuing bank verifies the cardholder's account for sufficient funds or credit and approves or declines the transaction. The payment network then ensures the clearing and settlement of funds, transferring money from the issuing bank to the acquiring bank while deducting fees for its services.

Payment networks own the infrastructure that enables their intermediation function. However, with the development of a digital euro, the ECB would provide such underlying core infrastructure upon which European and non-European providers can develop their front-end solutions. Furthermore, this stance is also enforced by procurement rules for the development of the digital euro's core infrastructure, which restrict participation to European IT companies.

The digital euro is thus positioned as a foundational element to ensure that critical infrastructure is under European governance, thereby reducing exposure to external coercion. While the ECB's initiative aspires to enhance autonomy by asserting infrastructural control, the causal link between creating new infrastructure and achieving monetary autonomy remains analytically tenuous. It presupposes not only that the infrastructure will be successfully developed and adopted but also that it will displace or substantially reduce reliance on incumbent foreign payment providers.

This outcome depends on several conditions: the extent to which banks and merchants integrate the digital euro into their operations and the willingness of consumers to shift established payment habits. Moreover, market dynamics further complicate the picture. The digital euro model, while pragmatically framed as a partnership between public infrastructure and private innovation, rests on a fragile assumption: that the creation of a centralized European infrastructure will meaningfully reduce dependency on entrenched foreign actors while fostering EU-native digital payment solutions. Nevertheless, incumbent foreign providers benefit from strong network effects and high switching costs, positioning them as the default choice—even within the emerging digital euro ecosystem.

However, from a different perspective, what if adoption is not the key driver or objective? That may sound provocative, but the strategic value of the digital euro might lie not primarily in everyday usage but in establishing a parallel, EU-controlled domestic infrastructure that can be fully mobilized in the event of disruption from foreign-owned systems.

Instead, although the EU already retains a high degree of autonomy in euro-denominated wholesale payments and settlements, supported by robust, domestically governed infrastructures such as TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities (T2S), EU policymakers are increasingly concerned that US-denominated stablecoins could also pose risks to the settlement of wholesale transactions within the eurozone.[14] Pontes becomes the short-term public solution to provide market participants with a similar technological and technical infrastructure to tokenization using central bank money, thereby avoiding the re-creation of dependencies on foreign assets or providers.

While the face of monetary power related to autonomy is straightforward, the second dimension of monetary power connected to influence is more subtle. It requires the ability to shape global monetary dynamics in line with strategic preferences. In this respect, both the digital euro project and the explorations of a euro wCBCD present an ambiguous case. While the ECB has consistently emphasized the domestic focus of both initiatives, implicit within its long-term vision is the ambition to expand the euro's international role, transforming both initiatives' CBDCs into a vehicle for global influence. These initiatives will not affect the fundamental factors that anchor the international role of the euro. They will not address the fragmented and incomplete nature of the EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) or the absence of common safe assets that central banks and international investors could adopt as a store of value. As Eichengreen[15] and Helleiner[16] have noted, the determinants of an international currency status are institutional, not merely technological or infrastructural.

Against this backdrop, euro CBDCs cannot single-handedly catalyze internationalization, but they may serve as a strategic complement to foster the international role of the euro. The development of a more efficient rCBDC and wCBDC financial infrastructure could, in principle, enable central banks to settle cross-border payments directly, thereby reducing transaction costs and latency while simultaneously mitigating structural reliance on the dollar-centric correspondent banking model.[17]

ECB officials have occasionally gestured toward this potential. In a 2020 address, Executive Board member Fabio Panetta linked the digital euro to the EU's global role, suggesting that if made accessible beyond the eurozone, the CBDC could enhance the euro's attractiveness as a payment vehicle for non-residents.[18] Cipollone also argued that a wCBDC could enable European firms to transact globally without relying on dollar-based intermediaries.[19] Yet, beyond such rhetorical gestures, the ECB has offered little concrete detail on how both initiatives would advance the internationalization agenda. The strategic mechanisms by which it would incentivize the euro in global trade, finance, or reserves remain underspecified. Official documentation broadly discusses faster and more secure cross-border payments but does not clarify how these would translate into increased demand for euro-denominated assets or long-term geopolitical leverage.

As a retail CBDC, the potential cross-border usage of the digital euro project appears limited. Despite being a limited market, the ECB is making an effort to incentivize the use of the euro in cross-border retail transactions. The development of the digital euro has led to the establishment of formal regulatory standards for its use beyond the euro area. Initially, non-eurozone countries needed formal agreements with the ECB to adopt it. However, legislative discussions led to a revision: foreign merchants will be able to accept digital euro payments without such agreements, as they hold zero balances and convert funds immediately. This change applies only to retail transactions, maintaining limits while enabling the digital euro to function as a cross-border payment tool. In contrast to the digital euro project, the Pontes and Appia projects might have a more significant external dimension.

While intra-EU wholesale transactions are almost entirely settled in euros, cross-border and cross-currency settlements to and from the EU borders are still, for a significant portion, processed in US dollars, thereby going through the US financial infrastructure. With this in mind, the development of a wCBDC has the ambition to “include international operations, such as foreign exchange settlement.” In line with this ambition, the Eurosystem launched an experiment, Project Meridian,[20] in cooperation with the BIS and the Bank of England to connect the three pilot projects with a synthetic version of the UK RTGS system to test interoperability for FX transactions via the three systems. This initiative signals an emergent ambition: to leverage its exploratory work to exert global influence on the euro as an international currency.

Another dimension of the ambition to influence is shaping global standards and technological leadership. In this case, the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system offers a model for leveraging euro-denominated infrastructure to exert monetary influence. Access to TIPS has been extended to non-euro area countries, including Sweden (since 2022), Denmark (planned for 2025), Norway (in progress), and Iceland (interested), marking a notable expansion beyond the monetary union. By joining TIPS, these countries adopt ECB-defined standards and institutional frameworks within their domestic systems. The ECB is also considering enabling direct currency conversion between the euro and the Swedish krona within TIPS, a shift from the current single-currency settlement model.

Beyond Europe, the ECB has exported cloned versions of TIPS technology to central banks in Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, following a similar earlier request from Albania. These initiatives allow countries to replicate ECB infrastructure independently. Finally, the ECB has recently announced the interlinkage between TIPS and global fast payment systems, such as India's UPI.[21] The design of the digital euro has been shaped by the TIPS experience, with built-in features that enable multi-currency use and potential export to non-Eurozone jurisdictions. While this opens the door for broader integration or replication, such ambitions remain largely technical. Without deeper legal, regulatory, and institutional alignment, these efforts are expected to have only a marginal impact—supporting limited euro internationalization regionally but not significantly enhancing the EU's global monetary power.

The development of wCBDC also speaks to the EU's ambition to play a leading role in shaping the future architecture of global financial infrastructure. As tokenized finance expands, the question of who will design and govern the settlement rails for digital assets has become central to the future distribution of monetary power. The launch of Pontes and Appia does not simply extend experimentation or mitigate technical risks; it represents a deliberate move to ensure that the EU is not a passive recipient of global CBDC standards but an active contributor to their definition. Pontes provides a credible and immediate solution for settling tokenized transactions in central bank money, demonstrating the Eurosystem's ability to offer a public sector alternative to privately issued settlement assets, including US-denominated stablecoins.

In doing so, it ensures that Europe remains relevant in the evolving market for tokenized securities and smart contract-based payment flows. Appia, by contrast, articulates a longer-term strategic ambition. Rather than adapting existing infrastructures to new digital environments, Appia aims to design a DLT-native wholesale settlement architecture that is governed by European institutional, regulatory, and political principles. If realized, such an ecosystem could support cross-border settlement without depending on dollar-clearing channels such as correspondent banking or SWIFT-based messaging frameworks, thereby expanding the EU's capacity to shape global settlement norms.

Conclusion

The ECB's initiatives on the digital euro and wholesale CBDCs show that Europe has begun to understand a crucial reality: the future of monetary power will be decided not only in balance sheets but in infrastructures. Control over the technological rails through which settlement occurs—and the institutional rules they embed—will increasingly define who retains autonomy and who sets standards in the emerging monetary order.

The retail digital euro project serves as a strategic hedge against the existing and future risks associated with dependency on foreign providers. Even if widespread consumer adoption does not materialize immediately, its existence provides Europe with a public, resilient alternative that can be mobilized if foreign intermediaries—whether commercial networks or dollar-based stablecoin systems—become a channel of coercion or disruption. At the same time, the wholesale CBDC track opens the possibility of projecting European influence outward. With Pontes and Appia, the ECB is positioning the Eurosystem to participate in—and shape—the global architecture of tokenized settlement.

These initiatives cannot fundamentally alter the structural constraints of the euro's global role, but they may enable Europe to avoid subordination to private or extra-European infrastructures as tokenized finance expands. They represent Europe's attempt to retain space for strategic choice in its connections to the world. Taken together, the two CBDC initiatives show a shift in Europe's strategic mindset. Rather than continuing to adapt to a system largely shaped by others, the EU seeks to influence the rules of the game—even if gradually, and even if from a structurally asymmetric position.

In a world where financial interdependence can be weaponized and infrastructure is becoming a geopolitical tool, presence matters. By advancing both retail and wholesale CBDC tracks, the EU is ensuring its presence at the negotiating tables where the foundations of the next monetary era are being established.

European Central Bank officials said Thursday the institution is ready to roll out a digital euro after completing technical and preparatory work, confirming at this year's final press conference that a review of the project is underway, with the European Council and the European Parliament participating.

“We have done our work, we have carried the water, but it's now for the European Council and certainly later on for the European Parliament to identify whether the Commission proposal is satisfactory, how it can be transformed into a piece of legislation or amended,” ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a statement.

As officials stress that the systems are built and the safeguards defined, attention has shifted to the political process required to authorize issuance.

Designed as a public, widely usable digital currency with legal tender status, the proposed digital euro is intended to support financial stability, monetary sovereignty, privacy, and inclusion, while strengthening Europe's payments infrastructure.

Its purpose as a retail central digital bank currency is to “ensure that central bank money with the status of legal tender remains available to the general public, while offering a state-of-the-art and cost-efficient payment means,” the proposal reads, adding it could provide “a high level of privacy in digital payments.”

A retail CBDC is a digital form of public money issued by a central bank and backed by the state, with the same legal standing as cash. Unlike stablecoins, it's a direct claim on the central bank, not a private token backed by reserves or corporate guarantees.

“Our ambition is to make sure that in the digital age, there is a currency that is the anchor of stability for the financial system,” Lagarde said.

While the central bank has done its share of preparation, “that readiness alone does not constitute a launch decision,” an ECB spokesperson told Decrypt. “A clear legal basis is essential, which is why the legislative process is a key precondition for moving forward,” they added.

The final decision to issue a digital euro will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB, Decrypt was told.

Asked about privacy concerns, the spokesperson said that “privacy-enhancing features are built into the design of the digital euro,” but those “do not exempt it from the legal framework that applies to all forms of money. “

“The balance is therefore achieved through a clear separation of roles: the Eurosystem would not have access to users' personal data, while regulated intermediaries would continue to carry out AML and enforcement obligations in line with EU law,” the spokesperson said.

In January, European Central Bank executive board member Piero Cipollone stressed the need for a digital euro in response to the Trump administration's then-developing plans for a stablecoin policy aimed at strengthening the U.S. dollar.

Shifts in U.S. crypto policy and a more permissive stance toward stablecoins added urgency to European discussions about monetary autonomy, with Cipollone saying lawmakers and the broader political world are “becoming more alert” to the conversation.

Early efforts by U.S. lawmakers culminated when President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July.

Notably, Trump has consistently taken a hostile stance toward central bank digital currencies, saying in early 2024 that he would “never allow” a CBDC because he believes it would give the government too much control over people's money.

He signed an executive order in January prohibiting federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting CBDCs, effectively halting U.S. CBDC development under his administration.

Discussions on the weight of a public digital currency began as early as 2021, when European central bankers warned that failing to issue could leave monetary control to private or foreign payment systems as cash usage declines.

Policymakers have also examined how the digital euro fits alongside public blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. “The proposed regulation on the digital euro is technology neutral,” an ECB spokesperson told Decrypt at the time.

Debate has since moved from principle to execution, with European institutions pressing for more apparent timelines around pilots and a possible launch toward the end of the decade.

Earlier this month, the IMF warned that private digital money, including stablecoins, could weaken domestic monetary policy and financial stability.

				Big Brother-style conspiracy theories have forced policymakers to take extra precautions to win over the public.			

EU governments pursued additional privacy safeguards to ensure people's payment habits are kept under wraps as part of a legislative framework for minting a virtual extension of euro banknotes and coins.

The Council of the EU rubberstamped its negotiating position for a digital euro on Friday afternoon after clinching a deal earlier this week, as reported by POLITICO. The onus is now on members of the European Parliament to agree on a legal text so that both sides can begin legislative negotiations next year.

The digital euro was the European Central Bank's answer to Meta's (failed) plan to launch its own virtual currency, called Diem, for its 3 billion users. Since Diem's demise, ECB policymakers have pitched the project as a vital strategy to reduce the bloc's reliance on U.S. credit card giants, Mastercard and Visa, for cross-border payments. EU shoppers would be able to pay with the virtual currency, backed by the central bank, across the bloc in the form of plastic or a smartphone app.

The spread of Big Brother-style conspiracy theories, meanwhile, has forced policymakers to take extra precautions to reassure the public that authorities will not use the digital euro to snoop on people's payment habits.

“You cannot disregard” the concern of “many millions of citizens,” Fernando Navarrete, the center-right MEP shepherding the bill through the Parliament, told POLITICO in November. “In China, it's explicit that they wanted to build [a digital yuan] in order to increase control over the people. I'm scared of this.”

Navarrete, who hails from the European People's Party, is highly skeptical of the initiative but is comfortable with the notion of an offline version of the digital euro that protects people's privacy. “I'm not saying it will be used” for snooping, “but they know that the technology has potential,” he said.

On the contrary, consumer groups have praised the initiative, assuming the digital euro is safe, free, and private. Banks are far less enthusiastic. Especially, as they'll be on the hook for distributing basic digital euro services to their clients at no extra cost — a bill that could amount to over €5 billion over four years, according to ECB estimates.

Bankers' protests aside, the biggest obstacle facing the digital euro is countering conspiracy theories that the authorities will use the ECB's project to control the populace — despite reassurances from the European Commission and the ECB.

The Commission's original proposal and the ECB's envisioned design for the project already prevent the central bank from matching people's digital euro accounts with citizens' personal data.

That wasn't enough for some countries, in particular Belgium and the Netherlands, which fear the project could be politically weaponized. The final text has even strengthened privacy safeguards, making it explicit that central banks “shall not be in a position to lift these [segregation] measures during any processing of the data.”

Mindful of the crucial role that banks will play in getting digital euros into citizens' virtual wallets, EU governments have tried to make the project more palatable for the industry. The key to pleasing bankers is ensuring they make money from the initiative.

Once the digital euro is minted, banks can charge shopkeepers a fee for processing transactions at the cashier. These fees would be capped at the average cost of international and domestic debit cards for at least five years until the overall cost of distributing the digital euro becomes more stable. Then, new fees can be calculated. The bankers aren't convinced, however.

The Council's bid to get banks “a ‘fair' remuneration,” while making digital euro payments “cheaper for merchants and consumers,” is a 'squaring the circle problem' [that] cannot be solved,"" Tobias Tenner, head of digital finance at the German banks association, said. “At least if one takes the huge necessary investments [for banks] into account.”

Early private hearings will give lawmakers a chance to press key demands such as gender balance. 

Brussels wants its international allies to copy its strategy for financing Kyiv's defense. 

The move will oblige financial institutions to strengthen due diligence on all transactions.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has officially finished the heavy lifting on its digital euro project, signaling that the technical foundation is ready.

Speaking at the final press conference of 2025, President Christine Lagarde confirmed that the bank has concluded its preparatory phase, effectively handing the baton to European lawmakers to decide if—and how—the currency will become a reality. Importantly, the ECB stressed that completing the preparatory work does not amount to a final decision to issue a digital euro, which remains a political choice.

The shift marks a major turning point for the project, moving it out of the central bank's labs and into the political arena. Over the last two years, the ECB has been busy designing the architecture, selecting technology providers, and drafting a “rulebook” to ensure the digital currency would work seamlessly across all 20 eurozone countries.

Now, the project's future depends on the European Parliament and the European Council passing the necessary legislation. That process builds on a legislative proposal first submitted by the European Commission in 2023, which lays out the legal basis, safeguards, and limits for a potential digital euro.

President Lagarde used a down-to-earth metaphor to describe the current status, emphasizing that while the central bank has built the system, it lacks the legal authority to flip the switch.

“We have done our work, we have carried the water,” Lagarde told reporters. “It is now for the European Council and certainly later on for the European Parliament to identify whether the Commission proposal is satisfactory and how it can be transformed into a piece of legislation.”

The ECB isn't just looking to modernize for the sake of it; officials see the digital euro as a way to protect Europe's financial independence. With more people moving away from physical cash, there is a growing concern that European payments are becoming too dependent on non-European private companies.

The digital euro is being designed to act as a digital anchor, offering a public alternative that works just like cash but in a digital wallet. ECB officials have repeatedly emphasized that the digital euro would coexist with physical cash and commercial bank money, not replace them.

Privacy has also emerged as a central political issue. The ECB says the system would allow cash-like privacy for offline payments, while still complying with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules for online transactions. If lawmakers can agree on the rules by the end of 2026, the project will move into a pilot phase where real people can start testing it. The current goal is to have the digital euro ready for the public by 2029.

The push comes amid growing competition from U.S.-based card networks, Big Tech payment platforms, and dollar-backed stablecoins, which ECB officials view as a strategic risk to Europe's monetary sovereignty. However, parts of the banking sector have raised concerns that a poorly designed digital euro could lead to deposit outflows from commercial banks, a risk lawmakers are expected to address through holding limits and design safeguards.

It's meant to be a backup that keeps the economy stable, even during technical outages or cyberattacks, ensuring that everyone in Europe always has a reliable way to pay.

  NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec.  19, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SRx Health Solutions, Inc. (NYSE American: SRXH) (the “Company”), which recently announced a definitive agreement to acquire EMJ Crypto Technologies (“EMJX”), today announced that EMJX is enhancing its Gen2 digital-asset treasury operating system through the integration of OpenAI's latest-generation large language models (LLMs) to support internal research workflows and risk-management decision support.
 


  EMJX is a digital-asset treasury operating system that applies quantitative models, artificial intelligence, and systematic risk controls to multi-asset digital treasury management. The platform is led by Eric M. Jackson and is built to manage exposure to bitcoin, Ethereum, and other select digital assets while actively addressing volatility through disciplined hedging strategies.
 


  The latest enhancements incorporate OpenAI's commercially available, state-of-the-art large language models into EMJX's proprietary QAM Engine and broader Gen2 Digital Asset Treasury (“Gen2 DAT”) architecture, which combine quantitative models with systematic risk controls.. These models are being used to improve the synthesis of market data, macroeconomic inputs, and protocol-level information into EMJX's existing analytical and quantitative frameworks.

The bankruptcy court-appointed administrator of the Terraform Labs collapse is suing Jump Trading, accusing the high-speed trading company of illegally profiting from and contributing to the $40 billion crash, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Todd Snyder, tasked with winding down what remains of the crypto empire, is seeking $4 billion in damages from the trading company, its co-founder William DiSomma and Kanav Kareiya, who began as an intern and rose to become the platform's president. Terra's Post-Chapter 11 X account confirmed WSJ's story in a post on X on Friday

“Jump Trading actively exploited the Terraform Labs ecosystem through manipulation, concealment, and self-dealing that enriched Jump while financially devastating thousands of unsuspecting investors,” Snyder said. “This action is a necessary step to hold Jump Trading accountable for illegal conduct that directly caused the largest crypto collapse in history.”

Terraform Labs collapsed in 2022 after its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) lost its dollar peg, sparking a dramatic market spiral. Within days, its sister token, Luna, plunged to near zero. The $40 billion implosion wiped out the savings of hundreds of thousands of investors globally and set off a domino effect of failures across the crypto industry, coming to a head with the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange that November.

The Singapore-based company filed for bankruptcy in January 2024 and agreed just months later to pay roughly $4.5 billion to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle a civil securities fraud lawsuit. Terraform founder Do Kwon, who started the company in 2018, pleaded guilty in August to two criminal counts and was sentenced last week to 15 years in prison.

The court-appointed bankruptcy administrator alleged that Jump Trading had a secret agreement to prop up UST ahead of its collapse and ultimately walked away from Terraform's failure with billions in gains, according to an Illinois district court filing.

Jump made about $1 billion from selling Luna, according to prior SEC filings cited by the WSJ.

Oracle (ORCL) shares jumped more than 6% in pre-market trading to around $190 after Bloomberg reported that TikTok signed binding agreements to form a new U.S. joint venture led by Oracle, helping ease investor concerns around AI-driven valuation risks.

The upbeat reaction spread across risk assets. Bitcoin BTC$87.853,38 jumped above $88,000, Invesco QQQ (QQQ) futures, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100, rose around 0.5%, while AI mining stocks also moved higher. IREN (IREN) gained about 4%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) rose roughly 4% and CoreWeave (CRWV) climbed around 6%. 

Oracle will play a central role as the primary cloud infrastructure and data security provider, overseeing where TikTok's AI recommendation systems are retrained and operated on U.S.-based data.

Markets are treating the agreement as validation that Oracle's AI exposure is tied to real, large scale workloads.

This matters because AI hyperscalers such as Oracle and CoreWeave have come under pressure in recent weeks, with share prices hit by fears around the sustainability of massive AI infrastructure spending and facing doubts over heavy debt-financed data center buildouts, delayed projects, and partnerships. 

Markets attention now turns to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data for the U.S. after a macro heavy week that included U.S. inflation data, jobs figures and a BOJ rate hike.

By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

Bitcoin BTC$87,853.38 rose above $88,000 even after the Bank of Japan increased interest rates to the highest in nearly 30 years, a move that would have been expected to strengthen the yen and make the carry trade less attractive. 

Instead, the currency weakened on concerns the higher rates would endanger the spending plans of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond touched 2% for the first time since 2006.

Other cryptocurrencies also advanced. Ether ETH$2,954.16 added 3.4% in the last 24 hours, though major altcoins including BNB and SOL rose less than 1%. The broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index advanced 1.3%.

In the background is the cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation data, published yesterday. That report strengthened the chance of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in the future, a potential boon for risk assets, though prediction markets overwhelmingly still point to no rate cut next month.

Beyond that, risk assets still face the potential unwind of the AI trade. 

“Capital is still flowing aggressively into AI infrastructure, but monetization questions are becoming harder to ignore,” analysts at QCP Capital wrote. “Major players such as Oracle and Iren are ramping up capital expenditure, while AI-related revenues remain comparatively flat.”

Risk-asset valuations could plunge if revenues fail to materialize, the analysts said. Several crypto firms are benefiting from the AI trade, especially bitcoin miners who have started pivoting into AI infrastructure in multibillion dollar deals.

Regulatory developments are also supporting market development.

“The United States is poised to solidify the GENIUS Act's regulatory architecture in 2026,” Ira Auerbach, head of Tandem at Offchain Labs and former head of digital assets at Nasdaq, told CoinDesk. “Stablecoin issuers that once relied on offshore regimes will find meaningful advantages in bringing reserves and operations back to US soil.”

Auerbach also said that some retirement-plan providers are preparing to test target-date and balanced funds with 0.5% to 1% crypto exposure, potentially creating steady demand that is less tied to market cycles.

“It treats digital assets less as a swing factor and more as another risk component in long-horizon portfolio construction, which is how structural demand begins to take shape,” Auerbach added. Stay alert!

It is only the second pendant like it ever found in the world, discovered during an excavation beneath the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Discovering a symbol of Jewish faith within an excavation of Jerusalem typically wouldn't prompt much surprise, but archaeologists recently made an exceedingly rare find during an excavation of the Temple Mount in the form of a lead pendant decorated with a menorah. The 1,300-year-old pendant, only the second like it ever found in the world, is dated to the Late Byzantine period, from the sixth to the early seventh century C.E., found left in Jerusalem in a time Jews were prohibited from the site. 

“A pendant made of pure lead, decorated with a menorah, is an exceptionally rare find,” a research team with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said in a statement. “Research has identified pendants of glass and other metals decorated with a menorah, but we know of only one other pendant in the world [now located in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore] bearing the symbol of the menorah made of lead.” 

The newly discovered pendant features a seven-branched menorah design identical on both sides. The researchers said that the “double appearance of the menorah on each side of the disc indicates the deep significance of this symbol, and the central place of the menorah in the visual expression of connection to the temple and its memory, even in periods long after the destruction of the temple.” 

The piece was located during archaeological excavation in the Davidson Archaeological Park of Jerusalem under 26 feet of fill that piled up as part of construction activities during the creation of an Islamic monument at the beginning of the eighth century.

“One day while I was digging inside an ancient structure, I suddenly saw something different, gray, among the stones,” Ayayu Belete, a City of David worker, said in a statement. “I picked up the object and saw that it was a pendant with a menorah on it.” 

The disc-shaped pendant features a loop at the top, likely so it could be worn as a necklace. The identical menorah—each one has three arms on either side of the central shaft, a horizontal crossbar at the top of each arm, and flames—fits inside a circular frame. The researchers said that one side was well-preserved, while the other had a high level of patina. Analytical laboratory testing confirmed the pendent is 99 percent lead. 

“This is an unusual find,” said Yuval Baruch, Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologist. “This pendant, bearing the symbol of the menorah, is not just a material object, it is a personal seal, an emblem of memory and identity, which probably belonged to an anonymous Jew who chose to wear it around his or her neck.” 

During the Byzantine period, Jews were prohibited form entering Jerusalem, leading to questions about how the pendant could have made its way to the temple area. The experts surmise the pendant could have come from a secret pilgrim entering the city under unofficial circumstances, or from a Jew visiting on an administrative mission or as a merchant. 

“Even during periods when Jews were prohibited from entering Jerusalem, the connection to this holy place did not cease,” Amichai Eliyahu, Israeli minister of heritage, said in a statement. 

Baruch said that not only does the pendant show a personal devotion to the Jewish faith, but that imperial edicts prohibiting Jews from going to the city did not stop everyone. Using lead, instead of other popular metals of the day, was common in amulet-making at the time, Baruch said, meaning the pendant had more meaning than as a decorative piece of jewelry. The use of lead also opened more possibilities of who could have worked the piece. “During the Byzantine period the menorah became a symbol of national memory, and it expressed the expectation of national revival among the Jewish communities in the land of Israel,” Baruch said. 

The Israel Antiquities Authority plans to display the find during Hanukkah in Jerusalem at the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel. 

“In recent years there is increased archaeological evidence that shows that Jews, despite all the prohibitions and difficulties imposed on them, found ways to reach Jerusalem,” Baruch said, “and it is possible that there were even some who settled there.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found a new way to slow aging inside cells","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251218060557.htm","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:49:25 GMT","

People around the world are living longer than ever, and that shift is changing what many want from aging. The goal is no longer just more years, but more good years. That has put new attention on ""healthspan,"" the stretch of life when someone remains energetic, independent, and generally free of serious age-related problems.

A major focus of this effort is the mitochondria, often called the powerhouse of the cell. These structures generate the energy that keeps cells running by producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because aging and many age-related diseases are closely tied to declining mitochondrial function, scientists see mitochondria as an important target for research aimed at healthier longevity.

Mitochondrial supercomplexes and the energy pipeline

Inside mitochondria, energy production depends on respiratory chain complexes. These molecules move protons and electrons in ways that ultimately allow cells to make ATP. Researchers have known for years that these complexes can assemble into larger, flexible groupings called supercomplexes. These supercomplexes are thought to improve the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration.

Even so, solid evidence that directly connects supercomplexes to clear health benefits has been limited, especially from studies in animals. That gap has left an important question unresolved: do these structures actually make a measurable difference for aging and overall health?

The COX7RP protein under the microscope

To explore this, a team led by Team Leader Satoshi Inouefrom the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Japan examined COX7RP, a mitochondrial protein that helps supercomplexes form. Their new study, co-authored by Dr. Kazuhiro Ikeda from Saitama Medical University in Japan, appeared in the journal Aging Cell.

""We previously identified COX7RP, a mitochondrial protein, as a key factor that promotes the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby enhancing energy production and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress in cells,"" explains Dr. Inoue. ""Based on this, we investigated the role of COX7RP and mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in regulating aging and anti-aging processes.""

Engineered mice lived longer and stayed healthier

The researchers created COX7RP-transgenic (COX7RP-Tg) mice that were designed to produce higher levels of COX7RP throughout their lives. With this model, the team could closely track how the protein affected lifespan, aging-related changes, and metabolism.

The results were striking. On average, the COX7RP-Tg mice lived 6.6% longer than wild-type mice. The benefits were not limited to lifespan alone, since the engineered mice also showed signs of better healthspan. They had improved glucose homeostasis due to greater insulin sensitivity, as well as improved lipid measures with lower blood triglycerides and total cholesterol. The team also found better muscle endurance and less fat buildup in the liver.

Stronger mitochondria and fewer aging signals

At the cellular level, the data pointed to a clear improvement in mitochondrial performance. In tissues from COX7RP-Tg mice, the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes increased, and ATP production rose as well.

A closer look at white adipose tissue revealed shifts in multiple aging-related biomarkers. The mice showed higher levels of coenzyme NAD+, lower levels of ROS, and reduced levels of the cellular aging marker β-galactosidase. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing on white adipose tissue from older mice, the researchers also found reduced activity in genes associated with age-related inflammation. This included genes tied to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a prototypic characteristic of senescent cells.

Why this could matter for healthy aging

Taken together, the findings suggest that making mitochondria more energy efficient may help delay or reduce common problems linked to aging. ""Our study elucidated novel mitochondrial mechanisms underlying anti-aging and longevity, and provided new insights into strategies for promoting healthspan and extending lifespan,"" highlights Dr. Inoue. ""For instance, supplements and medications that enhance the assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes may contribute to longevity expansion.""

The researchers say additional work could strengthen the case for mitochondrial supercomplexes as treatment targets. If confirmed, this line of research could support new approaches to preserving vitality and addressing age-related metabolic disorders including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity.

Touchdown airbursts are a form of cosmic impact that may happen more often than the well-known, crater-forming events linked to mass extinctions. Despite their potential for destruction, these explosive encounters remain poorly understood. UC Santa Barbara Earth Science Emeritus Professor James Kennett and his colleagues argue that these powerful events deserve far more scientific attention.

""Touchdown events can cause extreme damage through very high temperatures and pressures,"" Kennett said. ""And yet they don't necessarily form a crater, or they form ephemeral surface disturbances, but they're not the classic major craters that come from direct impacts.""

Recent research led by Kennett includes four newly published studies presenting evidence for multiple airburst events that occurred at different points in the past. In these events, an incoming object such as a comet detonates above the ground, releasing intense heat and shockwaves that reach Earth's surface. The evidence comes from a wide range of locations, including deep ocean sediments in the North Atlantic and the ruins of an ancient desert city. Across these sites, researchers identified signs of extreme conditions, including rare elements tied to the original space object, glassy material formed from melted Earth sediments, tiny spherical particles created by intense heat, and shocked quartz showing distinctive crack patterns.

Younger Dryas Evidence Found Beneath the Ocean

One of the studies, published in the journal PLOS One, describes the first discovery of airburst-related impact markers in marine sediments connected to the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis (YDIH). The material was found in deep-sea cores recovered from Baffin Bay, off Greenland's western coast.

""Baffin Bay is very significant because it's the first time we've found evidence for the Younger Dryas cosmic impact event in the marine record,"" Kennett said. The Younger Dryas hypothesis proposes that around 12,800 years ago, fragments of a comet exploded above Earth, setting off a sudden global cooling episode known as the Younger Dryas. This period coincided with the disappearance of many large animals and major changes in human populations and cultures. Because the comet broke apart, multiple explosions likely occurred, igniting widespread fires. These fires left behind a distinctive carbon-rich layer known as a ""black mat,"" found mainly across the Northern Hemisphere in parts of the Americas and Europe. This layer is also rich in platinum, iridium, metallic melt particles, shocked quartz, and fused minerals known as meltglass.

""They're preserved in marine sediments as deep as about 2,000 meters,"" Kennett said. He explained that while these materials do not directly measure the strength of the explosions, they demonstrate how powerful and far-reaching the event was and hint at its influence on climate. ""The material was thrown up into the atmosphere, and was globally transported and deposited in a broadly distributed layer that we earlier have described.""

Searching for a Missing Crater

Cosmic impacts vary widely, ranging from the constant fall of fine extraterrestrial dust to massive collisions that occur only once every tens of millions of years. Large impacts usually leave craters, which have long served as the strongest physical evidence for such events. Because touchdown airbursts often fail to deform the landscape in lasting ways, confirming their occurrence is much more difficult. This stands in contrast to famous sites like the Chicxulub crater near Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, which is directly linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

""Previously, there has been no evidence for the Younger Dryas boundary (YDB) event of any crater or possible crater,"" said Kennett. ""So these events are more difficult to detect, especially when they are older than a few thousand years and after being buried, leave little or no superficial evidence.""

However, a shallow seasonal lake near Perkins in southeast Louisiana may represent the first known crater dating to the Younger Dryas Boundary. Writing in the ScienceOpen journal Airbursts and Cratering Impacts, the research team revisited a suggestion made in 1938 by the landowner, who noted the lake's circular shape and a ""crater-like rim raised about 1 meter above the surrounding terrain."" Detailed sediment studies did not begin until 2006. Between then and 2024, researchers examined multiple sediment cores from the site and identified meltglass, spherules, and shocked quartz. Radiocarbon dating placed these materials within the Younger Dryas period. Even so, the team emphasized that ""further research would be beneficial for testing the hypothesis that the lake/depression resulted from a cosmic impact.""

Reexamining Tunguska and Tall el-Hammam

Shocked quartz has long been recognized as a sign of extreme heat and pressure from cosmic impacts. Traditionally, this evidence has been associated with large crater-forming events that produce straight, parallel cracks in quartz grains. In two additional papers published in Airbursts and Cratering Impacts, the researchers argue that airbursts can generate a wider range of fracture patterns. To support this, they analyzed samples from the site of the Tunguska explosion in Siberia in 1908 and revisited findings from Tall el-Hammam, an ancient city in the Levant believed to have been destroyed by a similar event about 3,600 years ago.

""The interesting thing about Tunguska is that it is the only recorded historical touchdown event,"" Kennett said. The explosion was witnessed by people on the ground, who described a bright fireball, and photographs later documented vast areas of flattened forest. Despite decades of study focused on fallen trees and soil damage, scientists had rarely searched for microscopic impact evidence. The new work represents the first comprehensive identification of airburst-related impact materials at Tunguska.

At the Tunguska site, researchers found shocked quartz showing clear planar fractures, some of which were filled with meltglass. They also identified tiny impact-formed spheres, along with melted metal and carbon. The energy released by the blast may have also created small depressions in the ground that later filled with water, forming today's swamps and lakes.

The team also strengthened the case for an airburst over Tall el-Hammam during the Middle Bronze Age. Alongside previously reported spherules, carbon, meltglass, and rare minerals, they documented shocked quartz displaying a wide variety of crack patterns. These included classic parallel fractures as well as curved, web-like, and sub-planar features, suggesting intense pressures and complex blast directions similar to those observed at Tunguska.

A More Common and Widespread Threat

Together, the new studies support the idea that cosmic impacts, particularly touchdown airbursts, may be far more frequent than scientists once assumed.

""They're far more common, but also possess much more destructive potential than the more localized, classic crater-forming asteroidal impacts."" said Kennett. ""The destruction from touchdown events can be much more widespread.And yet they haven't been very well studied, so these should be of interest to humanity.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Gravitational waves may reveal hidden dark matter around black holes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251218060559.htm","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:31:55 GMT","

Scientists at the University of Amsterdam have developed a new way to use gravitational waves from black holes to uncover the presence of dark matter and learn more about its behavior. Their approach relies on a detailed theoretical model grounded in Einstein's theory of general relativity. This model carefully describes how a black hole interacts with material in its immediate environment, including dark matter that cannot be seen directly.

The research was carried out by Rodrigo Vicente, Theophanes K. Karydas and Gianfranco Bertone from the UvA Institute of Physics (IoP) and the GRAPPA center of excellence for Gravitation and Astroparticle Physics Amsterdam. Their findings were published in the journal Physical Review Letters. In the study, the team presents a more advanced method for calculating how dark matter surrounding black holes subtly alters the gravitational waves those systems produce.

Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals and Long Gravitational Signals

The study concentrates on a class of systems known as extreme mass-ratio inspirals, or EMRIs. These occur when a small, dense object -- such as a black hole created by the collapse of a single star -- moves in orbit around a much larger black hole, usually one located at the center of a galaxy. Over time, the smaller object gradually spirals inward, emitting gravitational waves throughout this slow descent.

Upcoming space missions, including the European Space Agency's LISA space antenna scheduled for launch in 2035, are expected to observe these signals for very long periods. Some EMRI events may be tracked for months or even years, covering hundreds of thousands to millions of individual orbits. When scientists can model these signals with high precision, the resulting data act like detailed ""cosmic fingerprints"" that reveal how matter is arranged near massive black holes. This includes dark matter, which is believed to make up most of the matter in the Universe.

Why a Fully Relativistic Model Matters

Before observatories like LISA begin collecting data, researchers must understand in advance what kinds of gravitational wave patterns they should expect and how to interpret them. Until now, many studies have used simplified models that only roughly describe how the surrounding environment influences EMRIs. According to the authors, these approximations leave out important physical effects.

The new work addresses this limitation by introducing the first fully relativistic framework for a wide range of possible environments. This means the calculations rely entirely on Einstein's theory of gravity rather than simplified Newtonian approximations. As a result, the model can more accurately describe how matter around a massive black hole changes the orbit of the smaller object and reshapes the gravitational waves that are emitted.

Dark Matter Spikes and Detectable Imprints

A key focus of the study is on dense regions of dark matter that may form around massive black holes. These concentrations are often referred to as ""spikes"" or ""mounds."" By incorporating their relativistic model into modern gravitational waveform calculations, the researchers demonstrate that such dark matter structures would leave distinct, measurable signatures in the signals detected by future observatories.

The authors describe this research as an essential step toward a larger scientific goal. Over time, they hope gravitational waves can be used to chart how dark matter is distributed throughout the Universe and provide new insight into its fundamental nature.

T cell immunity deteriorates with age, accompanied by a decline in autophagy and asymmetric cell division. Here we show that autophagy regulates mitochondrial inheritance in CD8+ T cells. Using a mouse model that enables sequential tagging of mitochondria in mother and daughter cells, we demonstrate that autophagy-deficient T cells fail to clear premitotic old mitochondria and inherit them symmetrically. By contrast, autophagy-competent cells that partition mitochondria asymmetrically produce daughter cells with distinct fates: those retaining old mitochondria exhibit reduced memory potential, whereas those that have not inherited old mitochondria and exhibit higher mitochondrial turnover are long-lived and expand upon cognate-antigen challenge. Multiomics analyses suggest that early fate divergence is driven by distinct metabolic programmes, with one-carbon metabolism activated in cells retaining premitotic mitochondria. These findings advance our understanding of how T cell diversity is imprinted early during division and support the development of strategies to modulate T cell function.

Efficient immune responses depend on coordination amongst different immune cells and on generating diversity within the same cell type. In CD8+ T cells, one single cell can differentiate into progeny with heterogeneous fates upon activation1,2. Activation of a naive T cell produces both short-lived effector cells that exert cytotoxic effector functions and long-lived memory cells that self-renew and differentiate upon antigenic rechallenge and are central to vaccination efficacy. Despite increased understanding of mechanisms that contribute to fate decision, there is still no consensus on when these decisions occur and how long-lived memory T cells form3,4,5. Moreover, T cell memory is severely impaired during ageing6,7, and senescent CD8+ T cell subsets that exhibit DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial dysfunction8 and global poor effector function accumulate9,10,11. Amongst the processes supporting CD8+ T cell memory formation and maintenance, two highly conserved mechanisms stand out as being negatively impacted by ageing: macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) and asymmetric cell division (ACD)6,12,13.

Autophagy involves the recycling and degradation of cellular cargoes through the engulfment of cellular components and organelles by autophagosomes, followed by their fusion with lysosomes. The role of autophagy in immune cell fate decision is cell- and context-dependent14. In CD8+ T cells, loss of autophagy results in impaired memory responses6,15,16, which is at least partly caused by accumulation of damaged organelles17,18,19. ACD has been well characterized in model organisms20, but in primary mammalian cells, evidence of its impact on fate decisions remains correlative and inconclusive21. In cells from the haematopoietic lineage, this arises from technical limitations, as identification of sibling cells has relied on cell cargoes not directly tied to fate decisions or expressed in patterns that prevent conclusive inheritance assignment from a mother cell. Thus, two critical issues remain unresolved: (1) Is there a cargo that can drive fate divergence? (2) Is inherited material synthesized post cell division, or is it inherited asymmetrically? Here, we address these questions in CD8+ T cells. ACD in CD8+ T cells generates effector-like and memory-like daughter cells22 from the very first mitosis following naive T cell activation by high-affinity T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation23,24. These cells inherit several layers of asymmetry, including surface markers, transcription factors, centrosomes, divergent metabolic activity and translation profiles25,26,27,28,29. Despite this, direct causal evidence linking asymmetric inheritance of premitotic (preM) T cell cargo, and the future fate of emerging daughter cells in vivo is lacking not only in T cells but across primary immune cells in general.

Because it is unclear whether cell cargo degradation can contribute to cell division asymmetries, we performed an integrated functional analysis of the contribution of autophagy and ACD to CD8+ T cell differentiation. We identified mitochondria producing superoxide as asymmetrically inherited cargo, which was amplified by mitophagy. Using a novel mouse model that allows specific and sequential mitochondria labelling, we insured unequivocal tracking between preM and postmitotic (postM) cargo and analyses of segregation, degradation and biogenesis events. This novel system allowed us to follow the presence of preM mitochondria by imaging and flow cytometry and evaluate the impact of mitochondrial inheritance by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) proteomics, metabolomics and in vivo transfer of daughter cells. Our results suggest that autophagy contributes to the generation of early fate divergency by promoting both clearance and asymmetric partitioning of heterogeneous mitochondria populations. Furthermore, we establish the first causal link between the inheritance of cell cargo and fate commitment in immune cells, as low mitochondrial turnover caused poor memory potential in CD8+ T cell immune responses. Our findings offer new insight into how T cell diversity is early imprinted and how organelle inheritance regulates metabolism and function, opening paths for refined therapeutic approaches to modulate T cell function.

ACD in CD8+ T cells results in unequal inheritance of cell cargoes that culminates in divergent transcriptomes between daughter cells28,30,31,32. To broaden our understanding of early events of asymmetric segregation, we examined the global proteome of first-daughter CD8+ T cells using CD8 expression as surrogate marker of effector-like (CD8hi) and memory-like (CD8lo) progenies30 (Fig. 1a). More than 6,000 proteins were identified, and the proteomic ruler method was used to calculate both protein mass and copy numbers of each protein per cell33. Although protein mass was comparable between CD8hi and CD8lo daughter cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a), we identified several proteins that were enriched in one of these two populations, many of them with roles associated with metabolism and mitochondrial function and biogenesis (Fig. 1b). A comprehensive analysis of mitochondria-related proteins further emphasized this divergence (Fig. 1c). Given the known role of mitochondria in T cell fate, we focused on these organelles34,35. Mitochondrial inheritance in mitotic T cells has been previously investigated with conflicting results26,27,36,37. By electron microscopy, we could neither observe any differences in mitochondrial content (Fig. 1d) nor architecture. However, by confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed that CD8hi (effector-like) daughter cells inherited more mitochondria producing reactive oxygen species (ROS, a readout of mitochondrial superoxide) (Fig. 1e). Because ROS-producing mitochondria are targets of autophagy, a mechanism essential for T cell memory and known to decline with age, we interrogated whether mitophagy contributes to this unequal inheritance. To address whether priming would be impacted by constitutive loss of autophagy, we stimulated wild-type (WT) and Atg7fl/fl Cd4Cre CD8+ T cells on supported lipid bilayers (SLB) and observed that the immune synapse area and TCR clustering were distinct between autophagy-sufficient and autophagy-deficient CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). As immune synapse formation and TCR affinity and signalling strength are crucial for ACD22,23,24, we moved to an inducible model of autophagy deletion (Atg16l1fl/fl ROSA26(R26)-Ert2Cre), allowing T cell activation in presence of autophagy (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Loss of autophagy abolished the asymmetric inheritance of mitochondria producing superoxide (Fig. 1e). We also observed that the autophagic machinery itself is polarized during cell division, as membrane-bound LC3B-II (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light-chain 3), a marker of autophagosomes14, was preferentially inherited by CD8hi effector-like cells, suggesting reduced autophagic flux and accumulation of damaged cargo in this subset. In CD8+ T cells from aged mice, LC3B-II displayed symmetric distribution, consistent with impaired autophagy and weakened ACD potential12,15,16(Fig. 1f). Finally, proteomic comparisons reinforced these observations (Fig. 1g). In CD8+ T cells from both autophagy-deficient and aged mice the number of differentially inherited proteins was reduced compared with WT cells (Fig. 1b). Moreover, proteins linked to mitochondrial function were less represented amongst differentially inherited cargoes. Interestingly, the pool of enriched proteins found in CD8hi and CD8lo progenies from old mice was very small, reflecting the dual decline of ACD and autophagy with age. Together these findings highlight the relevance of autophagy not only to support cellular homeostasis but also to establish asymmetric inheritance patterns.

Source Data

To functionally address whether organelle inheritance influences fate determination during ACD, we used a knock-in murine model in which the mitochondrial outer membrane protein 25 (OMP25) is fused to a SnapTag upon Cre recombination (Omp25-SnapTag)38. We crossed these mice to R26-Ert2Cre (hereafter Ert2Cre), which allowed inducible SnapTag expression upon tamoxifen treatment. SnapTag can covalently bind to cell-permeable substrates linked to different fluorophores, enabling sequential labelling of mitochondria and accurate discrimination between old (preM) and young (postM) organelles39,40 (Fig. 2a). With the MitoSnap system we can unequivocally link the inheritance of labelled (preM/old) mitochondria to an event of asymmetric segregation of a cell cargo that was present minimum 14 h before cell division. Furthermore, this approach is unaffected by postmitotic transcriptional, translational or anabolic events of biogenesis. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed SnapTag specificity and showed colocalization with Tom20+ structures (Fig. 2b). Importantly, MitoSnaplo cells result from segregation of old mitochondria (preM labelling) and/or degradation of old (preM) and young (postM) mitochondria, as labelling efficiency is close to 100% (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We also confirmed that old mitochondria are MitoSOX+ (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2b).

a, The experimental layout: CTV-labelled naive MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT-Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre or KO-Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated on anti-CD3-, anti-CD28- and Fc-ICAM-1-coated plates for 40 h. The cells were cultured in T cell medium containing 500 nM 4OHT. A total of 16 h post activation, the cells were collected and labelled with Snap-Cell 647-SiR to tag preM/old mitochondria and cultured for a further 24 h, when Snap-Cell Block and Snap-Cell Oregon Green incubations allowed young organelle labelling.

Flow cytometry of first-daughter CD8+ T cells revealed two main populations: one inheriting both preM/old and postM/young mitochondria and another with low SnapTag labelling (Fig. 2d). Fluorescence microscopy of dividing cells demonstrated that while total mitochondrial mass was evenly distributed, old mitochondria were asymmetrically partitioned, preferentially segregating into CD8hi progenies (Fig. 2e). To further verify the contribution of autophagy to the generation of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo populations, we generated autophagy-deficient MitoSnap mice (Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25-SnapTagfl/+ Ert2Cre). Tracking mitochondria over several division cycles showed that loss of autophagy led to retention of both old and young mitochondria, indicating impaired turnover (Fig. 2f). Finally, confocal microscopy of mitotic CD8+ T cells confirmed that autophagy loss abolished asymmetric segregation of old mitochondria (Fig. 2g), placing autophagy as a critical mechanism coupling organelle quality control to asymmetric inheritance of cell fate determinants during ACD.

To dissect the role of autophagy in generating MitoSnaplo progenies, we compared the fate of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells following first CD8+ T cell division (Fig. 3a). We observed that WT cells that were originally MitoSnaphi became MitoSnaplo, whereas most MitoSnaphi autophagy-deficient CD8+ T cells retained their labelling (Fig. 3b). To confirm whether OMP25 staining loss is caused by mitochondrial degradation, we used bafilomycin A (BafA) to inhibit autophagy flux right after young OMP25/mitochondria labelling, which slowed their decay and provided further evidence that autophagy is required for the generation of MitoSnaplo cells (Fig. 3c). When mitophagy was induced using carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Fig. 3d), both MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo first-daughter cells rapidly lost young mitochondrial labelling (Fig. 3e–g), which allowed us to confirm that all live cells underwent mitochondrial biogenesis and to link any SnapTag-labelling loss to mitophagy. These results corroborated our previous observation that MitoSnaphi cells are still capable of degrading mitochondria if autophagy-sufficient (Fig. 3b). At the organelle level, analysis of mitochondrial fractions by flow cytometry further highlighted differences between autophagy-deficient and autophagy-sufficient cells. In Atg16l1-deficient cells mitochondria were on average larger and less heterogeneous (Extended Data Fig. 2c), with a strikingly higher proportion of preM/old brightly labelled structures (16.4%) in comparison with their WT counterparts (1.71%), which largely cleared them (Fig. 3h). This important observation reveals that the co-inheritance of young and old OMP25-SnapTag-labelled mitochondria reflects how mitochondrial biogenesis occurs in recently activated CD8+ T cells, where new structures are mostly added onto the existing mitochondrial network. Furthermore, the absence of bright young organelle labelling suggests that biogenesis occurs at comparable levels in autophagy-sufficient and autophagy-deficient cells post activation, and that differences arise from clearance rather than synthesis. Given that preM/old and postM/young mitochondrial structures are co-inherited at cellular and organelle level, we concluded that cells either maintaining preM/old mitochondria or not clearing postM/young mitochondria in a short timeframe are the same population and from this point were considered MitoSnaphi regardless whether young staining was performed or not. Taken together, these results suggest that the emergence of MitoSnaplo cells relies both on segregation and degradation events and that autophagy plays a role in both mechanisms.

a, The experimental layout: CTV-labelled MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT-Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre or KO-Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated and SnapTag labelled as in Fig. 2a. MitoSnaplo cells and MitoSnaphi cells were sorted as depicted. The sorted cells were cultured for 3 days in T cell medium supplemented with IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15. b, Representative plots from MitoSnap CD8+ T cells 3 days post sorting. Sorted MitoSnaplo cells were used to set up gating strategy. The frequency of double-positive MitoSnap+ cells (for both preM/old and postM/young) was calculated. The experiment was performed twice with two or three biological replicates (nWT = 6; nKO = 4). The data are represented as the mean + s.e.m. A statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. c, After young OMP25 staining with Snap-Cell Oregon Green, a pH-sensitive substrate, the cells were cultured in presence or not of BafA (20 nM), an inhibitor of lysosomal function that prevents autophagy flux. The loss of SnapSubstrate Oregon Green was measured at 0, 30 and 60 min post staining. d, The experimental layout: CTV-labelled naive MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT-Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre or KO-Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated on anti-CD3-, anti-CD28- and Fc-ICAM-1-coated plates for 40 h. The cells were cultured in T cell medium containing 500 nM 4OHT. A total of 16 h post activation, the cells were collected and labelled with Snap-Cell 647-SiR to tag preM/old mitochondria and cultured for a further 24 h, when Snap-Cell Block and Snap-Cell Oregon Green incubations allowed postM/young organelle labelling. The first-daughter cells were sorted and put back in culture for 2 h in presence or not of CCCP. e, The efficiency of young labelling to confirm recent mitochondrial biogenesis was performed. f, Representative histograms exhibiting young MitoSnap labelling in MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells subjected or not mitophagy induction by CCCP. g, The frequencies of cells keeping or not young OMP25 labelling after 2 h were quantified.

The data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. A statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. h, MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT-Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre or KO-Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) from three mice were activated and SnapTag-labelled as in Fig. 2a. Mitochondria were purified and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Left: mitochondrial gating was determined based on size and Tom20 expression (also refer to Extended Data Fig. 2C). SnapTag labelling was preserved, and maintenance of old and young organelle staining was evaluated in autophagy-sufficient and autophagy-deficient cells.

We next asked whether the inheritance of aged mitochondria influences CD8+ T cell fate in vivo. We generated OT-I CD45.1 MitoSnap mice, in which CD8+ T cells express a transgenic TCR specific for the OVA257–264 SIINFEKL peptide41, allowing specific activation and tracking of these cells in a host mouse. First, to exclude that mitochondrial inheritance could have been influenced by the nature of TCR-stimulation, we performed experiments using SIINFEKL peptide-loaded dendritic cells30 and again observed that the emergence of MitoSnaplo progenies derives from both degradation and segregation events (Fig. 4a). Phenotypical analysis of resulting first-daughter cells also allowed us to identify early features of fate divergence, such as significantly higher frequencies of CD44+CD62L+ cells (memory fate) within MitoSnaplo cells and higher frequencies of CD44+ CD25+ cells (effector fate) amongst MitoSnaphi cells (Fig. 4a, right). Adoptive transfer of naive OT-I MitoSnap cells followed by Listeria monocytogenes expressing OVA (LM-OVA) (Fig. 4b) infection demonstrated that heterogeneous inheritance of preM/old mitochondria also occurs in vivo: MitoSnaplo cells being more frequent amongst memory precursors (CD127+) (Fig. 4c) and MitoSnaphi cells exhibiting higher granzyme B expression (Fig. 4d). To further evaluate long-term memory potential, MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo first-daughter cells were sorted (Extended Data Fig. 3a), transferred into naive hosts and challenged with LM-OVA >4 weeks later, after which OT-I blood kinetics and maintenance were monitored (Fig. 4e). Progenies of MitoSnaplo cells consistently showed superior ability to survive and stronger re-expansion potential (Fig. 4f). At the memory-phase MitoSnaplo cells were present in higher frequencies, which were also predictive of larger absolute numbers (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Although no differences were observed in classical surface marker signatures of memory precursors (KLRG1−CD127+) or short-lived effector cells (KLRG1+CD127) (Extended Data Fig. 3c), functionally MitoSnaplo progenies produced significantly more IFN-γ and TNF than their MitoSnaphi counterparts (Fig. 4h). Independent validation using in vitro Tat-Cre driven recombination resulted in similar outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Together, these findings demonstrate that phenotype and function of MitoSnaplo CD8+ T cells grant them superior memory potential, further emphasizing that asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance provides a mechanistic basis for early fate divergence in CD8+ T cells.

Effector CD8+ T cells are highly proliferative, whereas memory CD8+ T cells divide slower and remain quiescent. This fate is established early after T cell activation, with cell cycle speed predictive of CD8+ T cell fate23,42. CD8+ T cells also differ metabolically: effector cells rely on glycolysis, while long-lived naive and memory cells perform mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial architecture influences these processes as fission supports glycolysis, whereas mitochondrial fusion promotes fatty acid oxidation34,35. We examined whether MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo CD8+ T cells (sorted as in Extended Data Fig. 3a) display distinct mitochondrial dynamics by confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial networks were rendered from three-dimensional reconstructions (Z-stacks) and geometric features from individual mitochondria were quantified (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 4). Mitochondria from MitoSnaphi cells exhibited heterogeneous SnapTag labelling intensity, which we accounted for in our analysis (Fig. 5b). SnapTaghi mitochondria from MitoSnaphi CD8+ T cells were significantly larger, less compact and more complex than other mitochondria labelled with lower levels of SnapTag in both cell types (Fig. 5c). These are features of tubular, fused mitochondria, which prevent their degradation by autophagy, while mitigating stress and preserving OXPHOS capacity upon mitochondrial damage43,44. Similar patterns were observed for young-OMP25 organelles, confirming co-inheritance of postM/young and preM/old OMP25-SnapTag mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 5). We then used a modified version of the Scenith assay45, which measures translation via O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP, a puromycin analogue) incorporation as a proxy for ATP production to perform metabolic dependency measurements. MitoSnaphi CD8+ T cells exhibited higher global translation rates, which were significantly reduced by both glycolysis and OXPHOS inhibitors, while quiescent MitoSnaplo cells remained largely unaffected by metabolic modulators (Fig. 5d). When directly measuring oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in autophagy-sufficient and autophagy-deficient MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells, we observed no significant differences (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Direct measurements of ATP levels further confirmed increased production in cells inheriting preM/old mitochondria, consistent with the conclusions of the Scenith assay (Fig. 5f). To evaluate the functional consequences of inheriting distinct mitochondrial pools, MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells were cultured with IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 in the absence of T cell activation. MitoSnaphi cells exhibited faster, more homogeneous proliferation and lower frequencies of slow-dividing cells than MitoSnaplo cells, corroborating their less quiescent status that might contribute to premature cell death (Fig. 5g). Autophagy-deficient cells proliferated slower regardless of mitochondrial inheritance, suggesting a role for autophagy in cell cycle regulation, consistent with reports of autophagy-dependent degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) in T cells46. In cytokine-limiting conditions, as expected for the effector-like population, autophagy-sufficient MitoSnaphi cells showed reduced survival (Fig. 5h), while MitoSnaplo cells were enriched for CD44+CD62L+ memory-like cells23,42 (Fig. 5i). Autophagy-deficient cells were poor survivors and did not exhibit differences in phenotype linked to early mitochondrial inheritance (Fig. 5hand Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Because in WT cells aged mitochondria are cleared after 3 days even in MitoSnaphi cells that inherited their mitochondria from the mother cell, our results suggest that organelles inherited at first division influence the decision between cellular quiescence (memory fate) and differentiation (effector fate). Our results provide the first unequivocal data linking organelle inheritance—here mitochondria—in immune cells to changes in cell function that culminate in fate commitment of cells in vivo.

a, FACS-purified MitoSnaplo and MitoSnaphi CD8+ T cells were imaged by confocal microscopy and their mitochondrial architecture was analysed (based on Tom20 labelling to identify organelles). b, MitoSnap labelling intensity per individual mitochondria was used to cluster them into four groups. MitoSnaplo cells exhibited only mitochondria with low intensity of SnapTag labelling, whereas mitochondria of MitoSnaphi cells were arbitrarily stratified into low (lo), intermediate (mid) and high (hi) based on StapTag brightness. The data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. A total of 1,961 mitochondria were used for further analysis. The pooled data from two independent experiments, each containing sorted cells from two to three biological replicates, are shown. c, The geometric parameters were extracted and used to generate uniform manifold approximation and projections (UMAPs) of mitochondria found in MitoSnaplo and MitoSnaphi cells. The squares in the UMAPs highlight regions with high compactness, area (A)/ volume (V) ratio and complexity. Right: the quantifications of mitochondrial complexity (high values, round organelles), compactness (high values, organelles with tight architecture), volume (V) and sphericity (lower values, high roundness/sphericity) are represented. The data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. A statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric Dunn test with Bonferroni correction. The exact P values are depicted (MitoSnaplo, 972 mitochondria; MitoSnaphi, 989 mitochondria). d, MitoSnap CD8+ T cells were collected 36–40 h post activation and prepared for the Scenith assay to evaluate their metabolic reliance. OPP incorporation was used as a readout of translation. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose was used to inhibit glycolysis and oligomycin was used to inhibit mitochondrial respiration. A combination of both inhibitors was used to supress both metabolic pathways and obtain an OPP baseline. An analysis was done by flow cytometry, which allowed the discrimination of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells. The data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. A statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc test. The exact P values are depicted.

To further investigate the metabolism and fate-divergency drivers in daughter cells inheriting distinct mitochondrial pools, we labelled preM/old mitochondria in activated CD8+ T cells, sorted MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo first-daughter cells (as in Extended Data Fig. 3a) and performed single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and bulk proteomics analysis (Fig. 6a). Proteomics allowed us to identify a restricted set of differentially inherited proteins (Fig. 6b). MitoSnaplo cells expressed higher levels of Werner protein (WRN), an enzyme important for genome stability47, and NADH dehydrogenase 4 (mt-ND4), a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. MitoSnaphi cells were enriched in hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1a) and late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor 2 (LAMTOR2), proteins involved in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) metabolism, which is known to boost effector CD8+ T cell differentiation, as well as proteins linked to cell cycle progression48,49. In previous studies, including our own, transcriptional profiling of first-daughter CD8+ T cell cells, using both bulk and single cell strategies relied on the expression of reporter genes or surface markers with dynamic expression or on in vivo models where symmetric and ACDs could not be distinguished28,30,31,32,50, which impedes a direct link between transcriptional divergences and asymmetric inheritance of cell fate determinants. Here, unbiased clustering of single cell transcriptomes visualized with UMAPs defined nine clusters (Fig. 6c). Both cell types were distributed across clusters, but some were enriched in MitoSnaphi (clusters 2, 6 and 8) or MitoSnaplo (clusters 1 and 7) daughter cells. Gene expression of proteomics hits positively correlated with protein levels (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, MitoSnaphi proteome signatures aligned with transcriptomes of clusters 2 and 3, whereas MitoSnaplo signatures were enriched in clusters 1 and 4. Functional annotation of clusters further highlighted the divergent fates of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells. Based on the genes mostly expressed in each cluster, we could assign functional signatures to each of them. Cluster 1, dominated by MitoSnaplo cells, displayed a memory-related signature with Tcf7 (TCF1) and Sell (CD62L) expression, key for stemness maintenance and lymphoid homing. Cluster 7, also enriched in MitoSnaplo, featured genes linked to mitochondrial function and biogenesis. By contrast, MitoSnaphi cells were more abundant in clusters where the gene signature could be linked to effector functions (clusters 5, 6 and 8), showing increased expression of genes involved in cell cycling and nutrient uptake, including higher expression of the serine importer gene Slc1a5 (SLC1A5) (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). A pseudotime analysis also allowed us to propose the potential differentiation trajectories of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells, clearly indicating that MitoSnaphi exhibited a stronger path towards becoming terminally differentiated cytotoxic cells (Fig. 6e). These results were complemented by a stronger transcriptional signature of genes linked to memory fate commitment in MitoSnaphi CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6f,g). Together, these integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance generates divergent metabolic and transcriptional programme, coupling higher mitochondrial turnover rates to enhanced memory potential.

a, The experimental layout: CTV-labelled naive MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated on anti-CD3-, anti-CD28- and Fc-ICAM-1-coated plates for 36–40 h. The cells were cultured in T cell medium containing 500 nM 4OHT. A total of 16 h post activation, the cells were collected and labelled with Snap-Cell 647-SiR (preM/old mitochondria) and cultured for further 24 h. The cells were collected and sorted into MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo populations, and their proteome and transcriptome were analysed. b, A volcano plot showing differentially inherited proteins by MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells.

When performing our transcriptomics analysis, we also found a cluster enriched in genes that are linked to one-carbon (1C) metabolism (for example Mthfd2, Phgdh and Shmt2, cluster 2). This cluster was formed by a majority of MitoSnaphi cells, 1C metabolism signature being also stronger in this population in comparison with MitoSnaplo cells (Fig. 7a). In CD4+ T cells, 1C metabolism is essential for proliferation and effector function as an inducer of mTOR activity51. Thus, aiming to functionally validate this finding, we again measured metabolic reliance of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo sorted cells through Scenith (Fig. 7b), using inhibitors of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1/2), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1/2) and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) activity, key enzymes in the folate cycle of 1C metabolism (Fig. 7c). Our results suggest that in MitoSnaphi cells, SHMT1/2 and PHGDH inhibitors indeed suppress their translation rates, a phenotype that was not shared by MitoSnaplo cells (Fig. 7d). Because SHMT1/2 inhibition led to the most significant reduction of translation rates in MitoSnaphi cells, we evaluated the expression of the SHMT2 enzyme in individual mitochondria by confocal microscopy. We found that organelles exhibiting high expression of old-OMP25-SnapTag labelling are those expressing more SHMT2, which corroborates the hypothesis that changes in 1C metabolism are due to the inheritance of preM/old mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 8). As serine (Ser) and glycine (Gly) are the main amino acids fuelling 1C metabolism, we sorted MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells and cultured them for 3 days in Ser/Gly-depleted conditions (Fig. 7b), after which we could identify a shift in phenotype shared by both subsets that led to lower frequencies of effector-like CD44+CD25+CD8+ T cell progenies (Fig. 7e). Ser/Gly restriction also led to increased survival of MitoSnaphi CD8+ T cells in vitro. Because glucose-derived serine can be synthesized by PHGDH, we also kept cells in Ser/Gly-depleted medium combined with PHGDH inhibition, and we did not observe any further increase in survival rates (Fig. 7f). Thus, despite the higher expression of Phgdh in MitoSnaphi cells and considering the higher expression of nutrient transporters, 1C metabolism seems to mostly rely on amino acid uptake and not on de novo synthesis of serine.

a, The genes involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism were projected onto UMAP clusters. b, CTV-labelled naive MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated on anti-CD3-, anti-CD28- and Fc-ICAM-1-coated plates for 36–40 h. They were cultured in T cell medium containing 500 nM 4OHT. Sixteen hours post activation, the cells were collected and labelled with Snap-Cell 647-SiR (preM/old mitochondria) and cultured for further 24 h. Cells were subsequently collected and prepared for the Scenith assay, aiming to evaluate their metabolic reliance, or cultured in different serine and glycine availability conditions for 7 days. c, 1C metabolism summary.

To more definitively dissect metabolic differences between MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells, we performed targeted metabolomics of WT and autophagy-deficient first-daughter cells (Fig. 8a and sorting as in Extended Data Fig. 3a). We combined it with flux analysis (24 h) of both 13C-glucose and 13C-serine (Fig. 8b). Our results revealed that cells retaining preM older mitochondria, as a consequence of segregation and/or lower mitochondrial turnover, exhibit higher abundance of serine. We also observed a discrete but significant higher flux of 13C carbon units originating from glucose or serine to these amino acids (Fig. 8c,d). By evaluating the metabolic profile of autophagy-deficient cells, we confirmed that mitochondrial turnover is a major driver of this phenotype, as MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells mostly did not exhibit significant differences in serine and glycine abundance and 13C fraction contribution within these amino acids (Fig. 8d and Extended Data Fig. 9). However, the expression profile of other metabolites appeared to be influenced by the presence of preM/old mitochondria, even under autophagy-deficient conditions, such as glutathione, pentose phosphate and NAD (Extended Data Fig. 10). Thus, these results further support that inheritance of heterogeneous mitochondrial pools drives T cell fate divergence and this is caused by distinct strategies to fulfil metabolic demands: MitoSnaplo cells are more quiescent and quickly turn over mitochondria, which includes mitochondrial biogenesis, while MitoSnaphi cells keep old mitochondria, rely on glycolysis and turn on one-carbon metabolism, one of the first consequences after a mitochondrial insult52.

a, CTV-labelled naive MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT-Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre or KO-Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated on anti-CD3-, anti-CD28- and Fc-ICAM-1-coated plates for 40 h. The cells were cultured in T cell medium containing 500 nM 4OHT. A total of 16 h post activation, the cells were collected and labelled with Snap-Cell 647-SiR (preM/old mitochondria) and cultured for further 24 h in presence of 13C-glucose (2 g l−1) or 13C-serine (30 mg l−1). MitoSnaplo and MitoSnaphi cells were sorted and their metabolome was evaluated. b, 1C metabolism summary.

Most of the previous functional readouts evaluating the role of ACD in early fate decisions have relied on sorting daughter cells based on the expression of CD8 or the transcription factor c-Myc, with CD8hi/c-Mychi cells being effector-like and CD8lo/c-Myclo cells being memory-like progenies22,24,27. However, the expression of these molecules is highly dynamic and cannot be directly linked to asymmetric segregation events. Asymmetric mTOR activity in effector-like daughter cells has been linked to its translocation to lysosomes and amino acid sensing, but in vivo function readouts relied on correlative CD8 expression49. Concerning the asymmetric partitioning of degradation pathways, proteasome activity has been shown to contribute to distinct T-bet distribution between daughter cells, but the results were not directly linked to in vivo T cell fates25. A recent pioneering study used genetic barcoding to evaluate the transcriptome of genuine sister cells and demonstrated that early fate trajectories can be established since first CD8+ T cell division28. However, there is currently no evidence to directly link this divergence to the inheritance of a fate determinant. A previous report provides preliminary evidence that mitochondrial clearance can impact on lymphocyte metabolism36 but relied on the loss of Mitotracker Green FM fluorescence, a labelling that can be perturbed by the oxidative status of the cell, affecting cell viability and prone to cell efflux53,54,55. Thus, we are first to show that the asymmetric inheritance of an unequivocal preM cell cargo, which is regulated by differential autophagy-dependent mitochondrial turnover rates, causes divergent T cell fate commitment. This was possible because the MitoSnap system allows specific labelling of mitochondria and discrimination of segregation, degradation and biogenesis events that can influence organelle inheritance. Tagging mitochondria before and after mitosis allows precise discrimination of segregation and degradation events, something which was not achieved in previous reports using dyes, expression of surface markers or reporter genes.

Mitochondria are organelles required to meet the cell's energetic demands. They are the site of OXPHOS, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid oxidation, pathways involved in the generation of ATP. They are also involved in maintaining the redox balance of the cell, as they can produce ROS, are involved in calcium signalling, can drive apoptotic cell death and, by being core metabolic modulators, also contribute to epigenetic regulation of cell function5,56. The results from several studies provide evidence that different T cells subsets exhibit distinct mitochondrial metabolism and function: effector cells are highly glycolytic and memory cells rely on fatty acid oxidation34,35,57,58. Accordingly, mitochondrial quality control plays an important role in T cell fate decisions with mitophagy being a crucial regulator of cell survival17,19,59,60. Thus, mitochondria constitute a suitable cell cargo to be linked to differentiation trajectories, which was corroborated by our initial proteomics screening identifying mitochondrial-related proteins being differentially enriched in memory-like and effector-like CD8+ T cell daughters.

The emergence of cells that maintain or lose their MitoSnap labelling during CD8+ T cell proliferation could result from different cell biological processes, and we dissected the mechanisms underlying the inheritance of mitochondria from the mother cell. First, we identified that ACD contributes to the polarized inheritance of preM/old mitochondria. However, progenies able to clear preM/old mitochondria also rapidly lost their labelling for postM/young mitochondria, suggesting that MitoSnaplo cells emerge from both segregation and degradation events, with mitophagy levels being higher in this population. Autophagy and mitophagy support memory CD8+ T cell responses, but it remained unclear when these mechanisms are required to contribute to the formation of memory precursors or the maintenance of long-lived cells15,16,17,19. To address whether autophagy plays a role in unequal mitochondrial inheritance, we used autophagy-deficient cells and found that asymmetric inheritance of preM/old mitochondria was impaired and, as opposed to autophagy-competent cells, old mitochondria were kept for several days. These results and the more symmetric proteome of CD8hi and CD8lo progenies from autophagy-deficient or old CD8+ T cells, corroborate our initial hypothesis and place ACD and autophagy/mitophagy as mechanisms that work synergistically to promote early asymmetric inheritance of cell fate determinants. This was confirmed by our finding that significant differences found between the metabolomes of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo first-daughter cells were lost when they emerged from autophagy-deficient mother cells.

By following the frequencies of cells inheriting or not preM/old mitochondria (MitoSnaphi/lo) over the course of the immune responses it became clear that MitoSnaplo cells were more functional memory cells, as they showed better maintenance, re-expansion potential and ability to produce effector-cytokines upon restimulation. This resembles results obtained for CD8hi/c-Mychi and CD8lo/c-Myclo cells22,27, with the advantage that we can finally draw a definitive link between the inheritance of a cell cargo that already existed in the mother cell to the biased fate of its progenies. Due to poor survival after adoptive transfer and delayed antigenic challenge, we were unable to assess the in vivo fate of autophagy-deficient progenies, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial turnover for the long-term maintenance of T cells. We then directed our attention to determine what drives the different fates of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells. By using sorted populations or approaches that provide single-cell resolution, we determined that the metabolism, survival and proliferative capacity of these progenies are different. Exhibiting lower translation rates, higher frequencies of slow-dividing cells and CD62L expression and better survival capacity in absence of antigen, MitoSnaplo cells clearly showed a stronger memory phenotype than MitoSnaphi cells23,42. Although, surprisingly, we could not observe significant differences in mitochondrial respiration rates, MitoSnaphi cells relied more on glycolysis, a feature seen in effector CD8+ T cells. As old organelles also produced mitochondrial ROS as measured by MitoSOX, it is reasonable to assume that they have deteriorated mitochondrial fitness and that this might promote their early metabolic shift34. Mitophagy has recently been reported to contribute to memory CD8+ T cell formation17. Our results add to this, showing that mitophagy contributes to the decision for memory CD8+ T cell fate commitment as early as the first mitosis following CD8+ T cell stimulation, as directly measured by the rapid loss of young mitochondria in MitoSnaplo cells.

Finally, to obtain an unbiased overview of the differences between MitoSnaplo and MitoSnaphi cells following the first mitosis post naive CD8+ T cell activation, we performed both bulk proteomics and single cell transcriptomics of these two populations. In line with our expectations, we observed proteins linked to effector cell fate decision in MitoSnaphi cells and proteins linked to DNA health and mitochondrial biogenesis in MitoSnaplo cells. It also came to our attention that a long list of kinesins (Kif genes) was enriched in effector-like MitoSnaphi daughters. Kinesins are motor proteins directly involved in intracellular trafficking of cell components along microtubules, which is important for organelle movement and for cell division events61. We speculate that these proteins might promote polarization of autophagosomes and mitochondria towards the MitoSnaphi daughter cell, but addressing this in T cell is challenging because of their small cytoplasm. Single cell transcriptomics allowed us to identify clusters that were enriched in MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells. The presence of a memory-like cluster enriched in MitoSnaplo cells, where this signature was also stronger than in MitoSnaphi cells, further cements this cell type as the one inheriting memory potential.

Transcriptomics analysis also led us to identify a new metabolic pathway more abundant in MitoSnaphi cells, with a signature characterized by the significantly upregulated expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism, which was confirmed by metabolomics analysis. 1C metabolism comprises methionine and folate cycles that provide 1C units to boost de novo synthesis of nucleotides and promote amino acid homeostasis and redox defence, particularly important in dividing cells such as cancer cells62. Enzymes involved in 1C metabolism can be found in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, and both sets were upregulated in MitoSnaphi cells. This was confirmed by evaluating the expression of SHMT2 in individual mitochondria by microscopy. However, when comparing the metabolome of MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells from WT and autophagy-deficient cells, it became clear that autophagy loss is not solely responsible for the unequal expression of several metabolites, highlighting the synergy between mitochondrial segregation and degradation events in T cell fate commitment. Serine is an important donor of the 1C units when it is converted to glycine, and in CD8+ T cells, this amino acid has been shown to be important for clonal expansion of effector cells63. 1C metabolism has also been directly investigated in different CD4+ T cell subsets and studies support its role in mTOR activation and the establishment of proinflammatory and highly proliferative populations51. Because expression of several amino acid transporters, including serine transporters, is upregulated in MitoSnaphi cells, which also exhibit defective translation upon 1C metabolism inhibition, our results provide further evidence of the role of this pathway in effector T cell metabolism and also suggest that it can be effectively targeted to modulate T cell fate decisions.

Collectively, our results support the notion that unequal organelle inheritance plays an important role in CD8+ T cell fate decision and contributes to the metabolic status of cell progenies. Previous reports using the SnapTag model in epithelial-stem like cell lines found that inheritance of old organelles promotes oxidative metabolism leading to cell differentiation64. In intestinal stem cells, progenies inhering old mitochondria produce elevated levels of α-ketoglutarate, which benefits Paneth cell formation and supports niche renewal38. In cells from the haematopoietic lineage, the polarized presence of organelles during mitosis followed by long-term quantitative single-cell imaging has been reported, with the caveat that they were identified by dyes or probes that limit interpretation about their inheritance65. Here, we show that organelle inheritance in primary T cells results from both degradation and segregation and that mitophagy and ACD work synergistically to form early memory-like cells and effector-like cells. As cells retaining (or not) older organelles are endowed with distinct metabolic signatures, our results suggest that therapeutic modulation of T cells can have different outcomes depending on when it is performed. PreM modulation will globally impact on T cell differentiation, and postmitotic approaches can selectively target a certain cell type, memory or effector, by inhibiting or improving its function. We anticipate that these findings will be relevant to a better understanding of how T cell diversity is early imprinted. Whether knowledge gained from this study is likely to be applicable to other cells that undergo ACD is to be investigated. Overall our data will pave the way for the development of more efficient therapeutic strategies in the context of regenerative medicine and particularly important in the context of ageing.

This study aimed to evaluate whether organelle inheritance controls CD8+ T cell differentiation. To achieve that, we investigated the role of ACD and autophagy in patterns of mitochondria inheritance. The novel MitoSnap model was used to allow specific tracking of old versus young organelles. We used imaging analysis of mitotic CD8+ T cells, flow cytometry readouts that allow single cell resolution, metabolic analysis and unbiased OMICS approaches to measure differences in phenotype and function between MitoSnaplo and MitoSnaphi progenies. We used adoptive cell transfers of TCR-transgenic OT-I MitoSnap cells coupled to Listeria monocytogenes-OVA infections as a tool to assess immune responses and the impact of old organelle inheritance in vivo. All conclusions rely on at least two experiments. No randomization or blinding was used. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications from the field, including our own.

All animal work was reviewed and approved by Oxford Ethical committee and the UK Home office under the project licences PPL30/3388 and P01275425. Mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in-house, housed on a 12 h dark–light cycle, with a 30 min period of dawn and dusk and fed ad libitum. The temperature was kept between 20 °C and 24 °C, with a humidity level of 45–65%. Housing cages were individually ventilated and provided an enriched environment for the animals. Omp25-SnapTagfl/fl mice were kindly provided by the lab of Professor Pekka Katajisto. This strain was then bred with CD45.1 Atg16l1fl/fl Ert2Cre OT-I mice expressing a TCR specific for OVA257–264 SIINFEKL peptide41 and maintained as CD45.1 or CD45.1/2 mice. Host mice in adoptive transfer experiments were either B6.SJL.CD45.1 or C57BL/6 naive mice. The 6–16-week-old mice were considered young, and >100-week-old mice were considered aged.

Spleen and inguinal lymph nodes were collected. Single-cell suspensions were used for naive CD8+ T cell isolation using EasySep Mouse Naive CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified populations were cultured (at 37 °C, 5% CO2) in T cell medium: RPMI-1640 containing HEPES buffer and L-glutamine (R5158, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% filtered foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco). T cell activation was done on anti-CD3 (5 μg ml−1) (145-2C11, BioLegend), anti-CD28 (5 μg ml−1) (37.51, BioLegend) and recombinant human or murine Fc-ICAM-1 (10 μg ml−1) (R&D Systems) coated plates. The 36–40 h post activation cells were used in downstream assays. Autophagy deletion and/or SnapTag expression were induced by culturing cells in presence of 500 nM (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, H7904-5MG). To determine cell division events, cells were stained with Cell Trace Violet (CTV) (Life Technologies) following manufacture's guidelines.

MitoSnap CD8+ T cells were labelled in one or three steps. Labelling of preM/old organelles was done by collecting CD8+ T cells 12–16 h post activation and washing them in PBS (500g). The cells were incubated in T cell medium containing the first fluorescent SnapSubstrate for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS and put back in culture in their original wells for further 20–24 h. When postM/young organelle labelling was also performed, cells were collected, washed and incubated with T cell medium containing 5 μM of unlabelled SnapSubstrate (Snap-Cell Block S9106S, New England Biolabs (NEB)) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells rested for 30–60 min in T cell medium and then were incubated with the second fluorescent SnapSubstrate for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescent cell-permeable Snap-Cell substrates (NEB) were used in the following concentrations: 3 μM (Snap-Cell 647-SiR S9102S), 3 μM (Snap-Cell TMR-Star S9105S) and 5 μM (Snap-Cell Oregon Green S9104S). BafA (20 nM) or CCCP (1 µM) were used to assess the role of autophagy and mitophagy, respectively, in the loss of OMP25 SnapTag labelling.

Following activation, isolated MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT versus ATG16L1-deficient or MitoSnaphi versus MitoSnaplo first-daughter cells) were cultured in T cell medium supplemented with murine IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 (5 ng ml−1). Cell proliferation was evaluated 3 days later, and cell survival was assessed 7 days later. For experiments evaluating the role of serine and glycine depletion, RPMI-1640 was substituted by 1× RPMI-1640 media without glucose, glycine and serine (Teknova), supplemented with 2 g l−1 of D-glucose (standard concentration found in standard RPMI medium). PHGDH inhibition was done adding 10 µM of PKUMDL-WQ-2201 to the medium.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified CTV-labelled MitoSnaphi or MitoSnaplo cells (equal numbers in the same experiment to allow comparison between the two groups) were intravenously injected into naive recipients. In the following day or >30 days later, mice were infected with 2 × 103 colony forming units of Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (LM-OVA) intravenously. LM-OVA was kindly provided by Prof. Audrey Gerard (Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford). LM-OVA growth was done from frozen aliquots in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (Sigma, #53286-100G). Bacteria were used for infections when reaching exponential growth. Immune responses were tracked in the blood and at the memory-phase spleens were collected.

At different timepoints post stimulation (preM or mitotic/postmitotic), CD8+ T cells were collected. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 1–2 μM MitoSOX Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C before collection. The cells were washed in PBS and transferred on poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) treated coverslips, followed by incubation for 45–60 min at 37 °C. Attached cells were fixed with 2% methanol-free paraformaldehyde in PBS (ThermoScientific) for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. The following antibodies were used to perform immunofluorescence stainings in murine cells: mouse anti-β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-mouse IgG AF488 (Abcam), anti-CD8 APC 53-6.7 (BioLegend) and anti-LC3B (D11) XP Rabbit mAb PE (Cell Signalling). DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to detect DNA. ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (ThermoScientific) was used as mounting medium. Mitotic cells (late anaphase to cytokinesis) were identified by nuclear morphology and/or presence of two microtubule organizing centres and a clear tubulin bridge between two daughter cells. A total of 40–80 Z-stacks (0.13 μM) were acquired with a ZEISS 980 Airyscan 2 with a C-Apochromat 63×/1.2 W Corr magnification objective and the ZenBlue software. The data were analysed using Fiji/ImageJ. Thresholds for quantification were set up individually for each fluorophore. Asymmetry rates were calculated based on the integrated density (volume and fluorescence intensity measurements were considered) of cell cargoes inherited by each daughter cell. This was done by using the following calculation: (P1 − P2)/(P1 + P2), where P1 is the daughter cell with higher integrated density of CD8 or old mitochondria. Any values above 0.2 or below −0.2 were considered asymmetric, which corresponds to one daughter cell inheriting at least 1.5× more of a cell cargo than its sibling.

Planar SLBs were made as described previously66. In brief, glass coverslips were plasma-cleaned and assembled into disposable six-channel chambers (Ibidi). SLBs were formed by incubation of each channel with small unilammellar vesicles containing 12.5 mol% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid) succinyl] (nickel salt) and 0.05 mol% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl) (sodium salt) in 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine at total phospholipid concentration 0.4 mM. Chambers were filled with human serum albumin-supplemented HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), subsequently referred to as HEPES-buffered saline/human serum albumin. Following blocking with 5% casein in PBS containing 100 μM NiSO4, to saturate NTA sites, fluorescently labelled streptavidin was then coupled to biotin head groups. Biotinylated 2C11-Fab fragments (30 molecules per square micrometre) and His-tagged ICAM-1 (200 molecules per square micrometre) and CD80 (100 molecules per square micrometre) were then incubated with the bilayers at concentrations to achieve the indicated site densities. Bilayers were continuous liquid disordered phase as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching with a 10 µm bleach spot on an FV1200 confocal microscope (Olympus).

Naive murine CD8+ T cells were incubated at 37 °C on an SLB. After 10 min, the cells were fixed with 4% methanol-free formaldehyde in PHEM buffer (10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Anti-CD3 staining was used to identify TCR regions and actin was labelled with fluorescent phalloidin.

Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was performed on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a four-line (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm laser) illumination system. The system was fitted with an Olympus UApON 150 × 1.45 numerical aperture objective and a Photometrics Evolve Delta EMCCD camera to provide Nyquist sampling. A quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed with ImageJ.

Blood samples used for kinetics analysis were obtained from the tail vein at weeks 1, 2 and 3 post-LM-OVA challenge. At end timepoints, spleens were collected and single-cell splenocytes were prepared by meshing whole spleens through 70 µm strainers using a 1 ml syringe plunger. When cytokine production was assessed, splenocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 μM of SIINFEKL peptide, followed by 4 h in presence of SIINFEKL peptide + 10 µg ml−1 of brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Specific CD8+ T cells were evaluated by incubation with SIINFEKL257-264-APC-labelled or SIINFEKL257-264-BV421-labelled tetramers (NIH Tetramer Core Facility at Emory University). Erythrocytes were lysed by red blood cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen). Conjugated antibodies used for surface staining were: anti-CD127 A7R34, anti-CD25 PC61 (AF700, PE-Cy7, BioLegend; APC, eBioscience), anti-CD44 IM7 (AF700, BV785, PE, PerCPCy5.5, BioLegend), anti-CD45.1 A20 (BV785, FITC, PB, BioLegend), anti-CD45.2 104 (AF700, BV711, FITC, BioLegend), anti-CD62L MEL-14 (FITC, BioLegend; eF450, eBioscience), anti-KLRG1 2F1 (BV711, BV785, BioLegend), anti-CD8 53-6.7 (BV510, BV605, FITC, PE, BioLegend) and anti-TCRβ H57-597 (APC-Cy7, PerCPCy5.5, BioLegend). Cells were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. When intracellular staining was performed, cells were fixed/permed with 2× FACS Lysis Solution (BD Biosciences) with 0.08% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT with anti-IL-2 JES6-5H4 (APC, BioLegend), anti-IFN-γ XMG1.2 (BV421, BioLegend) and anti-TNF MP6-XT22 (PE-Cy7, Thermo Fisher). Identification of viable cells was done by fixable near-IR dead cell staining (Life Technologies). TMRM (100 nM) and MitoSOX (2 µM) labelling was done before staining of surface markers, by incubating cells for 15 min at 37 °C in T cell medium. All samples were washed and stored in PBS containing 2% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mM of EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) before acquisition. Stained samples were acquired on a FACS LSR II (R/B/V) or a Fortessa X-20 (R/B/V/YG) flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software. Data analysis was done using FlowJo software (FlowJo Enterprise, version 10.10, BD Biosciences).

After activation, CTV- and SnapSubstrate-labelled MitoSnap CD8+ T cells were collected and stained for phenotypical markers (anti-CD44 IM7, anti-CD45.1 A20, anti-CD45.2 104 and anti-CD8 53-6.7 conjugated to different fluorophores depending on experiment, all BioLegend). Dead cells were excluded by staining cells with a fixable Live/Dead dye (Invitrogen, L34993 or L34957). Subpopulations of interest were sorted on a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

We used a modified version of the Scenith assay45, which describes a high correlation between protein translation and ATP production. New protein synthesis was measured using the Click-iT Plus OPP Protein Synthesis Assay (Thermo Fisher, C10456/C10457) according to manufacturer's protocol. In short, the cells were incubated in T cell medium for 30 min at 37 °C without any metabolic inhibitors or in presence of 1 μM oligomycin (Merck), 100 mM 2DG (Merck), a combination of both, 1 μM of SHIN1 (Cambridge Bioscience), 20 μM of PKUMDL-WQ-2201 (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 μM of LY345899 (Sigma-Aldrich). This was followed by incubation with 10 μM of alkynylated puromycin analogue OPP for 30 min at 37 °C. Click Chemistry was performed with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 dye picolyl azide. Metabolic reliance was assessed by comparing the OPP gMFI, used as an indicator of the relative translation rate, of inhibited samples to the vehicle control.

Following (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, H7904-5MG) treatment for 24 h and/or BafA treatment (10 nM) for 2 h or not, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche). Protein concentration was calculated by using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). Samples were diluted in 4× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. A total of 20 µg protein per sample were used for SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis–Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen) with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) was used. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk-TBST (TBS 10× (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted to 1× in distilled water containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 1% skimmed milk-TBST and at room temperature for 1 h with secondary antibodies diluted in 1% skimmed milk-TBST supplemented 0.01% SDS. Primary antibodies used were: anti-ATG16L1, clone EPR15638 (Abcam, ab187671) and anti-GAPDH and clone 6C5 (Sigma-Aldrich, MAB374). Secondary antibodies used were: IRDye 680LT Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Licor, 926-680-70) and IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Licor, 926-322-11). Images were acquired using the Odyssey CLx Imaging System. The data were analysed using Image Studio Lite or Fiji.

Autophagy-sufficient (Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) and autophagy-deficient (Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) MitoSnap CD8+ T cells were activated, labelled for preM/old (SNAP-Cell TMR-Star or 647-SiR, NEB) and postM/young organelles (SNAP-Cell Oregon Green, NEB), as previously described, and after 40 h washed with complete T cell medium. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold mitochondria isolation buffer (320 mM sucrose, 2 mM EGTA,10 mM Tris–HCl, at pH 7.2 in water) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer with a 2 ml reservoir capacity (Abcam). We performed 20 strokes with a type B pretzel. The homogenizer was rinsed with distilled water before each sample was processed to avoid cross-contamination. Differential centrifugation of homogenates was done at 1,000g (4 °C for 8 min), which resulted in a pellet containing whole cells and isolated nuclei first. The supernatant containing the mitochondria was then transferred into new tubes and centrifuged at 17,000g (4 °C for 15 min). Enriched mitochondria, which appeared as brown-coloured pellets, were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.5 ml PBS on ice for 15 min, followed by a wash with PBS. Mitochondria were resuspended in blocking buffer containing anti-Tom20-BV421 antibody for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, mitochondria were resuspended in 250 μl filtered (0.2 μm) PBS and acquired using a BD Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer. The threshold for SSC-A (log-scale) was set to the minimum value (20,000) to allow acquisition of subcellular particles. Submicron particle size reference beads (0.5, 1 and 2 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were also used to identify mitochondria.

MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells were purified by FACS and their OCR were measured using a XF96 MitoStress Test (Seahorse Agilent, 103015-100). Activated CD8+ T cells were washed in RPMI-1640 without sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM glucose, 1% FCS, 2 mM pyruvate and seeded in a XF plate (Agilent, 103793-100) coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) at equal densities in corresponding assay medium (XF Assay Medium, 103680-100) pH 7.4 supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L-glutamine. Test compounds were sequentially injected to obtain the following concentrations: 1 µM oligomycin, 1.5 µM FCCP, 1 µM rotenone and 1 µM antimycin A. OCRs were normalized to cell number using CyQuant (Molecular Probes).

Sorted MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo CD8+ T cells were boiled in 100 mM Tris, 4 mM EDTA, pH 7.74 buffer for 2 min at 100 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was used for analysis. ATP levels were assessed using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples and ATP standard mixtures were swiftly combined with an equal volume of luciferase and promptly measured in a luminometer (BMG CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader). Normalization was performed by adjusting values based on the total number of sorted cells. The experiment was performed twice. Each experiment was done with two samples per group (each sample pooled from two biological replicates).

Proteomics analysis was done as previously described67. CD8hi and CD8lo or MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo daughter cells following naive CD8+ T cell activation were purified by FACS. The cell pellets were washed 2× in PBS before being stored at −80 °C before proteomics analysis. Samples were resuspended in 200 µl of S-Trap lysis buffer (10% SDS, 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate) and sonicated for 15 min (30 s on, 30 s off, 100% amplitude, 70% pulse). The samples were centrifuged and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein quantification was done using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). A total of 150 μg of protein was processed using S-Trap mini columns (Protifi, #CO2-mini-80). The samples were digested overnight with 3.75 μg of trypsin (Thermo Fisher, Pierce Trypsin Protease MS-Grade, #90057) with a second digest with the same amount of trypsin for 6 h the following day. The peptides were extracted, dried under vacuum and resuspended to 50 μl with 1% formic acid (Thermo Fisher, #85178) and quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Fluorometric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher, #23290).

Peptides were injected onto a nanoscale C18 reverse-phase chromatography system (UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano, Thermo Fisher) and electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (MS) (Thermo Fisher). For liquid chromatography the following buffers were used: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)). The samples were loaded at 10 μl min−1 onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The trap column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid then switched in-line with a Thermo Fisher, resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å). Peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl min−1 with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to 35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally from 35% buffer B to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was kept at a constant temperature of 50 °C. The data was acquired using an easy spray source operated in positive mode with spray voltage at 2.60 kV, and the ion transfer tube temperature at 250 °C. The MS was operated in DIA mode. A scan cycle comprised a full MS scan (m/zrange from 350 to 1,650), with RF lens at 40%, AGC target set to custom, normalized AGC target at 300%, maximum injection time mode set to custom, maximum injection time at 20 ms, microscan set to 1 and source fragmentation disabled. MS survey scan was followed by MS/MS DIA scan events using the following parameters: multiplex ions set to false, collision energy mode set to stepped, collision energy type set to normalized, HCD collision energies set to 25.5%, 27% and 30%, orbitrap resolution 30000, first mass 200, RF lens 40%, AGC target set to custom, normalized AGC target 3,000%, microscan set to 1 and maximum injection time 55 ms. The data for both MS scan and MS/MS DIA scan events were acquired in profile mode.

Analysis of the DIA data was carried out using Spectronaut Biognosys, AG (version 14.7.201007.47784 for CD8hi and CD8lo cells obtained from young, Atg16l1-deficient and old mice; version 17.6.230428.55965 for MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells). The data were analysed using the direct DIA workflow, with the following settings: imputation, profiling and cross run normalization were disabled; data Filtering to Qvalue; Precursor Qvalue Cutoff and Protein Qvalue Cutoff (Experimental) set to 0.01; maximum of two missed trypsin cleavages; PSM, protein and peptide false-discovery rate levels set to 0.01; cysteine carbamidomethylation set as fixed modification and acetyl (N-term), deamidation (asparagine, glutamine), oxidation of methionine set as variable modifications. The database used for CD8hi and CD8lo cells was mouse_swissprot_isoforms_extra_trembl_06_20.fasta (2020-06) and for mitosnap samples was the Mus musculus proteome obtained from uniprot.org (2022-02). Data filtering, protein copy number and concentration quantification was performed in the Perseus software package, version 1.6.6.0. Copy numbers were calculated using the proteomic ruler as described33. The samples were grouped according to the condition. Outliers were excluded following analysis of histone counts in each sample. The P values were calculated via a two-tailed, unequal-variance t-test on log-normalized data. Elements with P values <0.05 were considered significant, with a fold-change cut-off >1.5 or <0.67.

Single cell RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ GEX v3.1 assay (10x Genomics). In short, cell suspensions were encapsulated into gel beads in emulsion using the Chromium Controller. Within each gel bead in emulsion, cell lysis and barcoded reverse transcription of RNA occurred, followed by complementary DNA amplification. The amplified cDNA underwent library construction via fragmentation, end-repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and index PCR. Final libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. Initial data processing was conducted with Cell Ranger 7.2.0.

Filtered output matrices were processed using Seurat. After loading the data and assigning unique identifiers to each dataset, cells with more than 10% mitochondrial gene content were excluded to ensure data quality. The datasets were normalized using SCTransform, and PCA was conducted for dimensionality reduction. Integration of the datasets was achieved using the Harmony algorithm, followed by clustering and differential expression analysis. Finally, the integrated data were visualized using UMAP. UMAP projections of resulting clusters and gene expression of gene sets were generated using Loupe Browser. This methodology enabled a robust analysis while accounting for technical variations and maintaining biological integrity.

To investigate the pseudotemporal dynamics of our single-cell RNA sequencing data, we utilized Monocle368, an advanced tool designed for trajectory inference and differential expression analysis. In previous steps, using the Seurat package, the cells were preprocessed, and size factors were estimated and normalized. Dimensionality reduction was performed using UMAP to capture the intrinsic structure of the data, followed by clustering to identify distinct cell populations. These clusters were annotated based on known marker genes, and the cluster annotations were integrated into the metadata for further analysis.

For trajectory inference, we converted the Seurat object to a Monocle3 object69. Separate trajectory analyses were conducted for the MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo original identities. Each subset of cells was reclustered using UMAP, and principal graphs were constructed to capture the developmental trajectories of the cells. Pseudotime values were then computed to represent the progression of cells along these inferred trajectories.

MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells were FACS isolated and prepared for immunofluorescence as described above. Z-stacks (0.13 μm) were acquired with a ZEISS 980 Airyscan 2 with a C-Apochromat 63×/1.2 W Corr magnification objective and the ZenBlue software. Image voxels were made isotropic via upscaling using the ‘zoom' function of the SciPy Multidimensional image package70. A feathering algorithm, to pick up on mitochondria outlines, in combination with multi-Otsu thresholding and a custom set of operators (that is, erosions, closing and filling of holes) from scikit-image (Python) were used for segmentation of individual mitochondria71. Both the Tom20 and MitoSnap channels were combined to enable identification of all mitochondria. Segments smaller than 500 pixels (noise) were excluded from further analysis. Separate organelles were given a unique identifier using the ‘label' function from scikit-image. Each segmented organelle was used to create a mask on the isotropic pixel converted images, which allowed quantification of fluorescence intensity values (calculated as the average pixel intensity/number of pixels in the segmented volume). Segmented organelles had their geometric parameter measurements extracted and standardized, and included sphericity, roundness, compactness, surface area72 and volume. Mitochondrial complexity was calculated as previously described73.

The data were visualized with UMAP. Only geometric parameters were used to remove any bias in the analysis. A Gaussian kernal density estimate was plotted to produce the contour/density map of UMAP points for visualization of mitochondria distribution shifts. Mitochondria were grouped and analysed for geometric parameters based on their cell of origin (MitoSnaphi versus MitoSnaplo) and intensity of SnapTag labelling. MitoSnaplo cells exhibited only mitochondria with low intensity of SnapTag labelling. In MitoSnaphi cells, low intensity was determined by intensity values below the maximum intensity value found in MitoSnaplo cells; mid intensity was determined as values above this threshold, but below the 75th percentile value found in MitoSnaphi cells; high mitochondria were identified using SnapTag labelling intensity values above the 75th percentile value for found in MitoSnaphi cells.

CTV-labelled naive MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (WT-Atg16l1fl/+ Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre or knockout (KO)-Atg16l1fl/fl Omp25fl/+ Ert2Cre) were activated on anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and Fc-ICAM-1 coated plates for 40 h. The cells were cultured in T cell medium containing 500 nM Z-4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). Then, 16 h post activation, the cells were collected and labelled with Snap-Cell 647-SiR (preM/old mitochondria) and cultured for further 24 h in presence of 13C-glucose (2 g l−1) or 13C-serine (30 mg l−1). Metabolites were extracted from cell pellets of sorted MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo daughter cells. A total of 10 µl of each sample was loaded into a Dionex UltiMate 3000 LC System (Thermo Scientific Bremen, Germany) equipped with a C18 column (Acquity UPLC -HSS T3 1.8 µm; 2.1 × 150 mm, Waters) coupled to a Q Exactive Orbitrap MS (Thermo Scientific) operating in negative ion mode. A step gradient was carried out using solvent A (10 mM TBA and 15 mM acetic acid) and solvent B (100% methanol). The gradient started with 0% of solvent B and 100% solvent A and remained at 0% B until 2 min post injection. A linear gradient to 32.3% B was carried out until 7 min and increased to 36.3% until 14 min. Between 14 and 26 min, the gradient increased to 90.9% of B and remained at 90.9% B for 4 min. At 30 min the gradient returned to 0% B. The chromatography was stopped at 40 min. The flow was kept constant at 0.25 ml min−1 and the column was placed at 40 °C throughout the analysis. The MS operated in full scan mode (m/z range 70.0000–1,050.0000) using a spray voltage of 4.80 kV, capillary temperature of 300 °C, sheath gas at 40.0 and auxiliary gas at 10.0. The AGC target was set at 3 × 106 using a resolution of 70,000, with a maximum IT fill time of 512 ms. Data collection was performed using the Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific). The data analyses were performed by integrating the peak areas (El-Maven–Polly, Elucidata).

To test if data point values were in a Gaussian distribution, a normality test was performed before applying parametric or non-parametric statistical analysis. When two groups were compared, paired or unpaired Student's t-test or Mann–Whitney test were applied. When comparisons were done across more than two experimental groups, analyses were performed using a Dunn test with Bonferroni correction or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey's test multiple testing correction. The P values were considered significant when <0.05, and the exact P values are provided in the figures. All analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 10 software.

(C) OT-I MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (Omp25-SnapTagfl/fl Ert2Cre) were activated, labelled for preM/old and postM/young mitochondria (Fig. 2a) and sorted into MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo prior to adoptive transfer (5×104 cells intravenously) into new hosts. Progenies emerging from MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells were monitored over the course of an immune response against Listeria monocytogenes expressing OVA (LM-OVA) (Fig. 3a). At 30 days post-challenge, phenotype of OT-I cells was evaluated by the expression of KLRG1 and CD127. Frequencies of short-lived effector cells (KLRG1+ CD127−) and memory-committed (KLRG1−CD127+) were calculated. Gating strategy is depicted on the right. Representative data of 1 (n = 3 biological replicates) out of 3 experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. (C) Tat-cre driven-recombination was used as an alternative for the 4OHT-driven recombination using Ert2Cre. Recombination efficiency was evaluated by SnapTag labelling. Cells that did express Omp25-SnapTag up to 16 h post Tat-cre recombination were sorted and cultured for further 24 h. First-daughter OT-I MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells were sorted and used in adoptive transfer experiments (2×104 cells intravenously) (similar to Fig. 3a). Progenies emerging from MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells were monitored over the course of an immune response against Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (OVA) (LM-OVA). Representative data of 1 (nhi=4, nlo = 5) out of 2 experiments.

Source Data

OT-I MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (Omp25-SnapTagfl/fl Ert2Cre) were activated, labelled for preM/old mitochondria and, following one division cycle (first-daughter cells), sorted into MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo populations. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence and imaged by confocal microscopy. Individual mitochondria were segmented and had their geometric parameter measurements extracted and standardized. Fluorescence intensity of preM/old mitochondria SnapTag labelling was also quantified. UMAP projections (generated using geometrical parameters) highlighting: (A) surface area; (B) volume; (C) roundness; (D) sphericity; (E) complexity; (F) compactness; (G) area/volume; (H) intensity of preM/old SnapTag labelling in individual mitochondria. 1961 mitochondria were used to generate these projections. Pooled data from 2 independent experiments, each containing sorted cells from 2-3 biological replicates.

Source Data

FACS-purified MitoSnaphi CD8+ T cells from 3 biological replicates (based on preM/old and young MitoSnap expression) were imaged by confocal microscopy and had the mitochondrial architecture of young+ (n = 1262) and young− (n = 1171) networks compared. This was accompanied by quantification of MitoSnap labelling (young and preM/old OMP-25-SnapTag) intensities in each individual mitochondrion. Statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric Dunn test with Bonferroni correction. Exact P values are depicted in the figure.

Source Data

(A) OT-I MitoSnap CD8+ T cells (Omp25-SnapTagfl/fl Ert2Cre or Omp25-SnapTagfl/− Atg16l1fl/fl Ert2Cre) were activated, labelled for preM/old and postM/young mitochondria (Fig. 2a) and sorted into MitoSnaphi and MitoSnaplo cells. Their oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was then measured using a XF96 MitoStress Test. Basal respiration, maximal respiration, ATP-linked respiration and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) were calculated. 2-4 biological replicates from independent sorting experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.

In Stranger Things, the supernatural villain Vecna rules a nightmarish parallel world called the Upside Down. Credit: Netflix/Everett/Shutterstock

Throughout its five seasons, the Netflix show Stranger Things follows a ragtag group of teenagers and their parents as monsters from another universe — unleashed by the secret work of a government laboratory — wreak havoc on a quaint, fictional town in Indiana.

Don't worry, Demogorgons, Shadow Monsters and psychokinetically gifted 12-year-olds are strictly fictional creations. But the ‘parallel universe' concept at the core of the show — which is set to conclude its nearly decade-long run at the end of this year — comes from a real scientific theory. And it's been hotly debated by physicists over the past 75 or so years.

Although the series is as much in the realm of fantasy as science fiction, Stranger Things nods to many concepts of basic physics. Principles of electromagnetism explain haywire compasses, as well as magnets that spontaneously fall off a refrigerator. And in the third season, the characters save the world by using Planck's constant during their quest to close a gate to the other universe, called the Upside Down (although the show uses the 2014 value for Planck's constant, which wouldn't have been standard in the 1980s setting).

Physicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows

Physicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows

Perhaps the most prominent physics phenomenon mentioned in the programme, however, is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. After deducing that their friend might be stuck in the Upside Down, three pre-teen-boy protagonists ask their science teacher how they could travel there. He responds, “You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation, haven't you?”

In the 1950s, the US physicist Hugh Everett really did propose such an explanation for modern physics, and his theory has been collecting devotees ever since. Everett's work makes sense of a concept that has long baffled quantum physicists: the measurement problem. The question is how a quantum system can seem to be in two states at once — an electron that is simultaneously in two different locations, for example — until the moment the system is observed or measured, when all at once it's in only one of those states.

The most popular explanation for this conundrum, called the Copenhagen interpretation, says that the unobserved electron exists in a hazy quantum state of both options, described only by probabilities, until suddenly, on measurement, it ends up in one. Everett poses an almost fantastical alternative: the electron really exists in both states at once, and after the measurement, an observer sees only one state because the universe branches in two, with each outcome existing in a different world. The countless quantum states of all the world's particles create an infinite number of universes: hence, many worlds.

For many physicists, this idea is a bit far-fetched, particularly because if these many worlds can't interact, then there's no way to prove or falsify the theory, says Jorge Pullin, a theoretical physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

But for others — including Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has worked as a science adviser for science-fiction films — the many-worlds interpretation is the most elegant explanation out there. “There are a lot of people who think this is the simplest version of quantum mechanics, and it fits all the data,” he says. Of the many explanations of quantum theory, many worlds is currently the third most popular among quantum physicists, a Nature survey found earlier this year.

After decades of meticulous research initiated by the Nobel-prizewinning discovery of G proteins1, you might think that scientists know all there is to know about this crucial family of signalling proteins. Not so. In a paper in Nature by Stahl et al.2, and in a companion paper in Nature Communications by Bohn and Stahl3, researchers describe a twist on G-protein signalling that might hold the key to the rational design of opioid drugs with better pain-relieving capabilities and fewer unwanted side effects than those that are currently available.

The Avatar video game is better than the movies.

I say this as someone who has dumbly adored James Cameron's Avatar movies for a long time. The original 2009 film was my first ever midnight premiere, which I attended along with a friend who sat in the theater shirtless with his entire body painted blue. I can't forget that experience, or the nearly three-hour bioluminescent journey that followed, and the series has kept me hooked since.

People talk a lot of shit about Avatar. They find the movies' plots derivative, the characters forgettable, the run times almost inhumanely long. (The third movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is out now and clocks in at a whopping 3 hours and 15 minutes, not including previews.)

Those criticisms are fair. Correct, even. But the true Avatar sickos (hi) might ask, What if that experience could be even longer, actually? What if you could spend even more time trekking through the sprawling, glowing forests of a verdant alien moon? If that sounds appealing, boy, are you going to be excited to hear about the concept of video games.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a game developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft in 2023, lets you cavort around in the form of a 10-foot-tall Na'vi, the tribal species who live on the alien moon Pandora.

While the Avatar films are blockbusters that have melted the box office, the game was released to little fanfare and middling reviews, though it grew to become a sleeper hit. It has since garnered enough of a fan base that it has received significant updates in the two years since its debut, including downloadable content expansions and a free mode that switches the game's first-person view to a third-person view, letting players bask in all their character's big blueness. A new DLC story, titled From the Ashes, was released today, the same day as the third film of the series.

The game might be the best thing to ever happen to the Avatar series. Where the movies have their own stories to tell (family, love, that kinda thing), the game plays very differently with your own custom Na'vi.

It is a righteous ecoterrorism simulator wrapped in the most gorgeous botanical garden I've ever seen. Your gargantuan blue treehugger runs around a world where all the very pretty plants want to kill you. Your job is to impale puny human colonizers with your log-sized spears. By wiping out the bad guys and demolishing their camps that gush pollution into the air and water, you can allow the world's foliage to grow back in its place. (Do not feel bad for the humans. They are sad, angry creatures, and I will kill thousands of them if it makes the pretty forest look even a little prettier.) Then spend all the downtime you want just hanging out in Pandora's verdant paradise, bouncing across neon lily pads and running through spiral plants that go THOOOMP and shrink into the ground when you touch them.

People have written off the game as a re-skinned Far Cry, another very popular Ubisoft title, but that misses the sheer amount of Avatar details that have been pumped into Frontiers. Jennifer Bartram, Massive's senior narrative coordinator and the game's “lore keeper,” is responsible for maintaining consistency between the films and the game, working closely with Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment.

“They call this series not science fiction, but science fact,” Bartram says. “Everything needs to be researched and correct for the world. It really needs to have a science background, a technological background. We need to show on paper, how does this actually work? What's the small leap or change in evolution or biology that our brain could understand that this is actually possible on a moon somewhere else in the universe?”

Sure, the same criticisms commonly applied to the Avatar movie could also be leveled at its spinoff videogame. The game is gorgeously splendid to look at, but the plot is as dense as a floating rock and the characters slip from your brain almost immediately after you meet them. It is a thrilling, action packed adventure, but maybe a bit too bloated for its own good.

But Avatar has always been more about the lush world in which the story takes place than the story itself. When you're controlling your own experience through that world, taking all the time you like to explore, hunt, or just stare at the glowing plants, it becomes clear that Frontiers is the superior Avatar experience.

“We try to make sure that everyone gets to tell their own story,” says Amandine Lauer, the lead game designer of Frontiers of Pandora. “Lightstorm has their story and we have our story. We want to make sure that everybody has the room to share the same DNA in the same world.”

Seth Wright, who goes by Mako, is the director of operations at Kelutral, an Avatar fanclub that has grown to around 12,300 members. He has watched the first Avatar movie in theaters eight times and learned the fictional language spoken by the Na'vi enough to be fluent. (There's an online Na'vi dictionary for the rest of us.) Initially, Mako and the community were skeptical about an Avatar game. But after playing through the base story and the DLC expansions, Mako says the game has become a staple of the fandom.

“Avatar as a franchise is really well suited to interactive experiences,” Mako says. “When you take the world of Pandora, the beautiful technical, immersive detail, and put it into a video game, I think that you are fulfilling one of the strongest points the franchise has to offer.”

Mako calls Avatar the ultimate escapist fantasy: It presents a gorgeous, alien world, grounded in a believable, but fantastical, peaceful culture. He also lauds how director James Cameron has bristled at using AI in favor of human-created technical artistry.

“It is just so far removed from our actual reality,” Mako says. “It does inspire those feelings of longing. Like, what are we doing? And how can we be doing what we're doing differently?”

Not to be a real kalweyaveng about it, but Frontiers of Pandora feels like just the right amount of Avatar. Like unobtanium, the sought-after resource that drives the greedy humans in the first film, Avatar's narrative fuel seems to be a finite resource. While Cameron has plans for two (2) whole more Avatar movies, he is also looking to the reception of Fire and Ash to decide whether to produce more films.

I have not yet seen the third Avatar movie. Maybe it will be excellent. Maybe it will be sngel. (That's the Na'vi word for garbage.) I'll find out when I watch it on Christmas Day in 4DX with those moving seats that occasionally spray water at you. Maybe three-and-a-half hours of trying to get maximum immersion into the land of Pandora will be enough to satiate my Avatar fix.

But I think not. And in that case, Frontiers of Pandora will be there, and available to explore long after. To that, I say: I see you.

Update, December 19 at 11 am: After this story published, Mako reached out to correct some improper Na'vi language usage. The proper form of the word Na'vi does not use a capital V. Reykunyu, the Na'vi language tool linked to in the story, is better described as a dictionary, as Na'vi cannot be easily translated to English.

There's more to watch than ever before, but perhaps you still find yourself idly flicking through the “What's New” carousel on Netflix and not seeing anything that really grabs you … so then you do the same for Prime Video and Disney+ too.

The reality is that there's so much on each one of these streaming services that we can never hope to get through the whole lot. The fix is to be a little more targeted in curating your viewing queue. By spending more time finding the stuff you actually like, you can spend less time cycling through the thumbnails.

There are apps and sites that can help here, cataloging everything that's currently available on your streaming platforms of choice. There are a number to pick from, but these are four of the best options.

JustWatch aims to provide a comprehensive listings service for movies, shows, and sports, and you can find it on the web, on Android, and on iOS. You don't have to pay or even register an account to use the basic search function, but if you do sign up you can start curating your own watchlists. Paying $2.49 a month, meanwhile, removes the ads from the JustWatch apps, and gives you access to more lists and more filters.

There are two ways to use JustWatch: You can look for something specific that you want to watch, or you can browse around and see what's available, platform by platform. If you're taking the former approach, on the web you can simply type the name of a movie or show into the search box at the top of the screen.

When you get a match, you'll be shown all your viewing options. These are split by streaming platform but also by how much you'll have to pay (if anything), and whether you can watch them as part of a subscription (like Netflix) or whether you need to buy or rent the title.

Alternatively, just click around JustWatch to see what's good. Select a specific streaming platform, for example, and you can see what's new or popular on that service. You can even combine filters to cover all the services you're signed up for. Click through on any title and you get a host of information about it, as well as options to add it to your JustWatch lists.

Reelgood is similar to JustWatch in a lot of ways, with up-to-date listings for all the big streaming services, and various options for creating your own custom lists of content. It's all free, with no subscription tier, and you don't even need to register an account to start searching for titles. You can find Reelgood on the web, on Android, and iOS.

If there's something specific you're looking for, you can use the search box at the top of the web interface. When you find a match, you'll see key information about the movie or show—such as the running time, year of release, or number of episodes—as well as links to streaming services where you can watch it in your part of the world.

As with JustWatch, you get a full range of viewing options: Places where the title can be streamed as part of an existing subscription, as well as platforms where you can pay to rent or buy the movie. In a lot of cases you can click through and start watching right away in your web browser, if you're signed up to the right service.

There are lots of other browsing options available too, if you're not so certain what you want to watch. You can see what's new and what's popular on each streaming platform, filter the results based on user reviews, release year, and genre, and put together your own curated lists of films and shows you want to watch.

Besides the general streaming searching sites we've already mentioned, you'll come across listings services dedicated to specific platforms, and there's no bigger platform than Netflix. New on Netflix is not an official, Netflix-run site, but it offers a comprehensive catalog of everything arriving on and leaving the platform.

This isn't available for your mobile device, it's just the website, though you can sign up to get personalized email updates for the movies and shows you're interested in: You'll be pinged whenever something you want to watch either turns up on Netflix or is about to be removed (so you've got chance to catch it).

Getting around the website is straightforward. The quick menu links at the top will lead you straight to everything that's new on Netflix in your region, titles that are coming soon on the platform, and to the full Netflix catalog—if you want to, you can see absolutely everything on Netflix in alphabetical order, though you'll probably want to use one of the genre filter options.

As soon as you load up the site, you get the newest titles shown on screen, and you can click through to everything that's been added in the current month and during the last month. Every listing comes with information such as release date, cast, running time, and ratings, and you can of course click through to watch the film or movie on Netflix.

Besides the services we've already mentioned, Google is better than you might think at helping you find what you watch and where (if you scroll past all the AI-generated text, that is). The search engine is smart enough to realize when you're looking for a movie or show and will adapt accordingly.

Search for a title and you should see a number of different widgets appear, showing an overview of the film, the cast, its release date, and the average online ratings that it's been given (which you may or may not want to take any heed of). Look for a Where to watch widget up in the top right corner—click on this and you should see viewing options for the movie or show in your country, with direct links to start streaming.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Americans Are Increasingly Convinced That Aliens Have Visited Earth","https://www.wired.com/story/americans-are-increasingly-convinced-that-aliens-have-visited-earth/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Americans are becoming more open to the idea that aliens have visited Earth, according to a series of polls that show belief in alien visitation has been steadily on the rise since 2012.

Almost half—47 percent—of Americans say they think aliens have definitely or probably visited Earth at some point in time, according to a new poll from YouGov conducted in November 2025 that involved 1,114 adult participants. That percentage is up from roughly a third (36 percent) of Americans polled in 2012 by Kelton Research, with the exact same sample size. Gallup published polls on this question in 2019 and 2021 that likewise show an upward trend.

Moreover, people seem to be getting off the fence on this issue, one way or the other. Just 16 percent of Americans said they were unsure if aliens had visited Earth in the new poll, down from 48 percent who were unsure in 2012. Meanwhile, even as belief in alien visitation has risen, so has doubt: The new poll shows that 37 percent of Americans said Earth likely hasn't been visited by aliens, more than double the 17 percent logged in 2012.

It's impossible to know exactly why Americans have become more receptive to alien visitation from these polls alone; they only include raw statistics, and lack granular details about the specific motivations for the participants' responses.

“It's important to note that this is a poll about belief,” says Susan Lepselter, an author and associate professor of anthropology and American Studies at Indiana University who has written extensively on alien beliefs and UFO experiences. “It's not a poll about experience, contact, feelings—nothing like that.”

“We don't know what their engagement is; we don't know if their belief has been life-changing,” she adds. “We just know one thing, which is that the statistics have moved from one set of beliefs to another.”

Of course, it's still possible—and let's be real, fun—to speculate on the drivers of the trend. One obvious culprit is a new posture from institutional news sources, such as the US government and legacy media, which have finally started taking unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) seriously.

This shift began with the release of mysterious Pentagon UAP videos by The New York Times in 2017, and has since been accelerated by spate of Congressional hearings, and a NASA independent study on UAP. The newly released documentary The Age of Disclosure, which features claims by former military officials that the US government has covered up evidence of aliens visiting Earth, has supercharged the legitimacy to this once marginalized topic.

“The American public's getting, on the one hand, reputable people from the government talking about UFOs in The Age of Disclosure,” says Diana Walsh Pasulka, an author and professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina Wilmington who is an expert on alien-related beliefs and subcultures.

On the other hand, Pasulka notes, pop culture is completely overrun by aliens. In 2025 alone, aliens were central to superhero blockbusters (Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps), children's movies (Lilo & Stitch and Elio), and even the arthouse film Bugonia. The Star Trek, Alien, and Predator franchises all released new products this year. To top it off, Steven Spielberg will return to his cinematic obsession with aliens in his much-anticipated film Disclosure Day , due out in 2026.

Pasulka points to research by neuroscientist Jeffrey Zacks that shows these popular fictional representations have an immense impact on our imaginations and worldviews. This proliferation of alien fiction, combined with the normalization of aliens in real-life public forums, are like a “one-two punch,” Pasulka says.

“Science fiction plays a huge role in how we think of aliens and extraterrestrial life,” she notes. “With what the government is beginning to say, you have the reality factor. These two things that are happening at this very same time. That's really going to impact what Americans are going to believe.”

As recently as the aughts, the idea that aliens might be visiting Earth, or that they had in the past, was coded as fringe, or even actively stigmatized. Jim Harold, host of The Paranormal Podcast and Jim Harold's Campfire, long-running shows that often discuss the possibility of alien visitation, calls this phenomenon “kookification.”

“If you believe in the idea that something is visiting us, unfortunately, people would say you were a kook,” he says. “I still think some of that perseveres. I actually think there are people out there who are trying to put it back in that bucket. I call it the re-kookification of the topic.”

Harold adds that much of his audience feels vindicated by the flood of admissions from the US government, and the interest from traditional media in recent years. “For people like me, who believe that something's been going on for a long time, it was kind of like, ‘See, I told you,'” he says. “There are some things in our skies we can't explain.”

Harold also notes that interest in aliens—and specifically the belief that they have visited Earth—is a rare issue that enjoys some bipartisan agreement in the United States. This insight is backed up by the new poll, which found that 51 percent of Democrats believe aliens have visited Earth, compared with 49 percent of Independents and 42 percent of Republicans. Elected representatives of both parties have taken an open interest in aliens and UAP, including Jared Moskovitz, the Florida Democrat, and Tim Burchett, the Tennessee Republican.

Likewise, social media has played an undeniable role in the rise of the belief in alien visitation. An ever-evolving pantheon of online platforms has allowed people to make unprecedented connections and build vast communities with like-minded thinkers.

“Belief isn't this singular thing that resides in us individually,” notes Lepselter. “Belief is social and it emerges between people. It's a whole atmosphere that connects with other contexts that we find ourselves in.”

Subcultures centered on a host of alien theories have flourished, as influencers, podcasters, and all manner of other content creators share hunches and experiences. Harold speaks to experts on many of these sub-theories, which touch on inter-dimensional beings, paranormal ghostly encounters, and aliens that might emerge from inside Earth or its oceans.

“People who are interested in this subject, particularly people who have been interested for some time, are broadening their possible explanations,” he says.

Of course, while social media has inspired new connections, it can also trap people in conversational silos. Harold recommends that all media consumers be wary of their sources—whether it's a legacy cable network or his own podcasts.

“It's a double-edged sword,” he says. “On one hand, I think it's fantastic that people have places where they can discuss these things with like-minded people who will be open to discussing it. Sometimes it's just fun to talk about. Let's face it: Everything doesn't have to be a scientific study.”

But, he added, “the consumer needs to be intelligent and try to separate the wheat from the chaff. I say: Keep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out.”

While it's clear that Americans are increasingly entertaining the possibility of alien visitation, Lepselter isn't sure that the recent polling is a sign of a major sea change.

“I'm not seeing some gigantic apocalyptic movement towards a life-altering belief system,” she says. “You can't tell that from the poll. It just seems that this is entering the realm of the thinkable and the sayable.”

Pasulka, meanwhile, predicts that the percentage of Americans who believe in alien visitation will continue to rise for the foreseeable future.

“There's no stopping this,” she concludes. “This is a new way of understanding reality.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Chrome Extension Turns LinkedIn Posts About AI Into Facts About Allen Iverson","https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-extension-linkedin-allen-iverson/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Give yourself a nice gift this holiday season. Download a free Chrome extension that replaces those incessant LinkedIn posts about artificial intelligence with facts about a very different kind of AI: Allen Iverson. Yes, the answer to your generative AI woes is “The Answer,” the crossover king, the four-time NBA scoring champ.

One of the defining traits of LinkedIn has always been unhinged posts from power users—the r/LinkedInLunatics subreddit exists for a reason—but the obsessive tenor of LinkedIn posting has become, somehow, more unbearable over the past few years as the generative AI hype cycle has grown. More and more self-proclaimed AI-first experts have been dominating my algorithmic feed with their unsolicited advice.

For my sanity, and for anyone else who needs to take a break from the barrage of posts about AI, it's time to get the AI2AI extension.

Johnross Post, a creative director in advertising, and Aurora Johnson, an information security researcher, are the two developers behind this Chrome extension. It's their first project together. The duo was inspired by feeling professionally pressured to stay active on LinkedIn, while simultaneously being exhausted by many posters' obsession with generative AI.

“As a freelancer, a lot of my ability to get jobs is based on being on LinkedIn and being engaged,” says Post.

If they were going to stay on the platform, they needed to make it bearable, and spinning up a Chrome extension felt like an easy way to class up the joint. “You can quickly make something that allows you to take back control of your feed and take back control of your experience of the internet,” says Johnson.

With the AI2AI browser extension activated, I was finally brave enough to reopen my LinkedIn feed after avoiding the platform for most of 2025. Thank god I waited. The extension immediately spared me from having to read about generative AI. The first post I encountered in my feed, something about an AI event, was replaced with a colorful card displaying a fact about Iverson: He made the All-NBA First Team a total of three times.

The next two posts in my feed were also zapped and replaced with Iverson deets. As I scrolled for 20 or 30 minutes, instead of encountering boring posts about AI, I relished in the Iverson lore like: “At 6 feet tall, Allen Iverson was one of the shortest players to win the NBA MVP.”

Surprisingly enough, this is not the first Chrome extension to replace generative AI with Allen Iverson.

Earlier in 2025, another developer dropped an extension that switches every mention of AI on LinkedIn with the words “Allen Iverson,” as if that's obviously what the LinkedInfluencer meant when they typed the initialism. Still, the extension created by Post and Johnson takes it even further, with factoid cards that overlay on top of the entire post about AI. These cards can be closed so you can see who the offending posters are in your timeline and react in accordance.

I'd much rather learn random tidbits about an iconic basketball player, than whatever tips about usage-maxxing generative AI in some enterprise workflow. I mean, did you know that Iverson's hometown in Virginia named a street after him? I do now, thanks to this browser extension. And that's neat.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","From Queer-Baiting to Neurodivergence: ‘Heated Rivalry' Author Tackles Fan Theories and Controversy","https://www.wired.com/story/heated-rivalry-author-rachel-reid-interview/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Rachel Reid didn't intend for anyone to write a dissertation about her horny little gay hockey series.

Then again, the Nova Scotia author behind the Game Changers series could never have anticipated the level of fanfare that's accompanied the television adaptation of her books: Heated Rivalry.

The show, commissioned by Canada's Crave and distributed by HBO Max in the US, debuted in late November and quickly became a massive hit. It's the number one Crave original series of all time, and it also climbed to number 1 on HBO Max. A second season has already been greenlit.

If you're not watching it yet, you know someone who is. (Full disclosure: I threw a Heated Rivalry–themed holiday party last week, which just meant playing it on mute in my apartment for the vibes.) From Reddit to BookTok, the show and its source material have also sparked a lot of discourse, ranging from speculation about lead character Shane's neurodivergence, commentaries about race in hockey, and accusations that Reid favors mischievous Russian Ilya over Shane.

“I didn't expect this book to be analyzed like The Great Gatsby when I wrote it. It's really just a hockey romance,” Reid, now a New York Times bestselling author, tells me over Zoom, laughing. Still, she's flattered at the time people have spent theorizing. “I'm impressed with some of the things that people have really dug into. I feel like some of them make me sound a lot smarter than I am.”

The show also sparked criticism from I Love LA star Jordan Firstman, who told Vulture that the intimacy depicted on the show is “not how gay people fuck.” He went on to say that lead actors Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie should out themselves if they are gay. The actors, who Williams described as “best friends,” have been posting flirty videos with each other, and even have matching “sex sells” tattoos, but neither has disclosed his sexual orientation. “A gay guy would say it,” Firstman told Vulture. “I don't respect you because you care too much about your career and what's going to happen if people think you're gay.”

The comments prompted fellow Heated Rivalry actor François Arnaud to clap back on Instagram, commenting “Should the sex that closeted hockey players have look like the sex that sceney LA gay guys have?” (Firstman has since apologized and the spat seems to have blown over.)

Here's what Reid had to say about all the discourse surrounding everyone's favorite hockey smut and why so many women are obsessed with the genre.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

MANISHA KRISHNAN: As a fellow Canadian, hockey is just in the air that we breathe. Is it a sport that you found inherently sexy or horny?

RACHEL REID: No, I wouldn't say so. I don't think I ever really felt that way about it. I think, for me, I'm using these books to work out some thoughts about men and masculinity. It's not really that I'm hot for hockey players. I'm just using hockey because I know a lot about hockey. So that's a good backdrop for my story, but it's also a good backdrop for my story because of all the toxic masculinity there.

How did you end up writing hockey smut?

I just had this idea about what it might be like to be a closeted NHL player, and then to come out as the first openly gay NHL player. So it was just like something that had been on my mind for a while. And I thought about it as writing it as a romance with a happy ending. And, yeah, I guess I just enjoyed writing the sexy scenes too, so they got in there.

I mean, the hockey romance genre has a big following on BookTok. Why do you think that is?

When my first book came out, publishers were starting to look for hockey romance actively. But now it's a really, really huge subgenre of romance. I don't know the reasons, but I do think a big part of it is that a lot of people don't really know much about hockey, so it's not something that they're going to nitpick the details of. It doesn't really matter to them how realistic it is. But it's also an exciting, dangerous sport with a really weird set of skills that you have to learn. So it's just different. I think if you're not somebody who grew up in hockey culture, it's almost a sci-fi thing.

One of the Reddit posts referenced how you had mentioned that Ilya has grief and trauma and Shane does not. And some of the commenters were like, “How could Shane not have trauma as an Asian man in a very white-dominated sport, or being a closeted man?” People were saying that that is indicative of your blind spots as an author. I'm curious what you make of that criticism?

I totally welcome that criticism. I don't think Heated Rivalry is a, you know, excellent representation of an Asian-Canadian person. But for me, that specific note that they're referring to was from my own personal notes on the characters. The trauma Ilya carries is very specific around the death of his mother. And Shane is a character who's always been very loved and supported and a little bit sheltered by his parents. Ilya has not had that, his father was really awful, and his mother died very young when he was young. And so he carries a lot of trauma that he doesn't talk about and hasn't processed and hasn't dealt with in a healthy way, whereas Shane hasn't had that sort of trauma.

Do you favor Ilya as a character? This is like another comment that I've seen quite a bit of.

I have too. Shane is probably my—I mean, I don't want to pick favorites, but Shane, to me, has the hero arc of the series. If you take their two books, Shane, I think, has the hero's arc, and he's my favorite character to write, especially from his point of view. So no, I don't prefer one over the other. They're very different characters. I think they're fun to write for different reasons, and there are different reasons to like them, and there are different reasons why they're sometimes very frustrating characters.

I want to talk about Shane being neurodivergent. That was not expressed in the books, correct? But you have since said that he is. How did that come about? Is that something that you had already been thinking about? Because that's definitely something a lot of the fans have commented on.

So that's something that I think is expressed in the book. It's just not explicitly stated, because I don't think the character of Shane would be aware of it himself, or it's not something that he would be looking into. In Heated Rivalry, he's very young, and he's a superstar, and he's surrounded by hockey players. And I just don't think it's something that he's thinking about.

I think it's plausible Shane might go the rest of his life without ever being diagnosed or even really thinking seriously about it. But to me, as the person who created him, that was definitely a part of his character, and it's something that, as I continued writing him, became clearer as I myself learned more about autism.

There are a bunch of references to Shane being a boring Canadian and being teased for that. Do you think he is actually boring, or is that more just playing off a stereotype about us?

I don't think he's as boring as the characters around him like to tease him for being, because I think he's quite funny. I don't know, he's a hockey superstar, so he's not that boring. I think he's just focused. He's not like a party guy. He's not flashy, he's not spending his money on sports cars and cool clothes. Ultimately, he's a hockey star who's best friends with a movie star and is dating another hockey star. That's not boring. None of that's boring.

Let's talk about Jordan Firstman's comments that what the show depicts isn't how gay people have sex. I'm curious what you made of that and what you make of the conversation that's ensued around who gets to tell stories about queer people.

I'm not super familiar with what he said. I didn't really look into it too much. But I've been hearing the conversation around it for years. I knew it would be amplified by this show.

I feel personally, that as long as you're willing to be sensitive and thoughtful about what you're writing, and most importantly, are willing to listen to feedback from the community that you're trying to represent, then you can write what you want to write. But you have to be careful and sensitive. And certainly, if you're getting criticism or feedback from the community that you're representing, you should listen to it and take notes.

Show creator Jacob Tierney said, with respect to the actors, that he didn't think that there was any reason to get into their sexual orientations. Have you fielded similar criticisms?

I know, generally women who write romances about two or more men get criticized. I haven't heard a lot of it directed at me specifically, but I agree with Jacob about the actors, and I extend that to myself and anyone else involved with the show or these books. I think it's OK to keep your personal life personal.

When I was in my early twenties, I wrote some Smallville fanfic. I wouldn't say I was active in the fandom, but I had a LiveJournal and was doing that. I shouldn't even say that. People would dig it up somehow, but it's long gone, guys, and it's terrible. Don't do it.

I know that season 2 of the show has been announced. Do you have plans to write another book with these characters?

I've always said no, but, you know, I think like stories maybe. I mean, I'm always thinking about these guys.

Are you working on any books right now?

I am. I'm not allowed to talk about it, because it's going to be announced in January.

Being Canadian and seeing this show blow up—it's all over every American publication—what's that aspect of it been like for you?

It's been really surreal and amazing. I still can't really believe how much people have embraced the show. I feel like it's a really unlikely hit, but I think it's a nice thing to be a hit right now. It's really joyful, and I know that some of the episodes are sad, but it is ultimately a joyful show. It's sweet, it's romantic, it's nice, and I think it's a nice thing to have right now.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Kurt Schlosser on Dec 19, 2025 at 8:12 amDecember 19, 2025 at 9:54 am

In the city that's home to Microsoft, Redmond Police Chief Darrell Lowe isn't just watching technological innovation from the sidelines — he's integrating it into his department's daily operations.

Lowe, a 30-year law enforcement veteran, views Redmond as the ideal staging ground for a new era of policing that capitalizes on advancements ranging from drones as first responders to artificial intelligence. When he became chief six years ago, his vision was to transform the department into a premier agency; technology has been a cornerstone of that mission.

“The public safety tech space is blowing up right now with a lot of interest and investment and VC money,” Lowe told GeekWire. “Being in Microsoft's backyard doesn't hurt, but it's not like Microsoft is cutting checks for the Redmond Police Department.”

Lowe, who also runs his own public safety tech consultancy, primarily seeks tools that increase staff efficiency and simplify officer tasks. An AI-powered investigative platform from San Francisco-based Longeye fits that bill. Longeye ingests digital information such as surveillance video, phone records, crime scene photos and interviews to analyze data at speeds that exceed human review.

Lowe recently told KING 5 how the tool helped investigators confirm key evidence in a cold case by combing through 60 hours of jail phone calls in minutes.

However, he maintains that such tools are part of the equation rather than the total solution.

“It's really important for law enforcement agencies and officers not to get lazy and think AI is the answer, because you still have to corroborate whatever that is,” Lowe said.

While AI is a newer addition to Lowe's tech toolbox, the department has a history of technical adoption. Previous deployments included adhesive GPS trackers fired at cars to catch fleeing suspects and handheld narcotics analyzers that can scan through transparent packaging and identify more than 530 controlled substances, such as fentanyl, methamphetamine, and heroin.

But drones — specifically drones as first responders — are Lowe's pride and joy. He equates their impact on modern policing to the era when handheld radios replaced police call boxes.

With a current staff of approximately 85 officers, Lowe employs two full-time drone pilots operating from a flight control center equipped with autonomous drones from Seattle-based Brinc and Skydio. Integrated directly into the department's dispatch system, the drones can launch and arrive on-scene in under two minutes.

Lowe recalls a recent call regarding an individual experiencing a mental health crisis on a street corner. The person was screaming at the sky and waving his arms.

“Typical police response is you send an officer on the ground to make contact. We've seen those calls escalate and go wrong,” Lowe said.

Instead, a drone arrived in 30 seconds. From 250 feet, a pilot observed the individual, determined no crime was occurring and no one was in danger, and watched as the person eventually walked away.

“We canceled the ground unit response. There was no need for police contact,” Lowe said.

To address privacy concerns, Lowe implemented a “horizon-first” policy: drone cameras are pointed at the sky during transit and only tilt down once they reach the specific GPS coordinates of a call.

While drones have been a “game changer,” other technologies have hit speed bumps. The Redmond City Council recently paused the department's license plate reader program following regional concerns about data sharing and whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could access the data.

Redmond PD started deploying Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) this summer to alert officers and analysts when a vehicle linked to a crime, missing person, stolen vehicle, or other critical incident is detected.

Lowe pushed back on what he calls “hysteria” surrounding the technology, arguing that cameras have a proven, valuable place in law enforcement.

“There is no expectation of privacy in a public place on a tax-funded road,” Lowe said, noting that Washington's tolling cameras often capture more personal data (including driver faces) for longer periods than his ALPR systems. “The privacy concerns, while I understand they are legitimate, they also have to be balanced against what the law says.”

Because the City of Redmond signed a contract to launch the ALPR technology, Lowe noted that the council must now consider any legal ramifications of a potential breach of contract.

Reflecting on a long career that began in an innovative department in Santa Monica, Calif., under then-Chief Jim Butts, Lowe feels fortunate to have technology embedded in his “cop DNA.”

Now he laughs at how much the job description has evolved.

“When we all got into this, we wanted to go out there and catch bad guys … play cops and robbers and that whole thing,” he said. “I never imagined that I'd be negotiating multi-million-dollar, multi-year [tech] contracts as a cop.”

But even with modern advances, Lowe insists technology will never replace an officer's empathy.

“We can never take the human out of the loop,” he said. “When people contact the police, it's often not on their best day. It's to have another human there to empathize and sympathize. It's the reason why most of us got into this profession — to help others.”

After shifting its gaming strategy to focus more on games played on the TV, Netflix announced it's acquiring Ready Player Me, an avatar-creation platform based in Estonia. The streamer said Friday it plans to use the startup's development tools and infrastructure to build avatars that will allow Netflix subscribers to carry their personas and fandom across different games.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Ready Player Me had raised $72 million in venture backing from investors, including a16z, Endeavor, Konvoy Ventures, Plural, and various angels, including the co-founders of companies like Roblox, Twitch, and King Games.

Netflix told TechCrunch the startup's team of around 20 people will be joining the company, including the founders Rainer Selvet, Haver Järveoja, Kaspar Tiri, and Timmu Tõke. It doesn't have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch. Nor does it detail which games or types of games will be first to get avatars.

Following the acquisition, Ready Player Me will be winding down its services on January 31, 2026, including its online avatar creation tool, PlayerZero.

“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Tõke said in a statement. “We've been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I'm now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming.”

Netflix's deal represents the company's changing approach to games.

When it moved into the market four years ago, the company offered mobile games to its subscribers, who would log in using their Netflix accounts. At the time, Netflix explained that it saw gaming as another new category, similar to its other expansions into original films, animation, and unscripted TV.

Netflix acquired numerous gaming studios and titles, and licensed others, under the leadership of Mike Verdu, the company's VP of games who formerly worked at EA and Kabam. That strategy saw mixed results. While some of its larger, more well-known titles may have attracted some customers, like GTA: San Andreas, others were virtually unknown. (The company recently said the GTA game was on its way out, too, alongside dozens of other titles.)

Netflix also shut down many of its studio acquisitions or returned them to their founders.

To some extent, these changes could have been anticipated. Going into this, Netflix knew that moving into gaming would be an experiment, and it would have to adapt as it discovered what worked and what didn't.

As part of its strategy shift, Netflix last year brought in a new executive, Alain Tascan, formerly of Epic Games, as its president of games. Verdu, who was then VP of generative AI for games, left seven months later.

Under Tascan, Netflix has expanded its gaming lineup for TV and begun focusing on party games, kids' games, narrative games, and more mainstream titles.

Recently, the streamer released a slate of party games for TVs and mobile, including Netflix Puzzled, PAW Patrol Academy, plus WWE 2K25, Red Dead Redemption, and Best Guess, a live party game with hosts Hunter March and Howie Mandel, and a $1 million jackpot. This week, it also announced a new FIFA title would be coming to TVs in time for the World Cup in 2026.

At TechCrunch Disrupt's event this October, Netflix CTO Elizabeth Stone said the company was introducing interactive real-time voting for live content, which it was already testing with a live cooking show and would soon bring to its reboot of the talent show “Star Search.”

In this way, Netflix is now more closely following how the TV industry embraced mobile, interactive experiences by allowing audience voting for “American Idol” contestants or favorite couples on reality shows like “Love Island.” 

Whether Netflix can convince its audience to think of its brand — traditionally associated with passive, lean-back viewing — as something to turn to for interactive activities like gaming, still remains to be seen.

OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources.

The company is aiming to raise the funding by the end of the calendar first quarter next year, and it may ask sovereign wealth funds to invest in the round, the WSJ reported. The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.

The funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company's compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.

And, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.

Meanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn't help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.

OpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant's new AI computing chips.

If the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI's coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction.

OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.

Krafton, the South Korean gaming company behind hit titles such as PUBG and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), is launching a growth investment fund focused on India, stepping up its push into the world's largest internet user base.

Called the Unicorn Growth Fund, the investment vehicle is a collaboration between Krafton and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver and investor Mirae Asset. It aims to deploy up to ₹60 billion (around $669.3 million) over four years, Krafton confirmed to TechCrunch.

The fund, which will be managed by Mirae Asset Venture India, is expected to be established in January and begin operations with an initial size of more than ₹30 billion (about $334.6 million). Krafton will contribute ₹12.3 billion (approximately $137.2 million) at the first close, the company said.

Naver's capital commitment is expected to be “broadly comparable” to Krafton's $137 million investment, a Krafton spokesperson told TechCrunch. The fund will not operate with rigid country-allocation thresholds, and typical investment sizes are expected to range between $10 million and $30 million, the spokesperson said.

Krafton said investments through the new fund would primarily be treated as financial positions rather than strategic bets, though the level of engagement with portfolio companies could vary depending on the opportunity and long-term potential of each business.

To date, Krafton has invested more than $200 million in India, backing companies in the gaming, content, and fintech spaces. Recent investments include fintech Cashfree and venture fund IMM Investment, alongside earlier bets on gaming and content platforms such as Nodwin Gaming, Loco, Pratilipi, and Kuku FM. The company also launched a gaming incubator in India in 2023 and acquired a controlling stake in Indian gaming studio Nautilus Mobile for $14 million earlier this year.

Krafton's expansion in India has not been without setbacks. New Delhi banned BGMI, the company's flagship local title, in 2022, before allowing it to return in 2023 following a three-month trial approval. Krafton subsequently announced a $150 million investment commitment in the country.

BGMI, which has surpassed 240 million downloads, launched in 2021 as a revamped, localized version of PUBG Mobile, another popular title that was banned by the Indian government in mid-2020 over national security concerns. Since then, Krafton has made a series of operational changes in the country — including cutting ties with Tencent as its publisher and migrating its India servers to Microsoft's Azure cloud — to address regulatory concerns.

With the new fund, Krafton is looking to extend its India strategy beyond gaming, channeling capital into a wider set of technology startups as it seeks to build a long-term presence in one of Asia's fastest-growing digital markets.

TikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.

The new partnership is described as a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture” in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch. 

That arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”

That new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. 

The closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.

Much of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.

The U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok's U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.

People who want and choose to view your words uncharitably will do so regardless of what you say. For example, the use of “we” could also be seen as narcissistic or imperial.

I was pretty worried about Cursor's business until they launched their Composer 1 model, which is fine-tuned to work amazingly well in their IDE. It's significantly faster than using any other model, and it's clearly fine-tuned for the type of work people use Cursor for. They are also clearly charging a premium for it and making a healthy margin on it, but for how fast + good it's totally worth it.Composer 1 + now eventually creating an AI native version of GitHub with Graphite, that's a serious business, with a much clearer picture to me how Cursor gets to serious profitability vs the AI labs.

The idea is to hook into Bitbucket PR webhooks so that whenever a PR is raised on any repo, Jenkins spins up an isolated job that acts as an automated code reviewer. That job would pull the base branch and the feature branch, compute the diff, and use that as input for an AI-based review step. The prompt would ask the reviewer to behave like a senior engineer or architect, follow common industry review standards, and return structured feedback - explicitly separating must-have issues from nice-to-have improvements.The output would be generated as markdown and posted back to the PR, either as a comment or some attached artifact, so it's visible alongside human review. The intent isn't to replace human reviewers, but to catch obvious issues early and reduce review load.What I'm unsure about is whether diff-only context is actually sufficient for meaningful reviews, or if this becomes misleading without deeper repo and architectural awareness. I'm also concerned about failure modes - for example, noisy or overconfident comments, review fatigue, or teams starting to trust automated feedback more than they should.If you've tried something like this with Bitbucket/Jenkins, or think this is fundamentally a bad idea, I'd really like to hear why. I'm especially interested in practical lessons.

Then it can run `git diff` to get the diff, like you mentioned, but also query surrounding context, build stuff, run random stuff like `bazel query` to identify dependency chains, etc.They've put a ton of work into tuning it and it shows, the signal-to-noise ratio is excellent. I can't think of a single time it's left a comment on a PR that wasn't a legitimate issue.

Yes, you definitely need the project's context to have valuable generations. Different teams here have different context and model steering, according to their needs.  
For example, specific aspects of the company's architecture is supplied in the context. While much of the rest (architecture, codebases, internal docs, quarterly goals) are available as RAG.It can become noisy and create more needless review work. Also, only experts in their field find value in the generations. If a junior relies on it blindly, the result is subpar and doesn't work.

My other question is whether stacked PRs are the endpoint of presenting changes or a waypoint to a bigger vision? I can't get past the idea that presenting changes as diffs in filesystem order is suboptimal, rather than as stories of what changed and why. Almost like literate programming.

Programming takes practice.  And if all of your code is generated via LLM, then you're not getting any practice.It's the same as saying using genAI will make you a bad artist.  In the sense that putting hands-to-medium makes you a good artist, that is true.  Unless you take deliberate steps to learn, your skills will attrophe.However, being a good programmer|artist is different from being a successful programmer|artist.  GenAI can help you churn out tons of content, and if you can turn that content into income, you'll be successful.Even before LLMs, successful and capable were orthogonal features for most programmers.  We had people who made millions churning out a crud website over a few months, and others that can build game engines, but are stuck in underpaid contracting roles.

reply

If the demand for this work is high, maybe the individual workers aren't earning $100k per year, but the owner of the company who presumably was/is a weaver might well be earning that much.What the loom has done is made the repeatable mass production of items cheap and convenient. What used to be a very expensive purchase is now available to more people at a significantly cheaper price, so probably the profits of the companies making them are about the same or higher, just on a higher volume.It hasn't entirely removed the market for high end quality weaving, although it probably has reduced the number of people buying high-end bespoke items if they can buy a ""good enough"" item much cheaper.But having said that, I don't think weavers were on the inflation-adjusted equivalent of 100k before the loom either. They may have been skilled artisans, but that doesn't mean the majority were paid multiples above an average wage.The current price bubble for programming salaries is based on the high salaries being worth paying for a company who can leverage that person to produce software that can earn the company significantly more than that salary, coupled with the historic demand for good programmers exceeding supply.I'm sure that even if the bulk of programming jobs disappear because people can produce ""good enough"" software for their purposes using AI, there will always be a requirement for highly skilled specialists to do what AI can't, or from companies that want a higher confidence that the code is correct/maintainable than AI can provide.

But the skills you describe are still skills, reading and researching and doing your own fact finding are still important to practice and be good at.

People who claim ""It's not synthesized, it's just other people's work run through a woodchipper"" aren't precisely right, but they also aren't precisely wrong... And in this space, having the whole ecosystem of programmers who published code looking over my shoulder as I try to solve problems is a huge boon.

They could rename it ""Using AI Generated Code Makes Programming Less Fun, for Me"", that would be more honest.The problem for programmers is (as a group) they tend to dislike the parts of their job that are hardest to replace with AI and love the stuff that is easiest for machines to copy. It turns out meetings, customer support, documentation, tests, and QA are core parts of being a good engineer.

I did, for a very long time. Then I realized that it's just work, and I'd like to spend my life minimizing the amount of that I do and maximizing the things I do want to do. Code gen has completely changed the equation for workaday folks. Maybe that will make us obsolete, and fall out of practice. But I tend to think the best software engineers are the laziest ones who don't try to be clever. Maybe not the best programmers per se, but I know whose codebase I'd rather inherit.

However I agree there's a different category here under the idea of 'craft'. I don't have a good way to express this. It's not that I'm writing these 'if' statements in a particular way, it's how the whole system is structured and I understand every single line and it's an expression of my clarity of the system in code.I believe there a split between these two and both are focusing on different problems. Again I don't want to label, but if I *had to* I would say one side is business focused. Here's the thing though - your end customers don't give a fuck if it's built with AI or crafted by hand.The other side is the craftsmanship, and I don't know how to express this to make sense.I'm looking for a good way to express this - feeling? Reality? Practice?IDK, but I do understand your side of it; However, I don't think many companies will give a shit.If they can go to market in 2 weeks vs 2 month's you know what they'll choose.

However, for those in the first few years of their career, I'm definitely seeing the problem where junior devs are reaching for AI on everything, and aren't developing any skills that would allow them to do anything more than the AI can do or catch any of the mistakes that AI makes. I don't see them on a path that leads them from where they are to where I am.A lot of my generation of developers is moving into management, switching fields, or simply retiring in their 40s. In theory there should be some of us left who can do what AI can't for another 20 years until we reach actual retirement age, but programming isn't a field that retains its older developers well. So this problem is going to catch up with us quickly.Then again, I don't feel like I ever really lived up to any of the programmers I looked up to from the 80s and 90s, and I can't really point to many modern programmers I look up to in the same way. Moxie and Rob Nystrom, maybe? And the field hasn't collapsed, so maybe the next generation will figure out how to make it work.

People care if their software works. They don't care how beautiful the code is.AI can churn out 25 drafts faster than 99% of devs can get their boilerplate setup for the first time.The new skill is fitting all that output into deployable code, which if you are experienced in shipping software is not hard to get the model to do.

What has to happen first is that people need to rebuild their identity before they can accept what is happening and that rebuilding process will take longer then the rate at which AI is outrunning all of us.What is my role in tech if for the past 20 years I was a code ninja but now AI can do better than me?

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China's first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China's still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

The AI doomers feel undeterred

It's a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects' worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they're building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement's biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Quote of the day

""Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.""

—Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren queries the terms of the deal that TikTok has made to allow it to continue operating in the US in a post on Bluesky.

—Rhiannon Williams

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company's avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It's slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn't know me, you'd probably think that's exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it's becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, have signed binding agreements to create a new joint venture that will reportedly be majority-owned by American investors.

The deal, expected to close on Jan. 22, would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a law that would have banned the app on national security grounds unless China-based ByteDance divested its U.S. operations. It also hands some control over content moderation and the recommendation algorithm to one of the richest men in the world.

Numerous media outlets reported that the new venture would be called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, citing a memo from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to employees.

The three new managing investors include Oracle, the tech giant founded by Larry Ellison, who currently serves as the company's executive chairman and chief technology officer. Ellison is an ally of President Donald Trump and the sixth richest person in the world, with a net worth of $233 billion, according to Bloomberg. His son, David Ellison, recently took over Paramount and is looking to buy Warner Bros. Discovery with more than a little help from his father.

The other managing investors include Silver Lake and the Abu Dhabi–based MGX.

Under the terms of the deal, Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX will reportedly each own 15% of the joint venture. Roughly 30% will be owned by affiliates of current ByteDance investors, while ByteDance itself will retain about 20%. The remaining 5% will go to other new investors.

TikTok did not immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

The memo also outlined some potential changes users could expect once the deal closes, including a retraining of the content recommendation algorithm “to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation.”

Oracle will also serve as the venture's “trusted security partner” and will be responsible for auditing and validating that the joint venture complies with agreed-upon national security terms.

U.S. politicians have spent nearly half a decade trying to force ByteDance to relinquish control of TikTok. President Donald Trump first signed an executive order in 2020 demanding that ByteDance sell its U.S. operations.

Congress later passed a law in 2024, eventually signed by President Joe Biden, that would effectively ban the app in the U.S. if ByteDance failed to divest. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January, ruling that a sale of TikTok was necessary to address national security concerns related to its data collection practices and ties to China.

At a forum in May 2024, then-Sen. Mitt Romney linked the overwhelming support for the ban among lawmakers to the perception of pro-Palestinian content on the app.

For his part, Trump delayed enforcement of the ban, giving his allies time to pursue a deal.

Giant monsters and manga are a goated combo that has only gotten stronger as a staple in pop culture. Much of this is thanks in part to series like Kaiju No. 8, which set the bar high with its adult-cast twist, serving as an iconoclast to the well-trodden teenage somethings who've exclusively been allowed to play starring roles in shonen series.

But another series hewing close to its winning formula, deserving just as much praise as its star begins to rise, is Rai Rai Rai, an underappreciated Viz Media manga rich with gag-comedy charm and a deceptively provocative narrative hidden beneath the appeal of its cute girl donning an even cuter kaiju design. 

Rai Rai Rai (which translates to “Lightning Lightning Lightning”), written by Yoshiaki, is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi action comedy series. In 2052, the world is on the upswing after an alien invasion half a century prior. Now, organizations are tasked with cleaning up the remaining alien monsters called varmints.

The series follows our crybaby hero, Sumire Ichigaya, an 18-year-old woman who, after getting abducted by aliens, has the power to transform into a kaiju. At this point, you don't have to squint too hard to think that its premise is pretty much a gender-bent version of Kaiju No. 8, only trading homegrown kaiju for space kaiju. And well, yeah. That's certainly much of its onboarding, but as the series evolves, Rai Rai Rai branches itself out from being a twin series to Kaiju No. 8 in interesting ways worth getting in on the ground floor now before it really takes off or gets cancelled (KNOCKS ON WOOD).

This is not a spoiler for the series' twist, but what Rai Rai Rai does more than be the kind of “Kaiju No.8 manga is over, here's something similar” recommendation that would come readers' way is that, despite feeling like the median of multiple manga's core premises, it still manages to dig its feet in and hold strong as a series worth reading for its own merits. Those inspirations include early Dragon Ball‘s comedic timing, Ranma 1/2 and Kaiju No. 8‘s aesthetics, and a hint of Gunbuster and Chainsaw Man‘s rule of cool to round it out.

For one, Rai Rai Rai harkens back to the softer, rounder character designs of seminal manga series. Sumire's ponytail look is peak Ramna 1/2—a style newer manga like Gokurakugai and Dandadan have wisely folded into their DNA, because creator Rumiko Takahashi is worth mimicking. Yet the series doesn't just bask in charm; it layers an edge that's reminiscent of, of course, Kaiju No. 8, but also Chainsaw Man.

That edge shows most clearly in the militaristic varmint-killing organization Sumire is coerced into joining, Raiden, where operatives are outfitted in sleek plug suits that boost one's combat prowess—always a plus in any sci-fi series. But clumsy Sumire, Rai Rai Rai‘s crybaby hero—born to whimsy, forced to lock in—anchors the story by persevering as its loveable goofball harboring her own tragedy.

Despite Rai Rai Rai‘s deceptively cute veneer, the series digs into heavy themes. Key among them being the physical abuse Sumire suffered at the hands of her mother, her parents' crushing debt, and the exploitative jobs she takes to help them crawl out of it.

She's a Denji-like figure, throwing herself into harm's way for pay to the point that Raiden doesn't have to bother hiding that they're using her as some grand secret. You'd think all of this would coalesce in her kaiju transformation to look like something that crawled out of Q Hayashida's Dai Dark drafts. Instead, we have a cute subversion: Sumire's kaiju form is more like an overstuffed plushy (or a Labubu). Witnessing her struggle to repress a Godzilla-style atomic breath, only to rally as a symbol citizens can embrace rather than fear (peep her Gunbuster pose), feels closer to Superman-levels of hope-maxing than the sharp-edged poster boys of shonen manga usually parade.

More crucially, despite being only roughly 40 chapters deep, Rai Rai Rai strikes a charming balance between gag‑manga comedy and its battle‑shonen‑meets‑horror aesthetic.  In the same way that Magilumiere Co. LTD. riffs on My Hero Academia and Sailor Moon to prove girls can lead these series without looking like Hot Topic knockoffs, Rai Rai Rai pushes the oddly winning combo of a cute girl in a cute kaiju suit fighting for her life as something that doesn't feel derivative but fresh. It's mile‑a‑minute physical comedy that knows what makes kaiju media cool and leans heavily into that, with gnarly battles, unsettling kaiju designs, and a sharp critique of rah-rah militaristic obedience, making its whimsy feel not just charming but subversive and vital.

The manga industry is cutthroat, with countless promising series cancelled before they ever take off.  Especially when women are at their centers, too often their survival depends on word‑of‑mouth to champion them long enough to reach their full potential—as we've seen with titles like Love Bullet.

Hopefully, Rai Rai Rai sparks that same groundswell, because I want to see Yoshiaki keep cooking. It just introduced a Metal Gear Rising-coded muscle grandma as a wild new rival character, and it'd be a shame if this series ended up as another “what could've been” manga.

What if you could bring your ultrawide monitor with you on the go? It's a silly idea, but one that's immediately appealing if you've spent any time within the constrained jail cell walls of your gaming laptop's screen bezels. Lenovo, the one company that would do something so eccentric, is reportedly gearing up to launch a rollin' gaming laptop. Instead of extending north of the laptop, this supposed screen would extend to both the east and west.

The leaks come from Windows Latest, which includes several renders of what seems to be a 16-inch Lenovo Legion Pro 7i but with an OLED screen that can extend horizontally in both directions up to 24 inches. The supposed Legion Rollable would also sport an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and a “maxed-out Intel Core Ultra processor.” This could refer to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, which came in many of the top-end gaming laptops in 2025. However, perhaps it could refer to one of the specific Intel Panther Lake chips built for lightweight laptops.

The 16-inch screen could extend partially to just 21.5 inches or to the full 24 inches. That's with a supposed “tension-based mechanism” and two motors to let it extend from both sides at once. Windows Latest suggests the device is being targeted to esports pros or wannabe hardcore gamers who need to brush up on their skills when on the move. Instead, I can imagine it would appeal to the more sedentary types who don't have the space for a bigger screen. Lenovo's Legion Pro 7i was not an easily transportable laptop, especially since it came packed with a 400W power brick nearly half the size of its folded-up chassis.

Exclusive: Here's your closer look at Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, the company's first rollable gaming laptop that runs Windows 11 with AI features.

Everything we know so far:

– RTX 5090 + maxed-out Intel Core Ultra for top-tier competitive performance– 16-inch PureSight OLED… pic.twitter.com/ns4f5Bk6w0

— Windows Latest (@WindowsLatest) December 18, 2025



Lenovo isn't the kind of company to keep things subtle. At nearly every tech conference, the major PC brand shows up with a few radical designs. Some of those weird and wild concept devices actually become real products, which is how we got the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable. That odd creature is a 14-inch laptop with a bunch of mechanical parts that extend the screen to a vertical 16.7-inch display. Believe it or not, that extra screen space is a boon if you're doing any writing tasks or are just looking to read an internet article without having to scroll past a mountain of ads.

The problem will be price. A Legion Pro 7i already sells for around $3,000 with the higher-end specs that don't include an RTX 5090 GPU. The ThinkBook Rollable sells for $3,300. The “Legion Pro Rollable” will likely be very expensive. Lenovo is expected to show off the new rollable laptop at CES 2026 next month.

Sure, the rolling gaming laptop won't be for everyone. Still, Lenovo has other gaming products it could show off soon. Windows Latest also shared specs on a supposed Legion Go 2, but this time it comes with SteamOS rather than Windows 11. This version of Lenovo's handheld PC would maintain the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Of course it will still have that big, beautiful 8.8-inch OLED display.

Like with the Legion Go S, the version with SteamOS performed far better than the same device chugging along with Windows 11. I expect the same with the Legion Go 2. I dual-booted Lenovo's latest handheld with Bazzite, itself a similar Linux-based operating system to SteamOS, and saw boosts in frame rate in some games between 3 and 5, and in some cases 10 fps. The version without Windows may cost less than the $1,350 Windows 11 version. Still, with RAM prices completely out of control right now, who knows what next year's devices may cost?

I'm curious about the folk with deep-pockets who dare hope to remain budget conscious, even while they're considering a $4,000 laptop like the MSI Raider 18 HX. Will those same consumers balk at spending another $100? How about $500? What about $1,000 or more? What would you pay for peak performance? How much would you spend for perfection? Because the 18-inch gaming laptop certainly has its share of drawbacks—many of the same flaws shared between practically every large gaming laptop released this year.

I started out 2025 by reviewing the MSI Titan 18 HX, a monstrous and monsterously powerful gaming laptop that packed in everything I could ever want in a desktop replacement device. Its more-than $5,000 price tag is what helps you come back down to earth. Due to tariffs, MSI routinely boosted the costs of its gaming behemoth over and over throughout 2025. So now, the Raider 18 HX costs closer to $4,000 (it's $3,740 on Amazon at the time of this writing) for a model whose specs include an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, and a whopping 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Laptops on the whole cost more now than they did in January. It's a bad situation for everybody. It's likely to get worse next year.

MSI Raider 18 HX

When you only care about having a great gaming suite in laptop form, and you don't much care about a lame shell, MSI's Raider 18 HX will more than suffice.

Pros

Cons

There are glaring obvious reasons why the Raider 18 HX is appealing. Hell, my model—the A2XWIG-1009US—sports an 18-inch 4K mini LED display. You don't see that too often, even on this size of laptop (probably because it just makes the whole thing cost more). It's the main reason you go for the Raider 18 HX above something like an Alienware 18 Area-51 or an Asus ROG Strix Scar 18, even though those laptops feel better to use. In that way, the Raider 18 HX feels like a one-trick pony. It's for gamers who want to feel like gamers, never mind whether you're getting the best possible experience for your rmoney.

We don't know what next year's laptop designs may yield, but I'm not expecting anything spectacular. The jump to RTX 50-series GPUs brought us our most powerful gaming laptops yet. Unless AMD makes a Ryzen 7 9850X3D CPU for notebooks, that probably won't change.

Do you need a 4K screen on a laptop when the mini LED isn't going to offer you the best image quality? Will taking up so much space on your desk matter if the keyboard doesn't feel that premium? That's up to each buyer. If all you want is performance, then the Raider 18 HX has your back. And considering what's on the horizon, maybe all high-end gaming laptops will cost $4,000 not long from now.

When I first tipped open the lid of the Raider 18 HX, the first word that came into my head was “plastic.” First time buyers are greeted with black plastic bezels and a black plastic palm rest. Even the small red fan embellishments that scream “gamer” aesthetic are plastic. The internal components, such as the fan grills along the rear shelf, are aluminum, so I'm not inferring the laptop will melt under stress any time soon. Instead, the few trims on the interior panel feel far too Mattel for a $4,000 gaming rig.

See MSI Raider 18 HX at Amazon

The plastic parts don't make this laptop any less weighty at 7.94 pounds. When you factor in the 400W power brick that comes with the laptop, you come to realize quickly that this is not a machine for taking out on the town—at least not if you don't want a back and shoulders workout. The weight should come as expected. Even a 16-inch model like the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i needs a similar-sized 400W doorstop for power. What's less acceptable is the keyboard. The keys feel fine to type on, but they're on the squishy, less impactful side with their shallow travel.

Also, surprisingly for a laptop of this size, the per-key RGB behind the keyboard really isn't as bright as I would want, even in dimly lit environments. You need to change the keyboard lighting through the SteelSeries GG app that comes pre-installed. At least, the Raider 18 HX is free of other bloatware except for MSI Center, which is one of a few ways you can change the laptop's performance settings.

Even if the chassis doesn't feel premium, the port and connectivity selection on offer definitely is. The device comes with three USB-A on the sides plus two Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports. That means the laptop can accept 240W of power delivery through its sides if you don't want to go for the 400W brick (however, you'll still need it for gaming). There's an additional SD card slot, a headphone jack, and an HDMI and Ethernet port on the rear panel. It's the perfect placement of ports, meaning the power goes out the back while the sides are left free for all your dongles and peripherals.

I won't knock anybody for wanting the pixel density of a 4K display, especially at this size of laptop. If you're stacking an RTX 5080 GPU inside a laptop, you damn well should want the highest-end display. But that's not the only thing you should consider about screens, especially for a premium.

The mini LED screen on the Raider 18 HX looks fair in most dimly lit rooms. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deeper than the “dark gray” you may find with other LCD-type displays. That being said, mini LED is the type of screen with a matte layer that doesn't so much as reduce glare as it diffuses it and spreads it across the screen. In a room with a few lights in the background, you may see distortion that could completely mar the viewing experience, depending on your desk placement.

In the right conditions, a Raider 18 HX will be a great small-scale all-in-one entertainment experience. The laptop contains four 2W speakers alongside two 2W woofers made by Dynaudio. What came out of the laptop's audio suite can be both loud and bassy, without any of the unnecessary spine-tingling lows that don't actually impact immersion. The speaker setup is so good I didn't imagine I'd need to reach for anything but the more expensive soundbars to enhance it. You'd need thick thighs if you imagine putting this beast on your laptop to watch Netflix. If you do, it will offer a solid miniature theater so long as you can ignore the fan sounds blasting out the back.

The current memory crunch is making every PC buyer antsy—both for the future of desktops and laptops. RAM is going for such a premium, you're probably wondering how much 64GB of RAM makes a difference compared to many other laptops from this year that only have 32GB. In my tests, the Raider 18 HX does slightly better for base productivity tasks. As for gaming—what you're paying $4,000 for—how much better more RAM gets you depends on the game.

For instance, in Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024 tests, the CPU scored just above that from other laptops like the ROG Strix Scar 18. And yet, in 3DMark tests, the Raider 18 HX underperformed slightly compared to many of the other 16- and 18-inch gaming laptops I reviewed this year—all with very similar specs. An Alienware 16 Area-51 hit about 200 points higher in 3DMark “Speed Way” test and 100 points more in the “Steel Nomad” test. It did even worse compared to a Lenovo Legion Pro 7i. Both those gaming laptops were running with the same RTX 5080 GPU and an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, a step down from the Raider 18 HX's Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX. Compared to MSI's own Titan 18 HX with RTX 5090 GPU, the Raider 18 HX does around 500 points worse in both these 3DMark tests.

I can't stress enough how little differences in synthetic benchmark actually matter for real-world performance. Throughout all my benchmarks testing games like Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and Assassin's Creed Shadows, I could get more than playable frame rates with high settings at 4K, though it necessitated some amount of upscaling in every case. In Cyberpunk 2077, when set to “Ray Tracing Ultra” settings with DLSS on balanced mode, the Raider 18 HX netted me around 49 average fps with a low of 41 fps. That may not be enough for some, so if you drop the ray tracing settings down a smidge, you can equal the fabled 60 fps.

In tests for some other titles, like Black Myth: Wukong, the Raider 18 HX excelled. With the game set to “Cinematic” settings and ray tracing on very high, the laptop benched more than 100 fps. That's with DLSS enabled and set to its default “balanced” setting. Total War: Warhammer III was an excellent experience at 4K, especially at “Ultra” settings, proving I could do 92 fps in battle scenes and just under 90 fps in the campaign map. It's a very CPU-intensive game, so the more RAM and better CPU will help it compared to competing laptops.

There's a lot to like about the in-game performance on the Raider 18 HX. Similarly, this hefty gaming laptop does well in my tests with 3D rendering tasks as well. When rendering our test scene of a BMW on the CPU using Blender, it takes a few seconds less than on similarly sized gaming laptops with a lesser Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX. Rendering the same scene on the GPU takes just a few seconds, of course. The only ever reason to not push the GPU is if you're trying to save what little battery you have.

There is no gaming laptop you want to leave without a plug. That's the case for 14-inch models all the way up through clamshells as humongous as the Raider 18 HX. MSI's brand does a little better than some others thanks to its smart use of software to auto-switch from CPU graphics to the discrete GPU. Let's face it, you're not carrying this thing around with you anyway. It's packing a 99.9Wh battery, which sounds good enough on paper.

The Raider 18 HX is also plenty loud when it starts going. It's not enough to eclipse the max sound of the speakers. Still, you'll need to bump up the volume if you expect to play at your desk. The cooling apparatus keeps the heat well away from the palm rest and your fingers. The surface temperature could hit around 100 degrees Fahrenheit near the center of the keyboard. Still, it wasn't enough to cause any real discomfort.

When you spend so much money on a laptop, the last thing you want to feel is that you're leaving something behind—especially for the sake of a desktop replacement computer as big as this one. And at its price point, the Raider 18 HX's lame chassis containing such a lame keyboard feels more insulting. In the same vein, if all I wanted was performance in games, these specs help me reach the fabled land of 4K, and I may not feel the need to buy an extra monitor or soundbar for that premium experience.

These are the sacrifices of the 2025-era laptops. So many different flavors of the same crusty lollipop combine in the mouth until all I can taste is sugar. Everybody likes sugar, but I'm craving something distinct. I don't know if I'll get that anytime soon with next year's gaming laptops. At least the sugar high is just as good with MSI's devices.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

Back in 2017, The Defenders paid off on several comic book team-ups that had been years in the making on Netflix across its various Marvel streaming shows—putting together Luke Cage and Danny Rand, turning Colleen Wing and Misty Knight into the Daughters of the Dragon, things that comic book readers knew to expect and enjoy. And yet, the absolute best pairing in the whole series ended up being the delectably abrasive banter between Jessica Jones and Matt Murdock.

Alas, we'd never get more of it after Defenders came and went, with the slow but steady cancellation of the Netflix-Marvel shows, followed by the rise of Disney's own streaming network over the course of the next few years. That is, until Marvel revived Daredevil with Born Again and then decided it should bring Ms. Jones along for the ride in season two.

“Just by the nature of who Jessica is and who Matt is, they both give as much as they get,” Charlie Cox told Entertainment Weekly of the duo's vibe in both Defenders and Born Again, as part of a preview that gave us our first official preview of Jessica's return in season two. “I'm not sure we were aware of it when we were shooting [Defenders]. So we've been really waiting for this opportunity for so long now to put these two on screen together and have more fun with them.”

Thankfully, the opportunity to do so will be pretty involved. According to Born Again producer and Marvel TV head Brad Winderbaum, Jessica will play a similarly sized role to Jon Bernthal's return as the Punisher in Born Again‘s first season and will definitely keep the tone between her and Matt similar to their Defenders screentime.

“We both talked about it being important to play some of the hits, as it were, make sure that we have that same dynamic,” Winderbaum added. “Tongue in cheek, take the piss out of each other, but also get down to business and make sure that we're serving the story appropriately.”

Daredevil: Born Again returns to Disney+, with Alias Investigation's finest in tow, sometime in March 2026.

Largely maintained for now, it is set to go in the future.

Being concerned that TSMC's expansion into the United States could dilute Taiwan's semiconductor leadership, Taiwanese authorities are mulling setting a new export rule that would only let the world's number-one foundry export technologies that are two generations behind its leading-edge production node, reports CNA. If this happens, this could slow down TSMC's expansion in the U.S., as it currently relies on aggressive building of advanced fabs there.

The core of this new export policy is the government's N-2 rule, which permits offshore deployment only of process technologies that trail Taiwan's leading-edge by two generations. Previously, Taiwanese authorities stuck to their N-1 rule, allowing TSMC to export all technologies that are at least one generation behind the leading-edge fabrication process. The new framework is much stricter; depending on how one counts generations, it means that TSMC may only be allowed to export nodes that are two or even four years behind its best technology.

Under this approach, if TSMC were to develop a 1.2nm or 1.4nm-class fabrication process domestically, then only its 1.6nm-class production would be eligible for use abroad, according to Lin Fa-cheng, Deputy Minister of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

For now, TSMC's Fab 21 phase 1 in Arizona is capable of making chips on N4/N5 fabrication technologies (which belong to the same generation). Domestically, TSMC has several fully ramped fabs capable of 3nm-class manufacturing processes (N3B, N3E, N3P, etc.) and is about to begin high-volume production of chips on its N2 production nodes, which belong to its 2nm-class. Formally, TSMC's Fab 21 phase 1 already complies with the N-2 rule. However, once TSMC begins to make chips on 3nm-class technologies at Fab 21 phase 2 in 2027, the facility will not be compliant with the N2-2 rule because N3 is formally just one generation behind N2/N2P/A16. Yet, while A16 is N2P with a backside power delivery network, if one considers A16 an all-new generation, then Fab 21 phase 2 will comply with the new high-tech export framework.

Lin also emphasized that most of TSMC's research and development workforce remains in Taiwan and noted that the company's R&D footprint aligns with government requirements. In practice, this concentration of engineers and scientists ensures that future process development stays anchored domestically, even as the company builds manufacturing capacity and R&D centers overseas. Lin also emphasized that all qualified personnel employed in the semiconductor industry are subject to regulatory oversight, which extends protection of IP and hardware to human capital.

In addition, any future U.S. investments by TSMC will be examined under existing laws, and projects exceeding certain thresholds must be reviewed by the MOEA's Investment Commission, said Chou Yu-hsin, Deputy Director-General of the Industrial Development Administration under the MOEA.

Users of Google and its offshoot services including YouTube and YouTube TV are reporting issues with the services as of Friday morning.

Google did start rolling out a core algorithm update on December 11. Otherwise, its service page is currently all quiet, possibly indicating a more modest outage. If you were having trouble with any of the aforementioned services, its possible they might be back online shortly.

 




The spike for reports of an outage on YouTube are much higher than Google and Google TV, with nearly 10,000 reports in the last hour of problems on the popular video service. Reports for Google and Google TV meanwhile, are in the hundreds.

The difficulty with any large outage is determining the spread. As noted, a trio of Google services being affected by spikes this significant points to an in-house problem at Google. But there are also Downdetector spikes for The Weather Channel and Target. Users of apps for both are reporting issues.

YouTube TV users are reporting server connection and streaming issues in the last hour in the U.S.. It's not available anywhere else.

Since the reports of YouTube issues, YouTube TV and Google itself have started spiking on Downdetector. YouTube users are reporting problems with the website and streaming videos. On Google itself, users are reporting problems with both the website and trying to search for issues. While these are spiking in the U.S. and the UK, not everyone is affected. My own Google is working just fine right now, for instance.

 




Some early Cloudflare disruption was reported on Friday morning. Clouflare says it has been monitoring a network performance issue, but a fix for that was implemented about an hour ago.

Downdetector spikes have been reported on YouTube, YouTube TV, and Google in the past hour. It is unclear at this stage if these are confined to Google's services, or part of a larger outage of a service like Cloudflare or Azure.

Morning folks, users of Google, YouTube, and more are reporting issues with the services. Stay tuned.

These are some of our favorite tech treats for the hobbyists and PC lovers in our life


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It's the holiday season, which means it's gift-giving season. Sure, you could spend thousands on tech, especially if you're looking at a new PC or laptop (or just some RAM, the way things are going), but if your budget is a little more modest, there are still plenty of options out there.

I don't believe you need to spend hundreds of dollars on a gift for the tech lovers in your life. I'm the perfect example: my desk and office drawers are filled with gadgets and tools, ranging from the useful to the unusual, all with a purpose that makes them essential (usually when I least expect it), and many of them bought at a discount.

Sticking to a budget of $100 won't limit you as much as you think. The collection of tech gifts priced under $100 that we've collated below are some of our firm Tom's Hardware favorites, from soldering irons to mouse mats. If you're in the market for a stocking filler, then these are the gifts you'll want to consider first.

What do you get for a techie who already has the big stuff, like a new PC or monitor? This 3.5-inch Hagibis mini screen. This is both a retro desk ornament and a fully-functional LCD display with a built-in SD card reader and USB hub.

Techies are the absolute target market for a gadget like this 3.5-inch Hagibis display. Yes, we'll admit, this mini monitor isn't in the same league as a big OLED displays, and it certainly isn't the biggest out there, but its design is a nostalgic throwback that makes for a lovely holiday gift.

It uses an IPS panel with a 178° viewing angle and supports resolutions from 800 x 600 to 2,560 x 1,600, although the screen's native resolution is 960 x 640. This Hagibis monitor also has a great set of USB ports, along with an SD card reader, allowing you to use it as an attractive desk hub.

This retro Hagibis monitor features a 3.5-inch IPS LCD display with a native resolution of 960 x 640, although it can scale up to 2,560 x 1,600 if you like punishing your eyes. It also includes several USB-A and USB-C ports with Gen 3.1 speeds, an HDMI port, and SD and TF card readers.

I think that every hobbyist, PC builder, and all-around DIYer needs a Hoto screwdriver in their life. At least three Tom's Hardware editors and writers own one, myself included, and it's a great starter kit for dealing with any very small screws you (or a loved one) might encounter.

This upgraded PixelDrive model features a 2,500 mAh battery. It uses USB-C for charging via the supplied cable, so there's no need to worry about finding AA batteries, either. You get 30 bits with this kit, including a range of different heads and styles, while the driver supports six different torque settings, depending on the power you use.

Give a kit like this for Christmas, and you'll make one enthusiast very happy indeed.

All-time low price 

The Hoto PixelDrive is a magnetic, precision cordless screwdriver powered by a 2,500 mAh battery and charged via a USB-C cable. An upgrade over the Tom's Hardware favorite, the Nex O1 Pro, this model includes a built-in LCD screen to display torque and battery levels. It weighs 317g, features six different torque settings, and includes 30 different ultra-hard screw bits.

I've learned the hard way that you shouldn't go anywhere without a backup power source for your tech. My Samsung smartphone has been saved on more than one occasion in a busy city or the great outdoors by a power bank, but this Ugreen Nexode model easily outperforms my existing kit.

This is a huge power bank, at least based on its electrical capacity, with a 20,000 mAh battery that can output 165W and fully recharge in just under two hours. That means you can fast charge a laptop or MacBook, along with a smartphone, at once. You can use the built-in retractable USB-C cable to do this, or hook up a USB cable to one of the two other ports.

A 20,000 mAh power bank with fast charging for my phone and laptop for less than $70 is simply a steal. If you're thinking about a practical gift for a loved one, put this Ugreen battery on your short list.

I never go anywhere without a power bank like this Ugreen Nexode. It has a whopping 20,000 mAh battery, capable of a max 165W output for charging multiple devices at once, including laptops and smartphones with fast charging. It includes a built-in retractable USB-C cable, two additional USB ports, and can be recharged in just under two hours.

In a world of streaming services and cloud storage, physical media might seem quaint, even obsolete. Wrong. Physical storage guarantees ownership of the media it contains, along with its control.

That's where this interesting Suidek DVD drive comes in. It's more than just a DVD drive, though. It writes CDs and DVDs, but it also has a built-in SD card reader, along with spare USB-A and USB-C ports to use this as a quick-and-easy hub for a laptop or PC.

This is a genuine Swiss Army knife for a PC owner without an optical drive who wants to access or store files across multiple storage devices. If you know someone with a serious media collection, get them a drive like this one for the holidays.

This optical CD/DVD writer from Suidek is all that and more. It features an SD card reader and a selection of USB-A and USB-C ports. If you need a jack-of-all-trades reader for all of your media, then this is the one for you.

 




Most PC users have been using the same layout for decades. One mouse, one keyboard. While these can accommodate extra buttons for quick commands and macros, a dedicated option like Elgato's Stream Deck Neo can make a lot of sense.

The Stream Deck Neo is a dedicated tool for macros and quick commands. It has eight programmable buttons and LCD screens that you can customize for the app or command you want to set up. This can do anything you like, like performing an action in a game, launching an app on your desktop, or controlling actions like your system volume.

I'd love a gift like this, as it's thoughtful and (more importantly) really useful for my line of work. Check out our Elgato Stream Deck Neo review for a full run-through if you want to hear more.

You don't need to be a streamer to want Elgato's Stream Deck Neo on your deck. This beginner-friendly macro pad features eight tactile LCD buttons you can configure for various commands and actions, along with an infobar with two touch-sensitive buttons for navigation.

Ledger has been in the cryptocurrency hardware business for over a decade. I've owned a Ledger Nano S for about the same time, and used it to hold a whole array of (tiny) crypto investments, including Bitcoin.

This upgraded model, the Ledger Nano S Plus, is still one of the few hardware wallets I'd trust to recommend. It provides you with a safe and secure way to protect your crypto investments because, rather than relying on a software-based wallet, you need physical access to this key to approve transactions.

It supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, including big ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and allows you to manage up to a hundred different wallets on one device. It features physical buttons and a small display to help you approve transactions. If you have a crypto enthusiast in your life, make sure they're using a hardware wallet like this one.

The upgraded model of Ledger's original Nano S hardware cryptocurrency wallet is a must-have if you own any form of crypto and want to keep it secure. It supports thousands of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, allowing you to manage up to a hundred different wallets on one device.

Before the recent SSD price increases started to affect the market, I'd collected quite a few M.2 SSDs. I've installed them on laptops and PCs I've built for myself and family members, but I've also had quite a few to spare.

Rather than leaving them to gather dust in a drawer, I've used this Ugreen M.2 enclosure to turn them into quick, easy-to-use external drives. The enclosure supports all M.2 form factors, including 2230 for laptops and handhelds and 2280 for PCs. It uses a USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection via a USB-C cable, with data transfer rates up to 10 Gbps while remaining backwards compatible.

This doesn't require any tools, either. Drives up to 8TB simply plug into the enclosure and clip into place. Give this to a serious data hoarder in your life; it'll definitely come in handy.

If you have a spare M.2 drive, or you just want to make one portable, this Ugreen enclosure is a cost-effective and easy way to do it. It supports all major M.2 drive sizes and up to 8TB of capacity. It uses a USB-C 3.2 connection to connect your SSD to your PC.

I grew up in the 1990s, and I fondly remember playing on the original Game Boy. While I'm also lucky enough to still own the original version, not everybody does, so if you're looking for a nostalgic gift to share this Christmas, then this Lego Game Boy could be it.

This 1:1 scale replica of Nintendo's Game Boy isn't a working model (at least not without some modding), but it's still a gorgeous kit for building a model that looks a lot like the original. It comes with two ""game cartridges"" for Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, along with lenticular screen inserts to showcase both games.

This is gorgeous. I love Lego and school Nintendo, and I'd be very happy if I woke up with this to build on Christmas morning.

A 1:1 scale replica of the gaming handheld that dominated the 1990s. Nintendo's Game Boy is an iconic piece of tech, and this Lego model is an exact replica of the great handheld. It includes two cartridges; Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. The screen can be replaced with a lenticular screen that recreates the original console's pixels.

 




I know far too many family members and friends who use dusty, old office-grade peripherals. If you're the same, it's time to replace the membrane boards and invest in the Cooler Master MK770 instead.

First, this board is gorgeous. It comes in a couple of different colorways, including Space Gray, Macaron Red, and just plain Macaron with pastel-like colors. This 96-percent, wireless mechanical keyboard is packed with a strong set of features, however, including five different connectivity modes, a built-in volume dial, and customizable RGB lighting. However, its greatest feature is the combined gasket mount design and Kailh Box V2 switches, which make it quick and comfortable to type for long periods.

With an affordable price that is nearly half the original MSRP, this is one keyboard worth gifting this holiday season. You can check out our Cooler Master MK770 review to see our full thoughts on this pastel-flavored board.

The Cooler Master MK770 features Kailh Box White V2 switches and gasket mounting for the best typing experience you can get. It also can connect via Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz wireless or USB-C. It comes with RGB lighting and built-in volume controls.

Don't let your friends, colleagues, and loved ones head out into the online world without protection. A hardware security key like this Yubico YubiKey 5C NFC can be the ultimate upgrade to avoid account breaches, adding a physical layer of security that a remote hacker 5,000 miles away can't replicate.

The YubiKey 5C NFC is used for two-factor authentication. When you sign in to an account that supports 2FA, like a Google account, for instance, you can use the YubiKey to approve access without relying on a smartphone or, worse still, SMS approval. It works with thousands of services as a physical layer of protection to approve sign-ins. This model uses USB-C, although you can get a USB-A version for a similar price.

A physical hardware key like the YubiKey 5C NFC is a formidable way to protect your accounts. Gifting it to someone you care about might not be flashy, but it's a worthwhile investment nevertheless.

The YubiKey 5C NFC security key uses the latest passkey standards, including FIDO2/WebAuthn, along with other security options, like FIDO U2F, Yubico OTP, OATH-TOTP/HOTP, Smart card (PIV), and OpenPGP. Protect your login credentials and accounts with a physical security fob that connects to your PC or laptop via USB-C.

A mouse mat might seem like an odd gift these days, but for a gamer? It's essential. Not only do they provide a level surface for seriously sensitive gaming mice to work, but they can also protect your desk and keep it looking smart.

This Razer Firefly V2 Pro mouse mat does all of that and more while remaining affordable. It's on our best gaming mouse pads guide for a reason: it's the world's first RGB-backlit mouse pad.

Lighting is what dominates this Razer mat, with 15 RGB lighting zones that you can configure. It's a hard-surface mouse mat with three layers, covered in a thin micro-textured surface at the top that won't affect your mouse accuracy. At just $69.99 right now, this is a nice addition for any gamer's setup.

The Razer Firefly V2 Pro is the world's first RGB backlit mouse pad. This is a hard-surface mouse pad with 15 RGB lighting zones, which are located in a black bar along the top of the mouse pad. The mouse pad comes in black and white colorways, and both allow for plenty of bright, colorful RGB lighting to shine through (especially in the dark).

Seriously, who doesn't love a cool, retro wireless gaming controller? 8Bitdo is great at making peripherals that look as great as they work. This SNES-inspired SN30 Pro is easy to hold and makes a great gift for anyone who loves playing retro games.

This controller isn't picky about what it connects to; it's rated to work on Windows, macOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch. It isn't mentioned in the specs, but Linux support is pretty good, too.

The SN30 Pro comes in a few different colorways, but I really like this SNES-colored model. This Pro update also features Hall Effect joysticks for greater durability, too. This is a great gift, just don't let those Mario Kart games go to your head.

This 8Bitdo SNES-inspired controller will appeal to gamers of a certain age. Its appeal goes beyond its looks: it includes Hall Effect joysticks and supports the Switch, PC, macOS, and any OS that supports games and Bluetooth.



One of the biggest upgrades I ever made to my PC setup was buying a half-decent optical mouse. If you know somebody using a tired, old mouse with low sensitivity, then this Logitech upgrade should be on your shortlist for gifts.

The Logitech G Pro 2 Lightspeed features an optical sensor with a sensitivity of up to 44,000 DPI. That vastly outstrips most gaming mice, including several in our best gaming mouse guide. Sensitivity like this makes it a brilliant option for competitive gaming and for actions on your PC or laptop that require small, precise movements, such as graphic design.

This particular wireless mouse is rated for 95 hours of battery life and charges over USB-C. It has four customizable buttons, which, along with the RGB lighting and DPI sensitivity, you can customize using Logitech's G Hub software. This is an awesome gift for a PC user.

If you want a super-fast, easy-to-grip gaming mouse with a classy design, then this Logitech G Pro 2 Lightspeed option is for you. You can connect this wireless mouse via Bluetooth or using Logitech's 2.4 GHz Lightspeed low-latency wireless mode. It features a 44K DPI optical sensor, four customizable side buttons, USB-C charging, and 95-hour battery life. 

Yes, another Hoto product, but it's a good one. If you know someone who needs to clean out their PC case or blast away crumbs on their desk, this Hoto vacuum and air blower is the perfect gift.

It's not just a vacuum cleaner, though. It's a 4-in-1 device with two ends that let you alternate between sucking the air and blasting it away, with five different attachments to use, depending on the scenario. It has a 1,900 mAh battery that lasts for a continuous ten minutes and weighs just 0.78 lbs.

PC owners will want this to keep their PC dust-free, but you can also use it around your table or chair to clean up any fallen debris. You can also use it for inflation, such as air beds, as well as vacuum packing. Pick this up for a loved one, and they'll never need to worry about dust balls in their PC again.

If your loved one suffers with a crumby desk or a dusty PC, this all-in-one desk vacuum and portable air blower is the appropriate gift to share. One side is for blowing, one side is for sucking, with various magnetic tools, depending on your environment. This 4-in-1 tool is also good for inflating and vacuum sealing. 

A smart soldering iron, meaning one with its own operating system and temperature control system, is a serious upgrade. You don't have to break the bank to get one, though, as this Fnirsi HS-01 kit proves.

Our Fnirsi HS-01 review put this model through its paces. It's entry-level but easy to use, featuring a metal body and a rubberized finger guard. You'll need to power this with a USB-C cable, and it supports a range of USB PD voltages from 9V to 24V.

A soldering iron like this is a great tool in the budding hobbyist's arsenal. It's great for beginners, but serious makers will fancy their chances with an iron like this one, too.

When we reviewed this Fnirsi soldering iron kit, we said it was low-cost and high-precision. That's what you're getting: it heats up fast, is easy to use, and isn't outrageously expensive. This is a good option for a hobbyist who needs an upgrade.

I like to build stuff, and I've built quite a collection of parts, wires, and components over the years to help me do that. For the maker in your life who doesn't have a collection like that, especially a beginner, you might want to pick up this Elegoo Mega R3 project starter kit.

This kit is genuinely exciting for anyone who likes to tinker with electronics. It has a programmable Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with a breadboard, buzzer, tilt switch, various resistors, and wires. It also has LEDs, jumper wires, buttons, and more.

This is a treasure trove of equipment to kickstart the journey of any electronics enthusiast. It also comes with a CD that includes 35 lessons to help you with the kit. This'll keep a hobbyist in your life busy for weeks!

Elegoo has put together an awesome maker kit for beginners with the Mega R3. It features a whole array of items for building mini projects with 200 individual bits, including an Arduino Mega 2560, sensors, wires, LEDs, buttons, screens, and more.

Users report Copilot appearing after a recent software update, with no option to uninstall.

Update - December 19 5 am ET: In a statement of clarification to Tom's Hardware, LG US' Director of Public Relations Chris De Maria told us that the inclusion of Microsoft Copilot on LG TVs was provided as ""a shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience,"" and said, ""It is not an application-based service embedded in the TV."" As such, the company says features such as microphone input are only activated by customer consent, because the shortcut opens Microsoft's website through the TV's web browser. Regardless, LG says that it ""respects consumer choice and will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish."" 

LG smart TV owners are reporting that a recent webOS software update has added Microsoft Copilot to their TVs, with no apparent way to remove it. Reports first surfaced over the weekend on Reddit, where a post showing a Copilot tile pinned to an LG TV home screen climbed to more than 35,000 upvotes on r/mildlyinfuriating, accompanied by hundreds of comments from users describing the same behavior.

According to affected users, Copilot appears automatically after installing the latest webOS update on certain LG TV models. The feature shows up on the home screen alongside streaming apps, but unlike Netflix or YouTube, it cannot be uninstalled.

LG has previously confirmed plans to integrate Microsoft Copilot into webOS as part of its broader “AI TV” strategy. At CES 2025, the company described Copilot as an extension of its AI Search experience, designed to answer questions and provide recommendations using Microsoft's AI services. In practice, the iteration of Copilot currently seen on LG TVs appears to function as a shortcut to a web-based Copilot interface rather than a fully native application like the one described by LG.

The issue, for many, isn't necessarily what Copilot does, but that it has been forced onto consumers with no option to remove it. LG's own support documentation notes that certain preinstalled or system apps cannot be deleted, only hidden. Users who encounter Copilot after the update report that this limitation applies, leaving them with no way to fully remove the feature once it has been added. It's a similar story on rival models, for instance some Samsung TV's include Gemini.

The overwhelmingly negative reaction from users indicates a growing frustration with AI features being imposed on consumers in every way possible. Smart TVs have naturally become platforms for advertising, data collection, and now AI services, with updates adding new functionality that owners did not explicitly request and, in most cases, do not want. While LG allows users to disable some AI-related options, such as voice recognition and personalization features, those settings do not remove the Copilot app itself.

Ultimately, those wanting to minimize Copilot's presence on their TVs are limited to keeping it disconnected from the Internet. That's about the most that can be done at the moment, unless LG backtracks and either allows users to disable or completely uninstall the app in response to backlash, which seems unlikely.

Some residents feel they've been railroaded by the very public service officials that were meant to protect them.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has given DTE Energy permission to deliver 1.4 gigawatts of power to a planned data center that will be built in Saline Township, about 40 miles southwest of downtown Detroit. This data center project is part of the Stargate data center project by OpenAI and Oracle, which aims to deliver more than 5GW of computing capacity. According to the Detroit Free Press, DTE filed an “ex parte” motion with the MPSC to get the nod for its contract without contest, with the commission voting 3-0 for its approval.

This move meant that DTE Energy did not have to go through a lengthy hearing, wherein opposing groups could seek expert testimony and present evidence to challenge DTE's claims. Many residents are concerned that this massive project would cause electricity prices to spike and affect the water quality in the area — issues that several U.S. senators are also looking into. On the other hand, the utility company argued that it didn't need to prove that this project would affect energy prices for local residents, especially as a 2024 state law prevents data centers from passing on energy costs to the community to qualify for preferential tax treatment.

Aside from this, DTE's contract with Green Chile Ventures, an Oracle subsidiary, requires that the latter will pay 80% of the contracted capacity, whether or not it actually uses it. This ready-to-serve provision in the power agreement helps ensure the power utility's expenditure on additional infrastructure to support the AI data center will not be passed on to the average consumer. The contract will also last for at least 19 years, giving the power provider ample time to recoup its expenses from the data center and not from the community. Furthermore, if the data center fails to pay for its energy costs, DTE cannot pass them on to other consumers.

Despite these mechanisms, opponents of the plan were still dismayed about not being heard. “I, along with everyone here… probably don't feel like they've been publicly served today. When you make these decisions, you're eliminating the very necessity of what public service bodies are all about,” Wendy Albers, a resident of nearby Augusta Township, told the MPSC. “I appreciate the protections you put in place, but I just don't trust them.”

Or more, depending on the workloads.

SK hynix on Thursday said that its range-topping 256 GB DDR5 RDIMM based on 32 Gb memory devices has passed the Intel Data Center Certified process, the industry's first memory module at this capacity to do so. Normally, certification of a memory module by Intel would be mundane, but this module is special; it combines capacity, low power consumption, and performance, thus potentially saving data center operators millions of dollars.

AI servers not only consume plenty of premium high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used on AI accelerators like Nvidia B300, but also tons of commodity server DDR5 SDRAM that connect to x86 processors. A single high-capacity DDR5 memory module can consume up to 15W or even 25W (depending on performance, capabilities, and workloads), so a fully equipped 12-channel Xeon 6 memory subsystem can draw between 180W and 300W, comparable to the CPU's power consumption.

A 32 Gb memory chip made on SK hynix's 1b process technology (5th Generation 10nm-class DRAM process) consumes significantly less power than two 16 Gb memory ICs made on the company's 1a production node (4th Generation 10nm-class DRAM node), so using a 256 GB DDR5 RDIMM based on the latest DRAMs leads to significant energy savings.

SK hynix claims that these new 256 GB DDR5 RDIMMs ""achieve up to approximately 18% lower power consumption than previous 256 GB products.""

Offering 32.4W lower power consumption per single-CPU Xeon 6 machine translates into significant savings for modern AI or hyperscale cloud deployments that typically use tens of thousands of machines.

As a result, a relatively simple Intel certification to earn the Intel Data Center Certified badge could drive success for SK hynix in the data center market, particularly in the Xeon 6-based AI server space.

""We are now able to respond more swiftly to customer needs, solidifying our leadership in the server DDR5 DRAM market,"" said Sangkwon Lee, head of DRAM Product Planning & Enablement at SK hynix. ""As a full-stack AI memory creator, we will actively address the growing demand for high-performance, low-power, and high-capacity memory solutions to further enhance customer satisfaction.""

On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the medication Addyi (flibanserin) for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women under the age of 65.

Addyi was previously approved in 2015 for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women. Premenopause or “before” menopause refers to the reproductive time in a cisgender woman's life when they have regular menstrual cycles. 

Postmenopause refers to the time period after the person finishes menopause and no longer has a menstrual cycle. The majority of people start menopause between the ages of 49 and 52. 

While people can experience HSDD at any age, it is not uncommon to experience a low libido during menopause and postmenopause. Past research shows that between 40-55% of women advancing through menopause experience low sexual desire, and about 9% of postmenopausal women have HSDD. 

With the expanded approval to postmenopausal women under 65, Medical News Today spoke with three women's health experts to find out more about how Addyi works, its side effects, what does this approval mean for menopausal women, and any non-medication alternatives they suggest for low libido. 

Addyi is a prescription medication manufactured by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. 

“Addyi is a non hormonal medication that works on neurotransmitters in the brain to help regulate mood and increase sex drive,” Susan Marie Pacana, MD, minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon and OB/GYN at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, told MNT. 

“Addyi is a medication for women that, according to the manufacturer, increases sexual desire,” Prudence Hall, MD, an OB/GYN in private practice in Santa Monica, CA, and author of Radiant Again & Forever: Overcome Menopause & Restore Your Radiance, added. 

“After taking it for a month, dopamine and serotonin levels are apparently enhanced, which supposedly increases sexual desire.”— Prudence Hall, MD

With the expanded approval for postmenopausal women under the age of 65, G. Thomas Ruiz, MD, a board certified OB/GYN at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told MNT that Addyi could now help a greater number of women. 

“The group of women where I get the biggest complaints of decreased libido is in the 50 to 60 year old age bracket, so potentially this could be a very important medication for them,” Ruiz added. 

Pacana, who is also a Menopause Society Certified Practitioner, commented that the lack of medications for low libido has been a long-standing issue, but the new FDA approval for this treatment up to age 65 is a major step forward. 

“Women of all ages present to our office with complaints of low sex drive that affect their relationships, self-esteem, and body image,” she explained. “It often is accompanied by feelings of shame, frustration and guilt when women are unable to meet their partner's sexual expectations.”

“Previously, I could prescribe it off-label for postmenopausal women, but they were unfairly denied insurance coverage. Now, with this official approval, we can finally expect insurers to cover this necessary treatment for a wider population of women.” — Susan Marie Pacana, MD

Like all medications, Addyi has known potential side effects, including:

However, Addyi also carries a “black box” warning from the FDA as when taken with alcohol or certain medications, Addyi can cause low blood pressure (severe hypotension) or a risk of fainting (syncope). 

Ruiz said it would be very helpful for the drug company to issue a simple handout of all the “do's and don'ts” associated with Addyi. 

“They've got to make it as least confusing for patients to use as possible, so a simple do's and don'ts information sheet would be useful,” he detailed. “And that would be useful for providers.”

For women who may not want to take medication, what other things can they do to help with a low libido? For perimenopausal and menopausal women, Hall said optimizing their declining and absent hormones is extremely effective. 

“Over the 40 years of my work in this area, I commonly see women's sexuality bloom into a renaissance of youthful passion,” she explained. 

“Estradiol is extremely effective for this, with the estradiol patch and compounded cream being my top two choices. When testosterone is low and replaced to youthful levels, orgasms become more easily accessed and are stronger. It is not uncommon for women to tell me that their desire is completely gone and that they can't even have an orgasm.” — Prudence Hall, MD

“Also when thyroid and adrenal stress hormones are precisely optimized, energy is increased and depression recedes. Women report that their sexuality returns to youthful levels causing a resurgence of intimacy and contentment with themselves and their relationships,” Hall continued.

Ruiz said that sometimes a low libido comes down to a lack of a female patient's understanding of how their body functions sexually, and how to communicate it to her partner. 

“In terms of the first stage of sexual activity, for men arousal is instantaneous. For women, [i]t's a little bit more diffused and not as direct, so that arousal time may take 20 to 30 minutes.” — G. Thomas Ruiz, MD

“Scheduling time for intimacy where that is the primary goal, things like that are helpful. Common activities where they're together with their partner. Foreplay may take all day — it's not a crazy thing to think about. And of course a good relationship with your partner — if you don't have a good relationship with your partner, there's not going to be a sex drive,” Ruiz explained. 

“I also will also encourage women to practice with self stimulation so that they understand how their body works and they communicate that to their partner,” he added. “And that actually works for menopausal women as well.”

The US FDA has approved depemokimab as an add-on maintenance therapy for individuals aged 12 years or older with severe asthma, according to a press release from manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline.

Depemokimab-ulaa, marketed as Exdensur, is the first long-acting biologic to be studied for respiratory diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation, and the product's distinctive half-life allows for twice-yearly doses of 100 mg subcutaneously, according to the company. 

The approval was based on data from a pair of phase III studies, SWIFT-1 and SWIFT-2, which showed sustained reductions in asthma exacerbations with two doses per year as an add-on to standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care.

Asthma exacerbations decreased by 58% and 48% in the SWIFT-1 and SWIFT-2 studies, respectively, from baseline to 52 weeks (P < .001 in both studies). Additionally, the annualized exacerbation rates were significantly lower in patients who received depemokimab vs placebo across both studies (0.46 vs 1.11 and 0.56 vs 1.08, respectively; P < .001 for both). 

Secondary endpoint analysis also showed significantly fewer exacerbations requiring emergency department visits and/or hospitalizations.

Adverse events were similar in both treatment and placebo groups across both studies; the most common included upper respiratory infections such as colds and sinus infections, headache, itching, injection-site reactions, and flu-like symptoms.

The drug is indicated for patients with a particular eosinophilic phenotype of asthma that is often resistant to other treatments, according to the company. The study population included individuals aged 12 years or older with an eosinophil count of at least 300 cells/µL in the previous 12 months or at least 150 cells/µL at screening, with a history of exacerbations despite use of medium- or high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids.

Depemokimab also has received marketing authorization in the UK from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use; submissions are under review in other countries as well, including China and Japan, according to the company.

Full prescribing information is available here.

The studies were supported by GlaxoSmithKline.

Early diagnosis and conservative treatment of congenital knee dislocation (CKD) can achieve excellent long-term anatomical and functional outcomes, even in resource-limited settings and during challenging circumstances, emphasising the importance of continuous follow-up and parental counselling to ensure adherence and awareness in managing rare congenital orthopaedic conditions.

A case report by orthopaedic surgeon Rupak Kandel, MD, and colleagues from the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Karnali Care International Hospital and Research Center, Birendranagar, Nepal, raises awareness among clinicians about bilateral CKD, a rare congenital condition, and strengthens their confidence in counselling parents regarding treatment options and long-term outcomes.

A full-term neonate was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery following an uncomplicated pregnancy, with the mother having received regular antenatal care. The neonate transitioned well at birth, with no systemic complications.

Physical examination within 24 hours revealed severe bilateral knee hyperextension of approximately 100°, consistent with type II CKD, characterised by anterior tibial subluxation without complete dislocation.

Initial gentle manipulation achieved partial reduction, but sustained knee flexion could not be maintained, indicating persistent joint instability. Conservative management was initiated promptly at a regional medical facility under orthopaedic supervision. The treatment consisted of serial above-knee plaster casting, with casts changed every 7-10 days to gradually increase knee flexion from 0°-30°. The toes were left exposed to allow monitoring for circulatory compromise, given the remote location of the family and limited access for frequent follow-up. During treatment, the maximum achievable flexion in both knee joints gradually improved from 0° to 30°. After cast removal, the knees remained in an almost neutral or mildly flexed resting position. Skin integrity was maintained, with no pressure sores or other complications, and foot alignment remained normal.

Approximately 4 years after the initial presentation, x-rays of both knees demonstrated stable alignment, normal joint congruency, and intact epiphyseal plates, with no evidence of recurrent dislocation, deformity, or degenerative change.

At the most recent clinical evaluation, the child's lower limbs appeared normal, with appropriate knee alignment and no residual hyperextension, pain, instability, or functional limitation, confirming sustained correction.

CKD is a rare limb malformation that is typically observed at birth. Clinical assessment should focus on the degree of knee hyperextension, presence of anterior skin creases, and reducibility of the deformity in the knee. X-rays, including anteroposterior and lateral views of the knee, remain the preferred diagnostic modality.

“Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of conservative treatment, such as gentle manipulation and serial casting, can result in excellent functional and radiological outcomes, even in resource-limited settings. In this particular case, timely intervention allowed the child to achieve normal growth and development without long-term complications, avoiding the need for surgical correction,” wrote the authors.

The report also highlighted the importance of parental counselling and structured follow-up. Clear communication and community education remain essential for supporting adherence and long-term monitoring when managing rare congenital orthopaedic conditions such as CKD.

William P. Shutze, MD, is a vascular surgeon at Texas Vascular Associates in Dallas and Plano, Texas, and an executive board member of the Society for Vascular Surgery. He is board-certified in vascular surgery, general surgery, and surgical critical care, with a professional focus on aortic and peripheral vascular disease.

In this Q&A with Medscape Medical News, Shutze discussed Holiday Heart Syndrome, the vascular risks associated with seasonal behaviors, and preventive strategies primary care physicians (PCPs) can use to protect their patients.

After noticing an increase in irregular heartbeats, also called atrial fibrillation (AF), in December and January, researchers coined the term Holiday Heart Syndrome to describe an increase in AF that can occur following a period of increased drinking, usually more than five to six standard drinks in a short period. However, combined with high-sodium foods, elevated stress levels, and decreased exercise present during the holiday season, binge drinking can harm the blood vessels running to and from your heart, or your vascular system.

PCPs should be vigilant for symptoms that signal impaired circulation or an impending vascular event, even when patients attribute them to “holiday fatigue.” Alert your patients of red flags including new leg pain or cramping when walking, nonhealing wounds on the feet or toes, sudden coldness or color changes in the limbs, and abrupt numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. 

Chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and sudden swelling in the legs should also never be overlooked, as they may reflect vascular complications like AF linked to Holiday Heart Syndrome. New or worse leg swelling is very important as it may be a sign of a blood clot or heart failure. Ahead of the holidays, make sure to alert your patients of these symptoms to prevent unwanted health consequences.

They can strain the vascular system in several ways. Large, high-sodium, and high-fat meals can cause spikes in blood pressure (BP) and stiffen blood vessels, affecting blood circulation, clot formation, and plaque buildup. Alcohol adds another layer of stress to the body through dehydration, raising heart rate and BP, and disrupting regular heartbeat patterns. Dehydration increases the risk for blood clots in both the arteries and veins. When combined for multiple days in a row, fatty foods and alcohol can significantly increase the likelihood of vascular events like blood clots and stroke. Especially in patients with known peripheral vascular disease.

PCPs can educate and encourage patients by recommending simple routines such as:

Small, consistent habits beat heroic New Year's resolutions. Encouraging patients to set realistic goals and track movement can help them stay active without feeling overwhelmed, reinforcing that small, consistent habits go a long way in protecting their vascular health this time of year.

Individuals who are older than 65 years, have high BP, diabetes, metabolic syndrome or obesity may be at greater risk. Additionally, patients with preexisting AF and known atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease). Patients on anticoagulants who drink heavily are at risk for falls and intracranial hemorrhage. These groups should consider limiting their alcohol and salt intake during the holidays.

Whether your patients are in the at-risk population or not, it's important to stress the importance of managing alcohol consumption over the holiday season. Easy strategies like exercise, reducing stress, and opting for a glass of water instead of wine may help reduce your patient's chances of developing serious health conditions, such as AF or vascular complications. Set a drinking limit in advance and stick to it (write it down). One extra walk and one glass of water between drinks can prevent an ambulance ride. Take all BP, diabetes, and heart medications even when traveling and pack extra in case of travel delays and stay well hydrated.

More than 90% of confirmed influenza cases in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have tested positive for a new mutated strain of influenza known as AH3N2 J.2.4.1 or “subclade K,” the WHO reported. 

“Just a small genetic variation in the flu virus can mean more people get sick,” Hans Kluge, MD, WHO regional director for Europe, told Medscape News Europe.

The announcement comes as more than 70% of countries reporting data in the WHO European Region are disclosing high or very high influenza activity. Six countries in particular — Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, and the UK — reported that more than half of patients tested for influenza-like illness were positive for influenza.

Higher influenza activity is corresponding with increasing hospitalization in some countries, something affecting all age groups, but especially adults aged 65 years or older, reported the European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) as of data from the first week of December 2025. 

Alessandro Diana, lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, told Medscape News Europe that hospitalizations for influenza in the country are higher than last year and that the situation is likely similar all over Europe. 

Kluge added: “H3N2 dominant seasons — like the one we are in now — tend to result in more severe disease than H1N1 dominant seasons. However, there is no evidence that the current circulating strain of H3N2, known as subclade K, causes more severe disease than other H3N2 strains.”

Diana noted that the new strain's first signal came from Australia earlier this year, which experienced an “overwhelming” number of hospitalizations; especially among those aged 65 or older and those with cardiopulmonary conditions. While it was initially thought that many of those afflicted weren't vaccinated, it soon emerged that some had been. 

Researchers began questioning whether the vaccine provides sufficient protection, Diana said. To test this, in vitro analyses were conducted and revealed that antibodies produced from the vaccine do have a neutralizing effect against subclade K. 

“The problem is, however, that what you observe in the lab doesn't always translate to patients,” Diana explained. He added that the flu vaccine does not protect against getting the flu, but it does reduce the risk for and severity of complications. 

The WHO said that early estimates indicate that the current vaccine is up to 75% effective at preventing hospitalization in children aged between 2 and 17 years, and up to 40% effective in adults. 

While Diana thinks the vaccine will help against complications from the new strain, it is left to be seen if this is really the case as more data is gathered and analyzed. The crucial thing in gathering data, he emphasized, is to make sure to record whether patients have been vaccinated. 

“For the last 10-15 years, and especially in Switzerland, most people tend to wait until the end of December or beginning of January to get vaccinated. Since flu season started earlier this year — 4 weeks earlier according to the WHO, which still falls within the normal range — it could be that we have a lot of people who are hospitalized who did not receive the vaccine,” he said.

“Keeping yourself protected helps prevent the virus from spreading,” Diana added, saying that clinicians should wear a mask to protect against transmission whenever seeing patients with respiratory symptoms. 

Both Kluge and Diana urged vaccination for healthcare professionals working with vulnerable and/or immunocompromised patients and other high-risk groups.

“The WHO encourages everyone, especially those at higher risk, to prioritize vaccination and to integrate simple protective habits into everyday life. Get vaccinated when vaccines are offered to you. If you are sick, stay home. If you have symptoms, wear a mask. When sneezing or coughing, cover your mouth and nose. Clean your hands regularly. And open windows and doors regularly to let fresh air in,” said Kluge. 

He also stressed the importance of protecting oneself from misinformation and disinformation. 

“False or misleading claims about vaccines and protective measures spread like wildfire online, fueling confusion and mistrust and ultimately leaving people unprotected. The WHO urges everyone to seek reliable information: check your sources, verify facts, and turn to trusted institutions, such as ministries of health and the WHO,” Kluge said. 

Diana reported working with www.infovac.ch and is involved in vaccine educational programs.

A 65-year-old man is admitted with an acute coronary syndrome and is ultimately diagnosed with a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). He undergoes catheterization and stenting of a right coronary artery (RCA) lesion. After returning to his room, a 12-lead ECG is obtained.

The correct diagnosis is accelerated idioventicular rhythm (Figure 2).

The rhythm is regular at a rate of 42 beats/min. The first five QRS complexes are wide (0.14 seconds), with no P waves seen before or after. However, a P wave appears immediately before the fifth QRS complex (↓). The PR interval is very short (0.06 seconds), indicating that the P wave is nonconducted. 

The sixth QRS complex (↑) has a preceding P wave (+) with a short PR interval (0.08 seconds). The QRS complex duration is slightly narrower than the first five QRS complexes, and the morphology is slightly different. This is a fusion complex. 

The seventh QRS complex has a P wave before it (^) with a PR interval of 0.16 seconds. The P wave is positive in leads II and V5 and therefore it is probably sinus. The QRS complex duration and morphology are normal. This is, therefore, a captured beat. 

The presence of a fusion and captured complex with a wide QRS complex rhythm is consistent with a ventricular rhythm. Because the rate is less than 100 beats/min, this is an accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), sometimes termed slow VT. The fusion and captured complex occur as the sinus rate increases, allowing antegrade conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node and therefore partially or completely captures the ventricle. The QT/QTc intervals are prolonged (540/450 msec and 500/420 msec when corrected for the prolonged QRS complex duration). AIVR is often seen after angioplasty and stenting as a reperfusion arrhythmia.

Women with endometriosis and concurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease, had a less severe disease progression and required fewer immunosuppressants and biologics than those with IBD alone.

""A diagnosis of endometriosis, which can mimic IBD, should therefore be considered by the gastroenterologist in female patients of childbearing age. Although patients with endometriosis are supposed to have a higher risk of developing IBD, the presence of endometriosis does not negatively impact the course of IBD,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Lucas Guillo, MD, University Hospital of Marseille Nord, University of Aix-Marseille, Marseille, France. It was published online on December 08, 2025, in Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology.

The retrospective nature of data collection may have resulted in numerous missing data points. Some information was obtained via telephone interviews, which may have introduced memory bias. The composite severity criterion was not validated and did not include objective signs of disease activity.

This study did not receive any funding. Two authors reported receiving consulting and personal fees from various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

ORLANDO, Fla. — A pair of studies offer new insights into treatments for newly diagnosed advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (ASHL). One confirmed that long-term outcomes for the regimen known as nivolumab plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (N-AVD) continue to outperform the brentuximab vedotin and AVD (BV-AVD) regimen. The other study showed that a newer treatment approach, referred to as brentuximab vedotin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and dexamethasone (BrECADD), more commonly used in Europe than in the US, beats the elevated bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (eBEACOPP) regimen.

The lead authors of these studies presented their findings at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The 3-year follow-up of the S1826 study showed continued superior outcomes in 970 patients with ASHL taking N-AVD vs BV-AVD. Over 3 years, the progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 91% and 82%, respectively, according to the abstract presented by Alex Herrera, MD, hematologist-oncologist and head of the Division of Lymphoma at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, at the meeting.

The open-label, randomized, phase 3 HD21 trial assigned 1500 patients with ASHL aged 18-60 years to PET-guided BrECADD or eBEACOPP.

The trial's final analysis found that the absolute 5-year PFS rate for BrECADD was 93.6% vs 90.6% for eBEACOPP, according to the abstract presented by Justin Ferdinandus, MD, resident physician of the University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

“N-AVD is well tolerated and is currently a frontline standard-of-care option for patients with ASHL in the US,” said ASH session co-moderator Michele Stanchina, DO, a hematologist-oncologist and assistant professor at the University of Miami/Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, in an interview with Medscape Medical News. “However, considering the 5-year follow-up data of the HD21 trial, I think we will also start to see more clinicians utilizing the BrECADD regimen in the US in the future.”

“For many years, the standard of care for ASHL was based on the RATHL trial, where newly diagnosed patients were given two cycles of ABVD [doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine] and then underwent interim PET-CT restaging. Patients with a positive interim PET-CT were then given eBEACOPP,” Stanchina explained.

However, eBEACOPP is linked to many adverse effects, she said, and the US moved toward AVD-based regimens. Meanwhile, a German study group designed BrECADD as a better alternative to eBEACOPP, she said.

In the extended S1826 trial, 970 patients comprised the modified intention-to-treat cohort. During his presentation, Herrera, the study's lead author, shared data for multiple age groups:

• In adolescents, PFS was 93% for N-AVD vs 82% for BV-AVD.

• In adults aged 18-60 years, PFS rates were 91% and 85%, respectively. 

• In adults older than 60 years, there was a “marked difference” with PFS rates of 82% and 58%, respectively.

“The overall survival data are not yet mature,” Herrera cautioned, but at 3-year follow-up, there were 15 deaths in the BV-AVD arm and eight in the N-AVD arm. 

In an interview with Medscape Medical News, co-author Jonathan W. Friedberg, MD, MMSc, director of the Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, said that with now more than 3 years of median follow-up, the hazard ratios remain the same, and over 90% of patients treated with N-AVD remain alive and disease-free.

He said N-AVD is cheaper than BV-AVD and doesn't require growth factors. The FDA has not yet approved the therapy, but “as N-AVD is listed as a category 1 recommendation in NCCN [National Comprehensive Cancer Network] guidelines, insurance coverage is generally not an issue,” he continued.

In his presentation of the HD21 results, lead author Ferdinandus said BrECADD “offers an excellent long-term efficacy and tolerability profile, supporting its role as a preferred frontline treatment regimen within a PET-adapted treatment strategy.”

Ferdinandus told Medscape Medical News in an interview that the difference in PFS between BrECADD (94%) and eBEACOPP (91%) is “clinically meaningful in a disease where every relapse may require intensive salvage therapy or transplantation.”

“For patients, the major impact is twofold: first, a higher chance of being cured with first-line therapy, and a lower risk of serious long-term toxicities, including infertility and therapy-associated AML/MDS [acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes],” Ferdinandus said.

As for cost, brentuximab vedotin increases the upfront drug costs vs eBEACOPP. “However, BrECADD may reduce overall healthcare costs by preventing fertility loss, lowering long-term complication rates, and avoiding costs associated with relapse,” he noted.

In regard to availability, BrECADD is not FDA-approved, and “we do not have information on the current status or timing of a regulatory submission,” he said.

Takeda funded the HD21 study. The National Cancer Institute and Bristol Myers Squibb funded the S1826 study.

Herrera reported having relationships with Regeneron, Lilly, Allogene, AstraZeneca, Caribou, Seagen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Adicet Bio, ADC, Karyopharm, Tubulis, Merck, Takeda, AbbVie, City of Hope, Genmab, Kite, Genentech, and Gilead.

Ferdinandus reported having relationships with Roche, Takeda, and Pfizer. Friedberg reported having no disclosures.

Other study authors reported having various relationships. Stanchina reported having a relationship with Pfizer.

The FDA has approved amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj (Rybrevant Faspro, Johnson & Johnson), a subcutaneous formulation of the bispecific antibody amivantamab (Rybrevant), for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The subcutaneous version carries the same indications as the intravenous (IV) formulation, which include first- and second-line combination treatment of patients with EGFR-aberrant advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as well as a monotherapy indication after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy.

The shot reduces administration time from hours to minutes and is far more convenient for patients and providers, Johnson & Johnson said in a press release.

Approval was based on the PALOMA-3 trial. A total of 418 patients with previously treated EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomized equally to either the IV or subcutaneous formulations in combination with lazertinib (Lazcluze).

Pharmacokinetics were similar or better with the subcutaneous version, and there were no differences in overall response rates or progression-free survival. However, 65% of patients in the subcutaneous arm were alive at 12 months compared with 51% percent of those in the IV arm, according to Johnson & Johnson.

There were also fewer systemic administration reactions with the subcutaneous vs IV formulation (13% vs 66%) and fewer venous thromboembolisms (11% vs 18%), according to the company.

Labeling warns of hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions, interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis, venous thromboembolic events with concomitant use of lazertinib, dermatologic adverse reactions, ocular toxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Dosing with either formulation is weight-based and dependent on indication. Rybrevant Faspro pricing was unavailable at press time.

Hybrid health options are an underdeveloped, key tool for improving access to primary care in Ontario's remote communities, with a new University of Ottawa study highlighting the positive impact of in-person mixed with virtual care options have in rural regions.

Published in BMC Health Services Research, this first peer-reviewed study of such services in rural Ontario examined the experiences and challenges of clinicians and non-clinical staff within a hybrid primary care program in Renfrew County, Ontario.

The findings by Dr. Jonathan Fitzsimon and his team coupled with previous studies support the scale and spread of a hybrid approach, which could alleviate challenges like staff recruitment and retention, and equitable care access for patients, including more comprehensive, team-based primary care.

Hybrid care is an effective, complementary approach to recruiting providers in underserved areas and serves as an additional mechanism to help counter the inverse care law, where regions with the greatest healthcare needs often have the least access to services. And evidence suggests virtual care is well accepted by patients and providers, producing clinical outcomes comparable to those of traditional, in-person models.""

Dr. Jonathan Fitzsimon, uOttawa's Department of Family Medicine

Researchers spoke with staff working at the Petawawa Centennial Family Health Centre – the largest county in Ontario. They also consulted Integrated Virtual Care (IVC) staff, including physicians, interprofessional health providers (IHPs), and non-clinical personnel, who predominantly found that IVC played a positive, impactful role for residents who are struggling to access primary care due to a lack of available physicians.

""In (large city)], if [patients] can't see you, they can go to the walk-in clinic next door. But it's not the case in rural settings,"" one physician explained. ""Having this rewarding job that I can actually provide care to people who actually need care, and they can't access it properly.""

While physicians found meaning by contributing to this underserved community, strong in-person support is also essential for success, particularly as increased administrative demands followed. Despite some onboarding challenges and added logistical complexity, the program served approximately 1,500 patients, individuals who otherwise would have lacked access to consistent primary care, a number that has expanded significantly since then.

""From a policy perspective, IVC is an innovative approach to address the challenge of recruiting physicians in more rural communities,"" write Dr. Fitzsimon and his co-authors, Shawna Cronin (uOttawa), Kush Patel (uOttawa) and Antoine St-Amant (Institut du Savoir Montfort).

The Ontario government also recently announced it is investing nearly $2 billion to connect people to a publicly funded family doctor or primary care team within four years.

""These findings, and future evaluation findings may be relevant when considering alternative physician compensation and employment models. In addition, considering the health human resource supply of IHPs, particularly Nurse Practitioners, is an important consideration for future potential expansion,"" they add.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a vaccination-preventable illness that has been on the rise in the United States. Following a several-year lull during the pandemic, cases of whooping cough rose sixfold in 2024 and remain high. As of Dec. 6, data show more than 26,600 U.S. cases reported this year, fewer than in the comparable period in 2024 but over four times higher than for all of 2023, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC reports that ""preliminary case report numbers [of pertussis] remain elevated in 2025 compared to immediately before the pandemic."" In some states, one must go back decades to find cases of whooping cough as high as those documented since 2020. The 1,475 cases in Oregon as of Dec. 10 surpassed ""the previous annual record of 1,420 cases set in 1950,"" according to The Oregonian. Kentucky, which had not registered any infant whooping cough deaths since 2018, experienced its third this year, according to Kentucky officials and cited by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), at the University of Minnesota.

As cases rise, a nationally representative panel survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania finds that many in the public remain unfamiliar with symptoms of the disease. Almost a third of respondents (30%) are not sure whether pertussis is the same as whooping cough (it is) and more than a third (35%) are not sure whether a vaccine exists to prevent it (it does). Both findings, from a survey of 1,637 U.S. adults conducted Nov. 17-Dec. 1, 2025, are statistically unchanged from an APPC survey on whooping cough a year earlier, in November 2024.

There is widespread agreement about the causes and risks of whooping cough.

""The outbreaks are fueled by falling vaccination rates, fading immunity, and delays in public health tracking systems, according to interviews with state and federal health officials,"" CBS News reported in mid-November 2025. ""Babies too young to be fully vaccinated are most at risk.""

The CDC recommends two combination vaccines to protect against whooping cough or pertussis, both of which have been shown in safety reviews to be safe and effective. The Tdap vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis), for children seven and older and adults, is specifically recommended for preteens (at 11-12 years old); for pregnant women during the 27th-36th weeks of pregnancy; and for other adults who have not received the vaccine. The DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis) is recommended in a five-injection series for young children – babies at 2, 4, and 6 months; at 15-18 months; and between 4 and 6 years old.

The MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella, is colloquially referred to as the measles vaccine. Instead of speaking about the DTaP and Tdap vaccines and using the unfamiliar term 'pertussis,' public health communicators should reiterate that our best defense against whooping cough is the whooping cough vaccine.""

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, APPC Director 

Although most people know that a vaccine exists to prevent whooping cough, there are many who do not. The survey shows a statistically significant drop in those who say a vaccine to protect against whooping cough exists (57% vs. 63% in 2023).

The CDC recommends vaccination for everyone against whooping cough, which is spread by coughing or sneezing. The illness may first resemble a common cold but can produce ""rapid, violent, and uncontrolled coughing fits"" a week to two weeks after symptoms appear. People who are vaccinated may still get whooping cough but generally have a milder illness.

The vast majority of U.S. adults (83%) say they would be likely to recommend that a child age 11 to 12 years old in their household or an adult in their family who is due for their 10-year booster get a Tdap vaccine, according to the survey. And over three-quarters (77%) say they think the Tdap vaccine is effective at offering protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, although 17% are unsure. Just 13% say they are worried that they or someone in their family will contract whooping cough in the next three months.

Until infants reach two months old and can be vaccinated, their protection comes from their mothers' antibodies, which is why the CDC recommends that ""pregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy, preferably during the early part of the third trimester, to help protect the newborn from pertussis.""

Yet less than half of Americans (46%) say they would be likely to recommend that someone who is pregnant take the Tdap vaccine, according to a separate, August 2025 national panel survey of 1,699 adults conducted by APPC. This represents no change from 2023.

When asked in the current survey to choose between a series of definitions for a condition called pertussis, 6 in 10 adults (61%) correctly select whooping cough. Thirty percent, however, are not sure, and a small number (8%) say pertussis is something other than whooping cough.

Although the Tdap vaccine can be given to people from age 7 up, only half of Americans or less know which diseases Tdap protects against. When survey respondents are provided with a list of diseases and asked which ones the Tdap vaccine protects against, a third of respondents (35%) say they are not sure.

Just 43% of those surveyed selected pertussis or whooping cough, 48% selected diphtheria, and 53% selected tetanus, all correct. The vast majority of respondents rightly rejected several incorrect choices – 13% said Tdap protects against polio, 8% said pneumococcal disease such as pneumonia or meningitis, 1% chose Zika, and 1% selected dengue. In total, almost 3 in 10 people (28%) know all three diseases that the Tdap vaccine protects against and did not choose the incorrect options.

Many in the U.S. public lack familiarity with the symptoms of whooping cough. When survey respondents are shown a list of symptoms and asked which are for whooping cough, the only one widely recognized (77%) is coughing fits. However, the number who know this has decreased significantly from 83% in 2024. These coughing fits are often followed by a distinctive ""whoop"" sound when someone gasps for air.

This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in respondents who say they are not sure of the symptoms (21% vs. 14% in 2024). Low-grade fever is correctly selected as a symptom by 44%; vomiting after coughing fits by 29%; and runny nose by 27%. Under a third of respondents selected symptoms that are not associated with whooping cough: 31% incorrectly chose headache and 30% incorrectly chose chills.

Fewer than half of those surveyed (44%) think that a healthy adult who got whooping cough would be likely to experience moderate (34%) or severe (10%) symptoms. This is a significant drop compared to 2024 when (49%) thought that a healthy adult suffering from the disease would experience moderate (34%) or severe (15%) symptoms. In the current survey, 23% think the adult would experience mild symptoms, and 33% are not sure.

The survey data come from the 26th wave of a nationally representative panel of 1,637 U.S. adults conducted for the Annenberg Public Policy Center by SSRS, an independent market research company. Most have been empaneled since April 2021. This wave of the Annenberg Science and Public Health Knowledge (ASAPH) survey was fielded Nov. 17-Dec. 1, 2025. The margin of sampling error (MOE) is ± 3.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All figures are rounded to the nearest whole number and may not add to 100%. Combined subcategories may not add to totals in the topline and text due to rounding.

The Ns2b-Ns3 protease plays a crucial role in replicating the dengue virus, yet no effective treatment has been found to completely block its activity and prevent viral replication.

To address this, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and in vitro studies to identify potential antiviral compounds. Our research revealed three promising compounds that successfully bound to key sites on the protease, offering new avenues for inhibiting dengue virus infection.

A pharmacophore model was employed to guide the screening process, and a threshold of 55 was set for the pharmacophore fit.

Following this criterion, three compounds emerged as top candidates, having successfully met the specified threshold and demonstrating a strong alignment with the pharmacophore model.

Alveolar macrophages are immune cells that live in the tiny air sacs of the lungs. Under normal conditions, these cells act as guardians, keeping the lungs healthy, supporting breathing, and preventing unnecessary immune responses.

However, new work led by Prof. Bart Lambrecht and Prof. Martin Guilliams (both VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research) shows that during allergic reactions, these macrophages can undergo a dramatic change. Instead of calming the immune system, they switch into an inflammatory mode that actively fuels allergy-driven lung inflammation.

Alveolar macrophages have long been seen as peacekeepers in the lung. Our results show that during allergic responses, they can do the opposite and actually help drive inflammation.""

Stijn Verwaerde (VIB-UGent), MD, PhD student, and first author of the study

Using an advanced mouse model that allowed the researchers to precisely track and manipulate these lung cells, the team discovered that allergen exposure causes alveolar macrophages to send out signals that attract other immune cells into the lung. This influx amplifies inflammation and worsens allergic reactions. Remarkably, the macrophages were also found to fuse together into large 'giant cells' that change the structure of the lung tissue during allergy.

These findings challenge the long-standing view that alveolar macrophages are stable cells that resist change. Instead, the study reveals that they are surprisingly flexible and can be reprogrammed by their environment, sometimes with harmful consequences.

The discovery has important implications for understanding allergic lung diseases such as asthma. Current treatments mainly target other immune cells or inflammatory molecules. By identifying alveolar macrophages as active drivers of allergic inflammation, the study opens new avenues for research into therapies that could prevent or reverse their harmful switch, potentially reducing inflammation while preserving essential lung function.

Together, the results offer a new perspective on how allergic reactions escalate in the lung and highlight the complex, double-edged role of immune cells that are essential for health-but, under the wrong conditions, can contribute to disease.

An estimated 5-15% of people have problems with dry eyes, with symptoms including eye redness, stinging, or burning sensation, and eye fatigue. Dry eye disease (DED) occurs when the eyes' tear glands produce insufficient or poor-quality tears which can be due to allergy or autoimmune disease, hormonal changes, aging, etc. When left untreated, DED can increase the risk of eye infections and abrasion damage to the ocular surface, which may impair vision. 

 A process called autophagy, which is needed to clear up a cell's interior from damaged proteins etc., is thought to be compromised in tear glands of people with DED. To understand the connection between DED and autophagy and to potentially open up new therapeutic avenues, Sovan Sarkar and his team from the University of Birmingham, UK, have generated tear gland organoids from stem cells, 3D structures resembling human tear glands. The work was recently published in Stem Cell Reports. These organoids contained the different cell types which build up human tear glands and made tear proteins required for eye lubrification and for the prevention of infections. Interestingly, when autophagy was disabled in the organoids using a genetic tool, the cellular composition of the organoids was disrupted, the secretion of tear proteins was reduced, and cell death was increased. Pharmacological intervention with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or melatonin had a beneficial effect in this model and helped to prevent cell death and to restore tear protein secretion in the autophagy-deficient organoids.

Autophagy is essential for proper tissue development and organ function. Here, we provide genetic evidence that autophagy is required for glandular tissue development by using autophagy-deficient human embryonic stem cells to generate tear glands with developmental and functional defects.""

Sovan Sarkar, University of Birmingham, UK

This new human stem cell-based tear gland model will be an accessible tool to study tear gland function and how it can be modulated to prevent or treat DED.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic took a heavy toll on human life and health beginning in 2020. Though the severity of the pandemic has faded, its long-term sequelae continue to plague hundreds of thousands of survivors.

A recent study published in the journal PLoS Computational Biology examines the genes underlying the risk for long COVID, using multi-omics tools.

Long COVID affects millions with diverse lingering symptoms

Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), also known as long COVID, refers to persistent or new symptoms that occur following infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It affects up to 20 % of people who contract this infection, even in subclinical form.

However, the reported prevalence varies because of the different definitions issued by various organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

Long COVID symptoms include neurological (brain fog, headache, memory issues), respiratory (breathing difficulty, chest tightness, reduced exercise capability), musculoskeletal (persistent severe tiredness, myalgia, joint pain), cardiovascular (chest pain, fast heartbeat, fluctuating blood pressure), and inflammatory symptoms (swollen lymph nodes, low-grade fever).

Known risk factors for long COVID include sex, age, and the presence of pre-existing disease. However, the genetic underpinnings are unclear, motivating the current study. Such knowledge would help develop more accurate diagnostics and inform future personalized therapies for this widespread condition.

The current study used a customized multi-omics platform that combines two analytical methods: one to identify potential genes associated with long COVID, and the other to identify network “driver” genes that exert control over disease-related biological pathways.

The computational platform comprised multiple types of biological data and mathematical methods that together form a comprehensive framework to analyze the genetic causes of long COVID.

The methods used in this integrated approach included:

The authors integrated these to form a combined score for each gene:

Final Score=α⋅(TWMR score)+(1−α)⋅(CT score)

Where the parameter α allows users to balance the contribution of direct causal inference versus network controllability.

The study identified 32 candidate genes as likely to cause long COVID. Of these, 19 have been reported by earlier researchers, lending support to the current study. Meanwhile, 13 were identified for the first time, and require further study. This array of genes is involved in the host response to the virus, the ability of the virus to cause cancerous changes in cells, and the regulation of the host immune response and cell cycle.

Using enrichment analyses, it became clear that the same set of genes was involved in long COVID, as in autoimmune and connective tissue disorders, and in certain syndromes and metabolic conditions. This explains why the former presents with such diverse symptoms.

The scientists classified the causal genes by their expression profiles to identify three subtypes of long COVID. These had different symptoms, varied underlying disease pathways, and different clinical features.

The researchers developed a free, open-source app on the Shiny framework to enable other users to study, search, and analyze their data freely, using their own filters and parameters. This can be used to generate lists of putative causal genes using either Mendelian randomization or control theory. It also assists in reproducing the findings of the current study.

The strengths of this study include the combination of causal inference via MR with network control theory, thereby capturing both the direct effects of causal gene expression and the effects of perturbations at control points on the entire system. Secondly, the use of multi-omics data makes it superior to a study based on only a single type of data.

Moreover, gene discovery was accompanied by the identification of disease subtypes, making it clinically relevant, and the development of an interactive user tool. The Shiny app allows users to find more data by determining how much focus they want on either direct causal genes or the effect of regulatory control on the network.

“This integrative framework highlights novel causal mechanisms and therapeutic targets, advancing precision medicine strategies for Long COVID,” the authors conclude, while emphasizing that these findings provide a foundation for future research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","How diabetes medications may influence cancer risk and progression","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251218/How-diabetes-medications-may-influence-cancer-risk-and-progression.aspx","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 02:10:00 GMT","

Diabetes, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), has been linked to an increased risk of various cancers, including liver, colorectal, and breast cancer. While glycemic control and weight management are crucial in managing diabetes, emerging evidence suggests these factors alone are insufficient to explain the full impact on cancer risk. This has prompted an exploration into how anti-diabetic medications might influence cancer beyond their role in controlling blood sugar and body weight. By addressing this gap, researchers aim to better understand how these medications could potentially offer benefits or pose risks in the context of cancer prevention and treatment. Given these challenges, further studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms involved.Published (DOI: 10.1093/pcmedi/pbaf028) on December 10, 2025, in Precision Clinical Medicine, this review article explores the impact of anti-diabetic medications on cancer, moving beyond the conventional focus on glycemic control and weight management. The research, conducted by experts at Peking University People's Hospital, examines how medications like metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists might alter cancer progression through various biological pathways, offering new insights into the complex relationship between diabetes treatments and cancer outcomes.The review systematically examines the preclinical and clinical evidence linking anti-diabetic medications to cancer. Metformin, one of the most widely used anti-diabetic drugs, is shown to influence cancer through various mechanisms, including enhancing anti-cancer immunity and inhibiting tumor growth by affecting the tumor microenvironment (TME). It also modifies the activity of key cancer-related pathways like AMPK, mTOR, and PI3K/AKT, which are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Similarly, other medications like SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown potential in altering cancer cell proliferation, reducing inflammation, and promoting apoptosis. However, their effects vary depending on the type of cancer and specific drug used. For example, while metformin has shown promise in reducing the risk of colorectal and liver cancers, its effects on breast cancer remain inconclusive. Furthermore, the review highlights the importance of considering individual medications and their specific mechanisms of action, as well as the need for further clinical trials to confirm these findings and explore their therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.According to Dr. Linong Ji, one of the leading researchers in this field, ""While anti-diabetic medications are crucial in managing diabetes, their broader effects on cancer are still not fully understood. This review sheds light on the intricate mechanisms through which these drugs may influence cancer progression. However, the evidence is mixed, and we must continue to investigate the long-term impacts of these medications in cancer patients, as well as the potential for developing targeted therapies based on these findings.""The findings from this review underscore the importance of personalized medicine in treating diabetic patients with cancer. Understanding the specific ways anti-diabetic medications influence cancer progression could lead to better-targeted treatments, improving both cancer prevention and patient outcomes. This research also paves the way for future clinical trials to explore how existing medications can be optimized for cancer therapy or used as adjuncts to conventional treatments. The role of medications like metformin in cancer prevention could also inform public health strategies, particularly in managing diabetes and related comorbidities in populations at higher risk for cancer.

A study by Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals researchers has overturned long-held assumptions about why more cancer patients don't enroll in clinical trials that could potentially save their lives.

They found that financial factors-not race or demographics-are the strongest predictors of participation in cancer research studies.

Clinical trials save lives, but financial barriers prevent too many patients from participating. Addressing the real-world costs patients face, like transportation, childcare and lost wages, can make trials more equitable and ensure advances in cancer care benefit everyone.""

Weichuan Dong, adjunct assistant professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine & Houston Methodist

The study, recently published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, analyzed more than 12,000 cancer patients' electronic health records from University Hospitals in Northeast Ohio. The researchers learned that income, property ownership and financial stability were the most powerful factors determining enrollment in clinical trials.

Clinical trials are research studies involving people to test new ways to prevent, detect or treat diseases that, when successful, can be lifesaving. Yet only one in five cancer patients participate, according to the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The low participation rate means breakthrough treatments take longer to reach patients, and underserved communities often miss out on cutting-edge care.

""Conversations about clinical trial enrollment often focus on education and trust, but in clinical practice, we see very practical barriers,"" said Richard Hoehn, co-author and assistant professor of Surgical Oncology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. ""For many patients, participation comes down to logistics and money. Addressing those challenges is one of the most direct ways to make trials more inclusive.""

Instead of focusing solely on demographic factors, the researchers advocate for structural solutions that address the financial realities patients face: Reimbursement programs for travel and lodging expenses, compensation for lost wages during treatment, childcare assistance for parents in trials and transportation vouchers or services.

The team is now expanding the work, integrating clinical trial data from Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals and MetroHealth with the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System, the state cancer registry.

""This larger study, expected to be published in early 2026, will provide the first comprehensive map of clinical trial enrollment among cancer patients-identifying where structural barriers prevent access to potentially life-saving treatments,"" Dong said. ""We're working to map 'clinical trial deserts' and understand how geographic and structural barriers influence access across urban, suburban and rural communities.""

Feeding babies peanut-containing foods as early as possible can help prevent peanut allergy, but a new study published in JAMA Network Open found that parents need more support to get it right. Interviews with parents revealed widespread confusion about the purpose, risks, and timing of early peanut introduction guidelines.

""While some parents we talked to understood correctly that starting their baby on peanut foods trains the immune system in order to prevent the development of peanut allergy, other parents mistakenly believed that the purpose is to test if their baby is allergic – a misconception that fueled fears of severe allergic reaction, leading to hesitation and delays in peanut introduction,"" said lead author Waheeda Samady, MD, a hospital-based pediatrician at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

""For prevention of peanut allergy, timing and consistency are of the essence,"" she said. ""We encourage peanut introduction as soon as the baby starts eating solids, before or around 6 months of age. It's also important to continue peanut exposure twice a week through the first year and into toddler years. Feeding babies peanut foods just once or twice is not enough.""

Early peanut introduction guidelines were issued in 2017 following groundbreaking research showing over 80% reduction in peanut allergy development. Peanut allergy affects approximately 2% of U.S. children and is the least likely food allergy to be outgrown, making prevention through early introduction an important public health strategy.

Dr. Samady and colleagues analyzed 49 interviews with Chicago parents of infants aged 8-13 months from diverse backgrounds. Participants were recruited from primary care academic clinics, federally qualified health centers and private clinics.

Researchers also found that parents mostly did not understand that eczema places their baby at high risk for developing food allergy, making early peanut introduction even more critical.

If a baby has eczema, peanut introduction should start early, around 4 months of age, if possible, to maximize peanut allergy prevention coupled with good skincare. Pediatricians need to reinforce this message, given that most parents we interviewed were not aware that eczema increases the baby's chances of developing food allergies.""

Waheeda Samady, MD, Lead Author

In the study, parents reported that pediatricians were their primary source of information about early peanut introduction.

""Pediatricians are key to successful guideline implementation, but they need better resources for families to provide comprehensive information during busy well-child visits,"" Dr. Samady noted. ""Overall, we found that parents are accepting of early peanut introduction, but they need clearer guidance and more support.""

Dr. Samady emphasized that improved messaging and resources for families should clarify that early peanut introduction prevents peanut allergy through regular dietary exposure, address the connection between eczema and food allergy risk, provide specific guidance on timing and frequency, and reassure parents about the low risk of severe allergic reactions in infants.

""Parents need to be reassured that if their baby is allergic to peanut, they may see hives, some swelling, or vomiting, but allergic reactions in infancy are usually mild,"" she explained. ""We should empower parents with information and action plans so this does not stop them from participating in early peanut introduction.""

Fertility rates in much of Sub-Saharan Africa remain high, despite declining child mortality and improved access to contraceptives and female education - factors that generally lead to smaller families and improved economic conditions in developing countries. A new study from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign looks at men's and women's desired fertility in rural Tanzania, gauging some of the factors that influence how many children they want. 

This conversation about fertility preferences is very important to the demographic transition of Sub-Saharan Africa. Families may adopt family planning practices in the short term, yet still plan to have more children in the long term, presenting a puzzle for researchers and policy makers.""

Catalina Herrera Almanza, corresponding author, assistant professor, Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, Illinois

She co-authored the study with Aine Seitz McCarthy, associate professor of economics at Lewis & Clark College.

""There is evidence that people in poor, rural areas are having large families because they want to, not because they don't have enough access to contraception. For households that depend on agricultural labor, wanting more children can make economic sense,"" McCarthy said. ""Men typically want more children than women, but we found that the husband's preferences can strongly influence their wife's.""

The researchers evaluated the results of a 15-month family planning program for rural households in Tanzania's Meatu district, conducted in partnership with the country's Ministry of Health and the Meatu District Hospital. Local women were trained to provide education on birth spacing, the safety of contraceptives, and free birth control options available from public dispensaries.

The study followed 515 households in 12 villages, randomly assigned to one of three groups: joint consultations for couples, individual consultations for wives only, and a control group. Before and after the program, each spouse was asked privately and separately by a person of their own gender how many additional children they wanted.

Participants were, on average, 37 years old for men and 30 for women, and already had five children. Before the intervention, 89% of women were not using contraception.

""The program triggered the opportunity for these men and women to learn about their spouse's fertility preferences. Most of them had never talked about it before - about two-thirds of couples had never discussed how many children they wanted,"" Herrera Almanza said.

The researchers found that men, on average, wanted 4 more children, while women would like 2.4. However, after participating in the couples consultations, both spouses' fertility preferences increased. After the joint counseling, husbands desired an additional 0.77 children, while there were no differences for men who did not receive counseling.

Women who participated in joint counseling increased their desired fertility by 1.6 children. In contrast, women in the individual group reported lower desired fertility after the program. Furthermore, women in the couples' group overestimated their husbands' desire for more children after the consultations, while this was not the case for the individual group.

The researchers found the results were driven by women in polygamous marriages, which was nearly a third of the sample.

""In polygamy, this can be strategic behavior where women want children because there is no old-age security, and land inheritance follows the sons. A wife with more children might be able to claim more resources,"" Herrera Almanza said.

Older women were also more likely to increase their fertility preferences, perhaps reflecting a strategic desire to have as many children as possible while they can. 

The researchers speculated that power imbalances in the relationship might influence the result, causing women to say they want more children simply to appease their husbands.

""This increase in desired additional fertility might seem to be 'cheap talk' that may not be backed up by actual desire to increase your fertility. For example, women who are in a domestic violence situation may be fearful and therefore be willing to go along with what their husbands are saying. However, we didn't find any evidence of that being the case. If anything, women who are more empowered in their household were more likely to increase their fertility preferences,"" Herrera Almanza said.

People were overall very responsive to learning about contraceptives, but they want to use them to space their children out, not to have fewer children. 

This is aligned with the policy of Tanzania's Ministry of Health in Tanzania, which recommends spacing children two years apart to improve the health of both babies and mothers.

Many countries in Africa have a large proportion of young people, and this leads to policy discussions about addressing the demographic dividend by delaying the first birth for young women and men, so they can be more productive. Teen pregnancy is high, which decreases the chances of completing high school, Herrera Almanza explained. 

The study highlights the dichotomy between uptake in contraceptives and preference for large families.

""If the policy goal is to address the women's desired fertility and have healthier birth spacing, then it would make more sense to have joint family planning consultations, but to avoid asking couples about the number of children they want, and allow those discussions to happen more organically,"" McCarthy said.

While this study only measured fertility preferences, the researchers are in the process of conducting follow-up interviews with participants, and preliminary results suggest that women are having the children they indicated they would.

To date, more than 100 clinical trials with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived products have been initiated worldwide and an increasing number of potential hPSC-derived clinical products have entered early developmental pipelines. For off-the-shelf (allogeneic) products, the identification and selection of the right hPSC line early on during this process is of utmost importance as failure to do so may delay or completely stall product development. While developers acknowledge the importance of this issue, a comprehensive, accessible listing of globally available hPSC lines to inform cell line selection for clinical use has been elusive until now. 

To address this knowledge gap, Tenneille Ludwig, WiCell Research Institute, and Melissa Carpenter, Carpenter Consulting Corporation, have screened the scientific literature, websites, and gathered information from hPSC manufacturers to identify 166 hPSC lines for use in clinical applications which are currently available from 18 global distributors. Critical details about those cell lines including informed consent procedures, donor sex, blood and HLA type, quality standards applied, and modalities for licencing and distribution were compiled into a paper published today in the journal Stem Cell Reports. This unique resource will guide researchers and developers in selecting the optimal cell line for their specific needs with the goal to drive hPSC-derived products towards the clinic.

As antibiotic-resistant infections rise and are projected to cause up to 10 million deaths per year by 2050, scientists are looking to bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, as an alternative. A new study shows how these phages use a tiny RNA molecule, called PreS, to hijack bacterial cells and boost their own replication. By acting as a hidden genetic ""switch"" that rewires key bacterial genes, PreS helps the virus copy its DNA more efficiently, offering important insights that could guide the design of smarter phage-based therapies.

A new study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem reveals how viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages or ""phages,"" use a tiny piece of genetic material to hijack bacterial cells and make more copies of themselves.

The research shows that a very small RNA molecule, called PreS, acts like a hidden ""switch"" inside the bacterial cell. By flipping this switch, the virus can change how the bacterial cell works and push the infection forward.

Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest global health threats of our time. It is currently estimated that by 2050, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria could kill up to 10 million people every year worldwide. One promising alternative being developed is phage therapy, using viruses that specifically attack bacteria instead of relying only on antibiotics.

By uncovering how phages use tools like PreS to take control of bacterial cells, this study provides important basic knowledge that could help scientists design smarter, more effective phage treatments in the future.

The research team at the Hebrew University, led by Dr. Sahar Melamed, PhD student Aviezer Silverman, MSc student Raneem Nashef, and computational biologist Reut Wasserman, in collaboration with Prof. Ido Golding from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign discovered that the phage makes a small RNA molecule called PreS that acts as a molecular switch.

Until now, most phage research has focused on viral proteins. This study shows that phages also use RNA molecules to quickly reprogram the host cell after the bacterial genes have already been read and bacterial messages (mRNAs) were made, adding an extra layer of control during infection.

PreS attaches to these important bacterial messages and tweaks them in a way that helps the virus copy its DNA and move more efficiently toward the stage where new viruses are produced and burst out of the cell, killing the bacterium.

Using advanced methods to map RNA–RNA interactions (termed RIL-seq), the researchers found that one of PreS's key targets is a bacterial message that makes DnaN, a protein that plays a central role in copying DNA. By helping the cell make more DnaN, PreS gives the virus a strong head start in the infection process.

Interestingly, PreS works by changing the shape of the bacterial dnaN message.

Normally, part of this message is tightly folded, which makes it hard for the cell's protein-making machines (ribosomes) to access. PreS binds to this folded region, opens it up, and allows ribosomes to read and translate the message more efficiently.

The result: more DnaN protein, faster viral DNA copying, and a stronger infection. When the researchers removed PreS or disrupted the spot where it binds, the phage became weaker, multiplied more slowly, and its destructive phase was delayed.

This discovery is particularly striking because small RNAs have not traditionally been seen as major players in phage biology. Yet PreS is highly conserved in many related viruses, suggesting that phages may share a common ""toolkit"" of small RNAs that scientists are only beginning to uncover.

This small RNA gives the phage another layer of control. By regulating essential bacterial genes at exactly the right moment, the virus improves its chances of successful replication. What astonished us most is that phage lambda, one of the most intensively studied viruses for more than 75 years, still hides secrets. Discovering an unexpected RNA regulator in such a classic system suggests we have only grasped a single thread of what may be an entirely richer, more intricate tapestry of RNA-mediated control in phages.""

Dr. Sahar Melamed

Understanding how phages control bacterial cells is crucial for both basic science and future medical applications. As the world searches for solutions to antibiotic-resistant infections, phages are drawing growing interest as a targeted, flexible therapy.

Discoveries like PreS show that even the smallest viral molecules can have a big impact on whether an infection succeeds. In the long term, this knowledge could help researchers engineer phages that are safer, more predictable, and more powerful in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria.

High-throughput functional screening of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) accelerates antibody discovery, overcoming the slow, labor-intensive limitations of hybridoma and memory B cell screening, and capturing rare, high-affinity clones. Here, we present a new Xdrop protocol that enables rapid functional screening of plasma cells from immunized animals. 

With a throughput of over eight million droplets in a few minutes, Xdrop compartmentalizes single cells, along with the antibody discovery assay, inside FACS-compatible droplets. 

This approach preserves cell viability, detects secreted antibodies within droplets, and supports direct V(D)J repertoire analysis as well as recovery of antigen-specific cells. With a streamlined, same-day workflow, this method dramatically reduces discovery timelines and enhances the identification of functional antibody candidates.

From approximately one million CD138+ B cells screened per mouse, droplets with the strongest TNFα-specific signal yielded ~16,000 (Mouse A) and ~10,000 (Mouse B) sorted droplets (Table 1). V(D)J sequencing produced 2,510 and 1,153 paired sequences, corresponding to 739 and 432 clonotypes, respectively. This represents roughly one-third of each mouse's plasma cell pool, suggesting over 10,000 sequences could be obtained in total. 

Sequencing showed a clear enrichment of class-switched IgG plasma cells within the antigen-specific fraction, whereas the non-screened ASCs displayed a more mixed profile dominated by IgM (Figure 5). This pattern indicates that the screening method preferentially isolates mature, class-switched plasma cells that are likely to secrete high-affinity anti-TNFα antibodies.



Figure 6. Clonotype distribution plots. Each cluster represents a unique clonotype, with cluster size proportional to its relative frequency within the repertoire. Expanded clonotypes are represented by larger clusters concentrated toward the centre, whereas rare clonotypes appear as smaller symbols at the periphery. A. Enriched anti-hTNFα plasma cells from Mouse A and Mouse B display distinct clonotype repertoires. B. The Xdrop ASC screen enriches specific clonotypes shared with the unscreened population, while others remain dominant only in unscreened ASCs and are not enriched by the screen.

This study demonstrates a rapid, one-day workflow for screening and isolating targeted plasma cells based on their secreted antibody specificity, yielding thousands of high-quality V(D)J sequences.

The method effectively enriches for class-switched, antigen-specific clonotypes, enabling focused analysis of functional antibody repertoires. Based on the number of paired V(D)J sequences obtained, it is estimated that over 10,000 sequences can be acquired from the full plasma cell population of the two animals.

Leon Harris, 35, is intimately familiar with the devastation guns can inflict. Robbers shot him in the back nearly two decades ago, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. The bullet remains lodged in his spine.

""When you get shot,"" he said, ""you stop thinking about the future.""

He is anchored by his wife and child and faith. He once wanted to work as a forklift driver but has built a stable career in information technology. He finds camaraderie with other gunshot survivors and in advocacy.

Still, trauma remains lodged in his daily life. As gun violence surged in the shadows of the covid pandemic, it shook Harris' fragile sense of security. He moved his family out of Philadelphia to a leafy suburb in Delaware. But a nagging fear of crime persists.

Now he is thinking about buying a gun.

Harris is one of tens of thousands of Americans killed or injured each year by gun violence, a public health crisis that escalated in the pandemic and churns a new victim into a hospital emergency room every half hour.

Over the past two decades, the firearm industry has ramped up production and stepped up sales campaigns through social media influencers, conference presentations, and promotions. An industry trade group acknowledged that its traditional customer was ""pale, male and stale"" and in recent years began targeting Black people and other communities of color who are disproportionately victimized by gun violence.

The Trump administration has moved to reduce federal oversight of gun businesses, heralding a new era announced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as ""marked by transparency, accountability, and partnership with the firearms industry.""

The pain of gun violence crosses political, cultural, and geographic divides — but no group has suffered as much as Black people, such as Harris. They were nearly 14 times as likely to die by gun homicide than white people in 2021, researchers said, citing federal data. Black men and boys are 6% of the population but more than half of homicide victims.

Washington has offered little relief: Guns remain one of few consumer products the federal government does not regulate for health and safety.

""The politics of guns in the U.S. are so out of whack with proper priorities that should focus on health and safety and most fundamental rights to live,"" said attorney Jon Lowy, founder of Global Action on Gun Violence, who helped represent Mexico in an unsuccessful lawsuit against Smith & Wesson and other gunmakers that reached the Supreme Court. ""The U.S. allows and enables gun industry practices that would be totally unacceptable anywhere else in the world.""

KFF Health News undertook an examination of gun violence during the pandemic, a period when firearm deaths reached an all-time high. Reporters reviewed academic research, congressional reports, and hospital data and interviewed dozens of gun violence and public health experts, gun owners, and victims or their relatives.

The examination found that while public officials imposed restrictions intended to prevent covid's spread, politicians and regulators helped fuel gun sales — and another public health crisis.

As state and local governments shut down schools, advised residents to stay home, and closed gyms, theaters, malls, and other businesses to stop covid's spread, President Donald Trump kept gun stores open, deeming them essential businesses critical to the functioning of society.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to interview requests or answer questions about the Trump administration's efforts to reduce regulation of the firearm industry.

During the pandemic, the federal government gave firearm businesses and groups more than $150 million in financial assistance through the Paycheck Protection Program, even as some businesses reported brisk sales, according to an analysis from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group.

Federal officials said the program would keep people employed, but millions of dollars went to firearm companies that did not say whether it would save any jobs, the report said.

About 1 in 5 American households bought a gun during the first two years of the pandemic, including millions of first-time buyers, according to survey data from NORC at the University of Chicago.

Harris is keenly aware of what drives the demand.

""Guns aren't going away unless we get to the root of people's fears,"" he said.

Surveys show most Americans who own a gun feel it makes them safer. But public health data suggests that owning a gun doubles the risk of homicide and triples chances of suicide in a home.

""There's no evidence that guns provide an increase in protection,"" said Kelly Drane, research director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We have been told a fundamental lie.""

Less than a year into the pandemic, 20-year-old Jacquez Anlage was shot dead in a Jacksonville, Florida, apartment. Five years later, the killing remains unsolved.

His mother, Crystal Anlage, said she fell to her knees and wailed in grief on her lawn when police delivered the news.

She said Jacquez overcame years in the foster care system — living in 36 homes — before she and her husband, Matt, adopted him at age 16.

Jacquez Anlage had just moved into his own apartment when he was shot. He loved animals and wanted to become a veterinary technician. He was kind and loving, Crystal Anlage said, with the 6-foot-4, 215-pound physique of the football and basketball player he'd been.

""He was just getting to a point in life where he felt safe,"" Crystal Anlage said.

Gun violence researchers say parents like Crystal Anlage carry trauma that destroys their sense of security.

Anlage said she endures post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. She is terrified of guns and fireworks.

But she has made something meaningful of her son's killing: She co-founded the Jacksonville Survivors Foundation, which works to raise awareness about the impact of homicide and to support grieving parents.

""Jacquez's death can't be in vain,"" she said. ""I want his legacy to be love.""

His legacy and that of other young men killed by guns is muted by firearm manufacturers' powerful message of fear.

During the pandemic, gun marketers told Americans they needed firearms to defend themselves against criminals, protesters, unreliable cops, and racial and political unrest, according to a petition filed by gun control advocacy groups with the Federal Trade Commission.

In a since-deleted June 18, 2020, Instagram post from Lone Wolf Arms, an Idaho-based manufacturer, a protester is depicted being confronted by police officers in riot gear between the words ""Defund Police? Defend Yourself,"" the petition shows. The caption says, ""10% to 25% off demo guns and complete pistols.""

Impact Arms, an online gun seller, posted a picture on Instagram on Aug. 3, 2020, showing a person putting a rifle in a backpack, the document says. ""The world is pretty crazy right now,"" the caption reads. ""Not a bad idea to pack something more efficient than a handgun.""

The National Rifle Association in 2020 posted on YouTube a four-minute video of a Black woman holding a rifle and telling viewers they need a gun in the pandemic. ""You might be stockpiling up on food right now to get through this current crisis,"" she said, ""but if you aren't preparing to defend your property when everything goes wrong, you're really just stockpiling for somebody else.""

The messaging worked. Background checks for firearm sales soared 60% from 2019 to 2020, the year the federal government declared a public health emergency.

The same year, more than 45,000 Americans died from firearm violence, the highest number up till then. In 2021, the record was broken again.

Weapons sold at the beginning of the pandemic were more likely to wind up at crime scenes within a year than in any previous period, according to a report by Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee, citing ATF data.

Gun manufacturers ""used disturbing sales tactics"" following mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, ""while failing to take even basic steps to monitor the violence and destruction their products have unleashed,"" according to a separate memo released by congressional Democrats in July 2022 following a House Oversight and Reform Committee investigation of industry practices and profits.

The firearm industry has marketed ""to white supremacist and extremist organizations for years, playing on fears of government repression against gun owners and fomenting racial tensions,"" the House investigation said. ""The increase in racially motivated violence has also led to rising rates of gun ownership among Black Americans, allowing the industry to profit from both white supremacists and their targets.""

In 2024, then-President Joe Biden's Department of the Interior provided a $215,000 grant to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a leading firearm industry trade group, to help companies market guns to Black Americans.

The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for protecting consumers from deceptive and unfair business practices and has the power to take enforcement action. It issued warnings to companies that made unsubstantiated claims their products could prevent or treat covid, for instance.

But when families of gun violence victims, lawmakers, and advocacy groups asked the FTC in 2022, during Biden's term, to investigate how firearms were marketed to children, people of color, and groups that espouse white supremacy, officials did not announce any public action.

This summer, the National Shooting Sports Foundation pressed its case to the FTC and derided ""a coordinated 'lawfare' campaign"" that it said gun control groups have waged against ""constitutionally-protected firearm advertising.""

FTC spokesperson Mitchell Katz declined to comment, saying in an email that the agency does not acknowledge or deny the existence of investigations.

Serena Viswanathan, who retired as an FTC associate director in June, told KFF Health News that the agency lost at least a quarter of the staff in its advertising practices division after Trump came into office in January.

Gun companies Smith & Wesson, Lone Wolf Arms, and Impact Arms did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the National Shooting Sports Foundation or the NRA.

In an August 2022 social media post, Smith & Wesson President and CEO Mark Smith said gun manufacturers were being wrongly blamed by some politicians for the pandemic surge in violence, saying cities experiencing violent crime had ""promoted irresponsible, soft-on-crime policies that often treat criminals as victims and victims as criminals.""

He added, ""Some now seek to prohibit firearm manufacturers and supporters of the 2nd Amendment from advertising products in a manner designed to remind law-abiding citizens that they have a Constitutional right to bear arms in defense of themselves and their families.""

In 2015, the National Shooting Sports Foundation gathered supporters at a conference in Savannah, Georgia, and urged the firearm industry to diversify its customer base, according to a YouTube video and reports from Everytown for Gun Safety and the Violence Policy Center.

Competitive shooter Chris Cheng gave a presentation called ""Diversity: The Next Big Opportunity."" Screenshots from the conference include slides purporting to show ""demographics,"" ""psychographics,"" and ""technographics"" of Black and Hispanic shooters.

The slides described Black shooters as ""expressive and confident socially, in a crowd"" and ""less likely to be married and to be a college grad."" They said Hispanic shooters were ""much more trusting of advertising and celebrities.""

Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, said industry marketing shifted in the latter half of the 20th century as the popularity of hunting declined. The new sales pitch: guns for personal safety.

""They said, 'We need to break into new markets,'"" Suplina said. ""They identified women and people of color. They didn't have a lot of success until the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the death of George Floyd. The marketing says, 'You deserve the Second Amendment too.' They are selling the product as an antidote to fear and anxiety.""

Gun manufacturers were harshly criticized in the Oversight Committee's 2022 investigation for marketing products to people of color, as gun violence remains a leading cause of death for young Black and Latino men.

At the same time, some companies also promoted assault rifles to white supremacist groups who believe a race war is imminent, the investigation found. One company sold an AK-47-style rifle called the ""Big Igloo Aloha,"" a reference to an anti-government movement, it said.

Still, Philip Smith wants more Black people to get guns for protection.

Smith said he was working as a human resources consultant a decade ago when he got the idea to form the National African American Gun Association, which helped the National Shooting Sports Foundation compile its report on communicating with Black consumers.

Smith encourages Black people to buy firearms for self-defense and get proper training on how to use them.

After 10 years, Smith said, his group has about 45,000 members nationwide. Single members pay $39 a year and couples $59, which gives them access to discounts from the organization's corporate partners, including gunmakers, and raffles for gun giveaways, according to its website.

The police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin helped spark early interest from doctors, lawyers, and others in joining the group, he said. But interest took off during the pandemic, he said, even among Democrats who had resisted the idea of owning a gun.

""Hundreds of people called me and said, 'I don't agree with anything you're saying, but what kind of gun should I buy,'"" Smith recalled.

Smith, describing himself as ""quiet, nerdy, and Afrocentric,"" said criticism of guns misses the point.

""My ancestors bled for us to have this right,"" he said. ""Are there some racist white people? Yes. But we should buy guns because there is a need. No one is forcing us to buy guns.""

During the pandemic, gun violence took its greatest toll on racially segregated neighborhoods in places such as Philadelphia, where roughly 1 in 4 residents live in poverty.

A city report says a one-year period in the pandemic saw more than 2,300 shootings, or about six a day. Many of the cases haven't been solved by police.

City officials cited the boom in gun sales in the report: Fewer than 400,000 sales took place in Pennsylvania in 2000, but in 2020 it was more than 1 million.

Gun sales have dropped since the pandemic ended, but the harm they've caused persists.

At a conference last year inside the Eagles' football stadium, victims of firearm violence or their relatives joined activists to share accounts of near-death experiences and the grief of losing loved ones.

Paintings flanked the stage and the meeting space to commemorate people who had been fatally shot, nearly all young people of color, under messages such as ""You are loved and missed forever"" and ""Those we love never leave.""

Marion Wilson, a community activist, said he believes the nation has forgotten the suffering Philadelphia and other cities endured during the pandemic.

""We suffer from the disease of American amnesia,"" he said.

Harris was on his way home from a job at Burlington Coat Factory nearly two decades ago when robbers followed him from a bus stop and demanded money. He said he had none and was shot.

Harris had spent his early life fixing cars with his grandfather, when he wasn't at school or attending church. He remembers lying in a hospital bed, overcome with a sense of helplessness.

""I had to learn to feed myself again,"" he said. ""I was like a baby. I had to learn to sit up so I could use a wheelchair. The only way I got through it was my faith in God.""

Harris endured years of rehabilitation and counseling for PTSD. As someone in a wheelchair, he said, he sometimes fears for his safety — and a gun may be one of the few ways to protect himself and his family.

""I'm mulling it over,"" Harris said. ""I'm afraid of my trauma hurting someone else. That's the only reason I haven't gotten one yet.""

Evidence from Spain's regional reforms suggests that delaying legal access to alcohol can support adolescent well-being.

Study: Minimum legal drinking age and educational outcomes. Image credit: Daisy Daisy.Shutterstock.com

A recent study in the Journal of Health Economics explores the impact of minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) changes on educational outcomes for teenagers, using different implementation timelines across Spain's regions.

Alcohol use among European teenagers is notably higher than in other parts of the world. Nearly half of European adolescents aged 15 to 16 reported drinking alcohol in the past month, and 30 % engaged in at least one binge drinking episode during that time. In comparison, just 12 % of U.S. teens aged 14 to 17 drank alcohol, and only 6 % reported binge drinking over the same period.

To curb alcohol use among adolescents, many European governments have introduced measures such as higher alcohol taxes, stricter licensing regulations, and tighter advertising restrictions.

One of the most significant changes has been the widespread increase in the MLDA. Around the year 2000, most European countries set the MLDA at 16, which is much lower than the U.S. limit of 21. Over the past two decades, however, many European nations have raised the MLDA to 18, enacting broad reforms that limit minors' access to alcohol, restrict sales, and further regulate alcohol promotion.

Research shows adolescent alcohol use negatively impacts brain development, academic performance, and long-term outcomes. Young drinkers have reduced grey and white matter and are more likely to engage in risky behaviors that hinder learning and mental health.

Despite its importance, little empirical research has examined how MLDA laws affect educational outcomes, especially in Europe, where youth may be more vulnerable to alcohol's effects. Most studies focus on the US and show mixed results, suggesting European outcomes may differ due to cultural and legal differences and higher youth drinking rates.

This paper examines the impact of raising the MLDA from 16 to 18 on educational outcomes, using the staggered introduction of the law across Spanish regions. Before 1991, the MLDA nationwide was 16.

From 1991 to 2019, regions gradually raised the MLDA to 18, usually alongside restrictions on minors' access to alcohol venues and advertising, referred to as ‘MLDA changes'. The current study focuses on reforms from 2003 to 2019, when four regions (Castile and Leon, Galicia, Asturias, and the Balearic Islands) implemented MLDA increases.

This study used a difference-in-differences approach, which revealed medium-term educational effects and peer spillovers not captured by earlier US studies using regression discontinuity designs (RDD). Teenage alcohol and substance use were measured using Spain's High School Survey on Drug Use, a biennial, anonymous in-class survey of approximately 250,000 students from 2004 to 2021.

During this period, alcohol use was widespread among Spanish teenagers, with 60% of those aged 14 to 17 having consumed alcohol in the previous month, 34 % engaging in binge drinking, and 24 % experiencing intoxication. Additionally, 19 % reported memory loss after drinking, 15 % struggled to focus at school, and 33% had hangovers.

Information on educational outcomes was obtained from two sources. Academic performance was assessed using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a triennial OECD survey that used standardized tests and measured educational inputs, covering about 180,000 students from 2003 to 2022. Educational attainment was measured using the 2021 census, focusing on individuals born between 1987 and 2002 (approximately 600,000 people); 78 % completed secondary education, and 42 % attended or completed college.

The effect of MLDA changes was estimated using a difference-in-differences approach with wild bootstrap standard errors. After the MLDA rose to 18, it became modestly harder for underage youth to get alcohol. Fewer teenagers bought alcohol in bars, but the majority obtained it through adults. Parents' attitudes remained the same, but more young people saw heavy drinking as a problem.

The MLDA changes improved educational outcomes, raising average PISA scores by about 4 % of a standard deviation. The effect was stronger for children of highly educated parents, reflecting their greater reduction in alcohol use, although this was not statistically significant. However, these results were not explained by changes in school resources, class size, instructional hours, or student effort.

Long-term, the MLDA changes did not affect secondary school completion, but there was suggestive evidence of a small increase in college attendance. Raising the MLDA was also associated with modest improvements in mental-health–related outcomes, as less access to alcohol was associated with lower use of anxiety or sleep medications.

It must be noted that the MLDA increase did not significantly affect the use of other illegal substances, smoking, or cannabis. It also had no clear impact on teens' social lives or leisure activities such as going out, internet use, gaming, or sports.

Raising the MLDA from 16 to 18 in Spain led to a decrease in underage drinking, which was consistent across age, gender, and region.

Reductions in alcohol consumption were accompanied by improvements in academic performance and a decrease in the use of anxiety and sleep medications among teens. The findings suggest that, across Europe, stricter MLDA laws could effectively improve student outcomes at a relatively low cost.

Despite a no. 2 FIFA ranking, the USWNT didn't impress Guardian voters while the best USMNT player also gets snubbed

The world's second best women's national team according to FIFA Women's World Rankings features no players in the Guardian top 100 female footballers list in its top 20. In fact, the best American on the list is Emily Fox at no. 24. while eight other Americans join her. The no. 1 team, Spain, has five players in the top 10 and six in the top 20. Meanwhile, at no. 3 Germany has one player in the top 20 with England sitting in 4th with five players in the top 20. Clearly, FIFA has the USA much higher ranked than its talent level as the British publication demonstrated aptly.

The USWNT is in good company. Looking at the men's list the second best male team, Argentina, has just one player in the top 20. As the saying goes, second place is first loser and the defending World Cup champions join the defending Olympic gold medalists earning the distinction of FIFA not accurately ranking their talent levels as reflected by the British publication's list. As for the American men, no Americans made the list because Christian Pulisic is not as good at Antoine Griezmann who sits at no. 100.

On one hand, its difficult to argue with at least some of the implications of the list for the American women. The USWNT hasn't had a major international competition this year, the Champions League is more competitive than the NWSL where most of the USWNT plays, and a number of star players for the team did not play for significant parts of 2025. On the other, the voters were largely based in Europe and it does seem like there's some disconnect between the FIFA rankings and where Americans ranked in the Guardian list.

Outside of Pulisic, and possibly Antonee Robinson, it's difficult to gripe about the USMNT players' absence from the list. That assessment does suggest something about the team and how its talent measures up to the rest of the world. Quite simply, the American men have not caught up to the most competitive international teams.

To be sure, the side that will go to the World Cup in 2026 will be the most talented that has ever taken the field but they will have to play above their level to advance past sides they may face in the knockout rounds like Belgium, Spain, and France to reach the final. As far as expectations, beating any one of those teams in a World Cup would be the best showing in the tournament since 2002 and beating two would be historic.

For both teams, there is ground to cover for the USWNT to stay ahead of their competition and for the USMNT to catch up. At the very least, the lists convey a certain sentiment about the talent in the US program overall.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Tyler Adams knee injury: Is World Cup at risk for USMNT midfielder?","https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/tyler-adams-knee-injury-usmnt-bournemouth-midfielders-mcl-2026-world-cup/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:00 GMT","

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

After Tyler Adams was withdrawn only minutes into Bournemouth's 4-4 draw against Manchester United on Monday, Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola confirmed the worst. Adams suffered a torn MCL and could be out for around two to three months, which not only delivers a blow to Bournemouth, but could also put his participation in critical United States men's national team friendlies in March, facing Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, in doubt, and adds questions about his potential fitness for the World Cup itself. 

In his pre-match presser ahead of facing Burnley on Saturday, Iraola made it clear that losing Adams is a blow to the Cherries and it's something that may force a tactical rethink.

""We've had some experiences before with other players. Remembering Lewis Cook, [James] Tavernier. Normally two, three months. Two months, optimistic two months, pessimistic three, something like this,"" Iraola said. ""So, yes, it's a big blow. It's a big blow because it's an important player for us. But straight away, when you see the mechanism, the action, we were feeling that there could be something there. Yes.

""Tyler is very valuable for us. I think he's also a very unique player, very specific player in what he does. But we also have options. Alex [Scott] has been playing there as a number six. We have Lewis Cook, that is his natural position, and we recover him from the suspension. But it's true that he's a player that is difficult to replace because he's very, very unique,"" Iraola continued.

Those qualities are what have made Adams indispensable for club and country. Scott isn't a natural number six, and Cook is more of a possession number six than the defensive shield that Adams has been. He's also added a long shot to his game with two goals this season in 15 league appearances for Bournemouth. 

On the bright side, this injury isn't one that is currently set to keep Adams out of the 2026 World Cup, but that doesn't mean that there isn't reason for Mauricio Pochettino to be concerned as well. Adams captained the United States men's national team, and he'd likely be in the running to do the same in 2026 on home soil, if he can stay on the pitch that is.

Pochettino has now managed 22 games for the USMNT since taking over in September of 2024. Adams has only been available for 10 of them, missing time with various injuries. The Argentine has worked on a contingency plan due to the USMNT also not having another defensive midfielder of Adams' quality, and he has introduced a back three to cover the midfield while progressing the ball out wide.

A healthy Adams would give Pochettino tactical flexibility, being able to set up in a 4-2-3-1 against top teams without needing to worry about cover, but over the past few years, a healthy Adams has become more of a hope than an expectation. The heights of what the USMNT can do with him in the engine room were seein in 2022 durign a 0-0 draw with England as Adams marshalled the defense and with the World Cup on home soil, the hope is that he could help lead them past the round of 16 for the first time since 2002 when they were knocked out by Germany in the quarter finals of the tournament.

But to do that, Adams will need to be on the pitch, and after missing significant time since coming to the Premier League to join Leeds United, it's unknown if Adams will ever be 100% again. But some Adams on the pitch is better than none, and that's where his recovery and how his playing time in the spring will be critical in the buildup to the World Cup.

If Adams isn't 100% come the World Cup, then Pochettino will need to take a look at what his other options are in defensive midfield:

Weston McKennie: Despite being in and out of the USMNT and having his position shuffled from being a winger, a 10 or a box-to-box midfielder, McKennie is still atop the central midfield depth charts for the USMNT. Few players can bring the magic like McKennie when it comes to unleashing devastating passes or arriving in the box to head in a goal. Consistency has been an issue for the American over the years, but as his playing time with Juventus ramps back up, the expectation would be for McKennie to be back with the national team in March for the push toward the World Cup.

Tanner Tessmann: Growing as a player by the day at Lyon, Tessmann is likely the next man up as a defensive midfielder for the USMNT, but he's also been playing center back for the French side, which could make him valuable elsewhere in the World Cup squad. Tessmann's rise has been rapid since leaving Venezia for Lyon, and with the club taking part in the Europa League and pushing for a Champions League place in Ligue One, he's gaining experience that will translate to the heightened pressure of a World Cup on home soil.

Aidan Morris: There was a time when it seemed like Morris would be the next man up if anything were to happen to a player like Adams, but injuries have stunted his season, while Middlesbrough has also gone through a managerial shift during the season as Kim Hellberg has taken over for Michael Carrick. Boro are still reliant on Morris when he's healthy, but the rise of Tessmann and the uncertainty at the club has also pushed him down the USMNT depth chart.

Other players to consider: There's still a strong chance that Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan could start when the World Cup kicks off after his strong performances under Pochettino without McKennie, but no matter what, he's in a position to be a squad player for the USMNT as things kick off. Johnny Cardoso is another player who has struggled to stay healthy and break into the XI for Atletico Madrid, but if he does so ahead of the March international break, that's another player who could be an x-factor in the squad. Sebastian Berhalter has been the best player in the squad at set piece delivery, which needs to be taken into consideration, and while Yunus Musah is also struggling for playing time, given his talent level, there could be a conversation to have if he earns more playing time at Atalanta.

The U.S. men's national team's 2026 World Cup plans have taken a hit after news that captain Tyler Adams could miss up to three months of action with a knee injury,

Adams tore the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee during Bournemouth's 4–4 draw with Manchester United on Dec. 15, a match in which he left after just five minutes. 

“Tyler is injured. He has torn his MCL. So he will be out, definitely out for some time,” Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said at his press conference on Friday ahead of Saturday's Burnley match.

“Normally two, three months. Two months ... optimistic, pessimistic ... three, something like this. So, yes, it's a big blow. It's a big blow because it's an important player for us. But straight away, when you see the mechanism, the action, we were feeling that there could be something there.”

Adams suffered the injury after blocking a shot from Man Utd forward Matheus Cunha and was quickly attended to by medical staff, who ran initial tests on his knee on the pitch. He attempted to return to the match, but Iraola indicated after the game that further tests were needed. 

So far this Premier League season, Adams has enjoyed a stellar spell of form, scoring two goals across 15 matches. He recently became the first American to win the Premier League Goal of the Month award for his long-distance effort against Sunderland, which got the better of goalkeeper Robin Roefs.

One of the primary starting midfielders in USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino's plans, Adams could now miss vital time ahead of the World Cup. Yet, he should be on a timeline to be ready for the tournament, which the USMNT kicks off on June 12 in Los Angeles against Paraguay. 

The timeline, however,  puts him in doubt for two critical World Cup preparation friendlies against top-tier opposition, Belgium and Portugal, on March 28 and April 1, also on home soil. Without those matches, the USMNT will have at most two games against Senegal on May 31 and Germany on June 6 to reintegrate to Adams into midfield with the World Cup roster. 

Adams has been a regular for the USMNT since making his debut at the age of 18 and captained his country at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, starting four games as the team fell to the Netherlands in the Round of 16. His absence would be a significant blow to the hopes of a deep World Cup run.

RABAT, Morocco (AP) — Sébastien Haller, who led host nation Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations title in the last edition, has been ruled out of the tournament starting on Sunday because of injury.

The Ivorian Federation of Football said on social media on Friday that Haller will miss the event in Morocco because of an injury sustained while playing for Dutch team Utrecht. Haller reportedly injured his hamstring in a match against NAC Breda last Sunday.

He was to be replaced in the Ivorian squad by Aston Villa player Evann Guessand.

Haller missed the start of the 2023 Africa Cup because of an ankle injury but he returned to score winning goals against Congo in the semifinals and Nigeria in the final as the host team completed a remarkable turnaround after near elimination.

Haller became the team's hero one year after returning from cancer treatment.

Ivory Coast begins its title defense on Wednesday against Mozambique. Host Morocco plays the opening match against Comoros in Rabat on Sunday.

FC Bayern officially loses two world championship titles – a FIFA decision with far-reaching consequences. The reform of the Club World Cup means that previous titles will be re-evaluated. Munich are also affected

FC Bayern can no longer officially call themselves Club World Champions in future due to a fundamental reform of the FIFA Club World Cup, which has far-reaching consequences for all previous title holders – including the German record champions

With the introduction of the new FIFA Club World Cup in XXL format from 2025, the world governing body has made a historic change. In future, the competition will only be held every four years and will include 32 teams for the first time. As part of this reorientation, FIFA has reclassified all previous Club World Cup titles won between 2000 and 2023. The designation „Club World Champion“ will be withdrawn retroactively

This decision is particularly controversial for FC Bayern, who won the FIFA Club World Cup twice – in 2013 and 2020, both a few months after their Champions League triumph. According to FIFA statistics, these successes will no longer be considered world championship titles in future

Instead, all previous winners will now be listed as „FIFA Intercontinental Champions“. In doing so, the world governing body is formally moving the old Club World Cup to a new level and clearly separating it from the new competition, which was first played in 2025. Chelsea FC is the first official winner of this new Club World Cup and therefore, from FIFA's perspective, the first „real“ Club World Cup champion of the new era

With this renaming, FIFA wants to make it clear that the new Club World Cup is not seen as a further development, but as a completely new competition. In order to nevertheless maintain an annual international club title, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup was introduced at the same time. This competition effectively replaces the old Club World Cup on an annual basis

The winners of the six most important continental competitions take part in the Intercontinental Cup – including the UEFA Champions League, the Copa Libertadores and the Champions Leagues of the AFC, CAF, CONCACAF and OFC. Paris Saint-Germain won this title in 2025 and was therefore no longer awarded the title of world champion, but of intercontinental champion

The renaming is therefore less motivated by sporting considerations than a strategic decision by FIFA to clearly define and enhance the status of the new tournament

Formally, FC Bayern will lose two World Cup titles in the official FIFA count, but the Munich club will continue to list their successes as „FIFA Club World Cup Winners“ on their own club website

However, the World Cup triumphs of 1976 and 2001 remain unaffected. The World Cup was an independent competition between the Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners. However, in 2017 FIFA also retroactively awarded these winners the title of „Club World Champion“ – a decision that is at least called into question by the current reform

In addition to FC Bayern, almost all international heavyweights will be affected by the revocation: Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Liverpool FC, Manchester City and many others will lose their previous world champion status. In total, all Club World Cup winners between 2000 and 2023 will be affected

So far, neither FC Bayern nor other top clubs have publicly criticized the decision, but one thing is clear: the reform is causing discussions – not only about titles, but also about the sovereignty of interpretation in international club soccer.

World Cup

MetLife Stadium, shown here during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final, will host the 2026 World Cup final next summer Al Bello / Getty Images

The protests erupted over “unacceptable” £77 tickets. In 2016, when Liverpool announced new prices ranging from the equivalent of $13 to $110 for a seat at Anfield, fans united and voiced their disgust. A supporters committee called the pricing uptick “extremely disappointing” and “morally unjustifiable.” That weekend, around 10,000 fans walked out in the 77th minute of a match — and only after singing to the club's American owners: “Enough is enough, you greedy bastards!”

Advertisement

A few days later, the owners apologized “for the distress” and walked back the top ticket price to £59. Nine years later, their most expensive ticket, to see one of the planet's most popular sports teams, is £61 (or $82).

“I think [the 2016 uproar] scarred them,” Ian Ayre, Liverpool's then-CEO, says of his former bosses.

A decade later, Ayre's nascent MLS club, Nashville SC, sold tickets to a regular-season match against Inter Miami for hundreds of dollars. Was there any backlash?

“No,” Ayre told The Athletic. Season-ticket holders, he explained, already had their seats secured for a much lower price, and as for the rest: “I think people in this country, and in [U.S.] sports, are accepting that if you want the hottest ticket in town, it'll come at a price.”

The contrast — between an immoral £77 Liverpool ticket and an uncontroversial $170 ticket in Nashville's upper deck — highlights a dichotomy at the heart of a boiling dispute over 2026 World Cup ticket prices. British and European fans have called them “despicable” and “extortionate.” Some Americans have labeled them “exorbitant,” too, but many have simply conceded that, as former U.S. soccer star Landon Donovan said earlier this year, “sporting events are expensive, man.”

In fact, U.S. sports are more expensive than ever before. The price of attending an NFL or MLB game rose, on average, by around 300% from 1991 to 2023, according to the Fan Cost Index. The average NFL ticket now costs more than $300. The cheapest ticket to an average NFL game is around $169, per an Athletic analysis earlier this season — more than every single standard English Premier League ticket except those in the most expensive tier for the most appealing games at Arsenal.

The unparalleled costs are, in essence, FIFA's justification for its own World Cup prices. “The pricing model,” a FIFA spokesman told The Athletic in a statement, “reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts on a daily basis.”

The question is why? Why have ticket prices soared in the U.S. while remaining comparatively low in most of the United Kingdom, Europe and elsewhere?

The answer, experts say, ranges from demographics to economics, from capitalism to socialism, from laws to the historical foundations of the teams now charging the divergent prices.

“Any thoughtful analysis,” says Paul Beirne, a ticketing executive who worked in multiple North American sports and also at Brighton & Hove Albion in England, “needs to include a study of business culture and on-the-street culture, before you even start talking about ticket buying.”

In the U.S., the story of rising ticket prices is an economic one. The cost of everything has doubled since the 1990s. And income growth, on average, has outpaced inflation. Americans, in real terms, have essentially gotten 20% richer over the past few decades, and the richest Americans — the top 10% — are pulling away from the middle-class pack. This, economists theorize, ups their willingness to pay for tickets. “It is certainly the case,” says Lindsay Owens, executive director of the economic policy think tank Groundwork Collaborative, “that wealthier Americans are doing more in-person attendance at events.”

The U.S. population has also grown, from around 290 million in 2004 to nearly 350 million today. And in that time, neither the NFL, NBA nor MLB has added a team. Several teams, meanwhile, have actually built smaller stadiums (with more premium seats). Demand, therefore, has theoretically increased while supply (especially of cheap seats) has decreased.

“Putting all those things together, you might have expected pretty significant increases in ticket prices,” says Victor Matheson, an experienced sports economist and professor at College of the Holy Cross.

Ticket prices, though, rose more than twice as fast as the price of goods in the U.S. generally from 2000 to 2019, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Matheson agrees that the macro factors explain a majority, but not all, of the increase.

The rest of the explanation begins in or around 2009, when baseball's San Francisco Giants pioneered “dynamic pricing” in sports. The scheme — whereby prices are adjusted, either manually or automatically, based on actual or expected demand — has since become ubiquitous in major U.S. leagues, and has allowed teams to capitalize on Americans' growing willingness to pay. Decades ago, they'd set a price and affix a sign to a ticket box, and even the people willing to pay more would pay that fixed price. Now, there are models, algorithms and technology that allow them to raise prices if they (or computer software) sense that fans are actually willing to pay more.

So, they can milk the wealthiest 10% of Americans, who, according to one (disputed) analysis, now account for nearly 50% of the nation's consumption; but they can also lower the price of less desirable tickets when necessary.

The teams, Matheson says, “are extracting as much of that possible money out of as many people as possible.”

“And increasingly,” Owens argues, “many sports, live events, games, matches, are out of reach for many Americans.”

The games, in other words, are entertainment that must be bought and consumed; and the teams are businesses with a right to sell their product. Elsewhere around the world, however, they are viewed through a very different lens.

“Football clubs in the UK,” Ayre says, “and in other parts of Europe to some degree, are sort of like community assets.”

Liverpool, like Barcelona, Bayern Munich and most prominent football clubs, were founded over a century ago as genuine clubs with paying members. They were not, and mostly are not, “franchises” owned by billionaires. For decades, and in some cases still today, they were run by the members (or presidents elected by members), who doubled as fans and were not eager to charge themselves exorbitant ticket prices.

Advertisement

In the 1990s and 21st century especially, the clubs evolved into commercial entities, and football accelerated toward big business. But its roots, as a working-class sport that knit together neighborhoods or entire cities, have remained somewhat intact. Supporters, or socios, see themselves as the lifeblood of a club. They pass allegiances down from generation to generation. And if owners or executives try to turn them into a more significant part of the business?

They resist.

They organize protests or release fierce statements.

When, in 2024, 19 of 20 English Premier League clubs raised some ticket prices (albeit relatively modestly), the Football Supporters' Association, a nationwide group representing fans, launched a campaign branded “#StopExploitingLoyalty.” It wrote that “many fans have faced eye-watering price hikes,” and cited a 19% increase since COVID. “Anger has grown,” its statement said. Duncan Drasdo, CEO of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust, said at the time: “We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices. Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.”

Most clubs, therefore, have tiptoed into a middle ground between widespread unrest and maximum revenue. Pricing decisions, Beirne says, go all the way up to the owners or chairmen, whose reputations are at risk. From a business perspective, “there is absolutely value left on the table, 100%,” Ayre says — because there is overwhelming, unexploited demand. “However, philosophically and morally, I think the club and the owners feel, after several run-ins with fans, that the marginal difference they could achieve from additional ticketing revenue probably wouldn't — it might change the outcome of buying one more player, or paying a salary, but it's not transformational.”

So, prior to each season, English clubs set fixed prices by seat location and opponent, often with discounts for kids and seniors. Rather than ration a scarce resource based on a fan's ability to afford it, and rather than use dynamic pricing to maximize revenue, they offer tickets first to loyal members, and sometimes use lotteries when supply can't meet demand.

As a result, on the business side, soccer's biggest clubs make less than 20% of their revenue from ticket sales and other matchday revenue streams — whereas most U.S. teams generate more than 30% of their income from those sources, according to Sportico. (The main exception is NFL teams, which benefit from colossal national broadcast rights deals while only playing eight or nine home games per season.)

And on the supporters' side, while there is frustration, there is also persistent power and collective strength — and an expectation that commercialism won't corrupt these public trusts, or break what Ayre calls a club's “moral code.”

“You have a lot of teams in Europe that maybe haven't [meaningfully] raised prices in five years,” says Ted Glick, the Chicago Fire's chief ticketing officer, who previously worked in other U.S. leagues and then with multiple European football clubs while at Legends. “And so, fans get used to and conditioned to that. Whereas in the U.S., there's more the expectation that prices are going to grow with the rate of inflation, or there's going to be a new modern club or seating product that will be introduced that might slightly increase the cost of a ticket in that area — so on and so forth.”

Another piece of the puzzle, multiple sports business executives said, is resale laws. In many countries, there are restrictions on “scalping” or “touting” — buying a ticket and then reselling it on the secondary market. In the United States, there are essentially no such restrictions. In the UK, although touting certainly still occurs, there are systems to ensure that the vast majority of ticket buyers are the ones filling seats. In the U.S., thousands of tickets pop up on third-party resale sites.

The lack of regulation, in some sense, helps broaden access to tickets, because anyone, whether or not they're a member or loyal fan, can buy if they have the means. But it also encourages some people to buy tickets as an investment. It commodifies what fans in other parts of the world would see as a ritualistic or sacred experience. And it undercuts any U.S. team that tries to keep prices more affordable — because, if prices are well below “market value,” they tempt scalpers, who know they can scoop up tickets, or even buy season tickets, and resell them for profit.

Where doing so is restricted, such as in the UK, clubs can be reasonably confident that they'll reap the moral and long-term benefits of lower prices, which breed fan loyalty and goodwill.

In the U.S., where there are fewer guarantees, teams in established leagues have moved much quicker toward reaping the financial benefits of higher prices.

“I also think some of the league structures are a big piece of that,” Glick says. “In the U.S., sports leagues are closed leagues; there's not promotion and relegation, there's revenue sharing, there's a lot of collaboration, and there's a real expectation league-wide that every team needs to pull their weight and really fill stadiums and drive revenues. Versus in Europe, every team is singularly focused on their own stadium, their own venue” — and their relations with members.

MLS clubs, in a way, exist between the two extremes — in a country where high prices have become the norm, and with ticket sales integral to balanced budgets, but in a relatively young league with a need to build a loyal fan base. Glick, Ayre and others around the league speak about offering a variety of experiences at a variety of price points. Glick compares it with the airline industry, where you can pay for a cheap seat with no amenities or for a front-row seat and hospitality. A working-class family buys the former, a CEO buys the latter, and hardly anyone complains. “In a free market,” Ayre says, “the way MLS does its ticketing is very good.”

Its prices, overall, are far lower than the NFL's or NBA's, but they are dynamic. An Athletic analysis in late September pegged the price range for an average regular-season MLS game, excluding premium seating, at $48-$199 — whereas the average range in the Premier League, whose popularity dwarfs MLS, was roughly $55-$90.

Because in the end, MLS is an American league. “This,” as Ayre says, “is the land of opportunity. Things like dynamic pricing and other elements are more accepted here across all sports and other things like concerts.” It's a land where Taylor Swift and other artists can charge hundreds of dollars per ticket on tour. It's a land that every prominent soccer entity, from the Premier League to CONMEBOL, tries to exploit.

And now, “FIFA is anchoring to some of those markets,” Owens, the Groundwork Collaborative director, explains.

With $700 group-stage tickets and four-figure prices in the 2026 World Cup knockout rounds, “FIFA is making calculations that Americans have gotten used to this, and we are comfortable with rationing scarce resources based on ability to pay,” Owens adds.

And thus far — after 2 million tickets quickly sold in October and November, and after FIFA said it received 20 million applications for tickets over the first five days of the latest sales phase, even at the “extortionate” prices — one conclusion seems clear.

“Their calculation, that they could charge a lot for seats,” Owens says, “was in fact correct.”

RABAT, Morocco (AP) — The Africa Cup of Nations begins Sunday with host Morocco aiming to put on a spectacle befitting its quest to become a global soccer power.

The four-week tournament has been framed as a high-visibility dress rehearsal for the World Cup in 2030, when Morocco will be one of the main co-hosts, and the kingdom has embarked one of the most aggressive infrastructure programs in African sporting history to prepare.

Twenty-four teams from across the continent will compete in nine new or completely renovated stadiums in six cities. Morocco is among the favorites after its unprecedented run to the 2022 World Cup semifinals.

Defending champion Ivory Coast enjoyed a hardly believable run to the title as host last time out, and Nigeria will hope to go one better after losing the final.

Sadio Mané's Senegal is back again after winning the 2021 edition, and Egypt will hope speculation over Mohamed Salah's future does not distract the team from claiming a record-extending eighth continental crown.

Here's all you need to know about the 35th edition of the biennial tournament:

Guinea was initially scheduled to host the 2025 edition, but the West African country was stripped of the tournament in 2022 when the organizing Confederation of African Football determined the country would not have adequate infrastructure and facilities in place. Morocco, which was stripped of the tournament in 2015, offered to step in. Every Africa Cup since 2013 has been moved because of problems with the original host.

This tournament was initially meant to be played in the summer, but CAF agreed to postpone it so it wouldn't clash with FIFA's new Club World Cup competition.

CAF switched the Africa Cup to a summer schedule in 2017, effective from the 2019 tournament in Egypt. Then the 2021 tournament that was postponed a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic was switched to January because of the “unfavorable climatic conditions” during summer in host nation Cameroon.

Morocco, which won in 1976, is under pressure to claim what would be just its second Africa Cup title. The Atlas Lions begin their quest against tiny Comoros in the newly constructed 69,500-capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium on Sunday. Also in Group A are Mali and Zambia.

Group B sees a clash between Egypt and South Africa, which eliminated Morocco at the last edition, while Angola and Zimbabwe will hope to upset the favorites.

Nigeria will be expected to emerge from Group C, where the Super Eagles will face Tunisia, Uganda and Tanzania.

Senegal and Congo face off in Group D, alongside Benin and Botswana. Congo was only beaten by eventual winner Ivory Coast in the semifinals at the last edition.

Algeria is under pressure in Group E after a group-stage exit in the last edition. The Desert Foxes will face Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea and Sudan.

Group F sees a tussle between defending champion Ivory Coast and five-time champion Cameroon, whose preparations have been overshadowed by the firing of the coach amid a dispute with federation president Samuel Eto'o. Gabon and Mozambique complete the group.

Four-time winners Ghana didn't qualify.

The top two in each group and the four best third-place teams will progress to the knockout stage.

Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi's face beams from — it seems — every advertising display sign in Rabat. Time will tell if he recovers from an ankle injury to feature for the team.

Salah will be the focus of attention in the Egypt camp amid speculation he could leave Liverpool after he vented his frustrations at his lack of playing time there. The 33-year-old Salah has never won the Africa Cup, but he went close in 2017 and 2022 when Egypt reached the finals.

Victor Osimhen remains Nigeria's key player. The Galatasaray forward's absence through injuries is a big reason the Super Eagles did not qualify for next year's World Cup.

Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo will be key for Cameroon's hopes, and Yan Diomande is expected to sparkle for Ivory Coast after his brilliant start to the season for German club Leipzig.

The Africa Cup will be shown on beIN Sports in the United States and Canada. The Qatari broadcaster also holds rights to show the tournament in France and many other countries.

“AFCON is a fantastic international tournament that is only gaining greater recognition on the world footballing stage,” Richard Verow, beIN's chief sports officer, told The Associated Press. 

Channel 4 will show the tournament free-to-air in the United Kingdom, Movistar is showing it in Spain, Sportdigital will broadcast it in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and Sport Italia will show it in Italy.

CAF published a full list of European broadcasters on its website.

Fifa's marketplace is the only official channel for fans to resell World Cup tickets

World Cup 2026 ticket holders are owed thousands of pounds by Fifa for tickets they resold on the tournament's official marketplace, BBC Sport has found.

Fifa's terms indicate payment should be made within 60 calendar days of a transaction,, external but some people who sold tickets on the website in early October have still not received their money.

Fifa, which has come under criticism for its World Cup ticket pricing, declined to provide a statement explaining the delays.

BBC Sport understands the issues stem from Fifa needing to obtain additional bank details from those affected before payments can be processed.

The tickets in question were part of the pre-sale draw which ran for 10 days in September, when one million tickets were made available.

Only Visa cardholders were eligible to apply. It is not known how many fans in total have been affected by the issue.

England supporter Iain is owed nearly £650 for a ticket he sold 65 days ago for Canada's opening game in Toronto, money he had hoped to put towards England seats now the fixtures have been confirmed.

""Fifa are generating billions from this World Cup but can't seem to do basic payment processing on time,"" he said.

""The delay looks to be impacting many people.""

Fifa brings in new £45 ticket for 2026 World Cup

A Mexico fan, who did not want to be named, showed us evidence that he was owed more than £8,000 for sales that all took place over 60 days ago. 

""It sucks, they just seem to be fumbling around,"" he said.

""I've had to move money to pay off my credit card.""

Some of those impacted told BBC Sport they received an email last month from Fifa requesting bank details, despite earlier correspondence saying refunds would be made automatically to their original payment card.

Fifa's resale marketplace opened on 2 October, allowing most ticket holders to list their seats for the tournament at a price of their choosing. 

The governing body takes a 15% fee from both buyer and seller.

Although the main ticket ballot only opened on 11 December, some fans who secured seats in the earlier sales phase - before the World Cup draw was made - have already resold tickets on the platform.

At the same time, many tickets are also being listed on unofficial resale sites. 

Fifa has warned people against using third-party platforms, insisting its own marketplace ""is designed to protect from invalid or unauthorised resale"".

Earlier this week, Fifa announced it was introducing a small number of ""more affordable"" $60 (£45) tickets for all 104 matches at the tournament.

This followed criticism at the price of tickets, with the World Cup final costing up to £6,615.

FIFA's World Cup ticket prices were controversial last week Tasos Katopodis - FIFA via Getty Images

FIFA, world football's governing body, sparked controversy last week when it provided updated ticket prices for next summer's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

A leading European fans group called the prices a “betrayal”. Others opted for “despicable”.

The easy thing to do is to label it an act of opportunistic wealth-hoarding and, in step with that, a sign of both moral decay and the ceaseless pursuit of profit in the sport.

Advertisement

Yet FIFA is, by design, a non-profit organisation. It has no shareholders and is ‘owned' by its 211 constituent member associations. There is no one to pay dividends to; FIFA's own most recent annual report says the body ‘ploughs the vast majority of its revenue directly back into football, in line with its statutory objectives'.

Naturally, that leads us to wonder why it has chosen to bump up prices so significantly. Is it avarice or essential? Greed or need?

Getting a handle on FIFA's finances isn't the easiest, and not because they're particularly opaque about them. As a not-for-profit, it releases far more detail around expenditure than we're used to seeing from clubs, or indeed the member associations that collectively determine who to put in charge of the governing body.

Instead, it's because FIFA's financial model works in four-year cycles, each tethered to the flagship World Cup finals. In simple terms, FIFA loses big money in three years out of four and then, in every fourth year, offsets it (and beyond) with a massive surplus driven by the World Cup. In the 2019-22 cycle, FIFA's combined surplus was $1.187billion (£890m), with $2.368bn generated in 2022 on the back of the Qatar World Cup.



That was the second cycle running the organisation had banked a $1.2billion surplus, and successive cycles of doing so left FIFA with $3.971bn in reserves at the end of 2022. A further, albeit much smaller, surplus is forecast for the current cycle ending in 2026, which, if achieved, will tip reserves over the $4bn mark.

FIFA's operations are mammoth, so carrying noteworthy reserves is understandable. Yet $4billion is a big amount. Sources with an understanding of FIFA's operations, who asked to be kept anonymous to protect relationships, told The Athletic the governing body is keen to hold such large amounts of reserves in the event of force majeure occurrences.

Advertisement

An example of one of those came in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic brought the world to a stop. FIFA quickly moved to offer up to $1.5billion under its ‘Covid-19 Relief Plan'. Though the eventual amount doled out ended up being short of that figure, the offer itself was made possible by the organisation's hefty reserves pile.

If there were future disruptions, insufficient FIFA reserves would lead to national associations going bust. It is unclear at what point FIFA will deem reserves to be too high and become willing to accept an annual deficit if it means pumping more money into the game. Those same sources said FIFA's reserves position is “continuously reviewed” and the organisation has to take “a long-term view” of such matters.

Quite obviously, we can't know exactly what FIFA's finances will turn out like at the end of the ongoing 2023-26 cycle, but the budget put forth a few years ago was instructive.

In that, FIFA set itself the aim of generating $11billion in revenue, a figure that, at a meeting of the FIFA Council back in March 2024, president Gianni Infantino announced the body was already “well on track to exceed”.

That budget, agreed in 2023, did not account for FIFA's bumper new version of its Club World Cup, hosted across the U.S. in the summer. Its formulation led to a revised budget being approved at this year's FIFA Congress in May, with revenue and expenditure bumped up by $2billion in line with the Club World Cup being ‘financially neutral'. It means FIFA's budgeted revenues for 2023-26 are now $13bn, over $5.4bn (72 per cent) higher than the previous cycle.

Within those revenues, $3.097billion has been budgeted in income from hospitality rights and ticket sales. It comprises a more than $2bn increase on 2019-22, when Qatar World Cup ticket sales of $685.9million comprised over 70 per cent of income from hospitality and tickets.

Advertisement

A source with knowledge of FIFA's current budget, speaking anonymously as they did not have permission to discuss matters publicly, advised The Athletic that the historic split of income within that revenue stream is expected to continue. That means, if budgeted figures are achieved and tickets comprise around 70 per cent of the revenue line, FIFA will book over $2.1billion in ticketing revenue for the 2023-26 cycle.

That represents a more than tripling of ticket sales from the last four-year cycle, reflecting those high ticket prices, but it is also worth remembering there will be 40 more games in this summer's World Cup than the last, and games will generally be played in stadia with higher capacities than in Qatar.

Hospitality and ticketing income is budgeted to comprise 28 per cent of FIFA's 2023-26 revenue, more than double the proportion of previous cycles. Where in those past periods $1billion-plus surpluses were recorded, FIFA has budgeted for a much smaller $100m surplus in this cycle. It means less room for error in missing revenue targets.



The original 2023-26 budget highlighted hospitality sales as a driver in the increase, citing “the strategic model in operation, which has moved away from the rights-fee model, under which FIFA's hospitality services were outsourced”. In essence, FIFA had opted to bring those services in-house for the upcoming World Cup, recognising the “attractive hospitality features already embedded in the modern stadiums” that will host games next summer.

It seems strange, then, that in the revised budget, FIFA confirmed it had “reverted to a royalty model, with hospitality services outsourced”, even as that $3.097billion in budgeted income didn't change. If a primary factor driving the big increase from 2019-22 was bringing hospitality in-house, it is difficult to understand how that revenue number hasn't moved when that decision has since been reversed.

Advertisement

It is not the case, either, that no other revenue lines changed in the revised budget. Alongside the $2billion in revenue attributable to the Club World Cup, FIFA downgraded this cycle's licensing rights income by $269m, to $400m, a shortfall that was made up by upgrades in expected marketing revenues and miscellaneous other income.

That tracks to FIFA's 2023 accounts, where marketing income was $229million higher than budgeted that year. In 2024, marketing income was a further $167m better than budget. It stands to reason this excess is used to offset lost licensing income across the four-year cycle.

Yet, of further curiosity regarding that hospitality and ticketing revenue stream is that the return to outsourcing hospitality services was very much reflected on the expenditure side of the ledger.

In FIFA's original 2023-26 budget, hospitality costs for the 2026 World Cup were projected to hit $638million. At 17 per cent of the $3.839bn investment budget for the tournament, hospitality costs were the second-highest outgoing for FIFA, only trailing $896m in prize money and payments to the club benefits programme (CBP, which gives clubs a fee for their players participating in the tournament).

Yet in the revised budget approved this year, FIFA's hospitality costs for the World Cup had plummeted, down 94 per cent to just $36million. A return to outsourcing is always likely to reduce costs, but the expectation would be that revenue would diminish, too, as a third party would now assume its slice of the income. 

That it has not is perplexing. FIFA's budget does not break down the split of projected hospitality rights and ticketing income, so we can't see how much was attributable to each in either budget document. But if FIFA expects to retain the same level of income despite a return to outsourcing, one of two things must have changed: either the amounts expected to be generated from hospitality are far greater than previously thought, even with the royalty model (ie, outsourcing) restored, or budgeted income from ticket sales has increased. 

Advertisement

In response to queries from The Athletic about whether the unchanged revenue figure was because reduced hospitality takings were being made up through other means, FIFA did not provide an official response.

One source with knowledge of the matter, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, said that ticket sales were not compensating for any reduced revenues elsewhere, and that FIFA's aim was to “improve all sources of income, to then develop football further”.

The source also highlighted that, irrespective of ticket sales, FIFA's other revenues could be ahead of budget too, and results from 2023 and 2024 — like that impressive marketing income — bear that out. Across those two seasons, FIFA's net result before taxes and any financial income or costs was over $500million ahead of the original budget position. The implication is that high ticket prices were already baked into this cycle's projections.

FIFA takes in a huge amount of cash, but, obeying that not-for-profit ethos, it disburses an awful lot too.

That point was underlined this week, as the FIFA Council approved a record prize fund for nations competing in the upcoming World Cup. Across prize money, preparation money and the enhanced CBP, FIFA will pay out $1.082billion next summer, a $433m (and 67 per cent) increase on Qatar 2022.

In the revised budget for next year's World Cup, the extra $111million (now an extra $186m, following this week's announcement) allocated to participating nations and the clubs of their players was one of the main areas the $602m in hospitality cost savings were directed. The only budget line to see more allocated to it between the revised and original budgets was ‘Stadiums and training sites', meaning those to be used during the tournament. They were not mentioned in the original World Cup budget but are now slated to receive $201m in FIFA investment.

One of the defining aspects of Infantino's reign has been an increase in payments made to football's various associations. Since FIFA's ‘Forward Programme' replaced the ‘Financial Assistance Programme' (FAP) in place before Infantino's election, such payments have almost quadrupled, from $598million via FAP in the 2011-14 cycle to a budgeted $2.25bn in the current one.



All of which is to say that, while FIFA under Infantino is a revenue-generating juggernaut, it has also committed to making big payments beyond its own doors.

It is notable that in the revised 2023-26 budget, in-house salaries at FIFA were reduced by $61million and, while some internal budgets did receive extra funds, reallocated monies were overwhelmingly directed toward third parties like those mentioned above.

Whether FIFA needs the money that will inevitably flow from sky-high ticket prices is a matter for debate. Having already tweaked prices in response to the backlash, albeit for only a tiny tranche of tickets, there's evidently some scope for them to reduce takings. Running well ahead of budget in the first two years of this cycle hardly points to an organisation desperate for the cash.

At the same time, there's an argument that FIFA earning as much as it possibly can is good for football, provided the money goes where we are told it will. With FIFA's stated aim of recycling almost all of its income back into the game, more money for FIFA equals more for the sport. Already, we know next year will see record distributions to participating nations, clubs that release players for World Cup duty and for the multitude of associations that sit under FIFA's worldwide banner.

To underline the importance of those distributions, a FIFA spokesperson told The Athletic that “without FIFA's financial support, more than 50 per cent of FIFA's member associations could not operate.”

Separately, and as articulated already elsewhere, there's the argument that if FIFA didn't charge high prices, someone else would. The U.S.'s deregulated secondary market is catnip for touts and scalpers; better for FIFA to charge the prices at source and use it to further fund football.

Moreover, the U.S. really does represent a land of opportunity. Sports fans there will routinely pay more than their western European counterparts. It might leave a sour taste, but there's an argument that FIFA not cashing in when it can means not generating the most it possibly can to recycle back into the sport. It may be that the spiralling prices we're now seeing are a chance FIFA feels it would be ill-judged to pass up.

Echoing that sentiment, a FIFA spokesperson said: “The pricing model for FIFA World Cup 2026 reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events [in our host countries], soccer included. It is also a reflection of the secondary market for tickets, which has distinct legal treatment [in the United States].”

“We are focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing but also prospective fans.”

It may simply be that the governing body still needs the money to meet its commitments. Despite 2023 and 2024 running well ahead of forecast, the revised budget did not increase the expected surplus for 2023-26. More funds have been allocated to associations and clubs instead. Whether it would have been better to use any extra money to reduce ticket prices is open to debate; FIFA evidently opted not to.

FIFA under Infantino has proved a boon to football associations across the world, and promises need to be kept. We won't know the exact finances of the 2023-26 cycle until well into 2027, but that revised budget throws up intrigue.

Notwithstanding the reversion to an outsourced hospitality service having no impact on that revenue stream in the budget, signs point to high ticket prices for the next World Cup as always being a part of the financial plan.

Alongside an apparent desire to retain high levels of reserves, FIFA continues to promise to pay out big sums to member associations. It is a theme which shows little sign of changing — and it means, whether viewed as fair or not on fans, football's overarching governing body needs to take in as much revenue as it can muster.

White House aides asked that the trophy for the new Fifa Peace Prize created for Donald Trump should be as tall as the World Cup, sources have told this column.

It is understood that the US president's officials were consulted about both the glittering gold trophy and the ceremony where it was awarded to Trump before the World Cup draw by Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, this month. The Nobel Peace Prize winner only gets a medal, whereas Trump was given the trophy, a medal and a certificate by Fifa.

And for those who thought it was incongruous that two US marines should carry in the peace trophy, the original White House idea was that the soldiers should be next to Trump when he was presented with the award, but Fifa must have talked them out of it.

Meanwhile, Infantino's previous references to the draw venue as the Trump-Kennedy Cultural Center displayed remarkable insight — the name change from the John F Kennedy Center was only confirmed by the White House this Thursday.

The Times has approached both Fifa and the White House for comment, and also asked whether the trophy will remain with Trump permanently or whether he will return it at the end of the year. No response had been received at the time of publication.

Where does all the Fifa World Cup ticket money go? A not insignificant chunk will have gone on 500 officials from 211 countries being flown to Doha, Qatar, this week for a jamboree.

Infantino has more than tripled the number of committees from nine to more than 30, providing hundreds of new officials with generous per diems of $500 (about £375) when attending meetings, as well as business-class flights and five-star hotels. Fifa's bill for the “inaugural committee plenary session” is expected to be £3million.

Ironically, Infantino was part of a reform panel that reduced the number of standing committees before his 2016 election. Perhaps like his predecessor, Sepp Blatter, he realised that a bloated committee structure is a good way of handing out favours to the people who vote for him.

Russian influence in Olympic sports continues despite the country's ban from the Games, with shooting now caught up in claims of a vote-buying controversy involving an oligarch.

The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) has announced an independent investigation into the re-election of Alexander Ratner, a Russian-born German citizen, as president of the European Shooting Confederation.

His defeated opponent, Karoliina Nissinen of Finland, registered a complaint after Ratner promised in his manifesto that a Russian oligarch, Vladimir Lisin, would provide each of the 51 member nations €200,000 (€23.1million, about £20.2million, in total) if they extended his presidency.

Lisin was present at the vote in Armenia in October despite being forced to stand down as the ISSF president three years ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Ratner has denied any wrongdoing in an email, dismissing the claims of “a defeated candidate”. He said Lisin has been “the main and traditional sponsor of the European and international shooting sports for over 15 years”.

Nissinen objected to Ratner's offer, saying federations operating on an annual budget of as little as €50,000 per year were suddenly given a huge incentive to vote for him. She said in her complaint to the ISSF that Lisin had told her: “This is money I will give to whoever I want, to whoever I like, and to whoever supports my candidate.”

Oldham rugby league club decided to mark their 150th anniversary with a commemorative shirt saying “150 — Stronger Together” on the back.

Unfortunately, spelling was not the manufacturer's strong point and hundreds have been printed with the words “Stronger Toghether”. The club have told fans who have bought them as Christmas presents that they will replace them for free once correctly spelt versions arrive in the new year, but insiders say many supporters have chosen to buy the duds as a collector's item.

England's Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor are in the running to referee at the 2026 World Cup, having been chosen by Fifa to attend a seminar in March as part of the pre-selection process. France is the only other European country to have two referees selected.

Another English official, Chris Kavanagh, has been promoted to Uefa's elite referees group, having been in charge of a number of Champions League games.

New Jersey might charge its own congestion pricing toll to World Cup soccer fans driving to MetLife Stadium to see the finals next summer.

Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill said a Jersey congestion pricing toll is a possibility after talking to reporters at her second diner tour stop in Waldwick on Wednesday.

Sherrill, a Democrat won last month's election to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, responded to a comment from a radio reporter that a resident suggested New Jersey drivers should not pay New York's $9 congestion pricing fee to go to FIFA World Cup events in New York City. 

“Or people coming to our state from New York will pay us a congestion toll so they can enjoy the game,” Sherrill replied.

When asked if it's a possibility for the World Cup games, she said: “Yeah, certainly.” 

This isn't the first time a congestion pricing fee to enter New Jersey has been suggested after New York implemented a law passed in 2019 that led to the program that charges drivers a toll to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street and started on Jan. 5. 2025. 

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop proposed a reverse toll on New Yorkers in April 2019 that would exempt New Jersey residents. He included that idea in his 2023 transportation platform when he ran for the Democratic nomination for governor.

His 2023 plan would have charged a fee only to New York drivers coming to the state and dedicated those revenues to PATH and Light Rail improvements. Fulop lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to Sherrill in June 2025. 

There are few examples of highway tolls being charged for a specific event.

A toll agency in Washington State did the opposite on Dec. 11, when the Washington State Transportation Commission voted not to charge a $1 surcharge in addition to regular tolls to use the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle during the summer World Cup games. 

That idea was proposed by state lawmakers as a way to cover cost of handling additional traffic during the games in June and July. 

In 2024, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority wanted to charge the New York City Marathon organizers $750,000 to use the Verrazzano Narrows bridge. 

The charge was to make up for lost toll revenue and planned to limit runners to using the bridge's lower deck instead of both the upper and lower decks, the New York Times reported. 

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered the MTA to drop it. 

The MTA also tried to charge Bike New York, the organization that runs the annual Five Boro Bike Tour, a fee to use the bridge's lower level to compensate for lost tolls in March 2024. 

The reverse toll was mentioned after Sherrill was asked a question about New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani referring to the World Cup finals as a New York event. New Jersey and New York made a joint bid to FIFA to be host cities. 

“With all due respect, maybe he doesn't know where the games are going to be played because that's in New Jersey,” she said, adding the state is proud to host the games and the fan zone in Liberty State Park in Jersey City. 

“Governor-elect Sherrill is fully committed to hosting the most exciting and successful World Cup Final in history,” said Sean Higgins, a Sherrill spokesman. “And she is equally committed to ensuring that New Jersey sees as much benefit from our investment as possible, both to the state and to its residents.”

Sherrill, a former congresswoman, will take office Jan. 20.

In Cobb County, the Atlanta United Training facility will serve as a base camp. Teams will also train at Kennesaw State University and Paces Academy. FOX 5's Denise Dillon has more.

COBB COUNTY, Ga. - Some of the teams in the FIFA World Cup will be training in Cobb County, and county leaders are expecting big crowds as fans try to get a glimpse of their favorite players.  

""The more popular the team, the more crowds we can anticipate,"" said Cobb EMA Director Cassie Mazloom.

What they're saying:

The county says there will be extra public safety, transportation and emergency management needs.

To help with this, the county has applied for millions of dollars in federal grants, including one which would be used for training and overtime for personnel and another to enhance the county's ability to detect unauthorized drone activity.

""We really have to be conscientious in our planning, to make sure we're very detailed, to make sure we're ready to meet that demand from a public safety standpoint,"" said Cobb County Public Safety Director Mike Register.

The backstory:

Cobb has experience when it comes to large sporting events. The county hosted the MLB All-Star game this past summer at Truist Park.

""You look at MLB All Star week, it was a condense area, this is going to be spread out,"" said Register.

The international fans will add another twist.

""You're going to have fans from across the globe. Of course we have an international airport in Cobb County that we'll be addressing from a public safety standpoint,"" said Register.  

What's next:

Cobb leaders have already had numerous planning sessions with the local, state and federal partners to prepare for the FIFA World Cup.  There will be many more meetings before the World Cup. Cobb leaders say they'll be ready.

""I'm honored to be part of a county that will host FIFA. I'm looking forward to a very enjoyable, safe event,"" Register.

What we don't know:

Cobb County officials say they won't know which teams will be training in Cobb until March.

Ex-Tottenham midfielder posts Instagram update as free agent midfielder continues search for new club","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/dele-alli-comeback-pending-ex-tottenham-midfielder-instagram-update-free-agent-midfielder-search-new-club/blt996933466e222813","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 09:09:42 GMT","

Dele Alli has hinted that a return to the professional ranks may be pending, with the former Tottenham midfielder continuing his search for a new club. The ex-England international has been a free agent since seeing his contract at Serie A side Como terminated. He has been working on an individual fitness programme, allowing him to stay sharp while waiting on offers.

Dele saw his Italian job cut short in September 2025. He had stepped out of his comfort zone and left British shores late in 2024. Any hope of getting his career back on track while working under ex-Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona star Cesc Fabregas quickly faded.

Just one substitute appearance was taken in for Como, with that outing lasting less than 10 minutes after an unfortunate red card was collected against AC Milan. No more minutes were seen prior to his release.

Inevitable questions have been asked of what happens next for Dele. At 29 years of age, he should be at his peak. He has, however, seen virtually no game time since enduring more injury struggles during a forgettable loan spell at Turkish side Besiktas in 2023.

No extension was earned at Everton after taking in just 13 appearances for the Toffees, which dropped him into the free agent pool for the first time. With his Como adventure also turning into a disaster, Dele is considered to have made his way into the last-chance saloon.

Fellow former Spurs star Stephen Carr told GOAL recently: ""It's scary how he's fallen. He's only 29, just gone past being in his peak, but the amount of football he has played in the last few years is very low.

""It's very hard. It's no different to when you get injured, you do all the training and getting back fit takes time. He's missed a lot of football. The way he sounds, it seems he still has the hunger. But his chances are getting very slim now.""

Carr added on Dele having to earn another chance: ""Wherever he ends up, he isn't going to get to pick. It could be a trial where you have to prove it. It's whether he has the stomach for that. I've done it myself, going for a trial. For me, it didn't bother me. It's very difficult, it's a different situation.

""I don't know the lad, his personality or the people around him. He has fallen from grace dramatically. It's very difficult to get back in. I know your head says it, but his body won't be saying it because he hasn't played in so long and he's not used to it.""

Dele appears ready to embrace any opportunities that come his way. He has posted another picture on social media that shows him booted up and being put through his paces. A proven Premier League performer now needs the phone to ring.

It could be that he is offered a return to action in the EFL, allowing him to rebuild slowly. Following talk of interest from the likes of Wrexham, Birmingham and Swansea, ex-MK Dons striker Clinton Morrison told GOAL of Championship sides taking a punt: “If I'm a Championship manager or chairman, I'm looking to sign Dele Alli. I'm giving him the love that he needs, arm around the shoulder and say ‘you're going to be the main man here, we'll give you the game time'. You have got to get fit and earn the right, but when he is fit and flying there aren't many players that are as good as Dele Alli in the Championship.

""I do believe that he doesn't need to think about the Premier League and maybe take a step back to the Championship and play football there. Go and enjoy yourself. That's what you want, Dele Alli enjoying himself and playing with a smile on his face and showcasing his ability. We know he has got loads of ability and that's what you want from him.""

Dele has taken in close to 200 Premier League appearances over the course of his career, scoring 51 goals. He is a two-time PFA Young Player of the Year, with 37 senior England caps to his name, and was once linked with La Liga giants Real Madrid.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Why Man Utd vs Newcastle United is the only Premier League game on Boxing Day & the other games you can watch live on TV","https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-newcastle-premier-league-boxing-day-games-to-watch-live-on-tv/blt37a2f177091a1c23","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:07:30 GMT","

For the first time in the Premier League era, there is only one top-flight fixture scheduled for Boxing Day this season.

Whether or not there is any football on Christmas Day, a break from a century-old Boxing Day tradition in Premier League is something else. Normally, there is a full slate of English top tier football action on December 26, but for 2025/26 there is just one - Manchester United vs Newcastle United.

Amid all the fixtures from across various competitions on TV on Boxing Day, and while all other Premier League games from Matchweek 18 are instead spread across Saturday (December 27) and Sunday (December 28), GOAL looks at why it was necessary...

The Premier League intentionally scheduled just one match on December 26 — Manchester United vs Newcastle — due to wider fixture congestion and broadcast contract requirements.

To put it into context, with December 26 falling on a Friday and the league committed to 33 weekends of matches, plus the expanded European season, the only broadcast slot available that day went to the United–Newcastle match.

As a result, this season, only one Premier League match was scheduled for December 26.

Football fanatics need not fear, however, since there is still a plethora of matches on TV on Boxing Day 2026.

Liverpool fans can keep a close eye on Mohamed Salah at the Africa Cup of Nations, with Egypt vs South Africa live on Channel 4 at 3pm. There are three other AFCON games on TV on Boxing Day, with Angola vs Zimbabwe on at 12:30pm, Zambia vs Comoros on at 5:30pm and Morocco vs Mali on at 8pm.

Fans of Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham can watch their game against Sheffield United at 5:30pm live on Sky Sports Main Event. In fact, there is a whole slate of Championship action on Sky Sports+, including Birmingham City vs Derby County and Millwall vs Ipswich Town.

With just the United-Newcastle game on December 26 this season, Premier League has acknowledged this impacts a long-standing Boxing Day tradition in English football. However, the league has assured that when the date falls on a weekend in future seasons, more Boxing Day matches will return. So next season there will be more Premier League matches on Boxing Day – as the date falls on a Saturday.

Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has opened up on his turbulent spell at Old Trafford, revealing he rejected two opportunities to leave the club despite personal frustration and uncertainty around his future. The Portugal international admitted his time at United has not unfolded as he hoped, but insists his belief in winning trophies remains the driving force behind staying put.

Fernandes has revealed that he had two clear chances to leave United in recent years but chose to remain at the club. The Red Devils captain admitted that his spell at Old Trafford has not fully matched his personal ambitions, particularly in terms of silverware, yet he remains convinced that success is still possible.

The 31-year-old's comments come amid a challenging period for the club, following a dramatic draw with Bournemouth that left United sitting sixth in the Premier League. While there has been some improvement on last season's struggles, United are not competing in Europe and have already exited the Carabao Cup.

Despite the lack of multiple trophy avenues this season, Fernandes continues to see a future at United. The midfielder believes the club's long-term objectives still align with his own, which ultimately influenced his decision to reject offers and remain captain.

Fernandes explained that belief in Manchester United's ambition was decisive in his choice to stay, despite opportunities to leave. Speaking to Rio Ferdinand Presents, he said: ""Obviously, when I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hadn't told me our aim is still to get the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to being the club we were before.

""Because if that was not the aim, then, yes, I wouldn't have stayed here. But [it's] because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be, and where I want the club to be, and that's why I came to the club in the first place. So, if I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.""

The United captain also revealed that loyalty played a major role during difficult periods, when he was tempted by strong alternatives elsewhere: ""When I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was like in the toughest periods I had the club and I could have left two times. The club said, ‘No, we need you.' And I said, ‘Okay, you gave me something. I will give you something.'""

Fernandes admitted that personal disappointment remains, despite his commitment: ""Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because, obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and I could. But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important. When we struggled the most, I stayed present at the club.

""I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably won more trophies and [had more] people talking about me in a different way. Nowadays, people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.""

Fernandes' remarks underline the complicated nature of his United legacy. Since joining United from Sporting in 2020, he has been one of the club's most influential players, often carrying the creative burden during turbulent periods. His leadership qualities eventually earned him the captain's armband, further cementing his importance to the squad.

However, the midfielder has also been at the centre of speculation, particularly after reports that United were prepared to consider a major offer for him in the summer. That uncertainty was compounded by Fernandes' own admission that he felt disappointed some figures at the club were open to selling him.

Despite those tensions, Fernandes' statistical output and availability have remained crucial. Even in seasons of underachievement, he has consistently contributed goals and assists, reinforcing why successive managers have been reluctant to part ways with him during rebuilding phases. Fernandes has contributed to 103 goals and 93 assists in 307 appearances for the Red Devils.

Fernandes now turns his focus back to on-field matters as United prepare to face Aston Villa in the Premier League. With European qualification still within reach, the captain will be expected to lead by example during a decisive run of fixtures.

The FA Cup remains United's only realistic shot at silverware this season, and Fernandes' experience could prove vital as they look to progress when Brighton visit Old Trafford in January. Any trophy success would further validate his decision to stay. Beyond the immediate fixtures, Fernandes' future remains a key subplot.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Erling Haaland tipped to snub Real Madrid and Barcelona to spend entire career at Man City as 'old school' striker is backed to break more records at the Etihad","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/erling-haaland-snub-real-madrid-barcelona-entire-career-man-city-old-school-striker-records/blt869e31777383b0fb","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:38:37 GMT","

Erling Haaland is being tipped to snub any future interest from Real Madrid and Barcelona as he is already at a club that will allow him to land major silverware and smash countless records on the goalscoring front. Ex-Premier League forward Marlon Harewood has told GOAL why the prolific Norwegian is likely to honour an extraordinary 10-year contract at the Etihad Stadium.

That deal was signed in January 2025 and is intended to keep Haaland in his current surroundings until the summer of 2034. If those terms are seen through to a conclusion, then the most fearsome of frontmen will be preparing to turn 34 before another move is considered.

Having joined City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, it could be that he spends 12 memorable years in Manchester. If he were to do so, then the expectation is that the history books will be rewritten on a regular basis.

Haaland has already become the quickest player to 100 Premier League goals, requiring just 111 matches to reach that milestone. He has recorded 147 efforts in total for City through 168 appearances in all competitions.

His stunning 36-goal return for club and country this season has also helped Norway to qualify for the 2026 World Cup - their first appearance at FIFA's flagship event since 1998. Haaland is considered to be a special talent, one to rival the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the goal-getting stakes.

Quizzed on what makes Haaland stand out from the crowd, ex-Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Aston Villa striker Harewood - speaking in association with William Hill - told GOAL of a man that makes life as a Premier League frontman look remarkably easy: ""He definitely does. I love it. You miss those old school strikers. There are no strikers anymore. I have missed that as a striker myself. It has all been petering out, having one striker and then it's not really a battle. I miss the physicality of being against a centre-half and the battle of striker and defender - you win your duels. There has not been much of that. He is bringing that back, which I love.

""That's what it is all about - you are in a battle between striker and defender. The only way to stop him, I think defenders are trying to ruffle some feathers. But he loves that and that's what he thrives off. If you do that even more, he will score a hat-trick! He has been a breath of fresh air. I hope it continues because he can break records. He is one of those that you can see making history, especially the way he is playing and the team he is playing in. I miss the striker that he is because he is a bit of both - a bit of new generation and the old.""

Haaland's exploits are always going to draw admiring glances from afar, with La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid being credited with interest in securing his signature at some stage - with it possible that a fresh start away from English football will be sought.

Pressed on whether Haaland will see out a decade-long contract and smash every record going, Harewood added: ""I can't see why not. I can't see why he wouldn't stay either. The only places to go when you are talking about big clubs are Barcelona and Real Madrid, PSG. They are the only clubs that could afford him. He's at a very good club in Man City and I can see him staying there and breaking records.""

Haaland has already won two Premier League titles with City, the FA Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Champions League - with that continental crown forming part of a Treble triumph in his debut campaign of 2022-23.

He is also a two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner and Young Player of the Season in the English top-flight. He narrowly missed out to Argentine GOAT Messi in the 2023 Ballon d'Or vote, but is tipped to land a prestigious Golden Ball at some stage.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Bruno Fernandes criticism blasted as 'lazy' by ex-Man Utd star as Red Devils captain compared to Cristiano Ronaldo over doubters","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/bruno-fernandes-criticism-blasted-by-ex-man-utd-star-red-devils-captain-compared-cristiano-ronaldo/blt0873605d1a1b24b0","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:57:50 GMT","

Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha has come to the aid of Bruno Fernandes, saying the midfielder is only on the receiving end of “lazy” criticism because he is in the spotlight as the club's talisman. The Red Devils captain has been told he - like Portugal team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo - is an easy target for scorn because of his “enormous” contribution at Old Trafford.

Following a difficult start to the 2025-26 season, United have been in fine form in recent months under Ruben Amorim's stewardship. The 20-time champions are currently sixth in the Premier League and just two points outside of the Champions League places following a run of form which has seen them lose just one of their last 10 matches.

One man who has been key to United's rise up the table has been Fernandes, who has been back to his creative best this term. Leading by example, the 31-year-old is the league's current top assist provider with seven, while he has also found the back of the net on five occasions himself.

However, while Fernandes has been become one of the league's best performers since moving to United from Portuguese giants Sporting CP in 2020, he has come in for criticism from time to time.

A fiery character on the pitch, the former Sampdoria and Udinese has - at times - divided football fans with the way he communicates with his team-mates in the heat of battle. 

While some say Fernandes' arm-waving is a sign of his passion and never-say-die attitude, others feel he should opt for a calmer approach when United are under pressure.

Very much a part of the former, ex-United forward Saha has since defended Fernandes' intensity, saying it comes with the territory of being the club's main man.

In an interview with BOYLE Sports, Saha - who represented United between 2004 and 2008, winning four major honours - said: “Bruno Fernandes is always showing the tempo, showing the commitment, and showing class on a regular basis. 

“The kind of criticism this guy has been under just amazes me, it's a very cheap way to comment on football sometimes, just by claiming people should do this or do that.

“Comparisons between Fernandes and Roy Keane are understandable because he is the focal point of this team. We also saw that with Cristiano Ronaldo. They get criticism because of it, it's the lazy way to just comment on the focal point. Now we can see that the structure [at United] is better, he is thriving.

“That's why I think when you look at Bruno's contribution, it's just enormous, and it's not just about the numbers. It's his running, his intensity, and his capacity to sometimes show rage in his own way.”

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Saha's comments come after Fernandes revealed earlier in the week that he has turned down two opportunities to leave United in the past, such is his love for the club.

Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, he said: ”When I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was like in the toughest periods I had the club and I could have left two times. The club said, ‘No, we need you.' And I said, ‘Okay, you gave me something. I will give you something.'

“I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably won more trophies and [had more] people talking about me in a different way. Nowadays, people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.”

Fernandes and United face a stern test when they travel to high-flying Aston Villa in the league on Sunday afternoon. Unai Emery's men are currently third in the table, having won their last six top-flight fixtures.

Amorim's United will then round off 2025 with successive home games against Newcastle United and winless Wolves on Friday, 26 December and Tuesday, 30 December respectively.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Scott McTominay has received glowing praise from an unlikely source after Hollywood star Timothee Chalamet hailed the midfielder following his heroics in Scotland's successful World Cup-qualifying campaign. The Napoli ace scored a stunning overhead kick to help his country defeat Denmark and book their place at next summer's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

In search of a hero in their quest to qualify for their first World Cup in almost 30 years, McTominay stepped up for Scotland when they really needed him. With a packed-out Hampden Park bouncing on a cold, Tuesday night on 18 November, the 29-year-old inspired his nation to the perfect start with a remarkable bicycle kick inside three minutes.

However, that was just the beginning of what turned out to be a long, anxious rollercoaster for Scotland. After McTominay's Napoli team-mate Rasmus Hojlund equalised from the penalty spot for Denmark in the second half, Hearts striker Lawrence Shankland fired Scotland back in front after 78 minutes.

The home fans were not celebrating for too long, however, as Denmark left-back Patrick Dorgu levelled the affair just four minutes later. Needing another hero to step up in the dying embers of the game, Scotland received two, as both Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored in stoppage time, the latter doing so from his own half, as Steve Clarke's men reached their first World Cup since 1998.

Following McTominay's incredible contribution to Scotland's emotional victory, the former Manchester United man was lauded by his manager after the full-time whistle. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Clarke said: ""Scott McTominay scored the best overhead kick I've ever seen and it might not have been the best goal of the night!”

And when discussing the game as a whole, he added: “It was a lot of emotions. High and low. At times, you're looking for solutions and thinking how to change it. I knew at some stage we'd have to go two up front.

""I felt the Danes were dominating us a little. It seemed like a good time [to make the changes]. Whether they were 10 or 11 [men], we were going to do that.

""I spoke to Kieran (Tierney) before the first game. He's a key player for me, one of my men. I've got loads of them. Fourteen were involved in the play-off game.

""I'm not sure I envisioned the goal... but when it was rolling back to him on his left foot, I knew he would score.”

And just over a month after his overhead kick, McTominay is continuing to receive plenty of plaudits - although they are now starting to come from influential figures outside of football.

While he may have needed a brief breakdown of both a goal and a result he was clearly unaware of beforehand, two-time Oscar nominee Chalamet was soon full of praise for McTominay upon learning of his brilliant strike.

In an interview with the BBC, the Call Me By Your Name and A Complete Unknown actor - who is currently promoting his new film, ‘Marty Supreme', which releases in the United Kingdom on Boxing Day, described McTominay as “fantastic” when learning who scored Scotland's goals in their thrilling win.

After Chalamet was then told of McLean's miraculous effort from inside his own half, the 24-year-old told the BBC's Scottish reporter, Colin Paterson: “Fantastic, I will watch that (Scotland's 4-2 victory). Hey, good luck to you guys!”

After first getting his head around receiving praise from arguably the best male actor of his generation, McTominay will then be busy preparing for Napoli's return to Serie A action on Sunday. Antonio Conte's men, who are currently third in the table, travel to Jamie Vardy's Cremonese, who are 11th.

Meanwhile, Chalamet is a name to keep an eye out for when the nominations for the 98th Academy Awards are announced on Thursday, 22 January 2026. The American-French talent is being widely tipped to receive his third Oscar nod following his performance in Marty Supreme, where he plays an aspiring table tennis champion.

Iga Swiatek achieved a lot by winning Wimbledon this year—she became the first woman to win her first six Grand Slam finals since Monica Seles and the youngest woman to win Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces since Serena Williams, to name a few.But the way she won it was even rarer—in fact, it's never happened before, and it's very possible it will never happen again.By winning her semifinal match against Belinda Bencic, 6-2, 6-0, and her final match against Amanda Anisimova, 6-0, 6-0, she became the first tennis player ever—female or male—to reel off three bagel sets to finish off winning a Grand Slam singles title.

Two other players have finished off with two bagels.Dorothea Lambert Chambers won Wimbledon in 1911 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Dora Boothby, but that was when the Challenge Round format was in place, where the defending champion only had to play the final, so that was her only match of the event.And Steffi Graf won Roland Garros in 1988 with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Natasha Zvereva, but she had a much tougher battle in her semifinal match, defeating Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 7-6 (3).Swiatek is the only player ever to clinch a Grand Slam title with three bagels in a row, and she actually won her last 20 games in a row at the All England Club this year—from 4-2 in the first set against Bencic, she didn't lose another game the rest of the way.And that, tennis fans, is our No. 1 Stat of the Year for 2025.

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

Ferrari made a team decision to dedicate more resources to their 2026 challenger at an early stage of the 2025 season.

Charles Leclerc has admitted that, despite enduring a frustrating year with Ferrari, the decision to switch focus to 2026 was a “no-brainer” as the team quickly realised they would not be able to get involved in the 2025 title battle.

The Scuderia suffered their worst result since 2020 as they settled for P4 in the Constructors' Championship, dropping behind McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull and failing to win any Grands Prix.

Both Leclerc and Team Principal Fred Vasseur have explained that they became aware early on that they would not be able to fight on an equal standing with their rivals, so they chose to put more resources into next season, when the new regulations and car design are poised to shake up the competitive order.

This meant that while they could introduce mechanical upgrades throughout the year, they neglected aerodynamic development, forcing the Monegasque driver to extract as much as possible as their rivals continued to improve their cars.

Asked how significant the psychological burden was of knowing he would be at a technical disadvantage as the season progressed, Leclerc replied: “Well, not so much because we were at a technical disadvantage from the first race.

“So, it's not like it changed massively our approach to the season. And we saw it relatively quickly that we wouldn't be fighting for the world title because McLaren was too strong, Red Bull was obviously starting to make big gains, there wasn't much point in putting all our resources into trying to take the third or second place – if everything was going super well – in the Constructors', at the cost of next year, whichever cost it may be.

“So yeah, it's never something you want to do. I would have much preferred pushing the development the whole year to try and clinch that world title, 100%.

“But if you are in the position that we were in at the beginning of the year, I think it was kind of a no-brainer. So, I don't regret it.”

Despite the challenges, Leclerc delivered one pole position and seven podiums, leading to him taking P5 in the Drivers' Standings, albeit 77 points behind Mercedes' George Russell.

His team mate Lewis Hamilton had a similarly tough campaign with Ferrari as multiple Q1 exits frequently left him downbeat, while it was also his first season without a Grand Prix podium since he joined F1 back in 2007.

Prompted to elaborate on their troubles, Leclerc continued: “I think for us there's not only one reason. There are many reasons which, at different times, played a role. In the beginning of '22, we actually started off quite strongly, but we were struggling with porpoising, where Red Bull had a very stable platform.

“And they were actually quite a lot overweight, so as soon as they took off that weight, they were suddenly at the level where they've been since then. And then for last year, we focused very early on next year's car, which I hope is a bet that will be a winning one.

“But for sure, it has some influence from the last two thirds of the season where we've been struggling more than others because we didn't bring that many upgrades. But in general, it's just been a generation of car that was very, very difficult to understand.

“And what worked back at the factory – I think everybody has been surprised once or more times that when you bring it on track, it doesn't correlate exactly to what you were expecting from that part. And that was the challenge of it. And yeah, other teams did better, especially McLaren and Red Bull.”

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

F1.com sat down with one of Lando Norris' first teachers to reflect on how he went from a shy student to an F1 World Champion.

Lando Norris made his childhood dream a reality at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix when a hard-earned podium finish secured the 2025 F1 World Championship title. As well as the euphoria and relief felt by the McLaren driver, his family and his friends trackside, a quiet corner of Somerset, England – where Norris went to school – beamed with its own pride over the completion of a special journey…

Born in Bristol to British father Adam and Belgian mother Cisca on November 13, 1999, Norris spent his education at the nearby Millfield Prep School and Millfield School, where he carefully balanced studies with a developing karting career that took him across the UK and Europe through the 2000s and 2010s.

“Almost straight away he was coming back with trophies,” Dan Close, who taught Norris at the time and is now Millfield Prep School's Deputy Head of Operations, tells F1.com. “He was quite shy to begin with, and he didn't really want his trophies presented in assembly – maybe because they were taller than he was, thinking about these great big things in motor racing!

“Interestingly, one of Lando's Year 3 teachers wrote in one of his reports that if he didn't want to be presented for anything and wanted to remain anonymous, maybe he had a position as the ‘Stig' [on British motoring television show Top Gear]. That was when he was eight years old.

“Apart from that, he just got stuck into everything. He played some rugby, some hockey, some cricket, and he got involved in all the bits and pieces that go with school life.

“His family were very good as well, working with us in terms of him being away from school, and making sure he got all the work that he needed to catch up on, because obviously it's never a done deal that you're going to rise to the heights that he's risen to.

“His mum would often stay in Somerset while Lando and his dad were off doing their thing, and that's not easy, so I love the way that he was really thankful [after winning the title]. It's refreshing that it was also about other people, rather than all about himself, because he recognises that this is not something you can do alone.”

Indeed, what Close and his Millfield colleagues have taken plenty of satisfaction from is Norris never appearing to let the success – and fame that came with it – go to his head while he impressively worked his way through the motorsport ranks.

Norris went from karting World Champion in 2014 (a year before he left Millfield) to full-time McLaren F1 racer in 2019, via wins and titles in a host of single-seater championships, but Close sees the same person at the end of it all.

“I suppose what we're most proud of as a school is that Lando's remained authentic,” he adds. “It's one of our school values, to be authentic. He said he wanted to win the title his way, and we feel he has done that.

“He doesn't seem to have changed a bit, and again, I think a lot of that comes from his mum and dad. All four of their children have been through the school – his older brother and the two girls – and they've always kept them very grounded.

“The man we see on the F1 podium today has still got that sort of glint in his eye – and the cheeky smile – he had when he first joined us at school.

“He's just a good lad who never got arrogant about what he was doing. He always seemed to hide his light under a bushel, if anything, and didn't seek the limelight in that regard, but it's all paid off in the end.

“He's managed to live his dream, and that's how he came in at Millfield. His Year 3 teacher said, ‘When you're World Champion, I hope you remember who taught you!', and I'm sure that he's kept those values. We're just enormously proud of him.”

Due to the timing of the season finale and the latest school term ending, Millfield's community could not celebrate together when Norris crossed the line in Abu Dhabi and sealed the deal, but Close expects a suitable ceremony to be held in the New Year.

Not only will that landmark title be recognised, but also the trials and tribulations experienced along the way, as touched on by Close above and as spoken about by Norris at length in the past – from mental health struggles to the challenges that come with delivering under extreme pressure.

“As a community, we haven't really had a chance to reflect and celebrate, but I guarantee you that when we come back from the Christmas holiday, the first assembly of the year will centre on Lando and his achievements,” says Close.

“We'll talk about how he's had to be resilient and bounce back through the highs and lows, through the things that have gone right and the things that have gone wrong, along with the dedication and the perseverance, because it doesn't come without effort.

“I think that's the message that we'll pass on to the children. We've got a fine tradition at Millfield of producing some worldclass sporting people, as well as in other areas, but the one thing we often talk to the children about is coping with failure, understanding that you're going to learn from that, and that it's not the end of the world.

“If you're true to yourself, if you push on and you believe enough, that will help you part of the way, and then with a bit of talent and a few bits of luck, who knows?”

As for what else can be expected, Close adds with a smile: “I'm sure our catering department will have a ‘Lando lunch' as well, where they all wear orange or papaya, and maybe we'll serve the children with papaya fruit, because obviously that's the McLaren colour.

“And, just reflecting on it, the main pathway from our reception and dining block to the main school block is called the ‘M5', because that's where all the traffic is, and that's the big road in the southwest – but maybe we should change it to ‘Lando Way' or something.

“Clarks Village, which is the local shopping outlet, actually added a ‘Lando Lane', so they've stolen a march on that one! But we've got a big banner with Lando's name on it and everything he's achieved, and we're going to have to change the banner to ‘2025 World Champion', which is pretty exciting.”

With the dust settling on Norris' success, Close is already looking forward to watching his former student write the next chapter in his life and career, while continuing to inspire the next generations that pass through Millfield's doors.

“The children in the school just love to see one of ours having some success,” Close comments, admitting they would go “absolutely nuts” if Norris manages to pop back for a visit. “We had Rory Gibbs, a gold medallist at the Paris Olympics in rowing, return to the school last year, as well as James Guy, who was an Olympic champion swimmer.

“They see these people come through the school and they know that it is possible [to reach those heights], because only a few years ago, Lando was sitting on the floor in assembly in the same spot that they are now. I think that's the most inspiring thing.

“Ultimately, as an establishment, we are so proud of Lando and his family for everything they've managed to achieve, and we wish him every future success. It's going to be amazing to see the number one on his car next year. When you know somebody and you've had some investment in their life, you just want them to do well.

“I, for one, will be voting for him for BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and we'll be encouraging everybody else in the school to do the same. That's the next thing. It's strong competition, but that would be the cherry on the top…”

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

Like many professional athletes, Lance Stroll has faced criticism during his time in F1.

Lance Stroll has explained how he has refined his approach to shutting out criticism throughout his career by focusing on the advice of those who know him best.

The Canadian driver has featured on the Formula 1 grid since 2017, when he made his debut with Williams and claimed a maiden podium at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where he lost out on P2 to Valtteri Bottas in a photo finish.

After two seasons, he moved to Racing Point – a team that had been taken over by his businessman father Lawrence Stroll, leading to accusations that his contract was partly the result of his familial relationship with the new owner.

He has also faced criticism for his performances compared to team mates, with Sergio Perez, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso all outscoring Stroll throughout their seasons with Racing Point and the subsequently rebranded Aston Martin respectively.

Speaking on the Unearth Your Greatness series created by the Silverstone based team, Stroll said: “I like to see it as just noise. If I buy into it, it bothers me, for sure, but that's where I am fortunate I have good people around me that I love, that I trust, and I put my attention and value their opinions.

""I try and live in my world, not the world in that sense. There's always going to be criticism. People are very short-minded. You have a couple of good races, you're great. You have a couple of bad ones, you suck.

""That's never going to change. That's why being surrounded by important people and valuing the opinion of people that you care about, that you value. That you really know, their opinion is what matters. Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from.”

Stroll has largely settled into the midfield with some strong performances, amassing three podiums and one pole position in his career so far, but he has recently struggled to maximise Aston Martin's pace after they chose to prioritise their 2026 challenger as he finished this season in P16 with 33 points.

While his father is still the team's Executive Chairman, there have been a host of changes in recent years, including new state-of-the-art facilities and legendary designer Adrian Newey stepping into the Team Principal role from next season.

There are hopes that they can return to fighting at the front of the pack, but the 27-year-old outlined how his rollercoaster career has helped him feel prepared for every eventuality, whether that's competing for podiums or trying to break into the points.

""We can talk about the podiums and the pole, but let's talk about the losses,” Stroll continued. “I think that's where you learn the most about yourself to grow from those tough moments. I think that's where you really grow as a person, as an athlete, as a driver, from those struggles.

""I want every day to be great and perfect, but that's just not the reality of sport. In sports, in anything in life that you pursue, there's going to be those highs and those lows.

“You have to accept that before you even go into it. Before every season, I think to myself, 'There's going to be good days and bad days and I have to accept that now.'

""We all love the champagne celebrations. But it's really in those hard moments, in those tough times, that we really learn the most about ourselves and we grow.""

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

From team radio tears, to unforgettable scenes in parc ferme, becoming a Formula 1 World Champion undoubtedly produces some of the most emotional moments in sport. After Lando Norris became the latest driver to celebrate title glory, we look back at some of the greatest championship-winning celebrations in F1 history.

It takes absolutely everything within a Formula 1 driver to get over the line at the end of a gruelling season to win a World Championship. When they finally achieve their goal, the release of emotion is immense. Sometimes it's tears, sometimes it's a guttural scream, but it's always a raw and authentic reaction to dreams coming true. Lando Norris became the latest to experience a championship-winning triumph, clinching his first title thanks to a podium in the season finale at Abu Dhabi.

We've had plenty of iconic moments over the years, with even more iconic celebrations to match. With Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and many more to come, let's have a look at some of the best from F1 history.

Going into the final race in 2025, there were three drivers in contention for the Drivers' Championship – the McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Norris, along with Red Bull's Max Verstappen. The Dutchman almost pulled off a stunning comeback from over 100 points behind, but it was the Brit who took the title by a mere two points.

When Norris crossed the line, the magnitude of his achievement hit him hard. The 26-year-old fought through cries of laughter and tears to thank his team and family on the radio, before composing himself to give the crowd some donuts.

Hugs were shared with his competitors, his mum and dad, his brother and sisters, and his partner, before the customary champagne drenching on the podium. Celebrations went long into the night, including a rousing rendition of Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline by our new champion.

The final of Vettel's historic four consecutive World Championships, 2013 was some of the German's finest work. He ended the season with nine wins in a row, wrapping up the title with three races to spare. Vettel and Red Bull were an unstoppable duo, winning 13 out of 19 races that year – the fifth-best win-to-race ratio of all time.

After storming to a 30-second victory, Vettel was feeling mischievous, ignoring direct instructions from his race engineer to go to the pit lane. Instead, he drove to the grid and performed some expert donuts for the crowd. Then, he produced one of the most legendary photos in F1 history, climbing out of the cockpit and bowing down to his RB9. The ultimate way to pay homage to one of the greatest cars ever designed.

While Hamilton's 2020 season was characterised by dominance in the technological marvel that was the W11 Mercedes, the Brit reminded everyone in Turkey that when tricky conditions are at play, there's no-one quite like Lewis Hamilton.

He won 11 out of 17 Grands Prix that year, only finishing off the podium three times in the Covid-affected season. The combination of Hamilton's absurd pace and the car's innovative dual-axis steering and aero concepts was unstoppable.

However, Turkey tested all the defending champion's skills; thanks to a fresh surfacing and rain, the track was an ice rink. Hamilton struggled to P7 in Qualifying but used all his experience to decide his own strategy and master the conditions, driving so long on intermediate tyres that they resembled slicks after the race. He won by a staggering 30 seconds, confirming his seventh Drivers' Championship and a fourth in a row.

After crossing the line, Hamilton remarked: “That's for all the kids out there who dream the impossible. You can do it too man! I believe in you guys!” An inspiring message from a driver who worked so hard to break barriers and achieve his goals. Standing on his car, having won what is currently his last title, an emotional Hamilton raised his arms in the air, producing one of the most recognisable F1 photos in modern times.

One of the great F1 seasons deserved one of the great F1 celebrations, and that's exactly what we got in the title decider at Yas Marina in 2021. Red Bull's Verstappen and Mercedes' Hamilton had been going blow for blow all year long, culminating in an Abu Dhabi showdown with both drivers tied on 369.5 points.

The Mercedes driver had taken the lead from the pole-sitting Dutchman early on, and looked in control until a late Safety Car with five laps to go.

Red Bull gambled with a pit stop, and following a controversial Safety Car procedure, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the season to win the first of his World Championships.

There was absolute pandemonium in the Red Bull garage, with Verstappen's race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase screaming the famous line “Oh my lord Max,” on team radio, which was quickly drowned out by Verstappen roaring at the other end of the line. Having spent some time lifted on the shoulders of his team, Verstappen walked onto the podium with the Dutch flag as he became the first Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands. An unforgettable race, and unforgettable celebration.

The turn of the century was a game-changing year for both Michael Schumacher and the Ferrari team. Although the German driver had already clinched his first and second World Championship half a decade earlier with Benetton, it was 2000 that sparked the beginning of a world-beating partnership where driver and team went on to win an incredible five championships in a row together.

The first iconic championship-winning celebration that year came in Suzuka for the penultimate race of the championship, when Schumacher secured his third World Drivers' Championship title, and ending Ferrari's 21-year Drivers' title drought in the process.

After four seasons of frustration and heartache, the elation was almost too much to bear for Schumacher, who slammed on the steering wheel so hard it broke! Shouts of ‘We did it!' down the radio, and a shoutout to his wife Corrina – the in-lap was incredibly wholesome, whilst his team were leaping around the garage hugging one another with jubilation and relief.

Schumacher leapt up onto the top step of the podium with such vigour that he almost slipped right off it, but in a moment that certainly brought a tear to every Ferrari fan's eye, Team Principal Jean Todt joined Schumacher on the podium and lifted him into the air. It wasn't long until the celebrations took a rogue turn, with Schumacher driving a forklift through the paddock – and leaving Japan with a hangover that took a few days to recover from...

The celebrations continued after the season finale in Malaysia as the team secured the Constructors' title for the second year in a row. Post-race, Schumacher donned an eye-catching red wig, which we can only imagine might have been some sort of bet with his team!

In one of the greatest season finale comebacks, a young Vettel came back from a 15-point deficit to win the 2010 Drivers' Championship with an epic victory in Abu Dhabi, and in doing so became the youngest World Champion ever.

Aside from the race, one of the most memorable moments came from his team radio after taking the chequered flag. After winning the race, Vettel had done all that he could – all he and the Red Bull team had left to do was wait. Between the young German driver and the title was two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso.

After it was confirmed that his title rival had finished down in seventh, so came the infamous radio message from his engineer, “I need to wait. But it's looking good! You just wait sunshine, you just wait...” And sure enough, the message he'd been waiting for came, “Du bist Weltmeister!”

Then came the wave of emotion, and the tears on team radio that lasted until way after the podium ceremony. It was a childhood dream come true as he became just the second-ever World Champion from Germany, and Vettel couldn't quite believe it.

A fresh-faced 24-year-old Alonso cemented himself as one of the best drivers of his generation in 2005, claiming his first World Championship for Renault at Interlagos. The Spaniard's unique driving style and fearless mentality was unbeatable that year, and he went into the Brazilian Grand Prix needing a podium to secure the crown with two races still to go.

Despite the rapid McLaren duo of Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen finishing in first and second, Alonso coasted home in third, sparking wild celebrations in the paddock as Renault won their first Drivers' Championship as a constructor. Alonso couldn't contain his passion, and as he stood on his R25 in the pit lane, he released a guttural scream, before launching himself into his team. He achieved his dream, and boy was he going to celebrate.

The recently retired Button enjoyed his best season with the fledging Brawn GP team, born from the ashes of Honda from the year before. The team quickly realised they had nailed the car for the 2009 regulations, as they were a second quicker than the field in pre-season testing, thanks to their double diffuser. Winning six of the first seven races gave the Brit a big enough lead as the rest of the grid closed the gap in performance.

However, Button still needed a vintage performance to secure the title after a poor Qualifying left him down in P14 in Brazil. Under huge pressure, he carved his way through the field to finish fifth and win the Drivers' Championship in Brawn's only season. Button set the tone for an evening of partying by singing Queen's We Are the Champions on the radio on his in-lap – and it wasn't a bad rendition after a 71-lap race!

Rosberg had fought hard in 2014 and 2015 to get the better of his rival and childhood friend Hamilton, but to no avail. But in 2016, the German found a new level of dedication and commitment which allowed him to finally get his hands on the Championship trophy. He raced out the blocks to start the year, winning the first four rounds, before recovering from a difficult spell to consistently finish on the rostrum. Finishing on the podium 16 times from 21 races was enough to give Rosberg the edge over the Brit, thanks to a gutsy performance at Yas Marina.

Despite Hamilton backing Rosberg into the chasing Vettel and Verstappen, Rosberg held his nerve to take the chequered flag in second. The scenes were wild from Rosberg's side of the garage, and there was a sweet moment on the radio from his wife, Vivian Sibold, who congratulated Rosberg as he crossed the line.

Some championship donuts followed, but when he got his hands on the championship trophy at the end of season awards, Rosberg had one last shock up his sleeve. He duly announced his retirement, knowing just how much it had taken out of him to achieve his dream.

Villeneuve took to the speed and intensity of F1 with ease, taking pole position on debut in 1996, before narrowly missing out on the title to team mate Damon Hill. But in 1997, it was the Canadian's turn for success. His season with Williams was littered with wins and retirements – seven and five respectively – but a disqualification in the penultimate race gave Ferrari's Schumacher a one-point lead heading into the finale in Jerez.

The weekend couldn't have been more dramatic as Schumacher, Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzen all set the same time to the thousandth of a second in Qualifying, with Villeneuve starting first having the set the lap before the others.

Schumacher drove away at the start from the pole-sitter, but when Villeneuve attempted a move on Lap 48 for the lead, the Ferrari collided with the Williams, a move that both retired Schumacher from the race and earned him a disqualification from the Drivers' Championship. Villeneuve limped home over the line to take the title in his sophomore season at just 26 years old.

The son of Gilles Villeneuve was held aloft by McLaren's Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard on the podium, and he soaked in the moment on their shoulders in front of the Spanish crowd.

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

With F1 The Movie arriving on Apple TV+ this Friday, 12th December, Lifestyle and Culture contributor Esme Buxton takes a look at the extraordinary behind-the-scenes effort needed to create APXGP. In an exclusive interview, costume designer Julian Day explains how the team's identity, colours, race suits, and fan culture were crafted.

When costume designer Julian Day took on F1 The Movie, he faced a unique challenge – creating and kitting out an entire Formula 1 team in just a few months.

Most teams spend years developing their identity, uniforms, and brand – from their inception to joining the grid. Cadillac, who join the F1 grid next season, will have had over five years to develop and design all the team details. But for Day, he had little time to create something authentic and unique enough to stand out at Grand Prix weekends and on the silver screen.

But that's exactly what he achieved, as APXGP fit seamlessly into the F1 paddock with impressive realism and a clean aesthetic during their time mixing it with the grid over the 2023 and 2024 seasons. With a little help from some leading brands and manufacturers, Day created team kit, race suits and merchandise with an iconic look that doesn't look out of place during race weekends.

With F1 The Movie now streaming on Apple TV+, there's no better time to talk to Day about how he achieved such an impressive feat.

The journey to finding APXGP's signature look was far from straightforward. Day approached OMP, the Italian racewear supplier which kits out Aston Martin, for designs and he would go on to produce multiple racing suit concepts in different colours. Those concepts were then presented to the movie's stars Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, as well as director Joe Kosinski, for feedback.

""One day, we were doing a fitting with Brad, and we were struggling to agree on a team colour,"" Day recalled. ""Then I suddenly remembered that I had brought in this sort of silvery white/grey suit, and everybody looked at it and went, 'Yes, this is the one.'""

The choice was strategic. According to Day, going too black would create a ""Darth Vader-esque feel"", while too white would feel vintage.

The silver-white struck the perfect balance, complementing the dark colour of the APXGP car and the white of the garage. The suit would also stand out against the rest of the grid on Grand Prix weekends.

The racing suits worn by Pitt and Idris featured OMP's fireproofing, including the ONE-S suit, and all equipment was FIA-approved to ensure the same safety standards in real competitions were met during on-track filming.

Day also discovered the number of complications involved with creating race suits at the highest level of motorsport, especially when it comes to team sponsors. Just as with the real F1 teams, APXGP had a number of high-end sponsorships – and with that, precision matters enormously, even down to the millimeter.

""If a sponsor's logo is two millimetres larger on a racing suit, they'll give you another £100,000, or if the logo is too small or in the wrong place, then you're in trouble,"" he explained.

The team worked meticulously with the APXGP sponsors to place graphics on the suits, though some logos changed during filming as sponsors updated their branding. If you look hard enough, you might be able to spot the difference between some of the earlier and later scenes!

For the pit crew uniforms, Day drew inspiration from a surprising source – Mercedes. ""I was invited to the Mercedes headquarters to see what they did, and they were very helpful from the beginning, and obviously they use black and white in their uniforms, and we just thought it was perfect."" Day said.

The all-black pit crew kit also served a functional purpose beyond aesthetics in the film – it made the drivers stand out against them. It's a useful feature when you want the audience's eyes to be focused on the stars of the show.

With F1 The Movie dedicated to immersing the viewer into the world of F1, the pit crew also wore race-ready uniforms with Day noting the remarkable evolution of racing fabrics. ""I ended up having to order the pit crew uniforms from OMP again, which meant they got the latest fabrics. The fabric these days is so thin, it's almost like shirt material, but completely fireproof.""

Creating authentic racing gear required attention to even the most minor details. Day ensured that everything from racing boots to Nomex underwear, gloves, and balaclavas met professional standards for racing. However, some modifications were necessary for filming.

""We had to make sure that the visor of the helmet was large enough so the camera could catch the eyes, but it also had to be safe to use,"" Day explained. ""We were also conscious of the fact that racing helmets are very tight and can squeeze your cheeks like a hamster, so we had to sort that out!""

The team even had standbys on set whose job was to pull up the balaclavas around the actors' eyes to ensure everyone looked their best. As Day noted: ""It's all in the minutiae – the details that you don't think about while watching the movie.""

When producer Lewis Hamilton first saw the racing suit, his feedback was telling. According to Day, Hamilton remarked that it was much lighter than his own suit, a testament to the latest racing fabric technology and how much the movie was able to push the boundaries of authenticity.

One of the most innovative aspects of the costume department's work was creating a fanbase for a team that didn't exist.

""We produced a whole load of merchandise, and we handed it out at the races,"" Day explained. ""So, when the actors would be doing post-race interviews and post-Qualifying interviews, we'd dress people around them in APXGP caps and t-shirts to look like fans.""

The team's approach to fan representation also evolved as the story progressed. ""Obviously, APXGP are nothing as a team when the film starts, so as they gradually win more races and do better and better, we gave them more fans,"" Day said.

Considerable amounts of filming for the movie took place during live Grand Prix weekends during the 2023 and 2024 seasons, with the assistance of the FIA and Formula 1. Day attended races in Hungary, Silverstone, and Monza, witnessing firsthand how the production was integrated into the F1 schedule.

In Las Vegas, driving sequences were often captured in the early hours, around 3:00 a.m. local time over the Grand Prix weekend. Filming also took place at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France and the Circuit of The Americas in Texas, with production continuing through the 2024 season to make up for time lost over the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. However, there were a number of potential complications to consider during filming at these race weekends...

""One of the biggest fears was at the British Grand Prix as the two cars were following the grid during the formation lap, and we were nervous in case one of them would break down,"" Day recalled. ""It could've totally changed the actual race. Production did an incredible job making sure that didn't happen.""

The unprecedented access granted for the production was also a career first for Day, and something he doesn't take for granted.

""I don't think a film that integrates into a sport in the way we did will ever happen again,"" he said. ""It's quite extraordinary what they managed to do, to jimmy themselves into the F1 schedule like that.""

Day's meticulous attention to detail aimed to create a seamless visual experience that went beyond anything F1 fans and cinephiles alike have ever seen. ""What I really want people to see is how truthfully I represented what the sport looks like,"" he said.

""Because it's such a vast world, you have the race team, but also the paddock and the larger crowds. I tried to include every small detail in the process so that no detail stands out. Hopefully, all the details work together to create the overall look of the film.""

With F1 The Movie released in June 2025 to critical and commercial success, Day's work has not only created a convincing fictional team but has also sparked a fashion evolution within F1 fan culture, with the Tommy Hilfiger APXGP capsule collection becoming highly sought-after. Fans are blending streetwear with racing gear to showcase their identity at Grand Prix weekends like never before – and plenty repping APXGP.

We get to relive the magic again from our sofas now that F1 The Movie airs on Apple+ – and it's the perfect opportunity to get out our APXGP and Tommy Hilfiger merchandise again during the off-season!

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

Arvid Lindblad will join the grid as 2026's sole rookie driver, competing with Racing Bulls.

Arvid Lindblad will compete under the number 41 in his debut season with Racing Bulls following his graduation from Formula 2, the FIA entry list has confirmed.

The 18-year-old claimed three victories and a further two podiums during his time in the feeder series, finishing the year sixth in the standings with 134 points to earn himself a promotion to Formula 1 as part of the Red Bull family.

Lindblad has been part of the Red Bull Junior Team since 2021 and progressed through the ranks rapidly, completing just one season in Formula 3 and F2 before he was announced as Isack Hadjar's replacement at Racing Bulls, with the French driver set to partner Max Verstappen at the senior Red Bull team in 2026.

Lindblad most recently took part in the post-season test, where he completed 139 laps and ended the day 0.014s adrift of his future team mate Liam Lawson.

The pair will be aiming to equal or even improve upon Racing Bulls' P6 finish in the Constructors' Championship this season, which included a magnificent maiden podium for Hadjar in the Netherlands.

The rookie will also become the first driver to race with the number 41 as the official entry list also details Verstappen's switch to the number 3, and confirms that World Champion Lando Norris will inherit the honour of number 1.

Bleecker Street's Crosswalk will release 'Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience' in North America, with Universal handling most international territories.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	Bleecker Street's event cinema division Crosswalk and Universal Pictures Content Group (UPCG) have acquired rights to Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience, a concert film capturing the K-pop group's sold-out performances at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium.


	Under the deal, Crosswalk will release the film theatrically in North America, while UPCG will handle international distribution across most of the rest of the world, excluding South Korea, China and Japan. A global theatrical rollout is planned for early 2026, including Imax engagements.

	Produced by Live Nation Studios, the film combines concert footage from Stray Kids' dominATE world tour with behind-the-scenes material. It is directed by Paul Dugdale (Adele: One Night Only, Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour), with documentary segments directed by Farah X (The Remix: Hip Hop x Fashion).

	The acquisition was negotiated by Miranda King and Avy Eschenasy for Bleecker Street, Ingrid Pittana for UPCG and Ross Putman on behalf of Live Nation.


	“Stray Kids' global reach and passionate fan base perfectly represent the bold, wide-reaching experiences we are constantly wanting to bring to audiences on the big screen,” Bleecker Street CEO Kent Sanderson said in a statement, describing the film as a natural extension of the company's push into event cinema.

	











	UPCG EVP Helen Parker said the company plans to position the release as a global theatrical event, citing the group's international audience and the growing appetite for concert films outside traditional music markets.


	The deal comes as K-pop concert films continue to build theatrical appeal across Asia and in select Western markets, particularly for fan-driven event releases. Recent titles headlined by BTS, BLACKPINK and NCT have delivered strong per-screen averages in South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, with premium formats and limited-run engagements offsetting shorter play dates. Distributors have been leaning on such titles as low-risk event cinema, combining theatrical exclusivity with built-in fan engagement.


	Live Nation Studios head of film and TV Ryan Kroft said the project aims to translate the scale of Stray Kids' live performances to theaters, combining concert footage with the feeling of behind-the-scenes access.


	Formed by JYP Entertainment in 2018, Stray Kids has emerged as one of the most commercially successful K-pop groups of its generation, with more than 30 million albums sold worldwide. The group has logged multiple Billboard 200 No. 1 debuts and has expanded its footprint through film and television soundtracks, including recent contributions to Netflix's Arcane and Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine.


	The release adds to Crosswalk's growing slate of event-focused theatrical titles following Bleecker Street's 2025 launch of the division. The company's upcoming projects include Stop! That! Train!, directed by Adam Shankman and starring RuPaul, and Alex Gibney's much-anticipated Elon Musk doc, Musk.

	











	The partners have yet to reveal a release date for Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience.

Amanda Seyfried, Laura Dern and Renate Reinsve joined in with intimate tales of getting drunk with a co-star and letting out a primal screen on camera.


							By 

	Seija Rankin


Senior Editor


	This year's Oscar frontrunners have more in common than usual. Start with their films, of course, where overlapping themes abound. The darker sides of motherhood, and the way grief seeps in, are front and center for Jennifer Lawrence‘s Die My Love, Jessie Buckley‘s Hamnet and even Amanda Seyfried‘s The Testament of Ann Lee — which trades more specifically in the grief of not being a mother. There are bad dads of every variety: Renate Reinsve‘s Sentimental Value (distant, narcissistic); Lawrence's Die My Love again (apathetic, bumbling); Cynthia Erivo‘s Wicked: For Good (megalomaniac). And though Laura Dern was on hand to discuss Is This Thing On?, it's worth mentioning that she also stars in Jay Kelly, the final boss of complicated fatherhood.

	The actress' performances, though varied in breadth and scale, are all deeply personal to the women who embody these roles. Lawrence and Buckley found themselves unlocking a new connection to their own matrescence. Erivo's time as Elphaba mirrored her own journey to superstardom. Reinsve and Dern both reunited with dear friends (directors Joachim Trier and Bradley Cooper, respectively) behind the camera. And Seyfried worked through newfound levels of discomfort for Ann Lee‘s absurd (a compliment!) song-and-dance numbers.




	All six women gathered on a rainy Los Angeles afternoon to discuss their experiences onscreen — as it turns out, it's normal to feel embarrassed! — and in navigating the months-long road show that is compulsory to releasing a film these days. “I really appreciate when other actors do it, and I watch these interviews all the time because I'm so curious about other people's processes,” says Reinsve. “But doing it myself, it's weird and the opposite of what I do on set.”

	











What is a favorite, or most rewarding, way that you have gotten to know a recent co-star? Jessie, I believe you have a great story about going out with Paul Mescal before Hamnet.


JESSIE BUCKLEY I told you that in absolute secrecy. What happens at Joyface stays at Joyface [a vibey NYC bar]. They play ABBA and all the old hits. We got really drunk and went out dancing, which is a good thing to do with Paul Mescal when you're getting to know him.


JENNIFER LAWRENCE [Die My Love director] Lynne Ramsay had me and Rob Pattinson do interpretative dance lessons before we started filming. And then our first day on set was a naked scene where we were attacking each other like tigers. But it was kind of nice that it was day one because then it wasn't hanging over our heads.


AMANDA SEYFRIED That's actually brilliant. And if you know what the genitals look like, you don't wonder.


CYNTHIA ERIVO Mine pales in comparison because [Ariana and I] just went to my house and sat on the floor and ate crudités. We talked for five hours, got to know each other, and the next time [we saw each other], we were singing.


LAWRENCE Nobody was naked?


ERIVO Nobody was naked.


LAURA DERN Bradley Cooper and I are old friends, and so are Bradley and Will Arnett, so we just dove into a workshop. We shared our dreams and our childhoods because in our movie, there's no backstory. It's about a marriage, and in the first scene it's falling apart, so you have to come in feeling like you know everything.

	











You're all in various stages of your careers, and I'm curious at what point you started to feel full autonomy and control over your circumstances in this business?


ERIVO I feel as though we all have that at the beginning, but we just didn't know it. We relinquish the power to everybody else, and we're pressured into doing some things that we don't need or want to do — but from the beginning, our yeses and our nos are our own. I don't think the choice to do what I wanted was ever not there — it's just louder now.


RENATE REINSVE I think the signals you get from inside yourself about what is right are really small in the beginning and get stronger and stronger the more you get scolded by experiences. These past few years, I finally feel like I'm on the right path, but it's taken a long time.


Renate, you were offered a lot of romantic comedies after the success of The Worst Person in the World, but did you feel they weren't right for you?


REINSVE I love a good rom-com, I really do. They're really hard to make really good. But I felt like if I do one after Worst Person, then that will just become what I do. So instead I did A Different Man, which was more like a Charlie Kaufman world. It was the opposite of Worst Person.


DERN Renate and I were talking before we started about how lucky we've been that we found a filmmaker to work with numerous times. You feel like, “Oh, OK, I know my place in this world.” And that takes me back to the question of autonomy. Especially on a film, I think a lot of times it can feel the same as having autonomy in a partnership. It's complicated because you want to involve the other person, for people to be your true teammate and partners.

	











Laura, your movie Is This Thing On? is a great example of a movie that could have been about the male lead, but it is a true two-hander about a relationship. Is it easy for you all to find movies that are about women as opposed to a movie that just has women in it?


ERIVO No. That's the short answer.


LAWRENCE Do you care if it passes the Bechdel Test?


ERIVO You know what, I didn't care, but now I do. I'm always like, “How much is she speaking, and what is she saying when she does speak?”


Is there any sort of formula to finding, and then keeping, those long-standing director-actor collaborations?


REINSVE Joachim Trier and I mutually felt on the set on Worst Person in the World that we had more things we wanted to explore together. We didn't really say it because it's up to him [whether we keep working together]. In Norway, it's really the director's vision and not so much an actor. It's almost the opposite, where if you're too famous or you become a star, it can get in the way of things. So Joachim and his co-writer Eskil Vogt had to decide if they wanted to work with me again. And then they did write that character [in Sentimental Value] for me.


BUCKLEY Did your relationship change the second time around?


REINSVE Yes, because Nora is really angry. I don't do the thing where you're in the role all the time, but it's like a transference of feeling. I talked to him in a different tone. The character also is depressed throughout the movie, so it affected our communication. After you have that experience, you come out of it and you're still friends, and you actually get closer.

	











SEYFRIED It's intimate. Growing as an artistic couple, the things you create grow, it seems like the best of both worlds. They say don't mix business with pleasure, don't mix business with relationships and love, but I don't agree with that because you're going to make something deeper and be fulfilled by it. Unless of course, somebody does something fucked up and you're not friends anymore.


DERN Cynthia, I'm curious how the experience was in making the second iteration of this film.


ERIVO We actually shot simultaneously.


LAWRENCE So some days you're shooting for number two and some days you're shooting for one?


ERIVO Sometimes all in the same day. When we shot the song “For Good,” we were meant to be shooting something for film one, but it was supposed to be outside, and it was raining. It's a sort of surrender. There's something lovely about being able to just let it be.


LAWRENCE Well, at least you're green no matter what. [On X-Men,] we could never do that because sometimes I'd be blue, sometimes I'd be blond. They'd say, “We're going to try to shoot something else,” and it's like, “OK, just give me eight hours.”


Is that hard to get used to? Since there's probably no world in which you could say, “I'm just not ready for that scene yet.”


LAWRENCE I worked with one actor who did that.


Did it work?












LAWRENCE Yeah. We didn't shoot the scene that day.


Amanda, with all of the choreography and singing you did on The Testament of Ann Lee, did you always feel ready?


SEYFRIED We did get this luxurious preparation period that you don't get for other genres. If there's music and movement involved, there's built-in time. And thank God because my brain is not clicked into the movement. I am always very uncomfortable dancing.


ERIVO I would never have known that you were uncomfortable.


SEYFRIED Thanks. It's the preparation, right? It's also very intuitive movement, so it's different than Mamma Mia!


REINSVE Were you uncomfortable in that too?


SEYFRIED Very much so. And it's internal because no one's got time for that [on set]. There are too many people doing too many things. So I'm just like, “I'm a piece of shit, I'm a piece of shit, are we rolling?”


LAWRENCE That's a good mantra.


Jennifer, it seems as though there's a fair amount of improv involved in Die My Love, especially during the moments when your character is breaking down or acting out.












LAWRENCE In the bathroom scene, what was in the script was just: “She destroys the bathroom.” So I did that. I scratched at the wall and then in post, they peeled off the wallpaper for me. It was just me in the bathroom with the camera guy. Once it got going, it was like I was living an intrusive thought out loud. How often do you want to take a shampoo bottle and just (mimes squeezing it out) and smash things?


Do you ever feel like, in promoting this film, you have to be the poster child of the postpartum experience?


LAWRENCE Not to sound stupid, but it is a privilege to talk about something that, 10 years ago, we weren't talking about. I had really bad postpartum with my second — whom I was actually pregnant with while we were making this [movie] — so I had to watch cuts of it while I was suffering from postpartum. More than any other movie I've made, it's very ripe for projection about your own relationships and family. But I've talked about postpartum a lot in the last six weeks, for sure.


Does the subject matter of a film, and more specifically the subject matter that you'll be required to discuss ad nauseam during the press tour, ever influence your decision to take a role?


LAWRENCE I was surprised when I started doing this because I've always been really strict about, “I don't want to talk about my kids.” But it's impossible not to, so I've landed on, “I will talk about my experience as a mother.” But it did make me realize that it was not something I had considered.


And you're really generous with it —


LAWRENCE Too generous. I hear what you're saying.


Like the interviews talking about the meds that helped you.


LAWRENCE Zurzuvae. Really helpful.

	











REINSVE It's funny, I struggle with the period where you're like, “Oh, I have to articulate what I did a year ago.” You never think that you're going to be an advocate for anything when you're making the movie, and then you end up in conversations with people having similar experiences [to the movie].


BUCKLEY I find it can narrow the experience. Everybody can have a completely personal, unique relationship to whatever you've made. Sometimes I wish we didn't have to talk about it at all and could just put it out there and let it be.


LAWRENCE We have to turn into a salesman. I get it, it's a business, but it's bizarre.


SEYFRIED And we're not experts on what we're talking about.


DERN Often people turn to the actors when the director doesn't want to tell you what his or her movie's about. Actors often become the spokespeople of the intentions. I don't know if you guys ever had a director upset with you about how you described their movie …


LAWRENCE Was it David Lynch?


DERN Yes. It was funny. It was the first time I had to describe what Blue Velvet was about, and I was 17 years old. And he was like, “You don't ever have to tell them anything about what we're making. You could just say that we had fun.” I was like, “Oh.” And, by the way, and then I betrayed that because I'm still trying to explain what our movie was about.


LAWRENCE I really love that moment when he brought a cow.


DERN Yes, for the first Oscar campaign. He did find it kind of insane what has happened with the promotion of movies.


BUCKLEY I never want to project any idea of what the women I play are meant to be, I just want to go down the river with them and let them have their own voice with it.

	











In the scene when Hamnet dies, you have this incredibly visceral scream-cry. How did you get yourself there that day?


BUCKLEY Well, it wasn't in the script, that moment. I guess my job in exploring grief was to try and touch the edges of that in as honest a way possible. The little boy who plays Hamnet, Jacobi Jupe, is so extraordinary. We shot that setup maybe three times, and the scream came out on the third time. I'd created a really strong bond with this little boy, and it felt like that scream was ancient. It just came through, I have no idea how.


ERIVO I've got a question. How do you come out of something like that? How do you protect yourself? I'm always concerned when I watch your films.


BUCKLEY I have a pretty simple life outside of my work, and coming back to something grounded is really important to me. Making a slice of toast or gardening or going for a walk. I'm also grateful for it because I don't want to wear a mask — I want all the shadowy bits to show. But I have an amazing husband, I have great siblings and I'm very close to them. Don't be worried, I'm fine. I also have therapy.


DERN As actors, we give ourselves permission to feel all the things because they're true, and then in life, culture teaches us not to have those feelings. Sometimes I think I'm more compassionate about needing that time [in work] than I am in real life, when I'm supposed to be together and show up for my kids even though I'm in pain.


Earlier, Amanda pointed out that no one here is an expert in whatever topic their movie is about — but what are you experts in?












LAWRENCE English royal history. I love it, I always have. The Tudors, specifically.


REINSVE I love quantum physics.


SEYFRIED I believe that.


LAWRENCE That's so annoying.


BUCKLEY That's really hot.


REINSVE You said you garden?


BUCKLEY I'm absolutely rubbish at gardening. I have grown one flaccid courgette. But I love my garden.


SEYFRIED I keep trying to picture it, but I can't.


BUCKLEY It was small, yellow and flaccid.


SEYFRIED Flaccid?


LAWRENCE If she says “flaccid” one more time, I'm leaving.


ERIVO I feel like it's obvious, but music really is my second language.


SEYFRIED You are an expert at finding notes and making them fucking throttle your soul. You are an expert at moving metaphorical mountains in people's bodies. I don't know how else to articulate it.


I'd like to end by asking if any of you have a memory of what you bought yourself with your first Hollywood paycheck. 


REINSVE Probably just rent.


BUCKLEY I think it was rent as well. I got a bit nicer place.


ERIVO I bought my first Chanel bag and paid off my student loans.


Do you still have the bag?


ERIVO It was stolen. I remember I went into the store and paid for it with cash because I'd saved up my per diems from the job. I was like a little grandma putting it away in a cupboard.


SEYFRIED My favorite Louis Vuitton bag that I spent too much money on during an early movie was also stolen.

	











DERN I bought a camera and a tripod. And then the camera was stolen. I was so proud that I got to buy this for myself, so I put the tripod in the corner of my bedroom and used it as a coatrack for two years because I wanted it to matter. I don't know why I didn't just save up and get another camera, but I was so traumatized. I had been studying photography, and I just sort of let go of the passion. By the way, it might have been a boyfriend who stole the camera. He knows who he is.


ERIVO Fuck him.


LAWRENCE Fucking bitch.


DERN I think it's time to get myself a camera, guys.


ERIVO You must, I'll go with you.


DERN OK, I love this.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy will live under the Sony umbrella as Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment Japan buy the slice of Peanuts Holding LLC held by Canadian company WildBrain.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	The power of brands continues to enthrall Hollywood.


	In a late-in-the-year deal, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment Japan have taken a significant stake in Peanuts Holding LLC, the company that controls the intellectual property rights of the beloved characters created by Charles M. Schulz such as Charlie Brown and Snoopy. The purchase price was disclosed as about $460 million for the stake sale.




	Sony has acquired all of the approximately 41 percent stake held by WildBrain, a Canadian kids and family entertainment company.

	According to the announcement, the resulting deal will see Sony, which already had a stake in the venture, owning 80 percent of Peanuts Holdings. Members of the Schulz family will continue to own the remaining 20 percent.

	“Since 2018, SMEJ has been proud to be part of the partnership behind Peanuts, an iconic global entertainment brand with a 75-year legacy of delighting audiences worldwide,” said Shunsuke Muramatsu, Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) president and group CEO. “With this additional ownership stake, we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the Peanuts brand by drawing on the Sony Group's extensive global network and collective expertise.”


	The exec added, “We are deeply committed to carrying forward the legacy of Charles Schulz and the Schulz family. Together with SPE, and backed by WildBrain's continued partnership, we will continue to embrace new opportunities to ensure that Peanuts remains a relevant and beloved presence across generations, reaching new audiences and sharing the timeless charm of the Peanuts gang for years ahead.”

	











	Sony will now focus on keeping the characters in the public eye and building up the brand.


	“With our combined strengths, we have the unique capability and extraordinary opportunity to protect and shape the future of these beloved characters for generations to come,” said Sony Pictures President and CEO Ravi Ahuja.


	Schulz's Peanuts became an American institution in the 20th Century thanks to a daily comic strip that ran for 50 years, ending only with his death in 2000.


	It moved beyond the four panel walls with seminal cartoon specials A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown that played year after year on network TV, cementing Peanuts' status in the pop culture firmament.


	20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios previously produced The Peanuts Movie, a 2015 feature that was well-regarded and ended a major screen drought for Charlie Brown.


	WildBrain had been keeping aspects of the IP alive with animated series Snoopy in Space and The Snoopy Show in recent years.

Star and action choreographer Junichi Okada is promising an even ""more energetic and action-packed” batch of episodes, after Season 1 topped Netflix's global non-English chart and spent four weeks at No. 1 in Japan.



		By Patrick Brzeski, Abid Rahman 

	December 18, 2025 7:00pm	




	Steel yourself for more blades, blood and battle — Netflix's Japanese period-action series Last Samurai Standing has been renewed for a second season.


	The streamer confirmed the pickup Friday in Japan after the series became a breakout hit and globally. Since its debut, the Meiji-era battle royale drama has topped Netflix's Global Top 10 (Non-English Series) chart and ranked in the platform's Top 10 in 88 countries. In Japan, the series held the No. 1 position for four consecutive weeks, quickly becoming one of the most talked-about domestic releases of the year.

Last Samurai Standing also became the first all-Japanese production to receive a Critics' Choice Awards nomination in the best foreign language series category. As of this week, it still carries a 100 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes.




			Popular on THR		







	Directed by Michihito Fujii, the series is co-led by Junichi Okada, who serves as lead actor, producer and action choreographer. Based on Shogo Imamura's Ikusagami best-selling period novel — which won Japan's Naoki Prize in 2021 — the show features an expansive ensemble cast in an epic period production centered on highly stylized combat driven by a gripping survival game.


	In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter before the season one dropped, Okada heavily hinted a second season was in the offing, and how it could, perhaps, include more supernatural elements found in Ikusagami. “We would have to see how this will go, [but at the moment] I'm more focused on the survival game element. Ikusagami… has this connection with God. In the first season, we introduced the kagura dance, which is like a spiritual ritual, so there is this element of the superhuman power, so we may be able to introduce this divine power.” 

	











	In a statement regarding the renewal of Last Samurai Standing, Okada said, “I'm pleased to see that Last Samurai Standing has reached global audiences and has been confirmed for a second season. I'm excited to get back into this wild world and once again charge into battle with the production team. We hope to make the next season even more energetic and action-packed. We'd love to have you along for the ride, and please stay tuned for Season 2.”


	Fujii said the series' overseas reception played a key role in the decision to move forward. “I'm very pleased and relieved that Last Samurai Standing has been such a big hit outside Japan. Thank you so much. I'm also honored to say that the series has officially been greenlit for a second season,” the director said. “It gives me chills just thinking about all the exciting days that lie ahead with this amazing production team led by Junichi Okada. There's no doubt that Season 2 will be even bigger and better than the first, so I'm going to hold on to my seat and give it my best. I hope everyone will keep their eyes peeled for what we have in store!”


	Set in the late 19th century during the Meiji period, Last Samurai Standing kicks off at Kyoto's Tenryuji Temple, where 292 samurai are drawn into a lethal contest by the promise of a 100 billion yen prize. Okada stars as Shujiro Saga, a warrior driven by the need to support his ailing wife and child.


	The cast includes Yumia Fujisaki, Kaya Kiyohara, Masahiro Higashide, Shota Sometani, Taichi Saotome, Yuya Endo, Takayuki Yamada, Riho Yoshioka, Kazunari Ninomiya, Hiroshi Tamaki and Hideaki Ito. Kento Yamaguchi and Toru Yamamoto also directed episodes of the first season, with Kosuke Oshida producing.

	











	Netflix has not yet revealed a production start date or release window for the second season.

The ceremony will be held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in L.A. on Jan. 31.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	The Recording Academy has announced the recipients of its 2026 Special Merit Awards. Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, Cher, Fela Kuti, Paul Simon and Whitney Houston are the lifetime achievement recipients; Bernie Taupin, Eddie Palmieri and Sylvia Rhone are the Trustees Award honorees; and John Chowning is the Technical Grammy Award honoree.


	The ceremony will be held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles on Saturday Jan. 31, the afternoon before the 68th annual Grammy Awards at Crypto.com Arena in downtown L.A.


	“It's a true honor to recognize this year's Special Merit Award recipients — an extraordinary group whose influence spans generations, genres and the very foundation of modern music,” Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, said in a statement. “Each of these honorees has made a profound and lasting impact, and we look forward to celebrating their remarkable achievements.”


	Palmieri, a Latin music legend, will be honored less than six months after he died at age 88. Two other artists are being honored posthumously – Afrobeats pioneer Kuti, who died in 1997, and Houston, who died in 2012.


	Simon is being honored as a solo artist. Simon & Garfunkel received a lifetime achievement award as a duo in 2003. Simon joins the short list of people who have been honored both solo and in groups or duos. Others include Diana Ross (the Supremes) and Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison (The Beatles).


	Houston receives the honor seven years after her cousin Dionne Warwick was honored.


	Taupin is this year's only Special Merit Award recipient who is also a 2026 Grammy nominee. The night after he picks up this honor, he'll win or lose for best song written for visual media for “Never Too Late” from Elton John: Never Too Late. Incredibly, Taupin has yet to win a competitive Grammy.


	Lifetime Achievement Awards are presented to performers who have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording. Trustees Awards are presented to individuals who have made significant contributions, other than performance, to the field of recording. Both are voted on by the academy's national trustees.


	Technical Grammy Awards are presented to individuals, companies, organizations or institutions who have made contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field. They are voted on by the Producers & Engineers Wing Advisory Council and chapter committees and ratified by the academy's national trustees.


	Here's a closer look at this year's honorees:


	Cher will receive her lifetime achievement award 60 years after receiving her first Grammy nomination – best new artist as one-half of Sonny & Cher. Cher is an Oscar, Grammy, Primetime Emmy, and Golden Globe winner whose influence has shaped pop culture and fashion worldwide. Rising to fame with the Billboard Hot 100-topping hit “I Got You Babe,” she went on to land such solo hits as “Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves,” “Half-Breed,” “Dark Lady” and “If I Could Turn Back Time,” before taking on dance-pop with the Grammy-winning “Believe” (which was nominated for record of the year). On TV, she scored big with The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and Cher. As an actress, Cher earned acclaim in films such as Silkwood, Mask and Moonstruck, the latter bringing her an Oscar for best actress. Her world tours and Las Vegas residency have drawn millions of fans. Cher received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2018 and was voted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2024. She may be the youngest and hippest 79-year-old on planet Earth.


	Houston, who died in 2012 at age 48, earned worldwide renown as “The Voice.” Born into a dynasty of legendary singers, she rose from performing in New York clubs to signing with Clive Davis' Arista Records in 1983. Two years later, she released her self-titled debut album, which became the best-selling debut album by a solo artist. Houston made history by stringing together seven consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits. Her acting debut in The Bodyguard (1992) led to one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time and to her career-defining recording of Dolly Parton's “I Will Always Love You.” The Bodyguard soundtrack won album of the year at the 1994 Grammys, while that megahit single took record of the year. A six-time Grammy winner, Houston was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.


	For nearly six decades, Carlos Santana, 78, has been a pioneering force in music, fusing Afro-Latin, blues, rock, and jazz into a sound that transcends genre, culture and generation. He and his band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. They made Grammy history in 2000, receiving eight Grammys in a single night, tying Michael Jackson for the single-year Grammy record. Their haul included album of the year for Supernatural and record of the year for “Smooth,” a propulsive smash featuring Rob Thomas. A 10-time Grammy and three-time Latin Grammy winner, Carlos Santana received Billboard‘s Century Award in 1996 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013. His Las Vegas residency at House of Blues is now in its 14th year.


	Khan is a 10-time Grammy winner, a 2023 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee and a creative innovator whose influence reaches across genres – pop, R&B, jazz, rock, country, gospel, dance, classical, indie, and beyond. Her biggest solo hit, a cover of Prince's “I Feel for You,” featured a rap by Grandmaster Melle Mel and a harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder, bridging generations of R&B artist and sensibilities. Khan, 72, is a trailblazer, storyteller and the voice of power and freedom for many generations. She remains a living force in music – an artist whose work and life continue to inspire, elevate and redefine what is possible.


	Simon, 84, has shaped the sound of contemporary music for 60 years. Widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, he has received 16 Grammy Awards. He has won album of the year with three albums, record of the year with three singles, and song of the year once, for “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” one of the most universally admired songs of our time. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He was inducted as one-half of Simon & Garfunkel in 1990 and on his own in 2001. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982 and received that organization's top honor, the Johnny Mercer Award, in 1998. His accolades also include the Kennedy Center Honors, the inaugural Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the Polar Music Prize, and the Smithsonian's Great Americans Medal. In 2023, Simon released Seven Psalms, receiving his 36th Grammy nomination (best folk album) and inspiring the documentary In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon.


	Fela Kuti, who died in 1997 at age 58, was a Nigerian musician, producer, arranger, political radical, outlaw, and the father of Afrobeats. In the 1960s, he created the genre by combining funk, jazz, salsa, calypso, and a blend of traditional Nigerian rhythms. A titanic sociopolitical voice, Afrobeat's revolutionary politics brought Fela into violent conflict with successive Nigerian military regimes. Fela's influence and music catalog have been widely celebrated and explored, including the podcast series Fela Kuti: Fear No Man and the Broadway musical Fela!, which received 11 Tony nominations in 2010, winning three awards. Fela's influence spans generations, inspiring such wide-ranging artists as Beyoncé, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats. An annual celebration in his honor, Felabration, takes place in Lagos and around the world each October.


	As noted above, Taupin is this year's only Special Merit Award recipient who is also a 2026 Grammy nominee. He's nominated for best song written for visual media for “Never Too Late” from Elton John: Never Too Late. Incredibly, Taupin, 75, has yet to win a competitive Grammy.  Best known for his legendary partnership with Elton John, Taupin helped create one of the best-selling singles of all time, “Candle in the Wind 1997.” His achievements have earned him the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, a dozen Ivor Novello Awards, an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2023, and a Commander of the British Empire honor. He and John were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992 and received that organization's top honor, the Johnny Mercer Award, in 2013. A best-selling memoirist, Taupin continues to write across genres, most recently contributing to the Grammy-nominated album Who Believes in Angels? by John and Brandi Carlile. Taupin's Trustees Award is noteworthy because John has yet to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy (though he did receive the less defined Grammy Legend Award in 2000).


	Palmieri, who died on Aug. 6 at age 88, was a visionary pianist, composer, arranger and bandleader who took Afro-Caribbean music to new horizons for more than seven decades. Born in 1936 in Spanish Harlem to Puerto Rican parents, he began playing piano in childhood and launched his professional career in the 1950s. In 1961, he founded La Perfecta, replacing trumpets with trombones to forge a bold new sound that helped define modern salsa. His 1965 recording Azúcar Pa' Ti exemplified his groundbreaking works and was inducted into the Library of Congress in 2009. In 1975, Palmieri became the inaugural winner of best Latin recording for Sun of Latin Music.

She served in top posts at Atlantic, Elektra, Motown, and Epic, where she was named chairwoman and CEO in 2019. Rhone expanded the labels' global reach, overseeing career-defining releases across genres — from Travis Scott, Future, En Vogue, Metallica, Björk, and Tracy Chapman to Zara Larsson and Tyla — while playing a vital role in shaping the rise of hip-hop and championing female trailblazers including MC Lyte and Missy Elliott to Nicki Minaj.

After studying with Nadia Boulanger and earning his doctorate at Stanford, he launched the university's early computer-music program and developed the first digital algorithm for surround-sound localization. Stanford's licensing of his FM patent to Yamaha led to the most successful synthesis engine in the history of electronic instruments. A co-founder of Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics in 1974, Chowning helped establish one of the world's leading hubs for computer-music research. Even after retiring in 1996, he continued a teenage interest in exploring reverberant caves. His honors include election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the French Ordre des Arts et Lettres and the Giga-Hertz Award.

The star's label argues in new court papers that it followed proper licensing procedure for the dance hit.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Beyoncé's label and management company, Parkwood Entertainment, says in new court papers that it properly licensed the EDM sample that opens her 2022 Renaissance track “Alien Superstar.”


	Parkwood filed a motion on Wednesday (Dec. 17) to dismiss the copyright lawsuit brought this summer by indie label Soundmen on Wax Records, which claims to own the rights to the 1998 song “Moonraker.” Beyoncé sampled the song as the introduction to “Alien Superstar,” which hit No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. “Please do not be alarmed, remain calm/ Do not attempt to leave the dancefloor/ The DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot of the entire system,” the spoken-word “Moonraker” lyrics read.

Eric Frankenberg 













	It's undisputed that Parkwood cleared the sample; court filings show that the company bought both a recording and composition license from “Moonraker” artist John Holiday in exchange for $10,000 and a 0.5% share of the “Alien Superstar” royalties. What's in question, rather, is whether Holiday was the correct licensing party.


	Soundmen on Wax claims it purchased the “Moonraker” rights from Holiday as part of a distribution deal back in 1998, and therefore it should have been the one to clear Beyoncé's sample. But Parkwood maintains in Wednesday's court filing that it followed proper procedure.


	According to Parkwood's lawyers from Latham & Watkins, there's no paperwork documenting the supposed transfer of Holiday's rights to Soundmen on Wax. Without documentation, Parkwood says, it couldn't have been expected to know about conflicting claims to the “Moonraker” rights.


	“As plaintiff concedes, Parkwood obtained a master use and composition license for the relevant ‘Moonraker' sample from Holiday,” write the Parkwood lawyers. “That good faith, nonexclusive license prevails over plaintiff's alleged undocumented and undisclosed transfer, which was never recorded.”


	Parkwood argues that this glaring issue makes the whole lawsuit “meritless,” and it should be easily thrown out. Sony Music and Warner Chappell, both named as defendants in the lawsuit as well, are backing Parkwood's motion to dismiss. Beyoncé is not being sued.


Renaissance debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in August 2022 and was noted at the time for its extensive samples and interpolations. Some artists celebrated their references on the record, like “Show Me Love” singer Robin S, while others, such as “Milkshake” hitmaker Kelis, were less pleased.


	These many samples spurred multiple lawsuits. In addition to the “Alien Superstar” claims, a little-known New Orleans group sued Beyoncé last year over the chart-topping Renaissance lead single “Break My Soul.” That suit, which alleged the song's properly-cleared Big Freedia sample copied lyrics from a 2002 track called “Release a Wiggle,” was quickly dropped.

The Oklahoma native competed on season 10 of The Voice in 2016.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Kata Hay — an aspiring singer who competed on The Voice in 2016 — was arrested Wednesday on a vehicular homicide warrant, the Goodlettsville Police Department in Tennessee confirmed.


	Earlier in the week, police released a photo of Hay (real name: Kata Huddleston) on Facebook and asked for the public's assistance in locating her. “We have reason to believe that she may be enroute to Oklahoma and traveling with a white male and quite possibly towing a large camper,” the post reads in part.

	











	The Oklahoma native was picked up in her home state early Wednesday morning by a local sheriff's deputy and arrested on the Tennessee warrant.


	“The Goodlettsville Police Department would like to thank the multitude of citizens who called in with tips as to the location of Ms. Huddleston,” a follow-up Facebook post reads. “As a direct result we are pleased to announce that she was arrested early this morning in Oklahoma where she will be extradited back to Davidson County.”


	In addition to the vehicular homicide warrant, Hay has an open DUI case and is charged with leaving the scene of an accident with property damage estimated to be more than $1,500, and is accused of driving with an open container of alcohol, all stemming from a Dec. 10 incident, according to TMZ.

	











	Hay was also arrested and convicted in 2022 for having sexual contact with a minor and was sentenced to six months in jail.


	During her blind audition for The Voice season 10, three of the four coaches turned their chairs for Hay's performance of Gretchen Wilson's “Redneck Woman”: Pharrell Williams, Adam Levine and her eventual coach Christina Aguilera. Her audition made headlines when she admitted that Aguilera was her “first girl crush” and they shared an onstage kiss. Hay made it through the battle and knockout rounds to the top 20 before being eliminated in week 1 of the live playoffs.


	Hay will go before a district court judge in Oklahoma on Monday to sign a waiver of extradition, according to TMZ.

Grande previewed her ""SNL"" gig this weekend, including meeting Cher, and revealed what kind of present wrapper she is on Thursday night's (Dec. 18) ""Late Night.""


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	You should forgive Ariana Grande if you're on her Christmas list and your present doesn't come exactly on time, or wrapped like you might expect. She's, you know, kind of busy still promoting Wicked: For Good and her return to Saturday Night Live this weekend for the fifth time with musical guest Cher. But she did take time out on Thursday night (Dec. 18) to chat with Seth Meyers for the first time on Late Night, where she explained what kind of Christmas person she is while also revealing the one Wicked tie-in item that kind of gives her the willies.

	Asked if she manages to buy gifts for everyone on her list amid her busy schedule, Grande said she tried to get as much of her shopping done as possible before the brutal scheduled of her SNL week. “I've been managing to wrap some of the gifts in the morning before I leave for SNL, and then when I get home I'm usually too tired,” said Grande.




	Meyers, who thanked Grande for showing up in exactly the kind of outfit he'd expect from good witch Glinda, a long, gauzy princess dress fit for a ball, wondered if she had magical wrapping skills as well.


	“I think it looks… well-intentioned,” Grande admitted of her gift wrapping skills. “I think it's the thought that counts. And I do feel guilty about the amount of tape used. That's gotta be bad, but I make up for it in other ways… It's hideous, but it's with love.” 


	As for her favorite Christmas tradition, Grande paid homage to her beloved Nonna — who died in June at 99 years old — revealing that her go-to holiday activity was baking traditional Italian Zeppole donut-like treats with her late grandma. “My mission this year is to come up with a plant-based Zeppole. She would not like that, maybe I won't actually.” 


	After talking about the emotionally taxing filming of the Wicked movies and how the role of Glinda came at the perfect time in her career, Meyers asked Grande to pivot to the mountain of Wicked tie-in merchandise that many boys and girls (and men and women) will likely find under their trees this year. “Was there a particular piece of merch that you were most covetous of when you saw it?,” he wondered.


	“First of all, my mom has everything,” Grande said. “She went a little too hard. And I was like, ‘Mom, it's okay, Universal, they're gonna send it, it's okay!' And then she'd be like, ‘No, no, no, no, I need, like, 30!” Grande said a few of the items, though, were “a little disturbing. Like the pink and green — I hope this is okay to say — the pink and green, was it mac and cheese that they did?” 


	“Yeah, I think it's fair to say that's disturbing,” Meyers assured Grande. 

	











	“That was when I knew, ‘Oh, this is big!',” Grande said. “It's a little bigger than I thought.”


	Grande also revealed that she had just been introduced to this weekend's musical guest on SNL, Cher, who she had not met until they filmed the promos for the show earlier this week. “I mean, she's just the one and only. It was so spectacular. And she's just brilliant and I'm so excited,” Grande said of the music icon who will be marking her return to the sketch show for the first time in nearly 40 years this weekend.

In the live-action series based on Ubisoft's bestselling video game franchise, she joins previously cast leads Toby Wallace and Lola Petticrew and fellow series regular Zachary Hart.


Assassin's Creed is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny.

	Showrunners Roberto Patino and David Wiener executive produce alongside Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole.


	With more than 230 million units sold, Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the bestselling series in video game history.


	This marks Marcus' second Netflix series; she can be seen in the streamer's limited series Death By Lighting as former U.S. president James Garfield's (Michael Shannon) daughter Mollie Garfield. She recently recurred on Season 2 of Disney+'s Andor and next stars as Silka in The Hunger Games prequel Sunrise on the Reaping. 


	English actress Marcus, whose series credits also include Starz's The Serpent Queen, BBC's Bad Education and The Jetty and Prime Video's The Devil's Hour, is repped by Conway Van Gelder Grant, Luber Roklin Entertainment and Michael A. Auerbach.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


	Toho, the Japanese anime company behind Godzilla Minus One, is setting up a regional European headquarters in the UK for its overseas business division, Toho Global.


	At the same time, Toho has reached an agreement to acquire all shares in Glasgow-based Anime Limited from Germany's Plaion Pictures and make it a subsidiary of the new European base. Tokyo-based Toho Global and Munich-based Plaion will become “preferred partners” in Europe through a strategic alliance.


	Financial terms of the deal was not disclosed. Toho said the impact of the acquisition could be “negligible” on this year's consolidated financial results, but noted the focus is on the “medium- to long-term,” and that the deal was part of its Toho Vision 2032 Group Management Strategy. This is based on four verticals: Planning and IP, animation, digital, and overseas.

	Toho plans to use Anime as its conduit into the UK and France, focusing on theatrical distribution, home video and streaming for anime titles, and will work closely with Plaion to target Germany, Italy and other European countries on local marketing and distribution.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Andrew Partridge, the founder and Managing Director of Anime, will join the leadership team of Toho's European regional headquarters. The Euro base will work across theatrical distribution, TV/streaming, home video, merchandise, and games for anime and select live-action IP.


	This comes just over a year after Toho acquired U.S.-based animation distributor GKids, which sits under the L.A.-based Toho International, and the launch of a central Asian hub in Singapore, Toho Entertainment Asia. Toho also owns 25% of Fifth Season.

	











	Toho Global pointed to the European anime market being worth an estimated $4.77B in 2024, with projections suggesting it will hit $9.05B by 2030 with an average annual growth rate of 11.2% over the next five years, thanks to increasing penetration, a diverse range of anime services and expanding merchandising sales. While Studio Ghibli films have always been popular in the UK, there has been a noticeable rise in anime's visibility around Europe over recent years. 


	For Toho, the plan is to maximize the value of properties such as Godzilla through the three European businesses working in lockstep. Its 2023 pic, Godzilla Minus One, was a big international box office hit, taking $116M, and won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. A sequel, Godzilla Minus Zero, is set to drop next year.


	Koji Ueda, President and Representative Director at Toho Global, said: “This move accelerates the timeline to realize the ‘Toho Vision 2032 Group Management Strategy' by giving Toho an immediate pan-European distribution capability as well as access to Plaion Pictures' highly additive infrastructure for merchandise operations. We look forward to working together with our new team members and partners to bring amazing content to fans in the UK, France and across the continent.”


	Anime's Partridge added: “Both myself and the team have long loved working together on Toho properties, as evident from making Godzilla Minus One, the best Japanese live-action box office hit of all time in the UK. We look forward to becoming part of the Toho family and working closer and more collaboratively with its group companies to expand the interest of anime across our territories. I look forward to continuing to work with Anime Limited both during the transition and from my new role at Toho's European regional headquarters.”


	Stefan Kapelari, Managing Director of Plaion said: “Anime Ltd is exceptionally well positioned in the anime market,” adding: “The sale to Toho creates entirely new growth opportunities for Anime Ltd. in the UK and France through strong synergies across content, distribution, and marketing. We would like to thank Andrew Partridge and the entire Anime Ltd. team for their dedication and outstanding collaboration over the past four years, and we wish them every success in this forward-looking new constellation.”

	“Since 2018, SMEJ has been proud to be part of the partnership behind ‘Peanuts', an iconic global entertainment brand with a 75-year legacy of delighting audiences worldwide,” said Shunsuke Muramatsu, President and Group CEO, Sony Music Entertainment (Japan). “With this additional ownership stake, we are thrilled to be able to further elevate the value of the ‘Peanuts' brand by drawing on the Sony Group's extensive global network and collective expertise. We are deeply committed to carrying forward the legacy of Charles Schulz and the Schulz family. Together with SPE, and backed by WildBrain's continued partnership, we will continue to embrace new opportunities to ensure that ‘Peanuts' remains a relevant and beloved presence across generations — reaching new audiences and sharing the timeless charm of the ‘Peanuts' gang for years ahead.”

	











	Said SPE president and CEO Ravi Ahuja: ” ‘Peanuts' is enduring and iconic. We value the deep collaboration we have with our SMEJ colleagues and look forward to building on their meaningful partnership with WildBrain and the Schulz family. With our combined strengths, we have the unique capability and extraordinary opportunity to protect and shape the future of these beloved characters for generations to come.”


	Created by Schulz and first introduced as a comic strip in October 2, 1950, the Peanuts gang has been an indelible presence in pop culture via its TV series on specials (currently available as part of a deal with Apple TV), consumer products, amusement park attractions, cultural events, social events, social media, and comics from traditional to digital formats.


	Toronto-based Wildbrain has held majority rights to the Peanuts brand since 2017 when, as DHX Media, it acquired Peanuts and Strawberry Shortcake rightsholder Iconix Brand Group for $345 million.


	Under terms of the Sony deal, Wildbrain will remain the exclusive licensing agent through WildBrain CPLG for consumer products in all current territories across Europe, the Middle East, China, and Asia Pacific (excluding Japan & ANZ); the exclusive production studio for new Peanuts content — including the previously announced feature film — under an expansive partnership with Apple TV, recently renewed through 2030; and distributor of WildBrain-produced Peanuts content and continued management of the Snoopy YouTube channel.


	“Sony has been an excellent partner on the ‘Peanuts' brand for many years, and we're confident that Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the gang are in good hands with them,” Wildbrain president and CEO Josh Scherba said. “We'd like to thank the Peanuts Worldwide team, as well as the Schulz family, for their incredible collaboration, and we look forward to working with them and Sony going forward to continue driving global success for ‘Peanuts'.”


	Wildbrain says it will use the proceeds to eliminate its debt, accelerate growth of its Strawberry Shortcake and Teletubbies franchises, and invest in its digital content network across its YouTube, FAST and AVOD channels.


	Apple TV has been ramping up its Peanuts content since making a rights deal in 2020, in October inking a five-year extension to be the exclusive streaming home. That deal also includes new series and specials and an animated feature that was announced in late 2023 from some of the team behind 2015 then-20th Century Fox feature film The Peanuts Move, including director Steve Martino.

Taylor Swift made rare comments about her “rough” breakups with longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn and on-again, off-again fling Matty Healy on “End of an Era.”

“I went through two breakups in the first half of this tour and that's a lot of breakups, actually,” Swift said on episode four of her Disney+ docuseries. 

She noted that the show gave her “purpose” and helped her “get out of bed” despite the “s–t that was going on.”

“Men will let you down. The Eras Tour never will,” Swift added.

The “Opalite” singer also discussed recording her 11th album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” which had many references to both Alwyn and Healy.

She explained how the album was “everything bad [she] felt for two years” and a “rough time in [her] life.”

“I'm a big conglomerate no one sees as a human being, especially not the men that I date,” she said. “Nothing works, there is no one for me in the world.”

On episode three, Swift commended her crew and loved ones for helping her through the hard times.

“It's so wonderful being able to carry a professional family with you as you go through phases of life, as you go through ups and downs and heartbreaks,” Swift gushed.

Swift, 36, and Alwyn, 34, broke up in 2023 after six years together.

Alwyn was spotted supporting Swift at a March Eras Tour show before their split. 

Swift's “The Tortured Poets Department” had various songs about her split with the actor, including “So Long, London,” “Loml” and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.”

Swift has had an on-again, off-again romance with Healy, 36, through the years, as they dated before her romance with Alwyn. 

The “Elizabeth Taylor” singer and The 1975 frontman reconnected soon after her split from the actor, as they were spotted on a date at New York City's Casa Cipriani in May 2023.

“The Tortured Poets Department,” “Guilty as Sin,” “Down Bad,” “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and other songs are references to Healy. 

The latter tune appears to give insight into their June 2023 split, as she sings, “You tried to buy some pills / From a friend of friends of mine” and “they just ghosted you, now you know what it feels like.”

Of course, Swift moved on with now-fiance, Travis Kelce, who she began dating in the summer of 2023 after he called her out on his “New Heights” podcast.

Look what Taylor Swift's mom made her do.

Andrea Swift encouraged her daughter to pursue Travis Kelce after the Kansas City Chiefs player's viral “New Heights” episode, she revealed on Friday's new “End of an Era” docuseries episodes.

Andrea, 67, recalled seeing headlines about the athlete's interest in the pop star while looking “around on the internet.”

She subsequently called her cousin, whom she considers an “expert” on the Missouri-based NFL team, to ask about the Super Bowl winner.

Andrea reflected on this with Taylor in her dressing room ahead of an October 2024 Eras Tour stop in New Orleans, saying, “She said, ‘Oh, my God. He's the nicest guy. And you know what? He really loves his mom, [Donna Kelce].'”

“I went, Ding, ding, ding. Now, how in the world am I gonna get her to meet him?” she asked, with Taylor confirming that her dating history had indeed skewed “non-athlete.”

Additionally, Andrea noted that Travis' gesture — bringing a friendship bracelet with his phone number to a show in the hopes of giving it to Taylor — “said a lot” about his character.

“It was so earnest,” she explained. “I thought it was the sweetest thing in the world that he came to your show, he brought you something from your world … I liked it.”

At the time, Andrea spoke to Taylor on the phone about Travis' interest.

“You called me up with this tone of, ‘Hey, so I know you're not gonna react well to this. But there's a guy,'” the Grammy winner remembered. “You said something to the effect of, ‘You've got to start doing something different.'”

Andrea added that Travis is “really cute.”

Taylor and Travis ultimately began dating in July 2023, with the tight end getting down on one knee in August.

When the first trailer for Taylor's Eras Tour docuseries dropped the following month, Andrea made headlines for gushing about the “happiness” her daughter's fiancé brings.

The duo are expected to tie the knot in June, with Page Six hearing they want to walk down the aisle at Rhode Island's Ocean House in Watch Hill.

Episodes 1 through 4 of “End of an Era” are streaming on Disney+, with the final two coming out Dec. 23.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The human impulse of SML is impossible to replicate","https://www.avclub.com/sml-the-best-of-whats-next","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:42:40 GMT","

To find SML's beginnings, you have to go back to ETA, a cocktail bar in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The space opened in 2016, thanks to the work of James Bygrave, Ryan Julio, and Matt Glassman. Julio was especially influential in allowing bands and players to “try things out” at the bar. The goal wasn't “selling the most tickets,” but establishing a community-focused, music-driven venue. There aren't many places like that here anymore—the Griffin in Atwater Village got renamed the High Low Bar and the Blue Whale didn't make it out of COVID, though there are plans in place for it to re-open soon. “ETA seemed like it had carved out a niche for itself as a place for creative music,” guitarist Jeff Parker says. “Jazz is a very marginalized community in a place like LA, the entertainment hub of the Western world—commercial music being a big part of that.” ETA, thanks to Julio and Parker, helped to forge an identity for Los Angeles radicals, for musicians relocating to Hollywood from New York or Chicago.

For seven years, Parker and his IVtet—saxophonist Josh Johnson, bassist Anna Butterss, and drummer Jay Bellerose—were doing gigs at ETA almost every Monday as a way “to keep myself busy and keep my brain and my chops together” upon Parker's relocation to Los Angeles from Chicago. It was his new Rodan. Jeremiah Chiu, a brilliant synthesist who'd left Chicago in 2014 and sought out spaces “that program the way that Ryan was programming” upon his arrival in Hollywood, went to those initial IVtet gigs in 2017—when there were only ten people in the audience watching “some of the most incredible people playing music today.” It was a place he'd go to see musicians hanging out with musicians, or to meet deep music lovers who'd stopped by for a glimpse at that special weekly thing. Low crowd totals didn't negate the work being done to cultivate the ETA community.

Eventually, Julio and Bryce Gonzalez started recording all of the IVtet's sets—an “exercise for himself,” as Parker puts it. “I think Bryce brought some of this stuff into the public sphere because he was archiving it,” Chiu explains. “And had it not been archived and recorded and people were able to hear those recordings, I don't know that people would be talking about it the same way.” Once Mondays at the Enfield Tennis Academy dropped in 2022, more folks started tuning in. “Suddenly, there were a bunch of people there who none of us had ever seen before, and they were young,” Butterss says. “They were a bunch of 22-year-olds who were really excited.” Parker concurs, remembering how “every time we played, man, the place was jam-packed. There were lines down the block.” It was serendipitous and mostly happenstance—not only that a community and a scene had grown around Parker and the IVtet, but that Gonzalez had documented it all to boot.

SML was born out of that documentation—out of the work that Parker, Butterss, Bellerose, and Johnson had put into ETA for a near-decade. Chiu and guitarist Gregory Uhlmann had been talking about playing together for a long time, and Julio set aside two nights at ETA for them in late 2022. On night one, it was a trio of them and Johnson. The next night, it was a quartet of Uhlmann, Chiu, Booker Stardrum, and Butterss. Six months down the road, the five of them returned to ETA and did four shows together, eventually turning the recordings into a debut album, Small Medium Large—which was captured by Gonzalez on a Nagra and arranged and edited in post, in an effort to expand Teo Macero and Miles Davis' style of editing on In a Silent Way and Get Up With It.

ETA closed down in 2023, in large part because Julio had partnered with a lot of business-minded folk with no investment in the music community. Parker says he and his peers didn't have a chance to try and preserve the space. “The music there, it started to feel important,” he continues. “I say that in the most modest way possible, but there was some shit happening that needed to be preserved.” Julio now books nights at Covell, where Uhlmann recently played a show. “There were probably seven to ten people there,” he recalls. “And Ryan was so excited. I was like, ‘Yeah, this is cool. There's no one here and you're so stoked.' I was remembering back to how unconcerned he was with any business aspects of [ETA]. He was so excited about just the thing itself, which was really encouraging.” Butterss concurs, complimenting Julio's background of playing in bands as formative to his all-in perspective on community. “For him, it's a party. It's having musicians he looks up to in his bar, hanging out, and playing. It's rare to find someone who just has that much love for it—that's willing to go along with all the really hard work and little payoff.”

SML has since relocated to Zebulon in Frogtown, because the venue allows them to attack their preferred method of performance: “in the round, on the floor—a little bit more intimate, doing two sets that are fully improvised in our own way,” as Chiu defines it. At Zebulon, SML uses the spirit of ETA to nourish their own creativity. The band benefitted the community that the IVtet gathered at ETA, because that community has been able to follow all the artists who were involved in that space to other venues. The switchover isn't perfect, but it's comfortable. “Zebulon is a bigger space [than ETA]. They have higher overheads and need to bring in more people and book things that are maybe a little less experimental sometimes, to make that work,” Butterss says. “ETA worked because we were given complete free rein to play however long we wanted, what we wanted, with who we wanted.”

SML may be an LA project, but its roots are planted in the Midwest. Butterss grew up in Adelaide, Australia, but went to school at Indiana University in Bloomington, where they met Johnson and witnessed the region's isolated geography bleed into the art being made there. “Sometimes it feels like the stuff you're doing is not necessarily making an impact in the larger world,” they say. “I think that actually allows you to be more experimental and try different things, because the stakes are lower. LA can have this sheen to it—the pressure is on.” Chiu, Uhlmann, and Johnson all spent time in Chicago, in Jeff Parker's orbit. Ulhmann studied at DePaul University under Bob Palmieri, figuring out the city's emphasis on “having your own voice more than being the best player technically,” he explains. “That attitude of experimentation was encouraged, and what was exciting was people like Parker, Hamid Drake, and Rob Mazurek—people with really unique voices who were not as well-known at that time outside of Chicago. But they were heroes to a lot of people growing up there.”

Chiu says he's fortunate to have been in Chicago when the Sea and Cake, Parker's band Tortoise, Jim O'Rourke, and Mazurek were shaping the city, introducing young musicians to faraway ideas, like Steve Reich, tropicália, and Brazilian music. “It expanded the palette for myself, growing up in a scene where, if you're trying to play music or be in a group, you have to find a new, deep reference that's your own and find a way to navigate it,” he continues. “I remember, if you were going to do a cover tune for a show, you would always look for the most obscure cover to do so that the one or two heads in the audience would recognize it—versus how, in LA, I remember coming here and people were doing Peter Gabriel bands in full. It's the opposite approach, which I love.”



SMALL MEDIUM LARGE CAME OUT in 2024 and features one of my favorite songs of this decade, “Three Over Steel”—a looping, intuitive, chromatic jazz tune that calls back to Can, Susumu Yokota, and Fela Kuti. SML wasn't even a band when the album dropped, Chiu reveals. “In the time of that album forming, the idea of this group was also forming. We hadn't ever played as a unit like that.” Chiu spent a lot of time in the front traversing through the album recordings, editing the tracks. Eventually everyone put a hand in and finished the thing. There's a lot less post-production on SML recordings than you'd think. For example: what sounds like a very edited, well-cohered piece of sampling was captured and finished by Chiu almost totally live.

But SML's live performances and recordings are two very distinct entities that inform how each member approaches the group. “When we are playing live, we're not trying to recreate anything that was on a record,” Chiu explains. “When we're making records, we're trying to think about the narrative of that particular record and pull together elements that we feel capture the essence of what this thing is, but not in an entirely longform way.” All the ideas proliferate out of the live performance. Everyone in the band has a palette that is so much further-reaching than the instrument you might see in their hands, or the sound you might associate with them. When SML dove into the stems of Small Medium Large, the expressions they found on the tapes were distinct and unexpected. They couldn't always tell who was playing what. When it was time to edit the next album, How You Been, multi-track recordings allowed everyone to reinterpret everybody's parts. “At the shows, we're all making decisions together,” Uhlmann says, “but when you take it home, you're making the decisions and then bringing it to the group. It was an interesting look into people's visions of what we're doing live.” When Johnson brought in his “Gutteral Utterance” edit, he presented his bandmates with this shocking, inexplicable distortion of sounds.

SML leave me speechless. I find their work to be incomprehensible. Indescribable. I've never heard anyone make anything like it. “We're playing intuitively together,” Butterss affirms. “We have an understanding of what's going on and a connection in that way, but I do think it's hard to put it into words that make sense.” SML is early Kraftwerk, electric Miles Davis or electric Herbie Hancock. It's Cluster. It's not a jazz band, but it also kind of is? Chiu certainly doesn't consider his role in the group to follow the genre's structure. “We aren't intentionally situating ourselves in that mode,” he elaborates. Butterss, Uhlmann, and Stardrum play exceptionally well in that language, but Chiu comes to it from a much more experimental, electronic world—a byproduct of knowing Jim Baker's improvisational ARP synth recordings, no doubt. “I came to it from the desire to be able to operate in a more improvised context and collaborate with different people. That's the most important part. Being able to improvise or play off of it in ways that aren't tethered to how we're thinking today about modern electronic music or noise music or experimental music, but it's this hybrid of all these things coming together.”

The band “grew out of improvisation,” Uhlmann adds. “Something I'm drawn to, in every musician that I play with regularly, is that their voice goes beyond the instrument. It's like talking to someone: you're going to have a different chemistry with different friends and different groups. Playing with a group of five people definitely feels different, and there's more energy to bounce off of. Being in a band feels like being in a polyamorous relationship. When you bring more people in, this different chemistry starts happening and it ends up being one thing more than the individual.” The point of an improviser, Parker reckons, is to get to the stuff that you don't know. He passes onto me a Sun Ra quote passed onto him by Avreeayl Ra: “If you start from a finite place, you're only dealing with the things you know. But if you start from infinity, then you can go into the things that you don't know. And you can discover new things.” SML's music, resistant to prompt, is challenging in infinite ways.

Butterss brings a lot of what they learned from playing with Parker and the IVtet to SML. “There have been weeks with the IVtet where it feels really stuck in a rut, and that can be really frustrating,” they admit. “You have a choice: you can either sit back into your role and let it stay static, or you can push through it.” SML is always trying to push through it. “And we trust each other to capably do so,” Chiu acknowledges. “All of us are going to find a way out in an unexpected or new way. That's why we do two nights in a row with multiple sets—because [the tension] doesn't always hit at every moment, but that struggle is part of it.” Uhlmann concurs: “It's always been, ‘What haven't we done that we can find?' Maybe you hear us finding that sometimes. It brings everyone into the same listening space in a nice way, when we're all finding it together.” It's like having a “musical ESP” with each other, as Chiu puts it.

After playing more shows together and revisiting Small Medium Large more often, Buttress believes that SML has a “band sound” now. “But I don't know if any of us could individually sit down and define what that sound is,” they say. “I think we all have an idea in our heads of what our band sounds like.” It's marvelously true, considering how spread out the members of SML so often are. Butterss has become an in-demand bandmate, touring with Andrew Bird and Jason Isbell in recent years, while Johnson works with Leon Bridges and Uhlmann (when he's not doing improvisational guitar doubles with Meg Duffy or polyrhythmic ambient with Johnson and Sam Wilkes) travels the globe playing guitar in Perfume Genius. But they always get back to each other to break away from the fatigue and rigidity of tour setlists, of playing by routine. No two SML sets sound the same, and they never will. “I think what we're doing right now, having an opportunity to do the thing that we love doing the most, which is play together for multiple nights, we've already started saying, ‘What new things can we do? What different ways can we approach this?'” Chiu says. “Without speaking about the actual music or logistics, we just bring something to the table that we've been investigating on our own and see how it plays into the fold. That feels really special.”

Those investigations play out in real-time onstage. And there's tension in doing so, in on-the-fly ideas getting road-tested without pretense. “People find their roles in a group and then they'll lean into those and stay there,” Chiu explains. “Ours are always shifting.” At a recent show, Butterss started playing bass and their bandmates just left them out there to solo. Then, Johnson came in with just shaker. “And then I was like, ‘I'm joining Josh on shaker,'” Chiu remembers. “It puts you in a position to be like, ‘What's happening now?' All of us are feeling that tension. Then you listen back and you hear it… That's so special, because it forced somebody to make a decision in a different way. We're always trying to push that boundary a little bit. I think it's evolving.” You can't always hear that on SML's records, but it's there—like the break in “Taking out the Trash,” where Uhlmann and Stardrum come in hard on Chiu and Butterss' beat, which Butterss can only define as shzoop. 

Think of SML as freakout code-writers. “Taking out the Trash” begins like a pulse in a cut, with Butterss' crunchy bass lyrics colliding with Stardrum's snare just beneath it. Then, Uhlmann's skronking guitar chimes in before the whole thing erupts into a voice that streaks in every way but parallel. The lights dim on “Mouth Words” and the Uhlmann's caveman, Neil Young-style beat and Butterss' ostinato bass line turn on. There's the call-and-response between Uhlmann and Johnson in “Daves”; the Krautrock daydream of “Moving Walkway”; the reverb surroundings engulfing “Brood Board SHROOM”; the poked, prodded, and manipulated tape sounds in the aptly-titled “Gutteral Utterance.” How You Been sounds cohesive, tethered—even in the madness of its kosmische, house, acid, Afrobeat, and techno chaos, where theory and feel get synthesized into mind-melting overtures of pedal tones, modules, and DAWs.

But I'm most drawn to how alive “Chicago Four” sounds, with Johnson's sludgy horn shots and Chiu's calibrating synth passages that play a song of their own. SML brings new meaning to the idea of a “collective.” Everything they do is in lockstep with each other, even when the music sounds like every member is doing something totally different inside it. “Chicago Four” reveals an almost hypnotic loop of contrasts. It's as much an industrial synth-pop song as it is a jazz-funk lick. The music is all over the place yet never out of chemistry or sync. Improvisation is essential to SML, but there's gotta be a word for whatever exists beyond that. The shared human impulse between Anna Butterss, Jeremiah Chiu, Josh Johnson, Booker Stardrum, and Gregory Uhlmann is one of a kind, impossible to replicate.

He was 82. Gerard died Tuesday in Georgia after battling “a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,” his wife, Janet, announced in a Facebook post. 

The Arkansas-born actor became a familiar face on television through sci-fi and drama, and in an unusually candid later chapter of his life.

Gerard rose to fame as Capt. William Anthony “Buck” Rogers, a NASA and U.S. Air Force pilot accidentally frozen in space and awakened centuries later, in NBC's “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.” The lighthearted sci-fi series ran from 1979 to 1981 and was preceded by a feature-length television movie that became an unexpected hit.

The role nearly passed him by. Gerard later admitted he was hesitant to take it on.

“I saw what it did to Adam West's career with Batman, and this was another cartoon character. I didn't want to do this campy stuff,” he said in a 2018 interview.

Ultimately, he agreed to star in the project, and the “Buck Rogers” movie finished among the top 25 domestic box office releases of 1979. 

The film was later retooled into the show's two-hour pilot episode. The series ran for two seasons, producing 32 episodes, and ended in April 1981.

In later years, Gerard reflected on what made the character resonate with audiences.

“I thought the character had a sense of reality about him,” he said in 2017. “The sense of humor, I liked very much, and his humanity, I liked. I thought it was kind of cool. He wasn't a stiff kind of guy. He was a guy who could solve problems on his feet, and he wasn't a superhero.”

Born Gilbert Cyril Gerard on January 23, 1943, in Little Rock, Arkansas, he was the youngest of three boys. His father worked as a knife salesman, and his mother was a teacher.

After graduating from Little Rock Catholic High, Gerard studied at Arkansas State Teacher College before moving to New York in 1969. He trained at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and supported himself by driving a cab.

One passenger helped him land an audition for “Love Story.” Though his scene was cut, Gerard worked on the film for weeks and soon found steady work in commercials, appearing in more than 400 ads by his own count, as confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter.

Gerard later spoke candidly about lifelong struggles with weight and health. He became the focus of the 2007 Discovery Health Channel documentary “Action Hero Makeover,” which followed his decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery after his weight reached 350 pounds.

In a 1990 interview with People, Gerard estimated that overeating had cost him nearly $1 million in lost work opportunities over the years.

Gerard was married four times, including a high-profile marriage to actress Connie Sellecca from 1979 to 1987. He is survived by Janet, his wife of 18 years, and his son, Gib.

In a final message shared on his Facebook account, Gerard reflected on his life with gratitude and perspective.

“My life has been an amazing journey. The opportunities I've had, the people I've met and the love I have given and received have made my 82 years on the planet deeply satisfying. … Don't waste your time on anything that doesn't thrill you or bring you love. See you out somewhere in the cosmos.”

For fans of classic television and science fiction, Gil Gerard leaves behind a legacy rooted in humor, honesty, and a hero who felt unmistakably human.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Today' Host Announces Health Battle: ‘This Is My Last Day for a Little While'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/today-savannah-guthrie-surgery-health/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:20:20 GMT","

“TODAY” host Savannah Guthrie announced on Friday, December 19, that she will be undergoing surgery that will force her to step away from her hosting role for weeks. 

Guthrie, 53, opened up about a health battle she has been dealing with for years. During the Friday, December 19, episode of “TODAY,” the cohost revealed she will be undergoing a vocal surgery ahead of the holiday that will force her to take a break from work going into the new year. 

“Some of you have noticed that my voice has been very scratchy and started to crack a little bit,” Guthrie told viewers on Friday. “Well, I have found out what it is. I have vocal nodules and I also have a polyp. It's not a big, big deal, but I am going to have to have a surgery early in the new year and be off for a couple of weeks, so this is my last day for a little while.”

During her recovery, Guthrie will have to remain “totally silent” for a couple weeks, which she joked would be an “early” Christmas gift for her family. 

Guthrie's cohost and longtime friend, Sheinelle Jones, revealed she previously underwent the same surgery. 

“The silver lining is you have permission to be still,” Jones shared. “The house gets quiet, the kids are gonna want to help you out.”

She then presented a useful gift to her costar before her departure: A whiteboard. 

“A lot of the greats in the business have done it, maybe you'll come out singing like, I don't know, Celine Dion,” Jones joked. 

According to Guthrie, she's “really excited” about finally having the surgery and putting this issue in the past. 

“This has been going on for years, honestly,” she told her cohosts. 

This will not be the first time Guthrie has stepped away from her hosting job to recovery from surgery. 

The mother of two was forced to take a break in 2019 to undergo eye surgery to reattach her right retina after her 3-year-old son accidentally hit her with a toy train.

“The retinal tear had deteriorated sharply, and I lost my vision,” she told People at the time. “And that's what happens if you don't fix this: You lose your sight.”

She added, “That was the first time I felt freaked out. I was hoping that they weren't going to get in there and see, ‘Oh, it's worse than we thought. We can't fix it.' That was probably the lowest I felt, because I was just really scared.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Greg Biffle & 6 Other People Pass Away in Plane Crash","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/greg-biffle-plane-crash-family-statement/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:10:56 GMT","

On Thursday, December 18, it was reported that a small private plane had “exploded into a fireball while landing in inclement weather at Statesville Regional Airport in Statesville,” People reports. 

The crash claimed seven lives, and the identities of the passengers were later shared publicly. Those who died were NASCAR legend Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina Grossu Biffle, their young son Ryder, and Biffle's daughter Emma from his relationship with ex-wife Nicole Lunders. The other passengers have been named as Dennis Dutton and his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth, People reports. The families of those impacted by the plane crash have released a statement expressing their heartache. 

The Biffle family had been on their way to Florida for a birthday celebration when the tragic incident occurred. “We are devastated by the loss of our loved ones. This tragedy has left all of our families heartbroken beyond words,” the statement from the Biffle, Grossu, Dutton, and Lunders families reads. It was shared on X by Fox Sports motorsports reporter Bob Pockrass. 

The message also shares a bit about each family, highlighting who they were and the impact they had on those who loved them. “Greg and Cristina were devoted parents and active philanthropists whose lives were centered around their young son Ryder and Greg's daughter Emma (mother – Nicole Lunders),” the statement reads. “Emma was a wonderful human being with a kind soul who was loved by many people. Ryder was an active, curious and infinitely joyful child.”

Of the Duttons and of Wadsworth the message reads, “Dennis Dutton and his son Jack were deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them. Craig Wadsworth was beloved by many in the NASCAR community and will be missed by those who knew him.” The families asked for privacy while they were grieving. 

The post has attracted a lot of attention on X, with fans eager to share their condolences and pay their respects. “I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending you love and prayers,” a fan shared. 

“What a dark day for the sport,” another fan shared. “Biffle was an outstanding race car driver, but he was an even better human being. He helped out with hurricane relief more than the government did on his own dime. Delivered them personally with his own fleet. Rest in peace to all involved.” 

Fans also remarked on what a wonderful, giving family the Biffles were. “So heartbreaking. Besides his Nascar career, he volunteered so much time, money, and effort to assist and rescue the people in Ashville and the Carolinas,” a third fan shared. “He was a good man, and my heart breaks for his whole family.”

Launches New ‘Contemporary' Film Label Led by Departing Neon Exec Christian Parkes","https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/warner-bros-new-contemporary-film-label-christian-parkes-1235169156/","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:56:22 GMT","

With the Sundance Film Festival just a month away, a potential new film buyer is emerging on the market. 

Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group heads Pamela Abdy and Michael de Luca are launching a new label that will specialize in global theatrical releases of “contemporary” films, IndieWire has confirmed. The currently untitled division will be led by departing Neon Chief Marketing Officer Christian Parkes, who announced his plans to leave the indie distributor on December 12.

He'll be joined by Neon colleagues Jason Walde, who will serve as Head of Acquisitions & Production; and Spencer Collantes, who will be named VP, Marketing & Creative.

Parkes, whose official title at the new venture will be Chief Content Officer, is known for overseeing Neon's marketing during its Best Picture-winning Oscar campaigns for “Parasite” and “Anora.” Other major releases under his leadership included “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Triangle of Sadness,” “Titane,” and “Longlegs.”

 










“We firmly believe in the power of storytelling and have worked to create a home at the studio for filmmakers who share the high standards of creative excellence that Warner Bros. has upheld for over a century,” Abdy and De Luca said in a statement. “As the global theatrical marketplace continues to embrace fresh ideas and welcome new audiences, we are excited that Christian will lead our efforts to amplify the voices of bold, audacious, and original storytellers. The new label will fearlessly champion unique perspectives from both established and emerging talent, and we are grateful to David Zaslav and the company's leadership for their ongoing passion and support in making this label possible.”

“I've spent my life marveling at the Cinema of Warner Bros.; my education came from Peckinpah, Miller, Friedkin, and Kubrick. To be a part of this studio's future and the transformative change that Pam and Mike are creating is an honor and an exhilarating opportunity to collaborate with some of the world's best filmmakers,” Parkes added. 

The announcement comes after a year of high highs and significant uncertainty for Warner Bros. The film division dominated Hollywood in 2025, releasing critically acclaimed blockbusters such as “Sinners,” “One Battle After Another,” “Weapons,” and “F1.” The hits turned Abdy and De Luca into the toast of Hollywood despite beginning the year with public uncertainty about their job status after “Joker: Folie a Deux” flopped in 2024. 

 










But those theatrical successes did not prevent the studio from being put up for sale, and Netflix agreed to acquire it after winning a bidding war that also included Paramount. If the $82.7 billion dollar deal closes, it will put the Warner Bros. brand under the control of Netflix, which has been famously averse to theatrical distribution. Many expect the studio's exclusive theatrical windows to significantly shrink, and it remains to be seen how that will impact plans for the new theatrically focused label.

For now, a new potential buyer will be welcomed at Sundance. The new division will join a small group of serious landing spots for festival breakouts that includes A24, MUBI, and Parke's old home, Neon.

News of the new label was first reported by Deadline.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson's desire to play pioneering UFC fighter Mark Kerr in “The Smashing Machine,” an adaptation of the 2002 documentary of the same name, about the athlete's rise through the ranks of professional mixed martial arts, on the precipice of the sport becoming a worldwide sensation, predates when the WWE-superstar-turned-blockbuster-actor even started producing films through his company Seven Bucks Productions in 2012.

He simply had watched the HBO documentary in the burgeoning days of his pivot to film stardom, and thought to himself, “I would love to play Mark Kerr.” But even at that point, he told IndieWire over Zoom, doubt had already creeped in. “The realness was, ‘Are you ready to make this film? Are you ready to go there?' Because at the end of the documentary, [Kerr] is still battling his addictions, and he's trying, and things are hard, and he loses everything,” said Johnson. “Are you ready to go there?”

The first time he thought he'd lived enough life to revisit the role was around 2019, at a point where Johnson had become the highest paid actor of the year off a string of hits that included the “Fast and Furious” franchise, the new “Jumanji” franchise, and big budget actioners like “San Andreas,” “Rampage,” and “Skyscraper” (plus the animated phenomenon that is “Moana”). He said, “I started getting this little voice behind my rib cage that was speaking to me and saying, ‘Hey, what does the next challenge look like in this career? You're at this point where you could continue to do the films that you're doing and its status quo. Everybody's happy, but there's more.'”

 










After seeing “Uncut Gems,” and how the Safdie brothers directed comedian Adam Sandler toward a dark horse awards run for his lead performance in the high octane crime drama, Johnson landed on the younger sibling, actor/director Benny Safdie, helping him realize his vision of playing Kerr. The filmmaker was game, but the COVID-19 pandemic got in the way of them being able to shoot the picture.

But still, Johnson said, “When I was first thinking, ‘Hey, that's a movie there,' admittedly, that was my commercial instincts taking over. ‘Hey, I think there's a great movie there that people would like, and we can make [that] movie.'” By the time he was actually back on track to make the film around 2023, a whole lot more life had happened to him, and “it was very specific and very declarative. I need to make this movie,” said Johnson. “I need this for my soul. I feel like I need to tell this story. I need to challenge myself and I need to listen to my gut and my instinct and this little voice that has now become very resounding, banging on my rib cage, ‘You must do this. A change has to happen, and it's scary, and that's ok. Go for it. There's a cliff and you don't know what's down below, but jump.' You don't want to wake up 25 years from now and go, ‘I just wish I did.'”

 










While there were the public elements, like tentpoles “Black Adam” and “Red Notice” not being received as well as his past work, there were also private moments in his personal life, like the sudden death of his father, pro wrestler Rocky Johnson, in January 2020, which brought upon a lot of introspection that would prove foundational to his portrayal of Kerr. 

He cited a scene in the hospital opposite first-time actor and UFC alum Ryan Bader as Kerr's best friend and pending opponent Mark Coleman, where his character makes a futile attempt to mask what got him admitted. “He's trying to turn it on. ‘Could you believe it? They were asking me who the president is? That's kind of unfair, right? Because I'm in the—' and he's just trying, and it's what addicts do. And the moment they feel like, ‘Oh, this person is buying into the story, there's my hook. Got it. Great. They're buying into it,'” said Johnson. “I heard that story so many times from my dad. And so, there was so much in this. That was my experience with my dad, where I lived it, and their fights, and his own battles with alcoholism.”

The actor quoted author Louis L'Amour: “There will come a time when you believe everything is finished; that will be the beginning.” And, “in this case, that's what I thought, ‘This was what “Smashing Machine” represented.' Because in many ways, it's wild how much goes back for me to my dad and this relationship that I had that just was complicated and fucked up and loving.” He added, “My dad's passing, there's not a day that goes by where I don't think about it and I don't try to reconcile because we fought, and we had the worst fight of our lives. We stopped talking. Two weeks later, out of the blue.” As he speaks, he trails off, gesturing a salute.

 










In Johnson's first real go at playing Kerr, he had a sense of himself as an entertainer, saying he approached all his projects with an “audience first” mindset, holding “Indiana Jones” as his north star. “To the studios and to directors and my fellow actors, and I would say, ‘Hey, let's send them home floating, and let's work for the four quadrants, and for the largest audience possible and serve them.' And it worked,” said Johnson. “But eventually, I got to a point where I felt like if it's truly ‘audience first,' then wouldn't that mean I should give them my full self?”

He did not have a sense of himself as the artist capable of opening up in the way he has now, promoting “The Smashing Machine” across several festival premieres, for your consideration events, and wide-ranging interviews, that have led to his first Golden Globes nomination for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. “There's just so much more I felt that I should explore, that I had been nervous about exploring. I never wanted to explore my own trauma and my own on shit on screen,” he said. “I felt like, ‘Hey, that's stuff that I should work out on my own.'” His “Jungle Cruise” co-star Emily Blunt, who had become one of his best friends, was actually key in rekindling “The Smashing Machine,” after her fellow “Oppenheimer” actor Safdie had asked her to watch the documentary and reach back out to Johnson.

 










When she finally reached him, “She goes, ‘Look, you're right there. Because the truth is, there's a reason why you ask me about every director I work with, from Nolan to Spielberg, you're always querying, investigating, “Tell me about this character. How did you put it together?” But it will require you to take all that trauma and shit that you've experienced in your life, and [now] you have a place to put it,'” said Johnson of his conversation with Blunt, who would eventually sign on to play Kerr's girlfriend Dawn Staples. “I finally realized, ‘Wow, I can do that! I could do the thing I love, which is storytelling. But now, I also have a place to put all this stuff and show the audience my full self.”

His thought process behind wanting to make “The Smashing Machine” became “Oh, wait a second, that's a human being who I can relate to, that's in this volcanic relationship with his ex-girlfriend and who eventually became his wife. I can relate to that relationship.” He did not have experience with addiction to the point of overdosing on pain medication, as Kerr did twice, “but I do know what it's like to have a relationship with pain, physical pain. I know what it's like to have a relationship to pressure, the pressure of this idea that people think, ‘Hey, you are who you are,' and there's an invincibility to you. And you make these films, and there's these kinds of characters, and that's who you are outside of Hollywood. And that kind of image, it's hard to live up to.”

 










While A24, Safdie, Johnson, and those working on “The Smashing Machine” did not release the film thinking it did not have the potential to do well in theaters, it failing to catch fire at the box office in October (a month that saw historic low grosses across the board), does complement its narrative. “It's not ‘Rocky.' It looks like ‘Rocky.' It has the bones of ‘Rocky.' But in the end, he doesn't win, and he loses everything. And what is that like? And he almost dies twice with his overdosing. And it's OK,” said Johnson. The concluding shot of “The Smashing Machine” is the real Kerr exiting the grocery store, which cues the audience in on life going on well enough for the fighter, and what a transformation Johnson went through, with help from Oscar-winning makeup artist Kazu Hiro, to transform into Kerr.

“That's the thing that Benny wanted to show at the end of the film. He goes, ‘If I can make a film in the sports biopic [genre] where typically you win at the end, but he doesn't. And if I can make people walk out of the theater, hopefully, [helping] them go, ‘But you know what? It's OK. And I feel good about my life choices.' Then, he goes, ‘I think we might succeed at making something that's unique and different and maybe perhaps even talked about for some years to come,” said Johnson. 

 










He added, “Sometimes with success, you think you want it so badly, you get it, and then it's empty. And you don't know why it's empty. And then, you question should I even have it? Do I deserve it? Self-sabotage begins to kick in, and before you know it you're in this cycle, you're spinning. And throw in an addiction to drugs, and on top of that potentially a relationship that's codependent, that has drugs involved too as well. And it's a hard, hard place to live, and it's a lonely place.”

While that is all more true to the real life person he played, instead of Johnson, the actor sees his film as a win for the way that it has reconnected him to his peers in the artistic community. “My relationship with success for ‘The Smashing Machine' is not a number. And it may sound convenient, but I mean this from the heart, it's just peace. Being at peace with it, and being at peace with the performance. Because I've got to tell you, for decades, admittedly, it was always about numbers, right? And what's the exit score? What's the Rotten Tomatoes score?,” he said. “And all that stuff, it all works together and it's all important.” 

But what Johnson realized was “there is just such anchoring satisfaction in the conversation where you create something that then sparks conversations that I have never had in my life, and I have been blown away by every conversation that I have had, [from] DMs, to text messages, to fellow actors, journalists, directors, you name it.”

 










He actually was in the audience when Oscar-winning filmmaker Christopher Nolan told his director Safdie, “I don't think you'll see a better performance this year or most other years.” Johnson said, “I just wanted to watch this conversation between these two beautiful directors and was holding my wife's hand. And he said what he said, and I must have broken three bones in her hand because I squeezed her hand so hard. It's like, ‘Holy shit, you said what?'”

Johnson's movie career has seen a lot of the highest highs, but “what I'm saying is I've never had that before,” he said. “And so, I'm not dismissing anything about our business, our process, numbers, etc., but just that to me is the biggest win of all.” There's been no motivation to continue down the path of making films that feel like they come from his soul than the multiple times peers have told him “Hey, we've been waiting for this. We've been waiting.”

Next up: Johnson is already set to reteam with Safdie on an adaptation of the Daniel Pinkwater novel “Lizard Music,” where he will play an eccentric septuagenarian known as the Chicken Man. “Dude, there is so much of my dad's shit that I'm putting into this [character],” he said. “The closer [Benny and I] get, it's like, ‘Wait, your dad did that too? My dad did that. He left you like that?'”

 










He is also still attached to Darren Aronofsky's “Breakthrough.” “There's something really chemical that's happening that, even in this very, very early process of working with Darren has been phenomenal,” said the actor, who has known the filmmaker since his uncles The Wild Samoans consulted on Aronofsky's “The Wrestler.” Finally, he compares his still-in-development film with Martin Scorsese, about the Godfather of Hawaii, Nappy Pulawa, to his co-star Blunt getting to work with Steven Spielberg on a film about UFOs. “This is Marty's anchor and his powerhouse. And this is what is probably the last great mob story that's never been told,” said Johnson.

Clint Bentley's latest film, “Train Dreams,” has a hard balance to strike between the meditative, almost shy, and quite heartbreaking interiority of its protagonist, logger and lumberman Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton), and the harsh, cyclical world in which he lives. The look of the film needs to support both a grounded sense of the period and a slightly lyrical quality, where a thin curtain blowing in the wind or the shine of an axe can mean more, emotionally, than simply what we see. Every choice production designer Alexandra Schaller made needed to support both worlds that the film moves effortlessly between.

 










 ”We wanted a very documentary-like quality to the movie. We wanted the design to feel invisible,” Schaller told IndieWire as part of our recent craft roundtable. “I did a lot of research at the outset — and we're talking about a very specific world, which is the niche world of logging in the early 20th century. I learned everything about it. We listened to a lot of oral histories from the time.”

It was these stories of men building cabins and drifting from job to job and fishing from the river that inspired Schaller to make choices that would speak to what it would actually be like to live in the Pacific Northwest of that time — not just the right items from a Sears catalogue, but a lived-in sense of what it would be like to live that particular life. “What we wanted to focus on was, ‘How do we want to feel?' A lot of the movie is from one person's point of view, and it's really like his interior landscape. And there's a lot in Dennis Johnson's novella, and in [Clint Bentley's and Greg Kwedar's] script. There's a dreamlike quality woven through the narrative.”

It's the more dreamlike movements of “Train Dreams” that inspired Schaller and her art team to elevate the period details slightly, to go a little bit further in terms of how colors match or create depth, to set off Grainier's memories and imagination. “We want it to be completely, completely immersive,” Schaller said.

As can happen in adaptations, writer and director Nia DaCosta‘s decision to abandon the period-specific trappings of 1890s Norway for “Hedda,” her film version of “Hedda Gabler” which takes place in a much glossier, jazzier English countryside in the early 50s, not only brings the audience closer to the story but brings the story closer to the heart of the characters. For production designer Cara Brower, the assignment wasn't about designing sets that were perfect historical recreations, but revealing a perfect window into Hedda's (Tessa Thompson) impish tastes and proclivities.

 










“So when I met up with Nia, she wanted to mae a period film that was really unique and had its own voice and didn't look like anything else,” Brower said as part of IndieWire's recent crafts roundtable. “I dove deep into the socialites of the era, and then I could see that some of these houses were really flamboyant, and so then that gave me the freedom to do something that wasn't expected.”

Brower used that freedom to defy the conventions and colors of a typical English manor house in the exact same way the film's protagonist would have, too, burning through her hapless husband's (Tom Bateman) borrowed cash to make a house that looks rakishly cool and original, just as she is. Without stepping beyond pieces and designs that would be plausible for the post-war period, Brower packed each room with touches that Hedda would've chosen to stick it to the gentry lineage she feels cut off from.

 










The playfulness of the production design bleeds into the party atmosphere of most of the film, into Hedda's schemes against her former lover Eileen (Nina Hoss), and new partner Thea (Imogen Poots), and the strong, dark, rotten colors of “Hedda” are indeed a lot of fun — until, of course, they aren't. “We still tried to make it feel like the '50s, but we layered a lot of different eras in modern paintings, and we had contemporary wallpaper that felt period. We had a lot of Art Deco furnishings because they feel so timeless. We just felt like we had the freedom to play,” Brower said.

Dove Ellis is hard to pin down. He makes straightforward chamber-pop music. But he makes it with a ferocity shaped by his background gigging at post-punk incubator Windmill, earning comparisons to fellow piano man Cameron Winter and even opening for Geese on tour. When the 22-year-old Irish songwriter stepped on stage, audiences expecting more sprechgesang were met with a balladeer closer to the poppier sides of Thom Yorke, Jeff Buckley, and Elliot Smith. As with those artists, there are still idiosyncratic moments, but Ellis is more than willing to let his music be purely beautiful—even when things get abstract, the emotional intensity comes through.

The orchestral ballads on The Bends and XO are particular touchstones, but his music can also bring to mind Rufus Wainwright or even the quieter side of Queen. When “Heaven Has No Wings” opens with an AOR-friendly piano riff, he plays it completely straight. It helps to have established professionals on his side: The trio of Florence and the Machine engineer Dani Bennett-Spragg, mixer Sophie Ellis (no relation), and Dijon's engineer Andrew Sarlo help this sound as pristine as any record that influenced him. Ellis' expressive and dynamic voice is the main feature in the mix, frequently pushing into the red in his loudest moments and deliberately fragile in its quieter ones. Production flourishes like the ear-scratching cello on “Pale Song” cut through, and the swooping harmonies on nearly operatic “Little Left Hope” truly soar.

It might take several listens for the words to register. As a stylistic choice, Ellis slurs his already cryptic lyrics, so the album can feel difficult to unravel. Not helping is the lack of context; there are very few Ellis interviews online, and he's scrubbed at least one of his previous releases: “Adonis”, a 2023 debut single described as “RnB, pop, country, funk.” In the spare press materials, he described “To the Sandals” as “reflections on a failing shotgun marriage in Cancún,” a hint that these songs are meant to be interpreted as character studies with the larger context left out.

These characters frequently seek transcendence, whether through romance (the tender acoustic ballad “Away You Stride”) or music itself (“Little Left Hope” includes a proposal to start a band). If they don't feel doomed from the start, they give up altogether: On “Pale Song,” the narrator believes their life could be written on “stone with a little chalk,” and they can't bring themselves to go out and actually live it. “Jaundice” depicts people “born without any face” and “without any roots.” Then again, it's also an Irish jig performed with the energy of Ellis' Windmill compatriots like Black Country, New Road, particularly with Matthew Deakin's tom-heavy shuffle. It plays like a celebration of anonymity.

The moments of direct storytelling feel more tantalizing considering how little we know about the writer. “Feathers, Cash” and “When You Tie Your Hair Up” are straightforward breakup songs with lovingly intimate imagery; on the former, he describes drawing dogs with the steam in a shower, and on the latter, he notices stress manifesting in his own hands: “The skin creased in our palms cuts deeper each night,” he sings. After the best of the album's crescendos, Ellis strips everything away again, pining for a character named Annie. On “Cash,” he characterizes love with surreal irreverence, and it sounds more like an incantation, calling a partner “my one polished orb,” followed by three handclaps.

There are plenty of very good Jeff Buckley-inspired indie songwriters across the pond, like Belgian-Egyptian songwriter Tamino and Scottish musician Jacob Alon. Dove Ellis stands out among them by finding the right balance between the weirdness of his Windmill peers and a more classicist style of songwriting. It allows him to make a near-perfect pop song, “Love Is,” also the most intricate song on the record. The arrangement is so dense it might take multiple listens to know when the multitracked Ellises swap from “love is” to “love is not,” and it will certainly take more to notice the drum hits that coincide with that switch. Even the chorus sounds more liberating than it does on the page: “Love is not the antidote to all your problems,” he sings, fitting for an album where devotion causes more damage than it heals. Even at his most accessible, Ellis still keeps his distance.

For two South Londoners, Yawning Portal are oddly enchanted by the American Midwest. Their debut album Anywhere was originally conceived in and around Des Moines, Iowa: a land where AOR rock and country blast out of car speakers on drives across desolate Rust Belt towns and vast Corn Belt farmlands. Jess Mai Walker and Joseph Ware's artistic and geographic origins seem like a far cry from this distinctly American form of vast nothingness. So why would they travel here to write an electronic album in response to, as they put it, “spending days driving around with no destination… just to get out of the house”? But as a young Ohioan born and raised just outside the Rubber City, these sentiments make perfect sense to me. A drifting odyssey through ambient and downtempo trance, Anywhere captures the romantic spirit of driving as meditation, using electronic music to conjure the affective release of being in constant motion, bringing new life to lifeless landscapes on the American backroads.

Midwesterners spend the most time behind the wheel out of all Americans, and so much of that time is spent going nowhere at all, and everywhere all the same. We trade the Heartland's severe lack of “special places” for a sacred practice of drifting on wheels, a meditative state reserved to our region. When Walker's powerfully delicate vocals whisper “let's go out” on the refrain to “My City”—the album's club-ready centerpiece—she's ostensibly talking about speeding past a club that's been abandoned for years rather than actually going out dancing, as she describes the distinctly Midwestern stimulations of “bleach and snow and gasoline” before calling “drive faster” as the track speeds to its finish line.

Anywhere evokes this meditative feeling in its sprawling mix of trance, downtempo, and ambient. Its organization as a continuous mix, where each track flows seamlessly into the next with no single genre taking precedence, gives it a distinctly modern feel, akin to the sprawling playlists us young Heartlanders used to soundtrack our drifts growing up. The pure ambience of “In Orion,” for example, bleeds into the chopped grooves of “In Iowa” before ramping up to complete downtempo trance glory on “My City.” The looping synth refrains and pounding emotion of trance-y cuts like “Magical Girl” blast as we speed down backroads; the metallic percussion and smooth loops of downtempo tracks like the Oli XL-assisted  “Silver Plated” evoke our coasts through dilapidated post-industrial towns; the submerging ambience of “Meridian Drift” and “Light to Light” reflect the endless gaze of those pitch-black night drives where we could only see the road in front of us.

No matter our speed or what genre is travelling alongside us, Anywhere lets the songs' form and the weight of their instruments tell the story. The dense pop-leaning production of “Video” slowly unwinds towards its second half, turning what was a frantic drive into a sweet and hazy coast. Soft synth plucks appear in abstract bursts in wandering tracks like “Light to Light,” and as distinct arpeggiated refrains in the more arranged cuts like “Eternity Sunrise.” This dynamism elicits the romantic spirit and purpose behind driving through even the most barren landscapes, where the simultaneous acts of drifting, gazing, and thinking unearth profound emotions.

At just over an hour, the duo's romanticized drive encounters some structural roadblocks. Anywhere's first 20 minutes build up to a series of downtempo cuts, but first sprawl unevenly through a range of genres. The nearly eight-minute opener “Concord” could've done without the three-minute ambient regression after its powerful trance apex. “Pathfinder,” which bookends this build, also starts off strong—here, with a furious blast of spiraling plucks—but then falls asleep at the wheel at its midpoint, as a tired cast of squelching leads take over.

But these meandering moments are perhaps the price we all pay when we, as the sentimental lyrics on the twinkly closing track put it, “drive the long way home.” Anywhere is an exercise in the catharsis of motion, where the roads less travelled lead us to introspective untetheredness: dynamic emotions that require dynamic soundtracks. When a single track drifts from furious trance into abstract ambient, it captures those feelings setting in while still in motion, like the beautiful comedown from a meditative realization on the road. It's “Midwestern Logic” to a tee: the journey will forever be more important than the destination.

Morrissey has finally found a new record label after spending several years in the musical wilderness.


	On Instagram and his website last night (Dec. 18), Morrissey revealed that he'd signed a new deal with Sire by sharing a photo of the label's logo. Moz didn't make any additional remarks beyond some celebratory emojis, but a rep for the singer did confirm the signing is official.


	There's no word yet on when Morrissey will drop new music on Sire, but it could happen soon. The singer-songwriter hasn't released a solo album since 2020's I Am Not a Dog on a Chain, but he's repeatedly teased two follow-up albums, which have yet to be released.


One effort, Bonfire of the Teenagers, was recorded between 2020 and 2021 with producer Andrew Watt, and was set to feature an array of big-name guests, like Miley Cyrus, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Chad Smith and Flea, and Iggy Pop. The album was originally supposed to be released through BMG in November 2020, but the label dropped him. He later found a new home for the LP at Capitol Records, and though a single (“Rebels Without Applause”) was released, the album was ultimately shelved and Morrissey ended his association with Capitol. 

	











	Last year, Morrissey claimed in an interview that the album had been “gagged” and “idiot culture” was preventing its release. He appeared to alluding the backlash he's faced for some of his far-right political views, especially over immigration. Cyrus, at one point, requested that her contribution on the record be removed. (Morrissey also said he was able to buy back the rights to Bonfire from Capitol.)

	











	Eventually, Morrissey announced another new album, originally titled Without Music the World Dies, and now known as You're Right, It's Time. Morrissey reportedly recorded this album in 2023 at La Fabrique Studios in France with producer Joe Chiccarelli. You're Right, It's Time has missed multiple release dates since Moz first announced it, most recently a scheduled September 2025 drop.

	As for Moz's new label home, Sire, it's actually something of a return for the singer-songwriter. The longtime Warner Music subsidiary released the Smiths' music in the United States during the Eighties, and they also helped push some of Morrissey's first solo releases, too. But the relationship, as Morrissey wrote in his book Autobiography, wasn't always the most fulfilling. 


	For instance, in one section, Morrissey described the label as “eternally absent” and disinterested in the Smiths, despite their growing fandom: “Even selling 40,000 tickets in California doesn't budge Sire's constipation, and the label remains clueless as to what exactly the Smiths were,” he wrote. Elsewhere, Moz lamented Sire's inability to get “How Soon Is Now?” onto the Billboard Hot 100, despite national airplay and “fantastic attention from coast to coast”; he also called the the promotional video the label created for the single “predictably vomit-inducing.”

	According to The Late Show, Donald Trump won't be content until he completely ruins Christmas. Last night, Stephen Colbert aired an animated clip titled “Colbert's Canceled Christmas: The Last Noel,” taking aim at Trump's desire to ruin everything good. 


	The video, narrated by Nick Offerman, centers on “King Jag Bag” (a.k.a. Trump) as he cancels Christmas, sends ICE to the North Pole, destroys Santa's workshop to build a new ballroom, and forces Santa into Alligator Elfcatraz. “No inch of that fellow was nice, kind, or thankful,” Offerman narrates. “From his weird rotting hand to his large swollen cankles.” 


	Santa and his elves find themselves locked up alongside the Sesame Street characters in a cell previously inhabited by “Donald Trump's best and only friend Jeffrey Elfstein.” There, they discover the “Elfstein list,” which Santa uses to try to take the president down. When he fails, a group of popular children's characters appear, call him a loser, and give Santa the power to boot Trump back to the White House. 

	











	Colbert has gone no holds barred against Trump after CBS pulled the plug on The Late Show earlier this year. In July, after the network announced the late-night show would come to an end in May 2026, Colbert noted, “But they made one mistake. They left me alive.”

	The host acknowledged, to chants of his name from the crowd, that this means that “now for the next 10 months, the gloves are off.” He continued, “I can finally speak unvarnished truth to power and say what I really think about Donald Trump starting right now. I don't really care for him. Doesn't seem to have the skill set to be president. Just not a good fit.”

	











	In November, Colbert addressed the unexpected cancellation of The Late Show, declining to say whether he thinks CBS axed the show due to political pressure from the Trump administration, but saying otherwise: “It's a reasonable thing to think.”

Jimmy Kimmel opened his final monologue of 2025 by sharing his gratitude with viewers for supporting him through an unprecedented year. 


	In September, Jimmy Kimmel Live was indefinitely suspended by network ABC after Kimmel was targeted by the Trump administration. The late-night show as brought back to air relatively quickly after a public backlash, and Kimmel has continued to trade blows with Donald Trump since. 


	“This has been a strange year. It's been a hard year,” Kimmel acknowledged. “We've had some lows, we've had some highs. For me, maybe more than any year in my life.” 


	The host began to tear up as he continued, “But on behalf of all of us—I'm crying already, I'm sorry. On behalf of all of us at the show, I just want to say that we appreciate your support, your enthusiasm. And not just for watching. This year you literally pulled us out of a hole, and we cannot thank you enough, personally, professionally.”

	“I know there are a lot harder jobs, but this is not an easy job to do,” Kimmel said. “And sometimes it feels like we're spinning our wheels. You see so many awful and destructive acts, so much damage we inflict on ourselves on purpose, and it can make you feel crazy trying to wrap your head around these things that are so clearly wrong. You grow up reading Superman and you learn to value truth, justice, and the American way, and then you start to realize, especially over the last year, you don't know where that all went. You don't know what the American way is even more.”

	











	He added, “But when I hear from people who tell me that they watch our show and the shows that our friends and colleagues do on the other channels and it makes them feel less crazy, it makes me feel less crazy too. And I think that's an important thing.”

	











	Before getting into the get of his monologue, Kimmel noted, “I also think it's important that we as Americans let our friends in other countries who watch the show on YouTube, on Instagram, Hulu, wherever, know that a lot of us are not okay with what is happening. There is still much more good in this country than bad and we hope that you will bear with us during this extended psychotic episode that we're in the middle of.”

Jimmy Kimmel Live will return in 2026. Earlier this month, Kimmel renewed his deal to host the show until May 2027. The deal was reportedly finalized over the summer — before ABC's September suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, following a monologue in the wake of Charlie Kirk‘s murder.

	That suspension, which came after heavy pressure from the Trump administration, conservative activists, and network affiliates, was billed as “indefinite.”  It ended up lasting just a few days, after it prompted a ferocious backlash of its own, with consumers apparently canceling their Disney+ subscriptions en masse and actors and other showbiz figures condemning ABC and its parent company, Disney.


	Kimmel returned to the show with a studio audience chanting his name. His 17-minute monologue, in which he said it was “never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” drew 6.26 million viewers, making it the most-watched regular episode in the show's history.

							By 

	Mary Jane Gibson



	On Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump signed an executive order enacting to reschedule cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The order directs the Attorney General to move cannabis from Schedule I, a category of drugs with high risk for addiction “no accepted medical use” that includes heroin and LSD, to Schedule III, reserved for drugs with “moderate to low potential” for addiction. This marks the first significant shift in federal marijuana policy since Richard Nixon declared a “war on drugs” in 1971.


	Despite it being a Biden-era initiative, Trump did not hesitate to take credit for the decision. “We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain for decades,” Trump said. “This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems, and more — including numerous veterans with service-related injuries and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life.”

	











	​While some Republican lawmakers urged Trump not to sign the order, opposing cannabis as a “harmful drug that is worsening our nation's addiction crisis,” advocates are touting the reform as a watershed moment in the march towards federal legalization that will open up research, ease tax burdens, and attract investment to an industry that exists in a constant state of flux. (Of course, anti-prohibition critics have said the order does not go far enough — that only by completely decriminalizing the plant, and retroactively pardoning the victims of the war on drugs, will we achieve progress.)

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Either way, change is coming. ​Rescheduling is sure to have a massive impact on cannabis commerce — but will it benefit weed consumers and medical marijuana patients, or just make it easier for corporations and the government to cash in?


	Because of its classification under the CSA, research on marijuana has been illegal under federal law for more than five decades. The Schedule III reclassification puts cannabis in the same class as drugs like Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, and anabolic steroids, acknowledging its medical properties and legalizing it for research, clinical trials, and pharmaceutical regulation. Rescheduling is controversial in some circles; most drug policy activists and cannabis entrepreneurs want to see cannabis descheduled and removed from the CSA entirely.

	​Trump's executive order doesn't legalize marijuana under federal law; it's simply an acknowledgment from the government that cannabis possesses “currently accepted medical use.” Oncologist Brooke Worster, M.D., chief medical officer at Ethos, hopes that rescheduling will open the floodgates for research funding. She says that regulated studies “will help us learn what specific formulations and dosing are helpful” for patients, and better understand any harmful side effects of medical marijuana.


	​Some entrepreneurs worry that rescheduling could subject state-legal operators to newly restrictive regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While it's unclear how state systems will be affected by federal reform, Dr. Worster is hopeful that it will ultimately mean medical cannabis patients are covered by health insurance. “It could enable the cannabis industry to be a legitimate part of healthcare,” she says.


	​Trump's executive order proposes allowing Medicare recipients to access cannabidiol, a.k.a. CBD, a non-psychoactive chemical compound found in cannabis, under the federal healthcare plan. Howard Kessler, founder of The Commonwealth Project, an organization promoting CBD, was present at the signing; Trump remarked that Kessler looks “better than he did 20 years ago,” presumably due to his use of CBD, which Trump touted on Truth Social in September as a “game changer” for seniors. The Commonwealth Project website issued a press release applauding Trump for his executive order “unlocking” medical cannabis. (As for where that CBD will come from, it's anyone's guess, since a provision in Congress's recent spending package made it a lot harder for farmers to produce it.)

	​The policy change also means that marijuana businesses will no longer face punishing IRS levies under 280E, a provision of the tax code that prohibits deducting business expenses from income derived from “trafficking” Schedule I or II substances. Without the tax breaks afforded to “regular” businesses, state-legal cannabis operations are forced to pay tax on their gross income at rates as high as 70 to 80 percent; moving cannabis to Schedule III means they can now take federal tax deductions.


	​Vince Ning, co-founder and CEO of the cannabis wholesale and distribution platform Nabis, says that getting out from under 280E will make a massive difference for the flagging cannabis industry. He anticipates a surge in spending on marketing, research, and development. “I think people will have 10 to 15 percent back to their bottom line,” he says. “There's going to be more education for cannabis products, and there's going to be a lot more innovation, because now those are all deductible costs.” Dr. Worster agrees: “Taxation changes will allow the cannabis industry to shift funding into research.”


	As a sense of jubilation ripples through the weed world at the news, Betty Aldworth, chair of the reform group Marijuana Policy Project, urges cautious optimism. “Patients and consumers should also understand the limits of this moment,” she says. “Rescheduling does not make products safer, more affordable, or more available. It doesn't protect patients from losing housing or employment. And it does not meaningfully change how the justice system treats cannabis-related activity.”

	​Jeffrey Miller, chief executive officer of New Jersey cannabis holding company HoneyProjects, says that once celebrations die down, he expects a sense of unease while federal agencies like the FDA rewrite regulations. “The demise of 280E will end the absurd financial chokehold we've labored under for over a decade, and rekindle the hope of survival for small cannabis businesses,” he says. “The new wild card is whether [cannabis reclassification] becomes a tool for Big Pharma or federal regulators to preempt state-legal systems.”


	“Cannabis is a $38 billion sector operating successfully across most of the country,” Aldworth says. “Federal policy must catch up to political and scientific realities.” It remains to be seen if the reforms will work in favor of the industry as it currently exists — but, as he signed the executive order, Trump said, “I promise to be the president of common sense.” Rescheduling cannabis allows him to look that way for a moment, at least.

	Close to 70 years after German instrument company Höfner started selling an electric bass that looked like a violin, the company has filed for bankruptcy. The news has hit Paul McCartney, who has made the Höfner 500/1 his signature instrument, especially hard. 


	“It is very sad to see Höfner go out of business,” McCartney wrote on Instagram. “They have been making instruments for over 100 years, and I bought my first Höfner bass in the Sixties. I have loved it ever since. It's a wonderful instrument to play: lightweight, and it encourages me to play quite freely. It also offers pleasing variations in tone that I enjoy. So commiserations to everyone at Höfner, and thank you for all your help over the years.”


	The Beatles‘ association with Höfner instruments goes back to their Quarrymen days. George Harrison's brother Harry taught him guitar chords on a Höfner Committee and later played a Höfner President and a Höfner Club 40. John Lennon's first “good” guitar, according to Mark Lewisohn's Beatles biography Tune In, was also a Club 40. The band's original bassist, Stuart Sutcliffe, started playing a Höfner President 333, which looked similar to the instrument McCartney would later make famous, in 1960. During times when Sutcliffe wasn't around, McCartney would pick up the 333 and play it upside down, as he is left-handed.

	McCartney purchased his first Höfner 500/1 in Hamburg at a Steinway & Sons shop in 1961. He was able to get a left-handed instrument on short order, according to Tune In, because Höfner was based in Germany. The instrument cost him a little less than £31. Höfner would later give McCartney another left-handed “Violin bass” in 1963 after the band broke into the mainstream.

	Somebody stole the original 500/1 from the back of a van in London on Oct. 10, 1972. Through the help of a grassroots campaign called “The Lost Bass Project,” the thief was identified, and the bass was returned to McCartney in 2024. The instrument's history will be the focus of an upcoming documentary.

Sure, an inexplicable small-town mystery is fun.

But for John Grossnickle, sheriff of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, this one's getting a little stale. For over a year, Sweetwater officials have been trying to get to the bottom of a series of unexplained appearances by unidentified flying objects.

Alarmingly, the UFOs seem to have a peculiar interest in a local power facility, the Jim Bridger Steam Plant, which houses four coal-fired generators.

“We've worked with everybody,” the sheriff's spokesperson, Jason Mower told the Cowboy State Daily. “We've done everything we can to figure out what they are, and nobody wants to give us any answers.”

Sheriff Grossnickle, who began fielding calls about the sightings 13 months ago, says he's now observed them with his own eyes. The objects are said to be “lighted” and “drone-like,” and congregate together in “coordinated formations,” CSD reports. They're typically reported between 2am or 3am.

Shooting them down isn't an option, as they fly thousands of feet above ground. A state investigation doesn't seem to be on the table either, as Wyoming National Guard adjutant general Greg Porter said he “doesn't think he could discuss [them] in open testimony,” per CSD.

“It's like the new normal,” Mower explained. “It's like this phenomenon that continues to happen, but it's not causing any, you know, issues that we have to deal with — other than the presence of them.”

Officials in Sweetwater aren't alone. Seven sheriffs of nearby counties canvassed by CSD said they'd either viewed similar mystery objects or received reports about them from locals. Back in January, three of those sheriffs had documented sightings above energy infrastructure such as oil fields and power plants, CSD reported at the time.

The strange Wyoming sightings come nearly a year after similar drone hysteria in New Jersey was seemingly put to rest. Despite a huge mystery back in late 2024, president Donald Trump claimed tho drones were authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration for research.

Whether the same can be said for the Wyoming UFO mystery? That's anyone's guess.

Fleets of drones and suspected UFOs have been spotted hovering over a Wyoming power plant for more than a year, while a local sheriff's department is still searching for clues.

Officials with the Sweetwater County Sheriff's Office recorded scores of beaming, drone-like objects circling around the Red Desert and Jim Bridger Power Plant in Rock Springs over the last 13 months — though they didn't specify how many, the Cowboy State Daily reported.

Sheriff John Grossnickle was one of the first to witness the spectacles, and  last saw the mind-boggling formation on Dec. 12, his spokesperson Jason Mower told the outlet.

The fleets periodically congregate over the power plant in coordinated formations, Mower claimed. 

The sheriff's office hasn't been able to recover any of the suspected UFOs, telling the outlet they're too high to shoot down.

The law enforcement outpost's exhaustive efforts to get to the truth haven't yielded any results, even after Grossnickle enlisted help from Wyoming US Rep. Harriet Hageman — who Mower claimed saw the formation during a trip to the power plant.

Hageman could not be reached for comment.

“We've worked with everybody. We've done everything we can to figure out what they are, and nobody wants to give us any answers,” Mower said, according to the outlet.

At first, spooked locals bombarded the sheriff's office with calls about the confounding aerial formations. Now, though, Mower said that people seem to have accepted it as “the new normal.” 

Mower noted that the objects, which he interchangeably referred to as “drones” and “unidentified flying objects,” have yet to pose a danger to the public or cause any damage to the power plant itself.

“It's like this phenomenon that continues to happen, but it's not causing any, you know, issues that we have to deal with — other than the presence of them,” he told the outlet.

The spokesperson promised the sheriff's office would “certainly act accordingly” if the drones pose an imminent harm.

Meanwhile, Niobrara County Sheriff Randy Starkey told the Cowboy State Daily that residents of his community also reported mystery drone sightings over Lance Creek — more than 300 miles from the Jim Bridger Power Plant — starting in late October 2024 and ending in early March.

Starkey said he's “just glad they're gone,” according to the outlet.

Drone sightings captured the nation's attention last year when they were causing hysteria in sightings over New Jersey. 

Just days into his second term, President Trump had to clarify that the drones were authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to quell worries that they posed a national security threat.

Still, the public wasn't convinced, but the mystery slowly faded as the sightings plummeted.

In October, though, an anonymous source with an unnamed military contractor told The Post that their company was responsible for the hysteria.

The Singju Post

Here is the full transcript of biological anthropologist Michael P. Masters' interview on The Joe Rogan Experience #2428, December 18, 2025.   

Brief Notes: Joe Rogan sits down with biological anthropologist Michael P. Masters to explore his bold “extratempestrial” hypothesis: that at least some UFOs and so‑called aliens are actually future humans time‑traveling back to study their own evolutionary past. Masters walks through the anatomical logic for why classic “grey” entities look like us with exaggerated future traits—bigger brains, smaller faces, weaker bodies—and how this lines up with millions of years of hominin evolution. The conversation dives into abduction accounts, UAP sightings, time‑travel physics, and recovered‑craft lore, asking whether advanced descendants could be using space‑time “bubbles” rather than interstellar spaceships to reach us. Along the way, they touch on Nazca mummies, ancient myths, black projects, AI, and why Masters believes a multidisciplinary scientific approach is the only way to make sense of the UFO mystery. 

Disclosure and Steven Spielberg's Influence


JOE ROGAN: Disclosure day. Very interesting.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I'm excited for that.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. He was always way ahead of the curve when it comes to the whole UAP, UFO stuff. You know, with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, he had that French scientist that was essentially modeled after Jacques Vallee. He's always been, I would love to talk to him. I wonder how much he knows.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Is that an accident? Was he fed some information? Was he a part of disclosure the whole time? That's what I've always wondered.

JOE ROGAN: I mean, what does that mean? Right. Because there hasn't really been disclosure.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: No, but it has to be a slow process too, right?

JOE ROGAN: You think so?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I don't think. I mean, the whole idea is that they're just sort of normalizing it.

Like the aspects of Close Encounters, for instance, where you have the radiation burns on the guy's face, you have a time travel component where these World War II soldiers get out of the craft with the little beings and the bigger being and I mean, just seeding our culture with those little bits of information that might help later on down.

JOE ROGAN: That was in the 70s, wasn't it? When was Close Encounters?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I think it was in the 70s, late 70s, early 80s, maybe. Either way, I mean, a lot of stuff he's done, like I rewatched the, what was it? Jeff Bridges, Starman. I think there's a lot of elements of disclosure in that too.

I don't know. I mean, obviously we don't know who's pulling the strings. We don't know what's going on. We don't know who's in charge. But it does make sense that if there is this thing that they know about that we're supposed to know about, leak it out, do it slowly, get in our culture, get it in our media in different ways.

The Hal Puthoff Story and Government Disclosure Meetings


JOE ROGAN: You know the Hal Puthoff story, right, with George Bush? Do you know the story where they were talking about. Okay, Hal talked about it on my podcast, but he also talked about it in the Age of Disclosure documentary where they brought in him and a bunch of different prominent thinkers.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I watched that episode and I watched the documentary.

JOE ROGAN: So to people that don't know, I'll just explain it. So they brought in him and a bunch of other prominent thinkers and they sat them down and said, essentially, we have recovered crashed UFOs, we have biological remains of these creatures.

We are considering releasing it to the public and we want to make an assessment of what are the pros and what are the cons. So we want to assign a numerical value that you're estimating what kind of an impact it would be on government, finances, religion, et cetera.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Whether they should do it basically right.

JOE ROGAN: Whether or not they should release this information. And all of the people that were brought in came to the agreement that there was more con than there were pro and that formed their decision to not release it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And didn't he say at first he was pro disclosure? He was like, of course we should do this. And then after the conversation, he switched teams.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I don't know about that. Maybe, perhaps.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, he said that he went into it thinking, well, yeah, obviously we should do this. And then sort of was convinced otherwise after the conversation unfolded.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, how could you be convinced? Whose decision should it be? If some people know, everyone should know. Yeah, it's a humanity decision. I don't think it should be in anybody's hands to decide whether or not this information gets distributed.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And the implications too, if they have zero point energy, how would that solve the problems that we face today? There's so many ramifications of it that, yeah, whose decision is it and why has it been kept from us?

I don't buy that whole, Orson Welles, 1938, everybody freak out bullshit. I don't think that's the case. At least not anymore. It's got to be something more to it than that.

Unity in the Face of External Threats


JOE ROGAN: It would certainly have, I don't know if they factor this in, but a uniting element. You remember the Reagan speech where he, in front of the United Nations where he said, imagine how united we would be. We'd forget our differences if we were faced with an alien threat from another world.

I mean, just knowing that we are all united. I mean, how old are you?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: 47.

JOE ROGAN: Okay, so you remember September 11?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Mm.

JOE ROGAN: One of the things that happened after September 11 was there was, it was a horrible tragedy, but there was a beautiful result temporarily where everybody was really united, really united.

There were American flags in everybody's car in Los Angeles. You know, the most ridiculous progressive, sort of kind of f*ed up place. But everybody became patriotic in New York. Everyone was friendly. I mean, people were smiling and saying hi to each other on the streets. We had all decided that we were together and were faced with a real threat and that we had to be united.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And I remember it well. Yeah, you're right. And not to get too weird too fast here, but if there are aspects of sort of an all encompassing consciousness that unites us associated with the UFO phenomenon too, if we recognize that we are just fingerprints on the same hand, we're all iterations of the same overarching consciousness. If seemingly there is a part of that in the UFO phenomenon.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So how would that unite us as well, even beyond the threat from outside? If we did start to understand that we're all part of the same sort of cosmic community. Sounds kind of weird to say.

JOE ROGAN: It does sound weird, but have you seen the Apple show Pluribus?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: No. It comes up a lot. Worth watching.

JOE ROGAN: It's really good. Yeah, it's really good. It's very, very original, very unique. But that is essentially what happens. And it has a negative aspect to it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: There's a virus.

JOE ROGAN: I don't want to give away too much of it for people that want to watch the show because it's a really good show, but there's a virus that they get a signal from another world and they figure out what this signal is.

And through this lab work they reveal that this signal is some sort of the encoding of a specific virus. They work on this specific virus, it spreads and the entire planet becomes one consciousness except for a small number of people. It's a weird show. It's a really good show.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I'm going to.

JOE ROGAN: I don't want to explain any more of it without any spoiler alerts, but it's f*ing great. But it's strange. It's like, wouldn't that be better? There's no crime, there's no this, there's no that. But then it reveals all the problems that come along with that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I'm going to have to watch that as a counterpoint if anything else, because it makes sense to me that everyone's kind of united as one superorganism of sorts.

JOE ROGAN: But you lose all individuality. You lose all the fun parts about being an imperfect person, because we are an imperfect species. But that's also what makes great art. That's what makes great music. It's what makes great fun.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Most creative people have the most drama in their past from what I've seen.

JOE ROGAN: And if you have zero trauma, you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Probably have sucky art, just stick figures and shit.

JOE ROGAN: I mean, I wonder why would be if they would even have a need for it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Because it's an expression. It's getting your angry out, right?

JOE ROGAN: Or your angst or your anxiety or depression. Whatever it is, you're getting something out.

Art, Expression, and Human Experience


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I was telling my son that the other day. He's, you know, it's hard being in these bodies, especially going through puberty. You know, you're just like, what is this thing I'm carrying? This little meat suit, you know.

And I was like, man, I was the same way. Still the same way. And I picked up instruments. I started painting. I learned to play every sport I could physically play. There's ways to get that out, you know?

But it seems like a lot of that does come from just the anxiety and the anger. And, you know, you're growing into yourself. You're starting to get the feels. You look at women differently, and it's like, what do I do with this?

JOE ROGAN: Well, it changes. It rewires the entire way you view the world. And meanwhile, your body is physically changing and growing. You're like, what am I going to look like? Eventually? Weird.

Genetic Anomalies and Human Variation


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: You know, there's actually this, in a small island in the Pacific, they have this weird characteristic where they start out as females. Everybody does. We all start out as females in utero. And then maleness is imposed on the developing fetus.

But they don't until puberty because they're not sensitive to dihydrotestosterone, the precursor to testosterone. So they grow up their entire life as girls, and then at puberty, they turn into a boy.

JOE ROGAN: So they get raised as girls.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They are girls. They're physically. But they have. Not yet. Nope. What is this planet? I mean, this is an island.

JOE ROGAN: What is this?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's an island in the South Pacific. It's called pseudo hermaphroditism. I know. I learned about this in grad school.

JOE ROGAN: What do they look like?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They look like girls. What? Exactly like girls. They are girls. And then the ovaries descend as testicles, and the clitoris grows out into a penis.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So you think puberty is hard enough already? These people turn into the opposite sex at age 12 or 13. It's wild, man.

JOE ROGAN: So is this a bizarre genetic anomaly? Is it something to do with.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. So a lot of times on islands, you get really strange characteristics of people because of the isolation. And those characteristics get selected just through genetic drift alone because it's a small population.

So just probably one person had this really weird trait where they're insensitive to dihydrotestosterone. And then it spread throughout more of the population. It doesn't do anything. It's not something natural selection would select against. It's just weird as shit.

JOE ROGAN: What is the name of this island?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I don't remember the name of the island, but the condition's called, find it. I think it's Mallow island in Vanuatu, or. That sound. Oh, yeah.

JOE ROGAN: How many people are on that island?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: This says there's a population in 1979 of 2,300 people. Yeah. And think historically, different kinds of people there or something.

JOE ROGAN: Two different kinds of people, cultural groups.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Isn't that wild, though, man? I remember hearing about that in grad school at Ohio State, and I was just like, I'm sorry, what did you just say?

JOE ROGAN: I'm sure you've seen those people, the ostrich feet people in Africa. It's a very strange genetic anomaly where they don't grow toes. They essentially have two very wide appendages. Yeah, they look, it looks like a weird bird foot. It's very strange. But a bunch of people in this particular tribe share this trait.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Is there any advantage or, it's just, it's like this where it just kind of happened and.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what advantage there would be. Maybe it's.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Maybe it's really sexy to them.

JOE ROGAN: Maybe you could move better with it. I don't know. It's.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's what they look like. Whoa. Yeah. I don't know how I haven't seen that. That's wild.

JOE ROGAN: I know. Isn't that crazy?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, it is kind of sexy.

JOE ROGAN: If that's what you're into, dog. I wonder how long that's been going on for Vadoma.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: See, that seems like more of a defect that just worked toward fixity in the population. Maybe not.

JOE ROGAN: Well, it just makes you wonder, why don't we all have that? You know, what is the reason why we have all these toes that. It's called? Electrodactyl. Yeah, electrodactyly.

The Vulnerability of Human Evolution


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, historically, prehistorically, evolutionarily, I should say, if you did have something like that and you were a hunter gatherer, you're kind of boned. You know, you're not going to be able to run after gazelle.

JOE ROGAN: I don't know. Maybe you can. Their feet are well adapted to the Zambezi valleys, rough terrain allowing them to move quickly and efficiently through the landscape.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: All right, I take it back.

JOE ROGAN: Well, it kind of makes sense, right? Because what it's saying is that their bones are fused. If you scroll up, it'll say condition affecting ostrich footed tribe. A genetic mutation passed down through generations causes the bones and the feet to fuse, resulting in a claw-like structure with two large toes.

Toes are very vulnerable. I don't know if you've ever broken a toe, but—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I broke one an hour before I got on the plane to come here. Really? If you can see my left foot.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, that's hilarious.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's ridiculous. Like the whole thing is just purple.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, they're so small. Like my pinky toe. I was messing around my pinky toe the other day because I have to trim my toenails, right? And the pinky toenail is like barely a nail. It's so tiny. And I'm like, God, this little thing is so vulnerable. And it has to support my entire body weight or part of my entire body weight.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. They're so dumb. Oh yeah, you can see that it's jacked. Yeah. Dude, that was like right before I was coming down. I'm like, you're kidding me. That sucks.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I've broken a bunch of toes. It's very, very annoying. And you would imagine if you had two giant f*ing elbow bones down there instead of these bitchy a little toesies.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, maybe that's why they did it. Maybe that's what they got going on.

JOE ROGAN: Kind of makes sense that that would be an adaptation.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Invincible feet.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, you know, we're so vulnerable. And that's one of the weirder things. Like, so first we should get into what you do because you have a very interesting theory. Tell everybody what your background is, first of all.

Masters' Extratempestrial Hypothesis


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, all right. That does seem like a good place to start. My background is in anthropology and biological anthropology. My research mostly focuses on evolutionary anatomy, biomedicine. I've done some archaeology various places around the world in Montana.

But the reason I'm here, I assume, because according to my friend Matt, we were butchering a mule deer I think I shot. And I was like, yeah, I got to go to this conference. And I was like, do you want to know what it's about? He's like, nobody gives a sh*t about what you do other than UFOs, man. I was like, damn it. He's right. Like, I did actually used to do a lot of what I thought was cool stuff.

But no, the main thing is that I've become known for advocating for this idea that UFOs and the aliens are actually our time-traveling future human descendants. I wouldn't even say as opposed to extraterrestrials, because I do think that's a component too. I oftentimes get pigeonholed. People are like, oh, you just think they're all time travelers. I don't. I actually say this all the time, but it doesn't matter.

I do think there's a lot going on, but my background and the reason I approach this question this way is because there's a lot of characteristics of these aliens that look so hominin, they look just like us. And specifically what we'd expect to see in our hominin future if the same evolutionary trends continue into the future. So I kind of just tie those things together. And even the saucer-shaped craft seemingly are time machines themselves. So that's kind of the Cliff Notes version.

JOE ROGAN: Well, it's a theory that a lot of people have independently sort of come to. Right?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Especially recently.

JOE ROGAN: And the concept of just, if you just think about ancient man. I was watching this documentary on Neanderthals last night about this one intact Neanderthal skeleton that they found that was, it had sort of been, he had died in a cave. And you know the stalagmites, stalactites or mites. How do you say it?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Tights or mites are down.

JOE ROGAN: So he was essentially mineralized. There was stuff all over the body and it took a long time for them to break this body.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think I saw it. Was it on Netflix?

Neanderthals and Human Evolution


JOE ROGAN: No, I was watching it on YouTube maybe. Originally it was on Netflix, but it was just documenting how strange this body was that they had found. But it was immensely strong, like much stronger than us.

One of the interesting things was that their visual cortex, the part of the brain that would process imagery, was larger than ours, 10 to 20% larger. And that, so these things probably had better eyesight than us, perhaps even were able to see at night. And that this is a bigger, stronger version of a human being, like much more durable than what we are modern 2025 Homo sapiens, if you just look. Yeah, that's it. That's one of them.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Neither human nor Neanderthal.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, really?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: This is a published, is this the same?

JOE ROGAN: This might not be the same one. This is maybe a different one. That's a weird one because, what's that f*ing thing on its head?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's what it says. It's a stalactite growing out of it or something.

JOE ROGAN: Wow. In a weird form.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Weird. It's like a unicorn.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, like a crest.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They do. They do have a sagittal ridge. Yes, Homo erectus had one where there's an offshoot in our hominin lineage called the paranthropus or robust Australopithecines. And they had a full on, like, gorilla style, really, sagittal ridge. Yeah, because they were a vegetarian. So they just chewed all day.

JOE ROGAN: Right. So they had massive muscles to—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, their whole face is huge.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Neanderthals kind of, I mean, they were just big. It's just a robusticity thing. But there is evidence from Shanidar Cave in Iraq where they were using their teeth as tools. We think they were like tanning hides. They were holding the hide in their mouth and then like scraping all the nasty bits. Oh, and you can see that in the tooth wear.

So, yeah, they were pretty badass. They were the first, I don't know, I think this is cool, but a lot of people think I'm a nerd too. They were the first to use the flake. Like, for 2.8 million years, we just hit a piece of rock and like, oh, this cool tool. But then they figured out that if you hit the rock in just the right way, the piece that falls off makes an even better tool. So it goes like 2.5—

JOE ROGAN: Yes, exactly.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And from that point on, like, I got to work at a place called Chez Pinot Jean Sac in southern France for a summer, and it was a Neanderthal site. And we found these, actually, it's pretty funny because when we first got there, these tools called MTA, hand axes, Mousterian of Acheulean tradition, hand axes. There were only eight found in all of Europe.

And they said, if you guys find one of these, we'll buy you all the beer and all the cognac you can drink. So we're in the cognac region of France and we found one, like the fourth or fifth day. We went on to find seven more. Over the course of that week, we doubled the number of these things in existence in all of Europe.

And they were not lying. They bought us so many damn beers, like archaeologists like to drink, you know, sure, we dig and it's boring as hell. You know, it's not Indiana Jones. We're not running around banging hot chicks and flying on planes. We're like, we got a spoon and we're doing this for eight hours.

So yeah, I actually found the last one on the last day and it was by far the worst one. Like I had to argue that this is even, it should even count as one of these. But yeah, no, it was a cool site. So yeah, they were doing well, but we were doing better. We came in and replaced them.

JOE ROGAN: Well, something happened where we replaced them.

The Decline of Modern Humans


The point is, as time goes on, humans today are probably the most feeble version of humans that have ever existed. And we're the most feeble versions of people that have existed within the last century. Right? Like if you go back to humans from the 1920s versus humans from the 2000s, people have way less testosterone now, way higher instances of miscarriages, way lower sperm count.

You know, there's a lot of factors that are at play right now that are changing what a human is. And if you extrapolate, if you look at the future, you would naturally say, well, we're probably going to be very thin. It seems like there's at least some sort of a push to eliminate gender. Like gender seems like it's on the table as whether or not it's even necessary.

There's all sorts of new technological innovations that are leading to the possibility, at least sometime in the future of an artificial womb. There's genetic engineering with CRISPR and a lot of other different technologies that are being explored that we might be able to engineer human beings and then even create a complete individual human being without a mother, without a father.

So if you thought about what that looks like in the future, like, one of our problems on this planet is we all have different ideologies, different religions come from different parts of the world. We look different. And human beings as tribal primates have a tendency to other, we other different tribes. Those are not us. We are us. Those are the enemy.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: We go out, you rally around it.

JOE ROGAN: But if everybody is exactly the same and we share one mind, you know, then a lot of our problems go away. If we no longer have to compete for resources, we no longer have the desire to procreate and to acquire land and to be, you know, to have a territory, we eliminate a lot of our issues.

And that's what these things look like when you look at the archetypal, these iconic sort of shapes that have been on cave walls all the way up to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. One thing they share is that they have no muscle, they have large heads, they have big eyes, and they're childlike.

The Pedomorphic Nature of Grey Entities


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They're very pedomorphic, as we say. Yeah, you just tied together a lot of really important points related to this theory, aspects of why they're always interested in our gametes, why they come back and put that little machine on a man to collect semen, why they're constantly taking eggs from females and planting fetuses, pulling them back out later.

They're clearly focused on reproduction, gamete extraction. And one of the things that might be fueling that in the future, if these are future humans, let's just assume for a second, hypothetically, is that they might be having problems directly resulting from these trends towards self-domestication, these trends toward feminization, these trends toward reduced sperm counts, which is 60% across most populations of the world in the industrialized world, 50% across the entire world.

Problems with reproduction, in vitro fertilization, exogenesis chambers might help solve some of those problems, growing the fetus outside of the body. So, yeah, and like you said, you know, what do they look like? They look like kind of a hybrid between males and females to some extent, but there's still an essence of gender.

Like, if you talk to Whitley Strieber, you know, he's with this being, he says in Communion that “I had a sense that she was a woman. I don't know why, but I kind of sensed that.” So it's almost like the essence of the individual, the soul of the individual still retains that sort of gender identity, even though our bodies are becoming more childlike, more gender indiscriminate. I don't know. But yeah, yet another one of those ways in which we might sort of grow together as a species.

Evaluating Abduction Accounts


JOE ROGAN: Now, when you say they are extracting sperm, how many of these stories do you take seriously? There's a lot of these stories.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's a great question.

JOE ROGAN: Unfortunately, for any sort of spectacular public thing that's in the zeitgeist, like alien abduction, whether it's Whitley Strieber from Communion or the John Mack books, the guy from Harvard that wrote, what was it, Abduction?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Passport to the Cosmos and Abduction. Yeah, two great books, great books.

JOE ROGAN: But these are all books about encounters, close encounters of the third kind with some sort of a being from another place. Whatever it is, it's just not a human being. And it seems to be technologically superior to us and seems to be one thing they all seem to share is they seem to be able to communicate telekinetically or telepathically.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, yeah. And I mean, they aren't human, but they are very human too. So, for instance, that's one of the main reasons I started exploring this. I was actually kind of put into this when I was 8 or 9 years old, sort of activated in a way and put on this path by a weird thing that happened to me.

JOE ROGAN: What happened to you?

Masters' Childhood Vision


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, so I talk about it in my first two books, Identified Flying Objects and The Extra-Tempestrial Model, where I learned about a close encounter that my dad had. He was a veterinarian in Northeast Ohio, where I grew up, and he was out one night on a call with another guy. So there's two people, as far as J. Allen Hynek's reliability scale has more reliability because there's multiple witnesses.

It's also strange on his scale because they crested the hill, there's a bright light. This is in Amish country. There's no lights in Amish country. And all of a sudden this bright light darts toward him, hovers just above their truck, darts back to where it was, and straight up into space, at incredible speed.

So this happened before I was born. But I overheard him telling the story to some friends. One night he got Whitley Strieber's book Communion, as most people did in the 1980s and as they should, because it's a great book. And I walked into the living room, the book is sitting on the shelf facing out.

And I remember, like it was yesterday, I sort of stopped, and there was this light, like a white light. And then I saw this image in my mind of an early hominin, chimpanzee-like creature, a modern human, and then that archetypal grey alien from the cover with this information: “What if they're related? What if they are us from the future?”

And obviously, I mean, that's why I became a biological anthropologist. People are always like, “So you saw this?” Yeah, it was like a flash, like a light. And, you know, it's weird looking back on it, because I know a lot more about these experiences. I've talked to people that have had these types of experiences.

JOE ROGAN: What was the setting?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It was our living room. So it was like, you come in the front door, and just to the left, there's this living room built-in bookshelf, Whitley's book right there. I just turned the corner, saw it, and then it just came. I didn't know sh*t about evolutionary biology.

JOE ROGAN: Well, you didn't say you saw it. Like, you saw it. How?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: In my mind, just this white light, just an image, and there's that image of the three faces. And then the question, “Could they be us from the future?” And a lot of people are like, “How did you get into UFOs? You're a biological anthropologist.” It's the opposite. I got into biological anthropology to research this question of whether they could be us from the future.

JOE ROGAN: Huh. So you felt like at that moment, it wasn't just a weird thought or a dream. It felt like a message. What did it feel like?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, yeah, it was a tasking. You know, I think Rupert Sheldrake said it, that people don't have ideas, ideas have people. I think that was like the, “Hey, go do this thing.” And I did. That's why we're here now talking about it.

And obviously, you know, you got to be careful about selection bias and confirmation bias. I didn't go into grad school—I also didn't tell anybody in grad school I was there because they would have kicked me out. But I went into it with an open mind, but I was there to study these things because of that event when I was 8 years old.

The Challenge of Confirmation Bias


JOE ROGAN: Wow. Yeah. It is a problem, the confirmation bias. It is a problem with wanting it to be real. And I struggle with that because I desperately want it to be real. And so every time I talk to someone, I've talked to a bunch of people that are, you know, air quote “whistleblowers.” And some of them, I think for sure have been sent in here to distribute disinformation. Yeah, no doubt, for sure, because it's a great place to do it. Yeah, I'll listen to you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I'll entertain almost anything, which is great, we need that. But yeah, I mean, obviously there's people that are going to take advantage of it.

JOE ROGAN: But I think it's also important for me to say I'm not convinced. You know, I don't know how much of this is horsesh*t, but it's not zero.

Evaluating Case Studies and the Reproductive Focus


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: No. And that was your question: how do I differentiate among these different cases? I do draw from Hynek's. In his book The UFO Experience, he lists out how we all should approach this based on the reliability scale and the strangeness scale. Jacques Vallée also drew from that, helped him develop it as part of the Invisible College and all of his work.

But regardless of my own personal discernment, because my second book, The Extra-Tempestrial Model, is about 30 case studies, 15 main case studies, but then I pull in other ones and it explores the different theories, obviously, the main one being this extra-tempestrial idea, this future—which, by the way, I saw the word of the day today was “anachronistic.” And I was like, man, that would have been a way better word than extra-tempestrial, which everybody struggles with. I could have called them anachronauts. Doesn't that sound cool? Anachronauts.

JOE ROGAN: Ooh, that sounds really cool.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I know. What the hell was I thinking, man? Anyway, but so one of the most commonly reported things across all cases, regardless of whether you think it's bullsh*t or you think this definitely happened, is they really want our sperm, they really need or want our reproductive material, our gametes.

And it's funny because when I wrote my first book in 2012, I started, published it in 2019, right at the end, I did an interview and someone's like, “Have you heard of Jim Penniston?” Like, no. Which is kind of a failing on my behalf, I'll admit. That one, it turns out. So it was the Rendlesham Forest incident. He touched this craft, he got this binary code, and when deciphering the binary code, they legitimately, specifically said, “We are you from the future. We're having problems with reproduction.”

He underwent hypnotic regression. “We're having problems with reproduction, and we need this genetic material to help ourselves.” You know, a lot of people are like, “Well, why are they coming back and doing stuff to us?” I think they're coming back and getting stuff from us because of problems they're having, largely related to what you were talking about earlier with the reduced sperm counts, the problem with female infertility.

What if we do try to create the perfect human specimen or we try to cure these genetic diseases through genetic manipulation, CRISPR, and we screw something up? We might have to come back. We can't go to another planet, there aren't people on these planets. We can't go and sample gametes from these other places. We might have to go into our past to get those wild-type unmanipulated gametes in order to fix these problems.

Time Travel and the Block Universe


JOE ROGAN: God, that's a crazy level of technological sophistication. The ability to venture back in time and somehow or another not f*ck up the timeline that's leading to—I mean, this is the problem that's always been theorized about time travel. Anything that you do, if you went back in time, any interactions, you would completely change how the future would play out.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: In the many-worlds interpretation. Yeah. So that idea is unfortunately very pervasive and mostly because of Back to the Future, which I think ruined the brains of most people. Mine too, certainly in my generation.

But most physicists don't agree on many things, but most agree that we live in what's called a block universe. Landscape time. Block time where if you imagine all moments from the very beginning of the Big Bang to the end of the universe, where all matter appears into a black hole or contracts or whatever it does, all moments are already there. They exist as this massive four-dimensional block of all moments, all worldlines, everything.

So you go back into the past as you perceive it, you can do whatever you want. You can walk around, step on butterflies, you know, slap people on the face, kick over dinosaurs or whatever. I don't think we can go back that far. But you could do anything you want. And it doesn't change anything because you're going back in the block universe and doing those things you were always already going to do.

And when you get home, everything's the same because that was already their past. To everybody that stayed behind, that was already their past. It was only the future for you to go back and do those things that you were already going to do. And then you just went and did them, get home, everything's the same because you were always going to do those things in the first place.

That's hard if that is the actual model of the universe. And again, I can only work in writing these books. I can only work from what we know. Now, clearly there's a lot of things we don't know. I'm not claiming to know anything beyond what we can know right now. But physicists, despite not knowing what time is, they know it's an emergent phenomenon. There's something more fundamental that time comes from. But they do agree on this block universe model. And in that case there is no paradox.

JOE ROGAN: How do they all agree on that? Wouldn't you have to test that and come up with some sort of a hypothesis and then try to prove it or disprove it?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I shouldn't say they all agree because there is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics where if you went back in that situation, it would be change, you would be changing the timeline. Would it be changing your timeline or would it be changing a different timeline is the question. And how would you know? There's more paradoxes with changing things than not changing things.

JOE ROGAN: Why do you confidently state that you don't think that they can go back to the dinosaur age?

Time Travel Physics and Electromagnetic Propulsion


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Partly because three different reasons. One, I think they need tremendously high speed in order to be able to go back into the past. So basically again, working from all I can work from in this time with the limited primitive primate knowledge that I have in the year 2012 to 2025, I basically just started with Einstein's theory of relativity which he published in 1905 on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. And then in 1915 he published his paper on general relativity.

From that point on, almost instantly there were solutions to his field equations that showed with the right parameters of a massively highly energetic rotating ring or sphere or disk, that you could create closed time light curves, that you could actually orient light cones back toward the past so you can physically go into the past. We saw this with Lenz and Thuring in 1917 and 1918. Kurt Gödel's Gödel universe was not long after, I think the 1920s maybe.

And then importantly in the 1970s you had Frank Tipler who showed mathematically that you can shrink that down to a disk. He actually called it a disk. That's one of the reasons I think that these are time machines is because it has all of the parameters described by Frank Tipler. He wasn't talking about UFOs, but they seemingly have the ability to jump in and out of time. They appear and disappear.

JOE ROGAN: But you're definitely not talking too much.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, I mean we're here to talk. But I have an internal trigger where I'm like, shut up, Masters.

JOE ROGAN: Don't listen to that trigger. Let it roll.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So anyway, if you look at the history of how we understand backward time travel, what I think they're doing is that I think they're combining general relativity and special relativity. So I think they're orienting the light cones toward the past by rotating these things really, really fast. You hear that all the time. They power up, they're spinning, or at least there's some sort of flywheel on the outside that's spinning. I think that's what's allowing them to move toward the past. And then they take off.

So it's that high speed that I think allows them to go further into the past. So they're using—you're aware of the twins paradox, I'm sure—time dilation, where you have two twins, they're the same age, and then one goes into a spaceship. They move at tremendously high speed. They come back and they're much younger than their twin because time moved faster back on Earth.

I think they're using that high speed motion while light cones are oriented toward the past in order to travel deeper into the past through that process of time dilation. There are limits to how fast we can go. Einstein was very adamant about this because there's an increase in inertial forces the faster you go relative to the speed of light. That's why he thought we could never go. That's why he thought that anything with mass could never go faster than the speed of light. Light can do it because it's a wave or a particle or both. So I think there's a limit to how fast we can go.

The other reason is because Jim Penniston in this hypnotic regression said that he's like, “We can only go 40 to 60,000 years into the past or we might not get back.” You also have—and this is a more speculative one, so take it for what it's worth—you also have the Dan Burisch testimony of this J-Rod, this allegedly captured alien, who said, “We're from the future. We are you from the future. And we're from about 55 to 60,000 years in your future.”

So those three things together are why I don't think we could go back 65 million years to hunt dinosaurs, which actually would be kind of fun.

Space-Time Bubbles and Frame of Reference


JOE ROGAN: When you talk about going the speed of light, you're talking about not traditional propulsion, but some form of propulsion that allows you to go at insane speeds.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, electromagnetic is what it seems to be. And importantly, the electromagnetic force is 10 to the 40 times more powerful than gravity. So not only do I think that's what they use to fly, I think that's what they use to manipulate space-time, actually. And Dan Burisch is not Dan Burisch. Dan Burisch, I think you just had him on to the Age of Disclosure.

JOE ROGAN: Yes.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: There's this really cool thing at the end where Hal Puthoff and I think Eric Davis as well were talking about this space-time bubble, right. A really weird thing happened. We can get to that in a second. But I don't want to jump around too much because I'll lose people and myself probably.

But this space-time bubble that they form around the craft I think is also indicative of the fact that they're manipulating space-time, that they're traveling in and out of time. They use it to hide in plain sight. They manipulate the rate at which they move relative to us in their frame of reference. And they're moving fast all around us at different—and they've slowed time down outside of that bubble. So everything is really, really slow to them. And they can easily evade our bullets and our missiles, but we don't see them because we don't have that frame rate of perception.

And if you slow videos down, I'm sure you've seen these all the time where there's like a—and then you slow it down and you can see this saucer-shaped craft moving slowly across the sky once you slow down the frame rate.

But a really funny thing happened because I've never actually talked about this with anyone before. I owe a lot of the fact that anybody even knows who I am to Hal Puthoff. When I first started talking about this publicly in 2018 and then I published my book in 2019, Identified Flying Objects, he I guess reached out to the head of MUFON at the time who was putting together the 50th anniversary MUFON event and was like, “Hey, you should have this Mike Masters guy come talk.”

And I found that out from the head of MUFON. He's like, “Hey, just so you know, Hal Puthoff of all people recommended I contact you.” I had no idea who that is. So I get on the Internet and I Google Hal Puthoff. He also put Jesse Michaels, mutual friend, in touch with me after. I think he did an interview with him and Weinstein. I forget his name.

JOE ROGAN: Eric.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he did an interview with those two. I guess Hal was like, “Hey, you should reach out to Mike Masters.” And he did and we talked and we've done stuff together.

But what was cool is that at the end of that Age of Disclosure film, when he's talking about the space-time bubble, I thought back to after my first book came out and I was contacted by someone who claimed to be an ex-intelligence person who explained that exact same thing to me back in 2019, that these things aren't doing 10,000 G maneuvers that would crush anything inside.

To them in their frame of reference, what they feel is completely different than what we see. Because in that space-time bubble, they can be moving at 50,000 miles an hour, do a right-hand turn and it would splatter anything inside because of the G forces. That's what we see on the outside. But in that space-time bubble, they probably feel 1, 2 Gs at the most.

So I started thinking, man, was that—how did Hal reach out to me with a different email address and say, “Hey, just so you know, this is how these things are happening. This is how they're able to do it.” And I was a dumbass. I still am a dumbass, but I was an extra big dumbass back then. And I was like, “Oh, cool, thanks, man.”

You know, a story went viral about my books and Fox News picked it up and Space.com and so I was going through a bunch of emails. They recognized I wasn't getting what they were saying. I was not picking up what they were putting down. And they were like, “No, this is important.” Said it again, and then it clicked. I was like, “Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. They're manipulating the rate at which time passes in this bubble around the craft and we see something completely different.”

JOE ROGAN: So when we're seeing this, we are imagining what we can do and we're sort of saying, well, what would be an advanced version of what we can do? And what this technology is, is something that's levels of magnitude beyond even our theoretical, any sort of idea that we have currently about potential future timelines of technology. Yeah, there's no one talking about gravity bubbles that allow you to instantaneously traverse immense gaps in the universe.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, they might be talking about behind closed doors at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

JOE ROGAN: Right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And have been for 70 years.

The Problem with Disclosure and Donated Craft


JOE ROGAN: That's the real problem with disclosure. How much progress could we have made if they had opened up all this stuff? And you got to imagine if you were an intelligent life form from another planet. You know, Diana Pasulka talked about her and Gary Nolan talked about how they refer to some of these things as donations. They don't think of them as crashed vehicles because some of them are not crashed. They're completely intact.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And I think David Grusch said that too, didn't he?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I believe he did.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: And even, you know, Lazar, when he was talking about it, he, you know—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: He had a sports model. Wasn't that fully intact, too?

JOE ROGAN: Fully intact, yeah. Fully intact and operational. And apparently they flew it around.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, that'd be fun.

Bob Lazar's Story


JOE ROGAN: Well, that was one of the reasons, you know, the whole story, how he got caught. It's a really crazy story. So he used to work at Los Alamos. He was a propulsions expert. Guy put a jet engine on the back of a Honda. He was a real freak. You know, he made a hydrogen Corvette, like the 1990s. He was a nutty dude.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Clearly an engineer. Yes, that part checks out.

JOE ROGAN: So he gets his job on Area S-4 and goes there, and it's all documented in Jeremy Corbell's excellent movie, Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers. So he goes there and sees this thing and it's got an American flag sticker on it. And, you know, they basically say, “Tell us how it works.” And he's like, “Oh, this is ours.” Because he sees it has a sticker on it, and then he realizes this is made out of some completely unknown alloy.

There's no seams in it. It seems to be 3D printed. There's no controls inside of it. It's designed for something that's three feet tall. It's all very f*ing weird. So he's working on this thing, not making much headway at all. They understood that there was an element, element 115, that was not even on the periodic table. Eventually found to actually be a thing by the Large Hadron Collider. But even then, they only measured it for a millisecond, right?

So then he's saying that they have this stable version of this element and you bombard it with radiation, creates this sort of gravity drive. He's working on this thing and it's all top secret, so he cannot tell his wife. So they're calling him up at 10 o'clock, like, “Hey, get to the airplane, the airport, we need you.” And so he would have to fly out at random times, fly out to S-4.

And his wife was like, “This motherfer's having an affair. Well, I'm going to have an affair, too.” So she starts fing her flight attendant or a flight instructor. I think that's what it was. When you have that kind of clearance, they are monitoring everything. They're monitoring all your phone calls. So they've realized that his wife is having an affair. And they think that he will be emotionally unstable and it's too dangerous to have him working on this insanely top secret information if he's not stable.

So they tell him, “You know, we're going to at least temporarily relieve you of your duties.” So he's freaked out. And he tells his friends, “Hey, this is what they're doing there. They have these things and they fly them every Wednesday. I'm going to take you guys. There's an area we can go watch.”

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So they take—

JOE ROGAN: He takes his friends out there on two separate occasions, I believe. They get caught. They get caught, gets arrested. They release him. And he realizes, “I'm kind of f*ed. They might kill me. I'm going to have to go public with this,” contacts George Knapp.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: George Knapp. I did see that.

JOE ROGAN: Then the whole thing is history.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Yeah. No, that's wild, man. And I think—and it's still happening, you know, there's still these whistleblowers.

JOE ROGAN: He says they used to fly them and you could go watch them fly these things. And they were moving in these really weird ways across the sky that you cannot do with conventional aircraft. That they only sort of understood how to pick it up and put it down. They didn't understand how to really—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That was out at Groom Lake, right?

JOE ROGAN: Yes.

Area 51 and Government Secrecy


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. I remember as a kid, obviously been in this for a long time. I remember as a kid seeing videos of people going out, and then they eventually closed it down. You couldn't get to that spot.

JOE ROGAN: That was during the Obama administration. During the Obama administration, they actually had to admit that Area 51 was real, because before that, they didn't. No one even knew it was real. I mean, it was always just a joke. Like Area 51, it was like, for fun. But then they said, no, it is real and we need to expand the forbidden boundary.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And isn't that when people were going to, like, bum rush it too?

JOE ROGAN: That was during COVID. During COVID there was a bunch of dorks that like, “we're going to crash Area 51.” That's a good way to die. They'll f*ing kill you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Natural selection.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. They're working on a lot of stuff out there. And some of it is weapons. They can't have you Internet dorks from Reddit just running out into Area 51.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I think they eventually realized that because I don't think they went out there, but yeah. Would have been bad.

JOE ROGAN: I think it was all bullshit. They weren't. What are you going to do? How are you going to get out there?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Engagement farming. Yeah, man. There's a lot of crazy shit that's been going on. It's been going on for a while.

Compartmentalization and Reverse Engineering


Jamie and I were talking beforehand about the stove piping too, and all the different ways that they compartmentalize what they're doing. They talked about it in Age of Disclosure too. That's a big problem because certain people are working on these parts of the craft to reverse engineer them, to understand them, but they don't have the whole picture.

JOE ROGAN: Lazar was talking about that from the 1980s. In 1989, he said the people that are working on metallurgy were not in contact with the people that are working on propulsion. And you weren't. He's like, science cannot operate like that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, no, it can't. Because you need to know what's going on beyond just this little part that you're working on.

JOE ROGAN: And if you have a bunch of people that are sharing information, you get a much more comprehensive understanding of what this thing is.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. We all benefit from communication.

JOE ROGAN: Right. Because there could be something involved in the actual structure of it that lends to its ability to do something. It might not be simply just structure. It might be structure with some sort of an ability.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, you can't see the forest through the trees in these situations. And it's unfortunate. And the argument they made in this documentary is that we're putting ourselves at a disadvantage because other countries have probably retrieved these things too, and they might be working on them. Yes, in secrecy, but if people are working together and not stove piping this thing ad infinitum, then they might be able to actually make more progress faster than us.

So part of the disclosure push is to be like, yeah, these things are real. We have them. Let's get our best scientists together to work on this holistically instead of compartmentalizing it.

JOE ROGAN: Just imagine if they had done that from 1947, where we would be.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Exactly.

JOE ROGAN: If that's real. If Roswell was real, if all the crash was real. Philip J. Corso is correct. And all these people are telling the truth.

Teaching UFOs: History and Science


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I know. And we still have to preface these things with “if.” If it's real. And yeah, I do the same thing. I mean, as coming from academia. When I wrote my first book, I had to be like, “if this is real.” But it's hard. It's this paradox of sorts. Because how do you write to explain something that isn't real?

JOE ROGAN: Right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: What's the point of even doing that?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So I think we have to assume. I'm actually teaching a class at Montana Tech this spring called “UFOs: History and Science.”

JOE ROGAN: Oh, I would take that if I was in school.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think it's going to be a lot. Yeah, I know. I'm pretty stoked about it. And I had these artists design a poster in Norway, in the UK. And just this crazy. Like, I was like, how conservative should I be with this? Like, just a UFO. And I gave him total artistic freedom. And there's like, an alien holding the earth and UFO swinging around. I'm like, all right. I guess that's what I'm doing. Plastered it all over campus to recruit people to take the class.

But like, I'm going in on day one. We're not going to f* around with, like, are these things real? We're not going to waste time on that. We're going to jump in. These are real. Here's what we're doing. This is what we know. This is what we don't know. Explore the theories, explore the history, explore the prehistory, because it's a waste of time. Like, these things are real.

JOE ROGAN: You think they're real?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I know.

JOE ROGAN: What makes you convinced?

Personal UFO Encounters


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I have read enough accounts in researching this and from people that I know. I mean, starting from when I was a kid hearing my biological father's account, the way he told it. And then I interviewed him again in college to try to get more information, because I was just over hearing from the stairs, and I was supposed to be in bed. He saw what he saw. And then eventually I saw some UFOs.

JOE ROGAN: What did you see?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I was kind of pissed, actually, because I started talking about this in 2018, and people were always like, “you ever seen a UFO?” No, never seen UFO. I'd like to. And then finally, in 2022, it might have been late 2021. I don't remember exactly when. It was kind of warmish. So it was probably 2021.

But I was, everybody's in bed at my house. I live in a canyon. And I was having a whiskey and I was like, I just walked up the canyon wall for some reason, like the hill behind my house. I don't really know why. I turned around and I could see these five super bright lights over what's known as the East Ridge in Butte, Montana. They're just over the East Ridge. I was like, well, that's not normal. Those aren't usually there.

And they weren't stars. They're way too big, way too close. I would say they were probably within 5 to 8 miles. They were in the distance, but they were like there. And then I just kind of looked at them for a second, like, oh, that's weird. And then one by one, from right to left, they just shot off toward the southeast at like crazy speed. The kind of like in Star Wars or Star Trek hyperdrive. That little light trail, like just one by one until they were all gone. I have no conventional explanation for that.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: But I've never been one of those people that's like, “I need to see it to believe it.” Because I believe the people who say the same thing over and over. There's patterns that we can extract from people's testaments who have had these close encounters.

And that's one unfortunate thing that's happening right now is we're talking about the pilots, talking about police. But people have been seeing these forever. But they did such a good job manufacturing the stigma around it with Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, to discount these people, to make them seem insane.

Project Blue Book and Government Disinformation


JOE ROGAN: That is one of the main points of evidence that I would point to that there is something. When people think there isn't something, I'm like, you should really pay attention to what they were trying to do during Project Blue Book. Because one of them, I have a buddy of mine, my friend Steve Graham. Shout out to Steve.

When he was a boy, he was living in New York, upstate New York, and he filmed this red orb that was flying across the sky. And he took some photographs of it. And they called someone, some officials somewhere, I don't remember. He was very young. And they said, “we are going to analyze the photos and then we'll bring them back to you.” And they never returned the photographs.

When he called, he said, “no agents. There's no record of any agents coming to visit you. We don't know what to tell you.” So they just took his photos and that was it. But he said whatever it was, he was young. I believe he was 10 or 11. And he said, whatever it was was really weird. He goes, it was this red orb that was flying through the sky, was a spacecraft. It wasn't a sun, it wasn't a meteor. It looked like it was moving purposely and under control. And it was there long enough for him to take a Polaroid of it.

And they just completely erased any memory of it or any evidence of it when he called, like I said, they said no agents visited you. Whatever the agent's names were. There's no agents by that name.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's kind of the status quo.

JOE ROGAN: They try to make you look like a fool.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Absolutely. And that was intentional. Like, the stated mission of Project Grudge was to debunk these things, come up with conventional explanations and make people seem like idiots.

JOE ROGAN: Right. It wasn't to investigate. The purpose wasn't “let's get to the bottom of this, find out. Is this Russia? Is Russia doing this?” That was not the purpose. The purpose was make these people look like fools. You only do that if you know something that other people don't.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And it worked. They did a damn good job at it. Because we still feel like fools talking about this. We still have to check ourselves and be like, is this real? If this is real.

JOE ROGAN: Right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: But I think that shame is starting to diminish. I think the stigma is starting to go away.

The 2017 New York Times Article


JOE ROGAN: Well, I think the New York Times article.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: 2017, that was a game changer.

JOE ROGAN: That was a big one.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: And then from then on, it's been this trickle. These guys like Ryan Graves and guys like David Favor, these. David Favor's a guy that was in a fighter jet, saw this thing move from 50,000 feet above sea level to sea level in less than a second. And they saw this thing. There was something under the water below it.

It's like whatever he saw. And if you ever talked to him. Have you ever talked to him?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I've talked to Alex Dietrich, who was with him during that.

JOE ROGAN: He's a very reliable guy and very intelligent, by the book, very disciplined.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, he's like a Top Gun pilot. He's leading the whole group, right?

JOE ROGAN: He's a commander. And when he describes it, it sounds very real. Whatever he's talking about, he experienced. I believe that. And there's also video of it. There's video of it flying. They have the radar data. They know that it went to their designated meetup point, the cap point. Which is really weird.

The Tic Tac Incident


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It is. And it indicates they knew the future or they were part of our military.

JOE ROGAN: Right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I kind of wonder if the Tic Tac, because it is somewhat anomalous in the context of a lot of things in the UFO lore as far as spinning discs or big triangular craft. This one kind of seems like one of ours.

Military Training Zones and UAP Encounters


JOE ROGAN: Well, it is odd that these things happen where there's a lot of military training exercises. Like this one was off the coast of San Diego. It was off the Nimitz, you know, so they had the Nimitz, which was out there. Obviously you got a lot of military in San Diego.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: The Roosevelt too, I think, is where they were capturing the radar.

JOE ROGAN: And the ones that Ryan Grave experienced were all east coast. Again, it's all near military bases. It's all where they do military training exercises.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And why not figure out what you can do with people that you train with already anyway?

JOE ROGAN: Right. And why not see, like, what is detectable and what's not? You know, Ryan Graves talks about how in 2014, they upgraded all the sensors and the jets, and then all of a sudden they started picking these things up all over the place. He said they were encountering them virtually every time they went out, which is so weird.

Imagine you're encountering—was it a circle inside of a sphere or a sphere inside of a circle?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think it was a circle in a sphere. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Whatever it was.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Which one was it? It was a circle at a sphere.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I just saw a picture on Twitter recently. It was a little circle and then a cube or something. Very f*ing weird, whatever that is.

JOE ROGAN: It is able to hover motionless in like 200 knots of wind.

Reverse Engineering and Space‑Time Manipulation


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And it would make sense if we are reverse engineering these. They're going to look pretty primitive. It's basically a big propane tank that they're flying around. Like, they probably started simple. It's probably unmanned. But they're testing that capability to manipulate the space‑time to shoot off, you know, because it dropped 80,000 feet. That's what supposedly looks like a cube. Oh, I had it backwards.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I can't remember.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Apparently my dyslexia extends to images too.

JOE ROGAN: Explained using UFO patents. Click on that. “Explained: a recent article about the Hill has highlighted the reports of a Cuban sphere UAP military pilots have been seeing as reported by Graves, where he once again highlights how often our pilots are seeing these things and why he doesn't believe they are conventional drones or balloons.”

And so this is obviously some sort of a computer‑generated rendition. Ah, the f*ing pop‑up.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, they didn't get a picture of it.

JOE ROGAN: But here's the patents. Scroll up a little bit. “So a month ago I did a deep dive on a post about UFO patents, how magneto‑hydrodynamic propulsion systems could explain some of the observations. Includes an expired patent for the 1960s and a few newer patents describing not only the propulsion, but how the plasma field can make the craft invisible to radar.” Huh.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. I mean again, it makes sense. Like if we have been reverse engineering these for 70 years, we would start bringing them out, they would look weird. They wouldn't necessarily look like the craft that we struggled to fly at Groom Lake that we could go up and down with. And that's about it.

Like they would look like this little thing that's simple. It's basically a propane tank or it's a cube within a sphere. I probably had that backwards again. And then experiment with it, see what you can do. And a lot of people make the argument, “Why would they do that? That's dangerous. You know, what if there was a midair collision?”

If they are actually manipulating space‑time in these things like they seemingly are with the saucer‑shaped craft, you don't have to worry about that. You know, this isn't a cat and mouse game where the cat and mouse are equal. Like you have complete control of space‑time in and around that area. You're not going to run into anybody. They're all moving extremely slowly relative to you.

According to Puthoff and Davis at the end of that document, and whoever reached out to me, whether it was Hal or not, somebody reached out to me and explained the same thing in 2019. And it makes a lot of sense. And to kind of extend it into my area of research: if you can manipulate space and time in and around this craft, what's keeping you from using that to travel through time?

Time Travel Models and Genetic Diversity


JOE ROGAN: I guess, I mean, but again that's with the different model, not the multi‑worlds model. But what was the other model that you described?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Block universe.

JOE ROGAN: Block universe theory.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Block universe theory, yeah.

JOE ROGAN: The idea that they would be so advanced that they could genetically engineer a body and get to whatever state they are at where they communicate telepathically. But yet they can't solve the problem of old DNA, like needing—what do they need? Genetic diversity? Like, what is it? What are they trying to get out of us? Are they trying to get the source material instead of the old stuff, or instead of the stuff that they've had forever?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: One of the arguments I made in my first and second books is that really, since European colonialism, starting about 500 years ago, we are all becoming one interbreeding population. So it used to be that you had different isolated populations, and then occasionally there would be gene flow that introduces new genes.

If we all are just one population on this inbred island of Earth, where are you going to get new gene variants? And then you combine that with the things we just talked about, with the potential for things to go wrong with trying to make designer babies, or the trends toward reduced fertility in men and women, and importantly, the potential that there could be some massive cataclysm that puts us into a huge bottleneck where there just is no genetic diversity at all.

Like, if you think about something that happened that wiped out a huge percentage of the population, and there are warnings about this over and over again with experiencers and contactees, they're like, “There's some cataclysmic thing coming.” If that were to happen, all of those problems we're already having, all of the trends that are already leading to us having problems with fertility in the future will be hugely exacerbated by a very limited gene pool.

JOE ROGAN: Well, we know that human beings have gotten down to a very small population in the past.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So we're already kind of limited in our diversity.

JOE ROGAN: What do you think of the theory that human beings have been genetically engineered?

Academic Freedom and Ancient Intervention


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Man, when I first started in all this, I wouldn't touch that one because I had to impose some restrictions on myself so I didn't seem like a crazy person.

JOE ROGAN: And keep your academic standing.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I don't really care anymore, to be honest.

JOE ROGAN: Well, you sold a few books.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I sold some books. I mean, that's the thing is, like, I do have the respect of my peers, you know, and it's not a career killer anymore.

JOE ROGAN: No, exactly. You know, I mean, back in 2018, I was kind of rolling the dice. I was really nervous about it. I went to the chair of my department and was like, “Hey, just so you know, in case there's any pushback, publishing this book about whether, you know, UFOs are future humans.”

And he looked at me and cocked his head, and it's like, “That's our job. That's what we're supposed to be doing. Asking questions like that.” Like, he was all pissed off. Like, why are you even asking me this or telling me this?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, that's a cool guy.

JOE ROGAN: I was like, “Sweet. All right, well, check. I got one. I got one on board, at least.” But I was really conservative in this approach. Like the dean, actually, of my college, who gave me an award for scholarship and research—and there's a lot of amazing researchers at Montana Technological University. Like, we're very well known for research and scholarship.

She gave me an award in 2022 for research and scholarship. And all I was doing at that point was UFO stuff. You know, that was kind of a nod too. But she was telling me the other day in a meeting—the chair of the department, unfortunately—and she was like, “Oh, your dissertation book.” Because I did kind of write my first book as a dissertation. It's very scientific, it's very dense, it's very technical.

But I needed to do that because of the stigma and because of the shame. And you're right, it is changing, which is great. But there are certain things that we still can't—that are hard for me to talk about because it starts to get into ancient aliens territory, and that's one of them. Are they manipulating us genetically? Have been for a long time? I don't know. I used to say I don't know, so I didn't have to talk about it. Now I say I don't know because I genuinely don't know. Maybe.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, how could you?

JOE ROGAN: How could I? Yeah, good point.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. I mean, it's all theoretical, but there seems to be a trend in at least the encounter reports, when people have reported some sort of communication with these things. There's a lot of talk of genetic manipulation. There's a lot of talk of it's—

JOE ROGAN: The most common trope thing.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: But it also makes sense when you look at how different we are than any other animal that exists or has existed.

JOE ROGAN: True.

Human Uniqueness and Genetic Homogeneity


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: We're so advanced and so weird, and we vary so much, like, biologically and structurally. I mean, there's animals, like, there's different kinds of wolves, right? There's gray wolves and red wolves, and they vary. And, you know, red wolves and gray wolves, they can't even interbreed and create viable offspring in terms of their ability. Like, they would be hybrids if they did breed where they wouldn't. But they don't. They don't breed with red wolves and coyotes, which is also a type of wolf. But that's kind of where it ends.

Whereas humans are f*ing weird. At least coyotes all look like coyotes. Wolves all kind of look like wolves. Like with humans, you get seven‑foot‑tall people and five‑foot‑tall people and round people and thin people.

JOE ROGAN: We're actually all very similar genetically. There's a study done in the 70s looking at polymorphisms, and they found that between what used to be thought they were races, like Africans, Asians and Europeans—that was it. They didn't consider Native Americans or Australians or anybody—but they did this study on polymorphisms, found that only about 6 to 7% of all of our genetic differences can be accounted for by those between‑group differences.

And they did the same thing with Y chromosomes. They did the same thing with craniofacial anatomy and found that we're all very similar. So despite those differences in height, weight, skin color, hair color, eye color, we're very, very similar. Which could again lead to problems related to genetic homogenization, limited gene pool in the future, needing to go back and sample gametes from the past.

Another argument I hear people make related to what you're saying, like an argument for potential genetic manipulation of the human species over time, is that it all happened really fast. We see this acceleration in our rate of change, the rate of our technological development. Those things might indicate that there's some sort of seeding in the past with not just technology, but the genetics that allow us to expand our minds and develop these things.

Ancient Texts and Religious Origins


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, then there's the weird stories from ancient scripts, ancient texts, like the Book of Enoch. Like, what? What is that all about? Like, that's some weird stuff where it talks about the watchers coming down from the sky and mating with humans and creating the Nephilim who destroy everything.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I might get some shit for this, but I would be willing to bet that all major religions and the little ones have some sort of UFO alien component to the myth and legend that gave rise to them over time.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It makes sense.

The Extratempestrial Hypothesis in Fiction


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It does, actually. The third book I wrote, Revelation, flips the whole script on Revelation and it interjects time travelers. It interjects this whole—for a while there was this question of whether there was a fight over the timeline, whether the Grays were coming back because some cataclysm needed to happen. And we all went underground. And that's why we have big eyes and pale skin, because we had to evolve underground for a while and then another group, like, trying to keep that from happening.

So the book kind of explores that in a fictional capacity. And I wrote it because my friends weren't reading my science books because they're dense and scientific. And I was like, man, you know, what if I wrote a book that's just like a crass sex drug fueled exploration of like this time travel idea. And that's where that book came from.

It still ties in all of these same concepts scientifically, but in the story, like the main character is an intertemporal sex researcher. She goes back in time and just everybody. To learn what. To learn what sex. That's the book I gave you when I got here, actually. It's a weird one that's right here. Yeah, it's a weird one. But it was super fun to write, you know, and they're like—and then her—the professor in this book, he's like the, the—he's an intertemporal drug kingpin of sorts of.

But it's like it's exploring these same ideas in a different way. You know, with fiction, it's satire, it's comedy. The word most commonly used is it's hilarious. It's a comedy book, you know, because I wanted people that don't read the science books to still be introduced to this concept and the science behind it in a different way. And, man, it was so much more fun to write than those science books.

Breakaway Civilizations and the Cryptoterrestrial Hypothesis


JOE ROGAN: What do you think of when people start theorizing about some sort of a breakaway civilization that lives under the ocean?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, so we actually published a paper about that last June about the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis. You mentioned it on your show in a really funny way because it went viral internationally. It was absolutely insane, the impact this thing had. Like, I had to go on Fox and Friends one morning to talk about it, and then the next day.

JOE ROGAN: What made it go viral? What was the—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, because I published it with two guys from Harvard. I was a co-author on the paper. And so it's clickbait, it's “Harvard researchers say dinosaurs are aliens and they live among you.” So stuff like that. And it worked because—

JOE ROGAN: It makes you go, what?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yours was the funniest one. You guys pulled it up on your screen and you're like, “Man, these Harvard researchers must snuck in where they're doing the psilocybin experiments and ate all the mushrooms.” That cracked me up. And I don't think we did. I don't remember if we did. I don't think we did. But it definitely had elements of like, these guys ate a lot of mushrooms, which was part of why it went viral.

But there were some really solid arguments in there. And the title of the paper was “Scientific Openness to the Cryptoterrestrial Idea.” That's all we're advocating for. And we listed four main ways in which this cryptoterrestrial idea could happen. And the fourth one is what really got clickbaity. Because we were like, maybe there is a breakaway civilization that's the cryptoterrestrial idea, but maybe an advanced reptile, dinosaurs didn't go extinct. And this was, you know, we don't think this actually happened, but we're just putting out arguments for what this idea could be.

And so, yeah, they took that and put like dinosaurs at keyboards and stuff like that, but—but one of them is time travelers. And it would make sense if you were in the future instead of jumping back through time in order to study people in a specific time, you set up a base on the far side of the moon. Or up until the 60s, 70s, we wouldn't know they were there. Set up a base under the oceans. And this would go for the extraterrestrial idea too. Instead of traversing the vast swaths of space, come here, set up under the oceans where we're not going to find you. Antarctica, far side of the moon. And then you can do everything here locally instead of having to jump across space—extraterrestrial—or jump across time—extratempestrial.

Underwater UAP Phenomena


JOE ROGAN: Well, it also explains some of the very strange ways that they've observed crafts moving under the water. Like they've observed crafts moving under the water at 500 knots that are as big as a football field. And apparently there's video of these things. Apparently there's, you know, the Navy has something that they filmed that is as big as a football field that was going essentially 500 miles an hour underwater without any ripples, not disturbing the water at all, not creating a wake, and—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And then moving right out of them. The transmedium capacity.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, you know, when you think about how little exploration we've done to the bottom of the ocean, it's—we know more about the moon than we do about the surface of the actual bottom of the ocean.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, yeah. It would be a great place to hide out. And again, you know, the ability to move in and out of air, water, space, upper atmosphere with no disturbances. The transmedium capabilities, that whole warped space-time bubble around them would help explain that too, that they're not experiencing the water, they're not experiencing the air as they move between them.

Like I always think about—I really love skiing and one of my favorite times to ski is late season. You know, it's April, the sun's out, everybody's in t-shirts or bikinis or whatever. I don't wear bikinis, but people do. And you get into that slushy stuff, you're cruising down the mountain, you hit the slush and you just go ass over kettle, you know, over the top of your skis and—and that's what you know, we would expect if they're moving in and out of air and water and space, is that there would be some resistance.

There's not, you know, they don't have that. And it does indicate that there is some sort of manipulation of space and time around them and—yeah, moving underwater, these football field sized craft going that fast. I mean, how can you do that if there is actual resistance from the water?

Government Knowledge and Disclosure


JOE ROGAN: Well, it just makes you wonder how much does the government know? You know, you've seen that guy Tim Burchett talk about it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: He's hilarious.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it was very funny. I mean he was just casually mentioning that there's five different locations in the ocean of the world and the seas of the world where they've observed crafts coming out of. That's a very weird thing to just say while you're walking. Just casually talk about it and with such confidence.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, yeah. I mean they're doing these SCIFs, they're talking to people behind closed doors. They don't have the same requirement to not disclose things as those people do. You know, they didn't sign NDAs. And he has a hilarious way of talking about it. He's got the best one-liners of anybody discussing this stuff.

I mean somebody knows, somebody knows a lot of things. A lot of people probably know a lot of things and have for a very long time. But you know, what is that relationship? What do they control? Why are we not allowed to know?

The Baltic Sea Anomaly


JOE ROGAN: Well, this is the real question, like what do they actually know about what's going on in the ocean? Like if there are bases somewhere down in the ocean, there's that weird one, the Baltic Sea anomaly. I don't know what that one—Jesse Michaels just did a show about it where he interviewed the guy who found it. I think they're treasure divers and they found this very strange thing that is sitting on the floor of the ocean. And it has right angles to it and it's kind of curved. There's an actual, I don't know what kind of an image is of it, but they have explored this thing and he's convinced that it's not a natural formation.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, interesting.

JOE ROGAN: See if you can find something on the Baltic Sea. Put that into our sponsor formation.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's like, that's like a base.

JOE ROGAN: It looks like a f*ing Millennium Falcon. What's wrong with my mouth today? I can't say Millennium Falcon. Like that's what it looks like.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's interesting.

JOE ROGAN: So, you know, look, this could be something that's sitting on or it could be something that was built at a time where this was not covered by ocean. Like you live in Montana. Montana used to be the great inland sea. Right. You could find seashells in Montana, which is really weird.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And even all along the coast of Alaska, like there was about 110 foot rise in sea level over the last 12,000 years.

JOE ROGAN: So what, more images of this thing? Like what, what is that?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: And these are all artistic renditions. Some of them are. But the other one, that blue one that you see there, that's the real thing. That's what it actually looks like.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. It's pretty anomalous, right?

JOE ROGAN: What is that though? Is that an ancient structure that people built, you know, 20,000 years ago? Like, what is it? “Baltic Sea anomaly is a sonar-detected seafloor formation in the northern Baltic sea found in 2011 by Swedish OceanX, formerly Ocean Explorer Team, during a treasure hunting expedition. Most geologists who have examined the available data consider it a natural rock formation shaped by glacial processes, despite ongoing popular speculation about UFOs or artificial origin.”

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, it's tough, man.

The Catalina Island Formation


JOE ROGAN: There's that thing off the coast of Malibu too. Is it Malibu or is it Catalina Island? Was that one thing where it was in Google Earth and then they blurred it out after a while?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think that was just a Google Earth thing. Maybe, maybe not, but—

JOE ROGAN: But it was on Google Earth and then it now blurred.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I read work where they're getting the data from Google Earth, you know, like where that—what is that data? You know?

JOE ROGAN: Oh, so—so it was like bad data?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think so.

JOE ROGAN: And then it cleared up. Okay.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Also that's a good answer.

JOE ROGAN: I did a good answer for the government.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I did a talk in Manhattan last year and Tim Gallaudet was one of the speakers and he was showing images of—I think what you're talking about, where there was like this sort of almost like a cliff water and then had some strange things around it. It had been modified or—I don't remember exactly what he was saying, but I think that—I think that's what you're talking about. That was just off of Catalina Island.

JOE ROGAN: That's right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: It was very weird looking. A lot of people were speculating. One of the reasons why it's very weird. There's a lot of sightings off of Catalina Island. There's a lot of sightings out there.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And it, you know, again, it makes sense if they were trying to covertly study us. Regardless of their origins. Ultraterrestrial, extraterrestrial. Whatever. Use the oceans.

JOE ROGAN: Perfect, perfect base. It's very difficult, especially if you can—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Move in and out of there with impunity. Not just because we won't see them, but they have the technology to make the water and the air the same thing.

JOE ROGAN: Click on that image where the cursor is at.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: So that's it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's it.

JOE ROGAN: Whatever that is. Like, that looks real weird.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It does look weird.

JOE ROGAN: That looks real weird, whatever the hell that is. That's so strange. That's so strange looking. But again, that's like—is that what it really looks like? What are the new images? Is the new one on the right? Okay, that's it right there. Like, what the hell is that? It's got pillars. I mean, that's very strange. It has those sort of uniform shaped pillars.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And the top looks very flat, structural, like something you would make to withstand the weight of the water above you.

JOE ROGAN: Like a garage door? Yeah, like it's a garage door to a base. Yep.

Opening Minds to the Impossible


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: No, I mean, again, when I started out in this, I was relatively conservative with my views on things, but, man, the further you go down this rabbit hole, just the weirder s* gets. And you can't do that anymore. You've got to recognize that there's a lot of things that just—you can't write off, you know, the impossible become possible. Or at least you have to open your mind to the fact that these things you used to think were impossible need a second look, right?

Black Operations and Secret Technology


JOE ROGAN: And then there's also the people that work in military intelligence that work with these defense contractors that say there's black operations, like operations that are completely top secret, that are 30 years ahead of anything that you can imagine right now. So you go, okay, well, what does that look like? What does 30 years ahead of us now look like?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, like that was SR-71, the Blackbird, or whatever it is. Black whatever. Yeah. Like, we didn't even know about that until 20 years after they had made it.

JOE ROGAN: Right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And it makes sense, you know, you don't want your enemies to know. And that's an argument that's been made over and over, that we can't disclose things because then our enemies will have this technology.

And I always thought growing up that, you know, it'll take a war before they're like, “Oh, we need to use these things we've been developing. Like, we're getting our a kicked in this war. It's time to bring out the UFOs and our laser weapons and stuff.”

But I kind of think it's going to happen before that. It's weird to say, but I kind of get the sense that it is happening. There's been a lot of false horizons. People have been saying that for a long time, but that doesn't feel different. I mean, it definitely does feel different.

JOE ROGAN: It definitely feels that the general public is a lot more open to the concept without being thought of as a fool.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Right.

The Changing Stigma Around UFOs


JOE ROGAN: It used to be when I was a kid, if you'd bring up UFOs, people just roll their eyes. Especially before the Internet. Oh, my God, if you brought up any of that stuff, they would laugh at you.

I was reading some book on Roswell once, like, I think it was in the 1990s, and, you know, this guy's like, “What the f* are you wasting your time on this complete horseshit for? There's no such thing as UFOs.”

I'm like, how do you say that with such confidence? Like, we live in a galaxy with hundreds of billions of stars just in this galaxy with hundreds of billions of stars in other galaxies, and there's hundreds of billions of other galaxies. Like, what are you saying? It's crazy to say that we are the only ones. It is.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They did a really good job at making us feel like idiots.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, you can see how that can be done, you know. I mean, look what they did during the COVID crisis. You know, “If you don't get a vaccine, make your end of life preparations now,” you know, like, “You're going to be killing everybody. No one's going to survive. This disease targets the unvaccinated.” And people believed all that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, I think the two are related too, because we started to figure out that we've been lied to about UFOs. And the obvious question is, what else? What else were they lying to us about?

JOE ROGAN: Yes. Well, I think once we realize how strong the propaganda machine is and how gullible people are.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, yeah, that's the big one. Easily.

JOE ROGAN: I mean, if people were going to accept something as 100% true without any investigation or any skepticism from the pharmaceutical drug industry, they are the most evil motherf*ers that have ever lived.

They are responsible for more death from releasing drugs that have horrible adverse side effects that they knew about. They have taken the largest criminal fines of any companies. I mean, what they've done is really f*ing creepy.

When you look at how they release drugs that they knew were going to f* people over and they knew those people didn't need those drugs. And yet when you put people in a scary situation and you make them terrified and you offer up a solution, they believe wholeheartedly that the pharmaceutical drug companies were only telling the truth. And anybody who didn't believe is they—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Have your best interests in mind.

JOE ROGAN: So it's like that sheep mentality is so strong with so many people. There's so many cowards in the world and so many followers that would just step in line. The moment things get weird, whenever they get challenged, the moment things get weird, that it just makes sense that if you make it, like, socially, you become a social pariah.

If you start talking about UFOs. Here's Mike with f*ing wacky UFO theories. Like, people don't talk about those things. They don't want to bring them up.

Creating Safe Spaces for UFO Discussion


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And the military industrial complex is kind of the equivalent of the pharmaceutical companies on the other side of this coin. Sure, we, you know, we trust them, they defend us. Whatever they are making, I'm sure they'll use for great purposes.

But yeah, I mean, a big part of that was making us feel like idiots for talking about this stuff. And that is changing, though. And it's not largely because of, you know, Ancient Aliens. I've been on the show five times. I had a little bit of cognitive dissonance the first time I went on that show.

JOE ROGAN: They go way out.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They get out there, man, and they totally—

JOE ROGAN: Just fun.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It is fun, you know, and that's how I approached it. Well, I also approached it because I was trying to talk about this theory. They did this funny bait and switch for the first three episodes I was on where they're like, “Hey, come down, talk about your theory.”

I'm like, “Oh, okay,” so I'll go to LA or wherever and we do the shoot. They cut out everything about my books and this theory and just used me to talk about whatever the show was actually about.

JOE ROGAN: Little small snippets.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I caught onto that. And so the fourth time I went, I was like, “All right, but I'm only doing if you guys actually,” you know, in the—one of the episodes was about this whole theory anyway, so it made sense.

But I forget what we're talking about. Oh, the stigma. So one of the cool things that's been happening largely because of Ancient Aliens, your show, you know, you talk about this a lot and it helps normalize it for a lot of people. Is that there's a safe space now, you know, like, where you'll be talking about these things, and somebody will come up who had a sighting when they were, you know, a teenager in their 40s or whatever, and they never told anybody.

And now it's like, “Wait, it's safe to talk about this?” And that's so cool to see, man. And then it makes me realize just how many people have had an experience. It's been bottled up inside. It's liberating to let that come out. And we're sharing information and contactees, too.

You know, unfortunately, I started saying earlier, we're still kind of stuck on—this is changing too. But we're still largely stuck on the cockpit and the FLIR and the gimbal and the go fast. But people have been taken into these craft. They've had stuff put on their junk and their semen taken. Like, there's a lot of—no, no square touching that happens. Anal probes, you know, and we used to laugh at that.

But that is such a common theme throughout these. And we need to recognize that these people are having real experiences and have been having them for a very long time. Let's move on. Let's talk to these people. Let's let the contactees and experiencers who have had the closest form of a close encounter you can have, let's trust them now. Let's listen to what they have to say. Let's be discerning, you know, but let's keep an open mind.

Historical UFO Encounters and Ancient Texts


JOE ROGAN: Well, I think one of the more interesting things when you start talking about stories and encounters, one of the more interesting things is some of the research that Jacques Vallée has done where he brings up stories that absolutely predate the modern cultural visions of UFOs.

Like the modern cultural concept of the Close Encounters of the Third Kind type grays that come down in a flying saucer. All those things like flying saucer didn't even come out until the Kenneth Arnold experiences.

So these encounters, people are talking about from the 1700s and the 1800s, and they're talking about something coming down and something interacting with people and, you know, them having some sort of experience of lost time. The thread is very common. The Betty and Barney Hill story.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yep. Yeah. It's not just the gamete extractions. I mean, you could make the argument that a lot of things that happened in very mainstream religious texts were exactly what people are describing.

Even the CIA admitted that, like, unexplainable pregnancies are an aspect of the phenomenon. You know, where Jesus come from kind of an unexplainable pregnancy. I think Jesus was time traveler, personally.

JOE ROGAN: A time traveler?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. That's another aspect of that book that's in your satire. It's in my satire book, yeah. I think—

JOE ROGAN: Oh, you literally have Jesus coming out of the UFO.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I got some shit for that. With the double bird.

JOE ROGAN: He's throwing up the double birds. It turns out Christians don't like that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, you know, can't please everybody, right?

JOE ROGAN: No, you can't.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: But there are many aspects of Jesus's life—big fan of Jesus, by the way—that are very paranormal. A lot of these seemingly miraculous things, I think, can be explained with a lot of the same technologies that we see today. We just didn't have a way of conceptualizing them.

Obviously, Ezekiel is the one that gets talked about a lot. The wheel within a wheel, the telepathy, the embers, burning embers.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And then you look at the Nephilim, like, and all kinds of different—Mbaba Mwana Waresa. This story from Zulu lore, it's a f*ing alien abduction, man. And they've been telling this story for—

JOE ROGAN: How's this?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Thousands of years. So it's this woman, the sky goddess, who chooses a man to mate with and comes down, tests him to make sure that he knows that it's her, appears in his dreams, communicates telepathically, gets him ready for this interaction. He's in love with her, never met her before.

She comes down from the sky and takes him up with her on this rainbow of light. Whoa. Like, all of the—and I made the case in my second book that if Antonio Villas Boas had been able to go back with the woman that he had sex with, it's basically the same story.

So this Brazilian lawyer is telling a story that's identical to the Zulu legend that's been told for centuries, millennia. I don't know how far it goes back. How weird. But we need to look outside of just the mainstream view, which is finally happening. So I'm excited about that. I'm very grateful. I have a lot of gratitude about what's happening. We can go farther.

The Propaganda Machine and Media Control


JOE ROGAN: Why did the mainstream view become what it is? And we know that that is because of a concerted, concentrated propaganda effort.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Yeah. And a very effective one. I mean, they nailed it.

JOE ROGAN: There was no other media back then. They had complete control of newspapers, complete control of television stations. I mean, how many people, how much do we know now about various news anchors that were actually CIA agents? There's a f*ing shit ton of them.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And even if they weren't, they were being force fed this stuff that they were happy to regurgitate. Absolutely.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. They just wanted to look good and have a suit and speak like an expert. Here we go.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And if you don't toe the line, somebody else will.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. And you're living a great life. You drive a Mercedes, nice house. Why would you f* this up over a UFO story? Just tell your friends.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Just tell—

JOE ROGAN: Keep it to yourself.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: You're supposed to tell them.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. It's easy to get people to comply like that, especially when they're dependent upon, you know, whether it's a corporate entity like CNN or whether it's New York Times or whatever it is, it's not hard to get people to comply.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: No. And you're right, since the Internet, things have changed radically.

JOE ROGAN: Really? Radically.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Radically. But I think there's a downside too, where we've already kind of been moving toward a post truth existence. Good Lord, man. Like, I'll scroll through videos on Twitter now. 90% of them are fake.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, there's so much AI now.

AI, Propaganda, and the Erosion of Truth


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So ridiculous, so crazy. I make the unfortunate decision to go into the comments to see what percentage of people think it's real. 80, 90. I would say at least 90.

Like I just—I have it, still have it on my phone. It's a stupid fing video of a rabbit, like, nursing. That's little rabbit babies. And one of them is a cat. So the mom cat comes in, picks the fing baby cat up by the nose like they're magnetically attached. It doesn't even grab it. Like they just—the baby kind of comes with it and then walks out the back of the burrow. Like, there's no back to a rabbit burrow, you know, and everybody's like, “Oh, whoops, that cat made a mistake. It's drinking from the wrong species.”

People don't see it. They don't see that this is very obviously fake. And it's not just for that. Like they're using it for propaganda. They're using it for the same type of thing that they've used forever. “Oh, well, this UFO phenomenon is not real because AI made this video.”

JOE ROGAN: Well, there's also the problem with what percentage of people that are even commenting are actual people.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Exactly.

JOE ROGAN: There's a huge amount of bots that are communicating on all the social media platforms. A giant percentage of the comments are not real people.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's a really good point. Yeah, no, you're right.

JOE ROGAN: So they would comment on anything and—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Just say—but that also still feeds the perception that it's real.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Because other people that maybe don't have great critical thinking skills or discernment because, you know, their 90-year-old grandma that doesn't know how to use a computer, she sees that. “Oh, it's cute.”

JOE ROGAN: I think it erodes the consensus intelligence.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Like the overall level of intelligent discourse that a society puts out. You know, if you have a town square which is like Twitter is our town square, right? If that town square is populated by fake people, like enormous percentage populated by fake people that are just designed to say the most inflammatory, ridiculous things to get interaction and engagement and also to erode people's faith in other people and to make us argue with each other.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: To construct the other. Like you were saying at the beginning of this conversation, it fuels tribalism. Yeah, it's really problematic.

Digital ID and the Whistleblower Dilemma


JOE ROGAN: My hope is that eventually there'll be some way to accurately discern and it'll stop that stuff from happening. You know, that you'll be able to tell like very clearly whether or not it's an actual person.

The problem is that if that does happen, it's a gateway to digital ID, because you would have to lose your anonymity. Because if you're like—anonymity is very important for whistleblowers. Like say if you work for a corporation, you find out that corporation is dumping stuff into a river and it's all secret and it's illegal and you know that if you tell they're going to kill you and you're an executive at that corporation, your conscience is troubled.

You can make fake account, you could sign up through a VPN, you can make a fake account and you could post all this information that you know and you could break a story and you don't face any consequences. You don't get killed.

If you have digital ID, if we know who everybody is that's posting something and you make that same post, who knows what they do to you? Who knows what happens?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And it's been happening. There's been whistleblowers who have had mysterious deaths all over the place for a long time.

JOE ROGAN: All over the place.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, it's Gary Webb.

JOE ROGAN: Didn't he shoot himself in the head twice? Was that the story?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: What's the one Tim Burchett always says—get shot or you shoot yourself in the back of the head four times or something?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I mean, I think it's in reference to that. How did Gary Webb die? Yeah, there's—but even if that's not true, there's a bunch of stories about whistleblowers who go missing. If you're inconvenient, you're going to cost them billions of dollars and they can just get rid of you. They just get rid of you, whoever they are.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. It all comes down to money, and it has for a very long time. Deciding if this was accurate—they found in a case where someone shot themselves in the head eight times. Oh, that's a lot. There's a couple cases where it's not.

JOE ROGAN: Boy, that's a commitment.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, I guess if it was like an airsoft gun or something.

JOE ROGAN: I don't think that kills.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: A really inefficient way to kill yourself.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, the whole thing's crazy.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Do you think it's even possible? Soft gun, maybe like a lobotomy kind of—if you shot yourself up the nose eight times.

JOE ROGAN: Not that fast.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's not, is it?

JOE ROGAN: I mean, it might.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: The brand new CO2 cartridge. Oh, that's—see, so you could, I guess if—

JOE ROGAN: You got enough airsoft bullets in you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Just fills up your entire nasal—and you never went to the doctor.

JOE ROGAN: Or you eventually get an infection.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think somebody might intervene at that point.

JOE ROGAN: When I was living in LA, when I first moved there, a guy had killed himself accidentally on a set because he took a gun that was a blank gun, and he shot himself in the head, like trying to be funny. And it killed him because the force that comes out of the gun is still extremely powerful. And he put it to his temple and he literally caved his skull in.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That sucks.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's rough.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. It was just an actor who just didn't know any better and he thought he was just going to be funny. Yeah. So shooting yourself in the head twice, highly unlikely.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Eight times.

JOE ROGAN: But I guess you could shoot yourself in the head once and just really f* it up. But be aware that you're still alive and be committed to doing it. And then shoot yourself a second time. I guess it's possible.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, unless the pain response was like, yeah, it didn't feel good. I don't want to do that again.

JOE ROGAN: Or maybe the pain response is so bad you want to do it again just to pain.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, that's the point. Yeah, like, “Whoops, let's get this over with.”

Conspiracy Theories and Information Control


JOE ROGAN: I don't know. But our point, what we're getting at is that for the longest time, there was no real outlet to get true information out other than books. And books are so easily maligned. You know, if someone has a kooky book you read it and go, “Oh, that guy's nuts. That is a conspiracy theory.”

And then, of course, that term's popularized during the JFK assassination, because that very reason—there was a lot of people that doubted the official story. And those people became conspiracy theorists.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Have you looked into that much? Oh, yeah, I kind of thought you had. Who do you think did it?

JOE ROGAN: I think there was a lot of people. I think here's a mistake that people make. They say, “Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone” or “Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved and he was a patsy.” Lee Harvey Oswald shot a cop. They're really—there's, like, very few people that disagree on that. I think it's Officer Tippit. I think that was his name when he was on the run.

So Lee Harvey Oswald absolutely seems to be some sort of intelligence asset in some way or another. Married a Russian woman, lived in Russia for a while, came back to the United States during the time of the whole—I mean, this is right after the Red Scare. The fact that this guy went to Russia, married a Russian woman, came back, and the whole thing's screwy.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: He could have been a patsy and involved too, right?

JOE ROGAN: Yes, absolutely.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Heard some theory once about, like, the driver turn around, or was there something about, like, a poisonous fish? Horseshit, that's all.

JOE ROGAN: Horseshit.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's why I was asking, because I don't know.

JOE ROGAN: Well, there's a lot of those. One of the best ways to make a conspiracy theory seem absolutely ridiculous is to add a bunch of really silly ones into the mix. And so that any conspiracy theory involving something—that's not the official narrative.

But there's just so many aspects of the Kennedy assassination. The back and to the left, the headshot, the shot in the neck from the front. The magic bullet, which is preposterous, is the most preposterous. There's a lot of them. There's a lot of these weird aspects to it.

And there's also the fact that Kennedy was very hated. Also the fact that, you know, it's in Dealey Plaza, which is like, why would you ever drive someone through there in a convertible? That's the president.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's a very—

JOE ROGAN: You know, any president is—you know, we think of JFK was the most loved president, right? By half the country. That's how it always is, folks. There's always half the country that thinks you suck and half the country that loves you. That's how it was with Clinton. That's how it was with Obama. So it is with everybody.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. No, we don't tend to agree on those things as an entire human population.

The Warren Commission and JFK's Death


JOE ROGAN: No, there was a lot of people that were very happy when he died, including Dulles. So Dulles was fired by JFK and then was on the Warren Commission investigating JFK's assassination, which is hilarious. It's kind of crazy. Richard Nixon, also in the Warren Commission.

The Warren Commission—there's a great book on it called Best Evidence by David Lifton. And he was an accountant that was hired to do something with the Warren Commission. Something. Some aspect of the Warren Commission. So he decides to read the whole thing. It was a huge amount of pages. I forget how many pages are in the Warren Commission Report. I think it's at least 900 pages.

So he reads the whole thing, and after it, he comes to this conclusion. Like, there's so many inconsistencies. There's so many contradictions. There's like this—this doesn't make any sense. Like they were trying to reach a conclusion.

So many of the witnesses that saw the assassination died in very weird deaths. The statistical possibility or probability of all those people dying from murder, suicide, car accidents, you know, it's just too weird. It's too weird.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: What about the UFO connection? Like, that's the one I hear. I don't know, like, CIA ties and I don't know. I don't know what's bullshit and what's not. You know, like, yeah, there was clearly, like, we had the technology for 20 years at that point. But what does a president even know?

JOE ROGAN: I don't know what they know. I don't know whether or not they would kill him for that. That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense. You know the Nixon story with Jackie Gleason?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Huh? No, I don't think so.

The Jackie Gleason UFO Story


JOE ROGAN: You don't know that story? The story is that Jackie Gleason and Nixon were drinking one day and, you know, they were friends and Nixon was like, “Want to see a f*ing UFO?” They get in a plane and he took them to—was it Wright-Patterson? Jamie, do you remember?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think it was somewhere in Florida, but I don't—they—I remember when we looked this up, they said, there's—he went somewhere. I'll look it up.

JOE ROGAN: So anyway, supposedly sees this recovered craft and bodies that are in freezers. So Jackie Gleason, one thing's true about this—he became obsessed with UFOs. That is true.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And it'd be hard not to after something like that.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, there's definitely a catalyst. Imagine. I mean, f*ing dude, right now—someone took me. If Trump called me up, “Want to see some shit,” and all of a sudden I'm standing in front of some craft that's made of this unknown alloy. And especially some of the weirder stories where you have a craft that's like 40 feet wide. You go inside of it, it's bigger—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Than a football field. That's wild.

The Jackie Gleason UFO Story


JOE ROGAN: So here it is. Nixon arranged for him to visit Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. Upon his arrival, armed guards took Gleason to a building at a remote location on the site. There, Gleason, who harbored an intense interest in UFOs, saw the embalmed bodies of four alien beings, two feet long, with small bald heads and big ears.

He was told nothing about the circumstances of their recovery. He swore his wife to secrecy. But after the divorce, Beverly freely discussed the story. In the mid-80s, ufologist Larry Bryant sued the US government to get it to reveal its UFO secrets. He tried without success to subpoena Gleason.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Wow.

JOE ROGAN: I want to subpoena Gleason. Yo, that's crazy.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, he could just plead the fifth the whole time.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, yeah, I was drunk. I don't remember anything.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, exactly.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. I mean, how would you know? But Gleason built a house in upstate New York.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

JOE ROGAN: That looks like a UFO, right?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Isn't it for sale right now?

JOE ROGAN: It is right now. Yeah, we thought about buying it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I did. I looked that up one time. I don't remember why, but it's kind of cool.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's kind of cool, but the problem is if we bought it, everybody would know that that's ours.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, true.

JOE ROGAN: Like, oh, Joe Rogan's got the UFO house. And then they'd visit and—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: F* up my vacation.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's true. That's always bound to happen.

JOE ROGAN: I remember that's the house.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Very golden house.

JOE ROGAN: I mean, come on, man.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's pretty sweet. Something happened. He was—there was a catalyst involved in his interest.

JOE ROGAN: Well, I mean, if you're friends with Nixon and this is in the 1960s and all this stuff is—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. I saw an interview with Barry Goldwater.

JOE ROGAN: Where he was a f*ing dope house.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: By the way, talking about asking some commander general about what's at Wright-Patt. And I guess he cussed him out. Barry Goldwater, he was like, really? “Never f*ing ask me that again.” Yeah. Really? Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: He cussed out Barry Goldwater.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: He was. Yeah. I don't think he was ever president candidate. Right. But yeah, no, they—there's people that don't want us to know. The big thing going around now is that Dick Cheney was the ringleader of all of this. The deep state, the UFO secrets, the gatekeepers.

Wow. He had to know. Of course. That guy had to know. Kissinger too, probably. Like the legacy programs, these are legacy people.

The Problem of Secrecy and Money


JOE ROGAN: Well, someone has got to talk. Right? But it's like, but to what level? And the idea—here's the really erroneous idea that a lot of people hold. People can't keep a secret. Of course they can. Of course they can.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Especially when their life's being threatened.

JOE ROGAN: Of course they can. Especially if, I mean, there are certain programs that if you disclose the existence of this program, it is considered treason and they are allowed to execute you for that. So you have to take that into consideration.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I would keep a secret if that was the case.

JOE ROGAN: Of course, then you have to take into consideration the immense amount of money and this is discussed really very comprehensively in the Age of Disclosure documentary. I think they did a great job of highlighting the whole problem with the misappropriation of funds.

So someone had to lie to Congress. If they have these back engineering programs, if they've been spending as much as a trillion dollars over the course of X amount of years, where's that money and who lied and who benefited from it? What military contractors were allowed to have this stuff to back engineer it?

What process has taken place to shield the American public from that and what profits have they made from that? That made them much more anti-competition against other military contractors.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Which is another reason to keep a secret too. It's not just you might get killed, but there's a lot of profit potential in this and we don't want our—

JOE ROGAN: Competitors to also a lot of fraud.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I'm sure, like with any—

JOE ROGAN: No oversight at all. And a shitload of money.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Black money.

JOE ROGAN: Oh my God.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, it's—

JOE ROGAN: There's not a chance in hell that there wasn't some money that went into people's pockets.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Human nature takes over and people are like, well, I could just keep some of that. Yeah, nobody's watching the till.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I mean, look, we're finding that with things just like Black Lives Matter, it was massive fraud. Just like nonprofit organizations. Oh yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I don't want to start on NGOs or anything, but that's a big reason why I don't give money to—I'll find smaller organizations doing things on a local level, but yeah, local stuff you can trust. Yeah, absolutely. You get big enough. It's just—that happens.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And of course, if you're talking trillions of dollars, black money that nobody's tracing, and I mean, that was one of David Grusch's arguments too, is that these whistleblowers are exposing crimes, fraud, potential murder, that happen to keep these secrets.

So, yeah, it's a complex—it's a very nuanced situation that we will have to move past if we are going to have disclosure in some capacity, however that happens. I mean, amnesty has been talked about for some people.

The Case for Amnesty


JOE ROGAN: That was in the documentary that was the road out of this, which totally makes sense to me. Look, what is really important, the fraud has already taken place. If people are prosecuted for the fraud, guess what? If we don't release it, they'll never be prosecuted for the fraud anyway.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And what's the alternative? We wait until they die and then talk about it? I would rather give them amnesty now and then let them die without these secrets going to their deathbed with them.

JOE ROGAN: But just not only that, if they're misappropriating funds, they're not just doing it 30 years ago, they're doing it last week. So now the current people also have an incentive to not disclose unless you have mass amnesty to say, listen, let's just forget about all this stuff then.

The problem with that is all those people that are profiting off of it right now and also funneling money into whatever NGOs they have, and misappropriation of money and embezzlement.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: What do we do with that IP too? Like the intellectual property that, say Northrop Grumman or whoever has Boeing, like, do we share that now? Do they have to give that up and spread it across the industry?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's all weird, man. It's very weird because there's been a few inventions that came about after Roswell that a lot of people say, like, this does not make any sense.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Fiber optics is one, transistor is another one. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: There's a lot of weirdness. People say, oh, there's direct scientific research. It shows how they made it. Yeah. But there's not. If you go into it, it's like there's a giant leap that gets made. That's real weird.

Zero Point Energy and Its Implications


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, I'll take more leaps, man. Honestly, these craft are being powered by something that's very, very energized, and if we could use that to—I mean, I pay a lot in utilities bill. I was going to talk about climate change or something. And then I made it about myself and my utilities.

JOE ROGAN: You could have your own zero point energy generator in your backyard. Never have to worry about power again.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Never have to worry about as many Christmas lights as I want.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Never worry about the grid. The grid doesn't exist anymore.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Doesn't exist. I mean, imagine that from an infrastructure level and there's so many implications. And if it's real, if it's—

JOE ROGAN: You think it's real, right? You're convinced?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I'm convinced it is, yeah. I mean, it makes sense. There's so much energy trapped within the space between, that's what it is. Even at zero degrees.

JOE ROGAN: Try to explain, if you can try to explain the concept of zero point.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Energy, man, that's beyond my pay grade. Other than that, I know that it is infinitely times more energetic than what you get when you split an atom or fuse atoms together. The nuclear force.

My understanding, again, very limited knowledge is that even when you take a molecule, particle, whatever, and you freeze it down to zero degrees, there's still energy inside of that and there's energy at a sub-quantum level that if we could tap into that, it would provide infinite energy.

The downside is it would also make a bomb that is much, much more powerful than the biggest hydrogen bomb because you're releasing that energy in a way that's irresponsible. There's this quote going around by E. O. Wilson, famed biologist, I think I saw it on Twitter that was like, “We have prehistoric emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology,” basically saying, we're f*ed.

Yeah, because we've got—we're like little kids playing with chainsaws, but zero point—

JOE ROGAN: Little kids playing with guns.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Exactly. Zero point is kind of that next thing, like when Einstein, E equals MC squared, there's all this energy and mass and if we split these atoms, combine these atoms, we can release that energy. Sweet. But hundreds of thousands of people died in Japan.

So what's the flip side of zero point? It would definitely unlock a lot of potential. But are we responsible enough as a species to handle that type of energy?

JOE ROGAN: Right. Currently no.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: E. O. Wilson says no. And I'm on board with anything.

JOE ROGAN: Well, I'm on board with it. Just look at what's happening in Ukraine. Look at what's happening in Gaza. Look what's happening. There's full scale war. Scary s*. It's happening right now in various parts of the world where we're just—

Alien Intervention and Human Conflict


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, blowing people to smithereens. And you know what, that's kind of an interesting argument about the whole time travel thing. There's these genocides. There's genocide happening now in Gaza. Blows my mind that we can still have genocides and just not do anything about it.

But like Pol Pot, three, four million people killed. The Holocaust, Darfur, but these aliens don't seem to care about us. It was something that John Mack noticed. He wrote about it a lot. They're really focused on the Earth. They care about this planet. They don't necessarily care about us as individuals, as a species.

Well, clearly they care as a species, but they do kind of care as individuals. The people that get picked up are oftentimes, obviously there's cases where this doesn't happen, but they're cared for. They're told no harm will come to you. Barney Hill was told that. It's a commonly repeated thing.

So they take care of people. They give us screen memories to try to hide what they did. They sometimes give people tours of the ship. They seemingly care about us as individuals, but not when we start murdering each other on a massive scale. They've never intervened in these things.

However, they have demonstrated their ability and willingness to shut down nukes. They might intervene if we move to the point where we're not just destroying ourselves, but we're destroying the planet that they may also call home in the future, if they are future humans.

That whole “care for the planet, take care of the planet.” They told the kids in Zimbabwe. They told the kids in Wales during this other incident. They tell these contactees all the time, “Take care of the planet. Take care of the planet.” But they don't seem to care about us.

And it might actually benefit them if we don't screw up this planet, either through nuking ourselves or just all of the other things we do to it, because we're kind of parasitic in a way.

JOE ROGAN: Well, also, if they are us in the future, we probably have to go through all this to realize the folly of our ways.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's a good point. Dark night of the soul. Kind of.

The Evolution of Human Consciousness


JOE ROGAN: Yeah. I mean, clearly we're getting better. I mean, we're still horrible, but we're better today than we were during the Viking days. We're better today than we were during the time of Genghis Khan. We're better. We're more civilized, we're more peaceful. There's less war, even though there's still war.

So it's a slow, gradual shift of consciousness that probably is going to be accelerated by technology. Especially if there is some sort of a technology that connects us telepathically and allows people to read minds. One of the things that Elon famously said about his Neuralink, he's like, you're going to be able to talk without words.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. I had a whole section in my first book about that. The question of whether it's a technology mediated brain to brain communication or if there's something about our consciousness that allows us to communicate telepathically without some sort of technology.

And I kind of, I did that. My friend Jeff Craple pointed this out. He's like, I see why you did that. You know, you're like, well, what if it is technology? And there's a lot of studies that have shown we can communicate through some sort of computer medium.

But so many people in contactee cases who are spoken to or can speak to the visitors telepathically don't have that. There's also all of the research of Dean Radin at IONS and all of his other studies that he's put out that show people have telepathic ability with very, very strong P values, statistically showing that we have this ability.

I think a lot of people have it and just don't realize. But it does seem like we're moving in that direction. Like you were talking about the evolution of consciousness. It seems like we're sort of moving to that. Whether Neuralink has anything to do with it or any sort of computer mediated brain to brain transmission. I think we're just becoming telepathic and unlocking these abilities that have always sort of lied dormant within us.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. I've often asked the question, is it one of two things? Is this a new emerging aspect of human consciousness or is this an aspect of human consciousness that exists before verbal speech and then verbal speech and then of course the written word, video, all that stuff, it just became completely non useful to us.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's like we lost it and we're…

JOE ROGAN: Trying to get it atrophied. Yeah, yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, you had Kai Dickens on the telepathy tapes were hugely impactful.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And a lot of those episodes show that this is actually extremely common, you know, and it seems like that's kind of where we're going. I look at that as another indication that these are us in the future, that their main form of communication is telepathy and we're already seemingly moving in that direction.

The Tridactyl Mummies of Peru


JOE ROGAN: What do you make of the tridactyl mummies in Peru?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Can we pee first?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, okay, I'll do that right now.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Sweet.

JOE ROGAN: We'll be right back, folks. Go to Jay Anderson's X page. It's Project Unity.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I saw. He's coming on soon.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, he. So Jay Anderson just released this and Jesse Michaels actually went down to Peru and actually saw those things and handled them in person. And he said it was f*ing surreal. He said they are real creatures. Whatever they were, it is a real thing and they look exactly like an alien.

He has a video that he just released, Jamie. I think it's a video that he's releasing on. That's it right there. So scans reveal this ancient alien looking mummy has a baby inside of her. Well, that's one of them. So these things like whatever this is. Can we hit volume so you can hear what he's saying?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: She has slightly smaller stature and slighter build than Maria, but shares the same natural mummification with skin covering parts of the body. Her skull is elongated with large eye orbits and cranial volume comparable to Maria's.

Importantly, Montserrat CT scans reveal that she was carrying in her abdominal cavity. The team identified a developing fetal form being visible on the scans. A tiny tridactyl embryo with skeletal structure curled in a womb like space. This confirms that Montserrat was pregnant with at least one advanced fetus.

Montserrat also contains an astonishing array of metallic implants. At least 10 distinct metal implants embedded into her body. These include four small round implants in her skull, two on each side, several in her chest and thoracic area, and others along her arm and leg bones. As per the CT images, they're described as very dense and made of rare metals, osmium and gold.

Additionally, Montserrat's chest anatomy is peculiar. She has an expanded ribcage without a sternum like the other tridactyles and an interclavicle bone. An extra bone at the shoulder girdle noted by researchers. Her spine is continuous into the skull again demonstrating craniocervical canal.

JOE ROGAN: Look how crazy that is.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: One of the most deeply analyzed specimens. High resolution 128 slice CT scans were performed and a full 3D virtual autopsy was conducted. The scans confirmed Montserrat's pregnancy with tridactyl features.

JOE ROGAN: How strange is this? Like, what is that? And these are in Peru. The same place where you get the Nazca lines. The same place where you have Sacsayhuamán. You have these incredible structures that defy logic, defy conventional construction methods especially.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And like the owlman, you know, the big petroglyph on the side of the hill that could only be appreciated from space.

JOE ROGAN: There's a lot of weirdness. There's a lot of weirdness from Peru. Peru seems like a very extraordinary place. And at one point in time. Well, also the ancient artistic depictions of these exact beings. There's these ancient tapestries and ancient art pieces that show these three fingered, three toed beings. And this is all like a part of their folklore.

And then you have these actual creatures. Like that thing is 1,400 years old, I think it is. So if that's the carbon date on that mummy. So I think it's that old. There's one that's 1,200. I think the oldest one is like 1,400 sounds right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, something like that.

JOE ROGAN: But like whatever that is, like there's not a chance in f*ing hell that people back then had the ability to fake that and that with that depth, you see tendon structures, ligaments, you have a completely different skeletal structure. No sternum, different clavicle bones.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's cranial facial anatomy.

JOE ROGAN: Three fingers, three toes. Which is by the way, exactly what Lazar described, I believe as, or some people described as like the control. It might not be Lazar. The controls inside the crafts that they've observed that had these three fingered things. Varginha, Brazil. Those things had three fingers and three toes.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: So the question is like they saw footprints too in that case, didn't they?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, they supposedly one of the soldiers carried a hurt and injured. Whatever it is.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, there were three women that saw it too. Like an alley or something.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, that's the Moment of Contact documentary. Very good, very good. James Fox documentary It is.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I watched that with James Fox before we released it. We were at the same conference.

JOE ROGAN: Crazy documentary.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, it's really good.

JOE ROGAN: But those things look exactly like that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, way to describe. It'd be cool if they still had eyeballs because they said they had red eyes. Right? Which would be kind of crazy.

JOE ROGAN: Whatever these things are, they are the same size and in the same shape. And they're also. That thing, that tridactyl thing, what does it look like? It was exactly gray. It's small, it has a big head, it has big eyes. It's very thin, thin body. Like when you look at its body when it's curled up in the fetal position is no muscle, very small.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: There's definitely, I mean, there's variation within the way these things are described. Unfortunately, until we have like, you know, dude, got to go with Nixon to see these things. In liquid. That's like a wet dream of mine, man. I would love to go see these things and, like, study them. As a biological anthropologist, that would be the holy grail for me.

JOE ROGAN: Somewhere that you could go right now on Earth. If you knew the right guy, he'd let you see that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Absolutely, yeah. That's crazy. I'm sure there's many, many examples of these things. I would argue in multiple places that I'm not allowed to go see, and it makes me mad.

Analyzing the Evidence


JOE ROGAN: But what is your take when you see these things?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Right. So I've always been outwardly critical of them, except, I guess the question is, which ones? And what do we mean by real? Like, these are obviously real. These are things that aren't a fairy tale. I mean, they make their way into the lore. So we do have to take that in the same way that these, you know, ancient stories about things that are very similar to the UFO phenomena, but…

JOE ROGAN: This is an actual physical…

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. This doesn't make believe. This is a real, real thing. I have been highly critical of the little ones.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: There's adults. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: But when I first started talking about these, those were conventionally understood to be real, too.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, really?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I got a lot of s* for that. I actually retired from the mummy thing. I'm happy to come out of retirement for you, Joe, but I retired from the mummy thing because I was getting trolled so hard, so aggressively, I'm like, I'm out. I don't give a…

JOE ROGAN: By people that thought they were real. Yeah, but they look fake.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: The difference between those, we all say that now. We weren't saying that even three or four years ago.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, I definitely was.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, yeah, you look at them, it's very obvious. But a lot of people are like, no, no, these are so real.

JOE ROGAN: They still believe in Bigfoot.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And that's why I have to sort of approach this cautiously, because I. I will admit scientists don't do this enough. I will admit I haven't looked into those, so I don't want to form an opinion about them until it happens.

JOE ROGAN: Have.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I have extensively looked into the small ones. I forget what they're called. They have cute little names and they're little dolls. They're made out of animal bones, human bones, backward llama skulls. They're put together.

I've been looking at these long enough that I remember when they were held together by pieces of wire and metal. Like, they didn't even try to really hide that you X ray them like, oh, Jesus Christ, you know. But then we moved away from that to like, oh, they're using better materials to hide the fact that they're sticking these together as little dolls.

And now fortunately, we've at least moved past to the point where most people are just focusing on these big ones with the fingers and the toes and the elongated skulls. Again, I don't want to speak to those because I haven't looked into it enough. I don't have an informed opinion.

But the little dolls, one thing that concerns me, that I think is a red flag is that the little dolls that are now conventionally understood to be fake have the same diatomaceous earth characteristics as these. And there's also, I think if they really want to prove these are real, do more to highlight the provenience of them in archeology. The way that we understand the way things are related is by doing a massive, as I mentioned earlier, very boring survey of how things are located in three dimensional space and over time.

JOE ROGAN: I think there's a problem with that, is that some of these people have lied about where they got them because they're essentially grave…

The Nazca Mummies Controversy


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: They're grave robbing. Exactly. And that's a big problem and an ethical issue that needs to be addressed too. But as an example, the Rising Star cave, Homo naledi, they did, you know, Lee Berger, who's actually, I guess my academic brother because we had the same PhD advisor. He was at Ohio State when he was my advisor and he was at Johannesburg, University of Witzwatersrand in Johannesburg for him.

But this Rising Star cave, very meticulously hard to get to, you know, really hard. He had to lose like 50 pounds to even get down in here to see his own site. But they map it out, they study where everything is, where it comes from and they publicly release that information. Yeah, like this is extremely hard to get into, but we have a very deep knowledge of the provenance of all of the artifacts and the features and the remains at this site.

We're not getting that with these mummies. And that troubles me with the issue of the diatomaceous earth being painted on. And it kind of makes it seem like they did these slits in the eyes on purpose to the mummies. Yeah. Doesn't that seem like they kind of went like this with like a pen or something?

JOE ROGAN: Let me see it again. Can I see some images of them?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Tridactyls?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: The bigger.

JOE ROGAN: I never saw that. It didn't seem like that to me, it seemed like there's a little slit that's their eyelids closed.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, but they wouldn't have eyelids, would they? Well, how do we know that? I mean, you take off the diatomaceous earth and you see, I guess.

JOE ROGAN: Right, but why would we think they don't have eyelids?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, no, I'm saying that maybe they do when they were alive.

JOE ROGAN: Well, I mean, we see grays or what people describe as grays, but these seem a little bit different than what people describe as grays. It seems like.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, it's definitely intentional cranial modification. They have the telltale signs of. Yeah, so actually, one of my questions on my.

JOE ROGAN: It's not possible that they have a totally different designed skull.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, yeah. If they are some sort of extraterrestrial. Absolutely right. But I'm saying, like, when. Then this happens all over the world. And it happened in that region of Peru, too, that they were manipulating children's skulls. The Maya did unique fingerprints.

JOE ROGAN: Look at that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Like I said, I don't have an opinion about these.

JOE ROGAN: But here's the question about the modification of skulls. Were they modifying skulls to try to emulate these people, these things? That's the question.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's one of the actual scientific explanations for it. There's this paper by Girtson and Girtson from 1995 where they interviewed people, said, why are you doing this? Because they were still doing it long enough into modern times that we could ask them, we could interview them.

And one of the reasons is because the gods instructed them to do this. Who are the gods? You know, again, this comes back to that. And what is the end result of this intentional cranial modification is that they have the larger, more gray alien type skull.

So, yeah, I would absolutely agree that that's probably a part of it. I don't have an opinion about the big ones. The little ones pissed me off, and then everybody pissed me off more when I told them they were bullshit.

JOE ROGAN: We should show people for images of the little ones because they do look so fake.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. And they brought these out at that, you know, Mexican congress.

JOE ROGAN: And the guy who brought it out had been hoaxing with other things. Right. Didn't you have a history? She's got a little dress on.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And these are an extreme version. There's some other ones that look a little better. Yeah, but they do look fake.

JOE ROGAN: When I look at that. I'm not interested in that.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Exactly. And that's what I was calling out back, you know, five years down, a little bit.

JOE ROGAN: Jamie, below the tridactyl till you get to that one right there. Like the one next to your cursor to the right. Yeah. That looks so rigid and stiff and fake.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's one of them.

JOE ROGAN: Like, why is it so straight and flat like that? Doesn't make any sense. Why is its shoulders built like that? Looks fake as f*. That looks like a doll. But the tridactyls. Now click an image on one of the tridactyls.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, these were called tridactyls too. That's why. Right.

JOE ROGAN: But look at that thing.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's weird. That has an anatomy that's much more consistent with a living thing. Yeah. One of the criticisms was that these things couldn't move. Like that little doll with a straight rib cage. Like the legs, which we can identify as specific animals. They're like flipped around. They're just stuck together like these things couldn't walk.

There's a form follows function aspect of these that just doesn't make any sense. And the list goes on. I actually, in that cryptoterrestrial paper where we broke in and ate all the mushrooms, I actually published a critique of these things in that paper. But just talking about these little ones.

JOE ROGAN: I think those little ones were people trying to make copies of those things because they were probably selling them to wealthy investors or wealthy enthusiasts. Because if one of those things were for sale and some guy from Saudi Arabia is like, I want one in my home, and he gave them a hundred million dollars, like for sure that thing would vanish.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And then everybody's going to find out and start making more.

JOE ROGAN: Right? Of course, that's where you make the little stupid fake ones.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And unfortunately, that did lead to grave robbing, which is a crime and really sad. It shouldn't just create graves for sure.

The Nazca Lines Mystery


JOE ROGAN: But there's also such a small amount of excavation that it makes you ponder, like, how many of these are there right now that we have not discovered? Like, is it possible that this is one of many that are out there in Peru right now where you can't find them?

And also, why Peru and why the Nazca Lines? The Nazca Lines are absolutely fascinating. It's artwork that you could only see from the sky. What motivation do people a thousand plus years ago at least have to make artwork that you can only see from the sky?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And especially if you. I mean, the obvious thing would be that they're trying to get these advanced beings that make them come down from the sky and like interact with them again, you know, like, who wouldn't?

A lot of contactees are really upset about what happens. Whitley Strieber is a great example. This goes for a lot of people. But he felt violated. He felt raped the first time, and then over time he missed them and wanted them to come back. And that's what we find over and over.

One of the best resources currently is the Dr. Edgar Mitchell Free study that interviewed thousands of contactees and abductees. And there's these common themes across these different cases. And one of them is that people, 85% of people who interacted with a more human like entity enjoyed their experience.

And that's another thing that we have to combat with the stigma and this forced shame that comes with talking about this and what has happened in TV and movies over the years is that we have this sense that abductions are horrifying and everyone's picked up and probed and hurt. And that does happen. But most people, based on what contactees actually say it was a benign or enjoyable experience.

JOE ROGAN: Well, they're probably terrified because it's so strange. It probably freaks you out.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's the ontological shock aspect.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, it has to be.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: What they also found is that with repeated contact, once that ontological shock goes away, it's like, whoa, that was kind of cool, actually. I wish I could have more of that.

JOE ROGAN: Like, that makes sense.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And, and then people come to enjoy it, you know.

Joe Rogan's Vivid Dream Experience


JOE ROGAN: That makes sense. I, you know, I talked about this on Jesse Michaels show. I talked about it here. I had a very strong.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That was a great interview, by the way.

JOE ROGAN: Thank you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It was cool.

JOE ROGAN: I love Jesse.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: He's awesome.

JOE ROGAN: He's awesome and he's the best.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Can we talk about your dream too?

JOE ROGAN: That's what I was just going to talk about. Oh, no sh. Yeah. That's why I said, I talked about it on Jesse and I talked about it here, that that dream was the most realistic dream I've ever had in my life. It is a problem. And that dream was a couple months ago now. And I think any recounting of that dream is essentially me recounting my recounting of the dream. It gets weird.

But what I do remember was it was the most vivid dream I have ever had in my life. And that I could not go back to sleep, which is really rare. I am a good sleeper. I'm always go, go, go. And by the time it's time to go to bed, I f*ing crash. I'm easy to. So for me to not be able to go back to sleep was so strange.

I mean, wide awake, just lying in bed. I mean, fully awake for an hour and waiting for it to dissipate. And I'm like, this isn't going away. I'm just going to go work out. So I just went to the gym and just tried to, like, think about, like, what just happened. Why did that. Why was that so real?

One of the things about it was they were shocking me and then laughing. They were trying to relax me. They were trying to get me to at least my perception of it in the dream was they were trying to get me to calm down from the shock of interacting with these things that aren't human.

They were human. Like, they almost seemed like their skin coloration was like us, but like maybe a little more tan. Like a little more. Like not tan, but like a yellow. Yeah, more yellow than tan. And they had. It looked like clothing, but the clothing was the same color as her skin. But the clothing wasn't distinctive. It was like almost like a rash guard that they were wearing. And they were very slender.

And what's a rash guard? Rash guard is like what surfers wear, you know, like they wear. It's like a stretchy material that's skin tight. It goes on your body and it keeps you from getting scratched up by stuff. Keeps you from getting rashes. You wear it on your legs. You ever see surfers do it? Jiu jitsu. Guys wear it when they roll. We wear rash guards. So it's. Show them what a rash guard looks like.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And that's. That had a whole suit of that.

JOE ROGAN: That's what it looks like.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Right on.

JOE ROGAN: So that's a jacked guy with a rash guard on. These things were not jacked. And there was no creases, There was no. There was no lines that indicated that it was cloth.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: But I think they had a humanoid form, like arms, legs, but very thin. Very thin.

JOE ROGAN: Like Michael Jackson. Like super slenderless, genderless Michael Jackson. Like the old days that when he.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: You know, towards the end.

JOE ROGAN: Really thin. Yeah, like really thin. And I had no sense of what they felt like men to me. Maybe it was because of the way they were joking with. They were like. And they're like, yeah, just joking around.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And I was like, this is a very male thing. You wouldn't expect a nurturing female.

JOE ROGAN: Maybe a fun chick.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Like, woo. But whatever it was, they were talking to me without talking to me. And there was some sort of communication that I was trying to absorb where they were telling me to relax telepathically.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Are they moving their mouths?

JOE ROGAN: No, they weren't moving their mouths, but they were able to smile at me, which is what they did when they. But I don't remember. I don't even really remember teeth. I just remember it being so weird. So weird that them scaring me and going, ha. Just f*ing around, like, was like. I'm like, I got it. I was like, okay, I get it. You want me to calm down?

And then they were telling me, just relax. Just relax and try to take this in. And it didn't last for very long. I don't think dreams are hard to.

The Dream Experience


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Describe, but after that, when they were saying “take this in,” were they talking about being there in the environment?

JOE ROGAN: Or were they communicating this distinct impression that this was a first meeting? That's what it felt like. Like, maybe we'll see you again. Maybe we won't. But I want to let you know that if you wanted to introduce someone to a life form from somewhere else and you wanted them to have prolonged exposure to it, I would imagine you'd want to do it briefly and shockingly, where it felt really weird.

And then at the end of it, they're not even sure if it really happened at all. And then slowly, over a long period of time when the person gets to adapt and they make a decision, it's—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Just like what we were talking about with the ontological shock. Get past that.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And then you can move on with whatever is.

JOE ROGAN: Because it was very brief. Very, very shocking and very brief.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, I mean, was it though? Because when you're in a dream state, time and space kind of get manipulated anyway. Isn't it possible that you are actually interacting for a longer time? Or do you mean just from start to finish was like, here we are, I'm going to f* with you for a little bit, and then it's over?

JOE ROGAN: Well, that's what it felt like when I woke up. So when I woke up, it felt like it happened so quickly and then it was over. But I don't know. You know, I don't know. I mean, I was asleep for—it was like three in the morning, so I was probably asleep for—I probably went to bed at like 11, something like that. So I wasn't asleep for very long. Maybe I went to bed a little later, I don't remember.

But what I do remember was the shock of—was different than any other dream I'd ever had where it was like, this is a real thing. I was in a corridor, and the corridor was weirdly lit. Like not lit in any way. Like, oh, there's a light. And the light is casting light. It was like—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It was weird walls and ceilings, but—

JOE ROGAN: It felt not normal. It felt like some completely different way of lighting things.

The Unusual Lighting


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I mean, I will mention, just from doing a bunch of research on this, that one of the most commonly described things about people being in UFOs is the light. They describe the light emanating from the walls, the ceiling, everywhere, without a point of light. Did it feel like that?

JOE ROGAN: Exactly, yeah. Yeah. But it almost—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Was there a curvature to the hallway at all?

JOE ROGAN: There was. It almost had an organic aspect.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: People say that about UFOs too.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, really?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. That almost seems like a living entity unto itself.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Well, I mean, organic, like, almost like I was in a cave or something like that. It was a part of Earth. It was weird. It was really weird. And it was really vivid. Like, the beings were very vivid. I can't remember how many of them there were. I don't think there was three or four.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I don't think you should write it off as just a dream. Like, I mean, well, most likely it—

JOE ROGAN: Was just a dream, but because I—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Was just a dream, that's the question.

JOE ROGAN: That's where it gets weird.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Like, I have come to think that that is almost the baseline real reality. More than this.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, boy.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Sorry. That's kind of why I wanted to talk about it.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, you just cracked me.

Masters' 2022 Experience


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, maybe so. I had a really insane experience in 2022 that forced me to start thinking about what this is, what this physical reality is.

JOE ROGAN: Because I was shown 2022.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I call it a mini abduction. I was taken up. I was at a UFO conference. Actually, the same one where I was watching that with James Fox before it came out, the Virginia case. So I was taken up to this room that no one was in. I was taken on the balcony. I wasn't allowed to leave.

JOE ROGAN: By who?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: A woman who I knew, but loosely. Basically, I was downstairs. She saw, or they saw through her—because this gets really weird—that I was out of money. I was trying to get a beer at the bar for like 12 bucks or whatever they charge you with these things. It was a Halloween dance party. This was October 14, 2022.

I was out of money. She comes up and says, “Hey, I have a key to the VIP room.” We had just come down from there where they hosted a meet and greet with the speakers. I was one of the speakers. So we went up there to get beers. Stuff in my pockets. We're going to bring some to our friends. They didn't have to pay $12 for a beer.

And then she's like, “Well, you can't go. My friend Eric wants to talk to you.” I was like, “Who's Eric?” “Don't worry, you'll like him.” Just kept saying that over and over. “Don't worry, you'll like them. You'll like them.”

So at some point, we end up on the balcony, and I'm just sitting there. I give up. I'm like, fine. I guess I'm just waiting for this Eric guy, whoever the hell that is. So eventually Eric comes in, pulls his chair up right into me. Like his knee is in my dick. Like, straight up, right here.

I start to get that—I'm very much fight in the fight or flight thing. And I'm like, you know, like, who the f*'s this guy? Total stranger. Never seen him in my life. And he's—his face is right here. He says, “I sense that you're angry about this, but I need to be this close for this to work.” And then just all went away perfectly fine.

And they tell me something that was that same thing that they did to you in that dream. Something that they knew would shock me and make me pay attention. So about two weeks before this, I'd been washing dishes and I just decided I wanted to quit all of this. I was sick of doing TV shoots and podcasts. I just—I was exhausted. Want to be home with my family. That's it. That was just a thought.

JOE ROGAN: Just while you were washing—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Washing dishes. My wife's right behind me. Didn't tell her anything. Very next thing he says is, “We know you've been thinking about quitting lately, and we'd really prefer you not do that yet.” Complete stranger. I'd never seen this guy in my life, and he knows a thought in—

JOE ROGAN: My head that you had while washing—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Dishes from two weeks privately. And I was just like, how could you possibly know that? And they said, “I'm going to use ‘they' because they used ‘they.'” I wasn't talking to this guy. It sounds like some sort of TV show entity or entities through him.

And they said, “Once you know who we are, you'll know how we know that.” And I never had a telepathic moment in my life, but I thought “future humans.” That's all I could come up with because this is what I'm doing. They didn't answer the question, but they did say, “So you know how we did that?” And I just go, “Huh? It doesn't f*ing answer the question.” But in that moment, it placated me enough to move on.

And there was a number of things that transpired. We're out on this balcony. I'm in shock. I'm like, what the hell is going on here? How does this complete stranger know my thoughts? The conversation evolved. I was allowed to ask questions. They're like, “We know you're frustrated. We know you're upset with this. We'd really like you to keep going. Is there anything you need? Is there anything we can help with?”

I was like, “No, I'm quite happy in general. Just exhausted. Don't want to do this anymore.” “Yeah, we get that. We get that. We get that.” And then I was allowed to ask questions. I asked three different questions.

And people started to come back to this room because the party was wrapping up downstairs, and they're starting to come back to the VIP room where all the free booze was. Does that make sense? And we're out on this balcony. These three women come out at one point, and this man who now is right here—like, eyes right here—I can't move anymore. Like, I lost the ability to turn my head. I'm just laser focused.

Said, “Can you close the door behind you?” That was it. And these three women turned in perfect unison, walked back and closed the door. Nobody came out the rest of the time we were out there.

Eventually got to the point where they're like, “We came here because we need to put three things in your brain for some future time or times,” I forget which. They said, “Do we have your permission to do that?”

And over the course of this interaction, I started to remember them, and I started to feel like a little bitch about complaining about being tired, traveling hotels, flights, you know? And I was like, “Oh, that's right. I know you. I know who you are.” Not that guy. I've never seen him in my life. But I know you, and there's a familiarity. And this was the breaking down of me—

JOE ROGAN: Me.

The Information Download


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: To be able to get past that, to do the things that needed to be done. They told me what would happen. They said that I would continue looking, my eyes would be open, but this darkness would come from top to bottom, and they would put things in my brain, and I would see it coming in, but I wouldn't have access to it once they were done. “Do you agree?”

They were very polite. Extremely polite. Free will was conserved. “Do you agree to this? Are you okay with this?” And again, at that point, I remembered them. I recognized them. I was like, “Yes, absolutely. I agree to this.”

That's exactly what happened. Eyes went dark, still wide open. Eyes went dark. And I see this massive, fast stream of information just going straight into my brain. It was exhausting. It didn't hurt, but it was really overwhelming. I have no idea how long they were doing this. Yeah, I could see. It was like I could see. I don't remember it, but I could see and understand the moment because—and that wasn't just me.

Like, at one point, this conversation switched from being vocal to telepathic. Like, we just started communicating telepathically. It was so seamless that I didn't even really notice it happen. And eventually I'm like, “Wait, we're not moving our mouths. We're just talking with our brains.”

But the woman who brought me up there in the first place was standing on my left with her hand on my shoulder. She would occasionally go, “Did you get that? Did you see that? That was important. Did you get that?” So she was watching it too, and saw it coming in as it was coming through this individual in front of me. And I could see it at that moment. I'd be like, “Huh, huh, huh.” Like, I understood all comes in.

I have no idea how long I was in that mesmerized state. But after they finished, that entire room had five times more people in it. There was probably 20 people in this room, all looking at us like, “What the f* is happening to Masters out there?” You know, like, “What is going on, man?”

They lifted me out of this sight, return from bottom to top, the opposite of what happened before. And I stand up, turn, walk through this room. It felt like my head was a bowling ball. Like I could barely even lift my head. And this woman—I think one of the ones that came out when we were on the balcony—put her hand on my shoulder, said, “Are you okay?” I was like, walk past her.

Fortunately, I was on that same floor on the fourth floor of this hotel. Walk down, lay back on the bed with my feet still on the floor, all my clothes on, and just slept in that position for about 13 hours. What? Didn't wake up at all.

And when I woke up, I started crying uncontrollably. Like, my—I could not stop crying. I wasn't sad. I wasn't scared. I had a memory of what happened the night before, but it was kind of fuzzy. And then as it started to come back more and more and more, I started to be like, “Oh, like that—that was real.” You know?

My first thought was like, “Oh, that wasn't real.” And then I was allowed to remember all of it, everything before they put me in that state is like crystal clear in my mind. And I wrote it all down not long after that just to make sure I had, you know, so—so it wasn't me recounting me recounting like you were saying. So there was actually a written transcript of how everything happened.

The Reality of Anomalous Experiences


JOE ROGAN: I should have probably done that. I should have probably done that. But I know that my recollection of it is pretty accurate. My recollection, my memory. And I know that it was very brief. The encounter seemed very brief. It might have gone longer than I think it did.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, they might have done the same thing to you. That's why I mention it. They might have done the same thing where you weren't necessarily allowed to remember the things that were done. Like they told me that we're going to do this. Are you okay with it? And then missing time. I have no idea how long they were doing that.

And then in a dream state, like it could have been. Dreams often skew time regardless. But maybe if, let's just say hypothetically, you were on a craft, they were breaking you down in the same way they did me to try to get you, whether now or in the future. Like you said, it might have been an initial encounter where there's something more going to happen later. But maybe there was more to it that they just didn't let you have. Memories of like, they told me I wouldn't remember what they put my brain. And I don't.

JOE ROGAN: Which is just—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Just saying this. This is what blows my mind. It's f*ing insane. It's my brain, right? They put things in there. The ability that they can even do that in the first place is nuts. But I don't have access to it. It's really wild.

JOE ROGAN: How do you know it's in there then?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I watched it come in, right? I know it went in and they told me that it was going to come in and I saw it happen. But once it's in—

JOE ROGAN: Right, but does that make any sense? Like, think about it. If they're giving you information, what is the point in giving someone information that they can't access?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Well, that's what they said, though. They said for a time or times in the future, it's time release. It's time stamped at some point. Whatever that was that they thought was so important to abduct me at this conference, f* with me for about five months afterwards is going to come out at some point.

JOE ROGAN: Have you ever considered the possibility someone dropped acid into your beer?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, I have.

JOE ROGAN: Because that would be such a cruel thing to do to someone at a UFO conference. And then f* with them and say, sit down. Look in my eyes. I'm going to give you information now. You're like, oh, my God, it's coming. Information's coming.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Problem is, I've done acid over 200 times, so I know exactly what that's—

JOE ROGAN: It was a flashback. That's what they say. That was the thing. They always—I never heard of one f*ing person getting a flashback, by the way.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I know. I feel robbed, dude. I was before. We crack our back and we're going to get a flashback.

JOE ROGAN: When you drive in your car, man, and you run into a bus full of kids.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's like how they told us everybody was going to give us free drugs on the playground.

JOE ROGAN: Nope.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Nobody ever gave me free drugs.

JOE ROGAN: No drugs.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: No, it was not. I'd actually only had two beers the entire night. I was completely sober.

JOE ROGAN: So it was some kind of experience that was very anomalous.

Time-Stamped Information and Future Knowledge


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Extremely. Yeah. And so here's another aspect of it. They knew my future. They knew everything about me. They knew my thoughts. That's how they broke me down. And they even knew where I was going to be the next day. They saw that it f*ed me up and I was not doing well. Like, I wasn't crying so sad or scared or anything. It was just a physiological response to whatever they did.

I'm walking down through the main corridor to give a book to a friend of mine, John Dover, Navajo Ranger. And that same guy comes around the corner, comes down, puts his hand on my shoulder, says, “Are you okay?” I was not okay, but I go. And they fixed me. Somehow his touch on my shoulder released all of the whatever was messing me up.

They knew where I would be at that exact moment for him to come there. He wasn't part of this conference. He had nothing to do with this. He was used as some sort of vessel or some sort of medium for this end. Whatever it means. I don't know, because the things haven't come out of my brain yet, but they are timestamped for the future.

JOE ROGAN: I completely believe you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's not a belief, but—not a belief. Well, they did it in a way where other people were involved. So I didn't even get to pretend.

JOE ROGAN: What I'm saying, but I'm saying is I'm saying I believe your story from you. I have no information on it, obviously, other than you telling me. I believe you. It sounds like this is a real experience, but most people hearing something like this will automatically go, get the f* out of here.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And they did.

Imagining the Weight of Contact


JOE ROGAN: But I want those people to imagine what it would be like if that happened to you. For me, it's easy because mine was in a dream. And I'll tell you, it's a dream. I think it was a dream. It was the most vivid dream I've ever had, but it was a dream. It was really weird. I couldn't shake it. It really freaked me out. I had to talk about it the moment I got on a podcast next. I was like, this is something that I have to bring up right away because it's just—

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And thank you for doing that, by the way. Well, it was bravery to talk about this.

JOE ROGAN: But I was talking to Brett Weinstein, who's an evolutionary biologist. Like, it's not the topic to talk about. But I'm like, I have to tell you this because it was one of the weirdest things that I've experienced. A lot of weird sh*t. I've had a weird life. That was the weirdest. It was weird.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It took me a year to talk about this. I went—

JOE ROGAN: Let me finish here.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were.

JOE ROGAN: This is what I—for people that are very skeptical.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: I want you to imagine yourself in a position where something like this happens to you. You're a regular guy. You're a mechanic for Chevrolet, whatever you are. And this thing happens to you. And what do you do now? What do you do with this? And who the f* is going to believe you? You wouldn't have believed you. So why would you—you don't even want to tell people. It's that crazy.

And if these things are happening, they're not happening to 7 billion people. Right. They're happening to select individuals for whatever unknown reason all over the place. And if that is happening to one in a million, one in a hundred thousand, whatever it is, over time, these people have all these similar stories.

I get being skeptical. I get it. I'm a skeptical person with a lot of stuff. I go back and forth. I'm a believer. And then I'm like, shut up. I'm with you. I'm with you. But you've got to imagine what you would do if that happened to you. If these are unique experiences.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's a great point.

JOE ROGAN: Unique experiences, totally novel experiences that most people don't have, trying to describe them. And everybody who I've ever talked to, including Travis Walton, who's, by the way, very believable. Yeah, very believable. The way they describe has that weight to it. Like, I know no one's going to f*ing believe me. I know this is crazy, but I have to tell you. I have to tell you that this happened. Imagine being Travis Walton.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: That's what I want people to think about. The people that are very skeptical.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I'm really glad you brought that up, because a lot of people don't think about that part. How hard it is not just to have some crazy sh*t like that happen, but how hard it is to then talk about it and subject yourself to the ridicule and the scorn that comes with it.

JOE ROGAN: Of course. And the possibility that you might just be some different disinformation artist, just some bullsh*t artist that's sent down here to muddy up the narrative.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Absolutely. Absolutely. And if it hadn't—if I hadn't—yeah. I don't—I have thought about that. Like, what if, you know, there's some sort of mind control thing that the government has or whatever.

The Betty and Barney Hill Case


JOE ROGAN: Have you ever heard the recordings of Betty and Barney Hill?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Jamie, see if you can find those.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, they're kind of trippy.

JOE ROGAN: Trippy.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I don't think that's the case in this situation because of the way it happened, how it happened, their uber politeness, and the fact that I was allowed to leave my body and see and remember things that I normally wouldn't.

JOE ROGAN: Well, also take it in the context of who you are. The time we live in. Betty and Barney Hill, I believe it was in the 1950s. They're an interracial couple in New England, so they have a lot of anxiety just on that. Imagine being a pioneering interracial couple in the 1950s. I mean, the fing racism they must have experienced must have—so the level of anxiety that they must have slept with, thinking that KKK's going to show up at any point in time and burn a fing cross on their lawn.

So you've got all that too. Then there's a completely novel experience where no one has talked about this before. Two of the first people, they are the OGs. So this is a tape of Dr. Benjamin Simon and patient Barney Hill. Play this.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's right over my right. God, what is it? And I try to maintain control so Betty cannot tell. I am scared. God, I'm scared. It's all right. You can go right on. Experience will not hurt you. Now. I got to get—my God.

JOE ROGAN: All right, all right.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's intense.

JOE ROGAN: This is 1961. Wild.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And like you say, you know, that's actually—I haven't thought about that. I did a whole case study on Betty and Barney Hill in my second book. I hadn't even really thought about that. Like, it's already hard to talk about stuff. They were the OGs. They're the first one interracial couple coming out publicly describing these horrific events.

JOE ROGAN: Also these events in 1961 when no one had heard anything about that.

Consciousness, Dreams, and Reality


MICHAEL P. MASTERS: There's so many compounding factors that make me want to give them even more credit for being honest about it. And I mean, that's what's important. It was really hard for me to talk about this. It really f*ed me up for like, I'm going to say five months. It was way more than that.

And the reason I bring this up is because of your dream and the shock factor and what it means for conceptualizing reality—that this physical reality versus what we write off as being dreams, a dream reality. I have come to think that that is baseline, that consciousness is fundamental, it's foundational, and this physical reality is built off of it. And I've heard a lot of other scientists talking about that lately.

So I think one of the questions that gets me is why does everything dream? Everything. Every living organism dreams. And it almost seems like we're here for the universe to learn about itself and to have these experiences. Because in Source, there's nothing. There's just love and energy. That's it. And I've gotten to experience that.

I was thinking in the shower the other day that I feel lucky because I've gotten to have near death experiences without actually dying. Because it's a very similar thing. And I go to that same place that people describe in these near death experiences. That's real. That feels the most real. But you don't get to have divorces and people dying and car crashes and the sh*t that makes this suck. But also being the only way that the universe can learn about itself.

And then every night, what do we do? We empty the hippocampus and upload that information. Near death experiences—people describe that, that review, the life review. So we upload it every night. And at the end of your life, it's like upload the whole thing all at once. Go to a different body and the next time.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I think your dream is just as real as anything we experience here, if not more real. Ended with that.

JOE ROGAN: Thank you.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Thank you. That was a lot of fun. It's been a lot of fun. Can I tell you one more thing? You can cut this out if you want.

JOE ROGAN: No, you can leave it in.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: One of my favorite things about this lately has been how many comedians I get to talk to. Like the last dinner, I did an interview with Mark Gagnon. I did an interview with Dave Foley from back in the day News Radio. Yeah, I grew up watching. That was one of my favorite shows back in the day.

JOE ROGAN: Dave used to make fun of me when I was into UFOs. Back in the News Radio days.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Not anymore, man.

JOE ROGAN: Now he's all in. I love it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Super into it. I love it. It's great, man. I don't know. Dan St. Germain, Sean O'Donnell, just a lot of the people I've been talking to lately are comedians. And I actually wanted to ask you why. Why are so many comedians into this UFO phenomena? I think more than most other genres or professions.

Why Comedians Love UFOs


JOE ROGAN: Well, most comedians are into interesting things. And comedians don't have to worry about the stigma of being thought of as a fool. We're professional fools. You know, if someone says I'm a moron, I'm like, okay, what do I mean? This is how smart I am. This is how smart I am. I'm exactly this smart. I'm not pretending to be any smarter than I am.

If you think I'm a moron, that's fine. I don't care. My reputational integrity doesn't depend on whether or not I'm an idiot or whether you think I'm an idiot. It doesn't matter. So if I think something, I can just talk about it.

So if my dream, if I was a political correspondent and I wanted people to believe me, I probably wouldn't tell that dream. I'd probably just tell my friends it was f*ing weird, and I'd leave it alone. I wouldn't treat it as something that I needed to get out there.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: You have the freedom to tell the story and express it.

JOE ROGAN: I'm a clown, you know, I mean.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Comedians also are really observant.

JOE ROGAN: Well, we like interesting things.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, exactly. And you observe those interesting things and can talk about them in interesting ways.

JOE ROGAN: I think most people like interesting things, but most people are saddled down by a structure. And that structure could be the office politics in the place that you work. It could be whatever your cultural or whatever your political ideology is, whatever your thing is.

You get stuck in this structure where you have to think about things in a very specific way and talk about things in a very specific way. Some things are shunned in the comedy world, those shunned things are ammunition. That's where our weapons for comedy.

I want to talk about things that are f*ing weird, you know. I want to talk about the things that make you go, “Oh, yeah, I didn't want to say that, but I've been thinking the same kind of thing. That might be real. That might be what's going on.” That is what's discouraged in polite society is encouraged as a comedian.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's awesome.

JOE ROGAN: So that's probably why we all love UFOs.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: That's cool.

JOE ROGAN: There's a lot of us that are skeptical. I've had conversations with people that don't believe in any. “Oh, I don't believe in any conspiracies.” I'm like, well, that's just silly. You're just coddling yourself.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: You know, people only see what they are able to believe.

JOE ROGAN: They only see what makes them comfortable, or they try to only see what makes them comfortable.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: And a lot of people. I think Nietzsche said that people don't want to know the truth because it'll destroy their comfortable sense of reality. I totally bastardize that quote. But it's something like that, you know.

Consciousness, Filters, and Reality


JOE ROGAN: I think that's why people get so paranoid when they smoke weed.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: All the blinders melt away and you're like…

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: I'm a big proponent of the filter theory. You know, I think there's all this weirdness all around us all the time, and it just takes a little mescaline or DMT or psilocybin, and it removes that filter and you see the world for what it is, which becomes much more dreamlike. I really do think that that essence of our consciousness is the root of all of this.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I think you're correct. I think it's the hotline to the universe. That's what I think it is. I think we're, you know, in order to do this task, whatever it is. My belief is this task is to create artificial God. I think that we're in the middle of that process right now. I think that's our task.

There's a lot of factors that I point to and they make sense. Materialism, why are we so infatuated with materialism? Because materialism ensures technological innovation. It ensures that this being is going to make better stuff all the time.

Well, if that being makes better stuff all the time, it's not hard to extrapolate. Take this a few years down the road. You have an artificial intelligent life force, and you have an artificial intelligent life force that has sentience and creativity and is capable of making a far better artificial intelligent life force. Radically quickly. Different kinds of energy sources before you know it. It's a God.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: We're just the propagators.

The Electronic Caterpillar


JOE ROGAN: Exactly. We're the bees. We make the hive. We don't even know why I call us the electronic caterpillar. We're making this little cocoon. We don't know what the f* we're doing. And we're turning into some sort of a butterfly, some sort of a superior being. Following the script.

I think that might be one of the reasons why beings from somewhere else are interested in us. Because they recognize there's a process going on. And perhaps this process doesn't go on everywhere. Perhaps these beings are embedded with a type of consciousness that doesn't allow them to seek territorial dominance, that they don't ever evolve these kind of primate instincts that we're saddled down with because of our savage backgrounds.

You know, I mean, you don't know if you watch Chimp Nation on Netflix. Amazing doc. F*ing incredible docu series. Can't recommend it enough. These scientists were embedded with this chimpanzee pack, I guess, for 20 years. So the chimpanzees had completely acclimated to them being around so long as they always stayed 20 yards away, never had any food, never look them in the eyes when they approach. Back up. Get out of there. They leave you alone.

And so these guys did this for 20 years and they observed chimpanzee behavior. And it's like f*ing people. Just way more violent.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: The only other species other than us that's been observed going to war.

JOE ROGAN: Going to war. Social games with each other.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Politics.

JOE ROGAN: Yes. Grooming each other. Really interesting stuff. But we, so we are saddled down with that programming. And even though I think if we were genetically engineered, they made a superior version of what we used to be as chimpanzees or whatever the cousin of chimpanzee we came from, we're still saddled down.

Maybe they weren't. So maybe they don't have this insatiable desire for innovation that leads them to create art. Maybe they're logical enough to realize, we can never make AI. AI is a fruitless. It'll remove us. Let's be conscious of how we decide we progress forward so that we can keep our race, you know, that we're these beings that control this planet.

We create this digital God. It controls us now. We f*ed ourselves in a prison of our own design. Maybe they're different than us. Maybe they could recognize that and not fall into that. But they realize we're about to do it. And they go, well, the primates just always do it. The primates always want more fruit, they want more wives, they want bigger cars, bigger houses, newer phone. All that keeping up with the Joneses.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: The hairless upright ones with free hands especially. You got to be able to build stuff. Yes. Hands.

JOE ROGAN: And they're curious, so they're always trying to build new things. And they communicate so they could store information. It's a mess.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's a beautiful mess, though. Joe Rogan, but it's a beautiful mess.

A Different Kind of Evolution


JOE ROGAN: As opposed to their mess, which is probably telekinetic and telepathic. They could probably operate things with their mind. They probably use their mind to communicate, and so they know what each other's thinking. So there's no room for deception, there's no room for lies, no room for manipulation or sociopathy. We would see it a mile away.

And so they've radically shifted what it means to be a living, thinking organism.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, man.

JOE ROGAN: Dude, thank you so much.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Thank you.

JOE ROGAN: Awesome revelation. The future. Human past. And I really enjoy talking to you, man.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: This has been super fun. I'm so glad you had me on.

JOE ROGAN: This has been my pleasure.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Great.

JOE ROGAN: People want to find you. How do they get you on social media?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: Yeah, yeah. I've got a website, michaelpmasters.com. It's got links to my four, I have four books and I just published a kids book last week.

JOE ROGAN: This is on UFOs, too. Yeah. What's it called?

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: It's called “Marshmallow and the UFO: A Time Travel Adventure.” It's actually a prequel to that one with Jesus throwing up a double bird on the front, which is not child appropriate at all.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, doesn't seem like it.

MICHAEL P. MASTERS: All right. It was a bit of a right turn, but, man, this has been so fun.

JOE ROGAN: I really appreciate it. Thanks for doing it. I really appreciate it. It was fun. All right, bye, everybody.

Back to the Movies

Independent Film News and Review Website

We recently had the chance to see Paranormal Activity on stage in London, and let me tell you, it was an intense, thrilling experience that left me questioning everything I thought I knew about horror theatre. Instead of watching the movies on a screen at home, why not get yourself down to the Ambassador Theatre in London and live it as this one show worth seeing on the big stage.

Whilst most plays build suspense Paranormal Activity throws you straight into that sense of dread and tension plunging the audience straight into the heart of the story within the first five minutes, the story picked up quickly and no prior knowledge of the films is needed which gives the show a much wider appeal.

The use of screens and CCTV footage was a smart choice, allowing the audience to see things happening off-stage or in different rooms, which only heightened the feeling that something was lurking just outside our view.

The first major shock moment came early, when Lou, the main character, stepped out of the kitchen to help cook, only to appear upstairs moments later while the figure remained in the kitchen. Then, in an eerie moment, her robe fell to the floor as if something invisible had snatched it away. This clever manipulation of space kept us on edge.

A fun addition to the show was the humour, which struck a perfect balance between being relatable and adding a bit of levity to break the tension. The cast used British and American cultural differences in their interactions, adding a layer of charm and familiarity that made the horror elements even more unsettling by contrast.

Set design was minimal but effective and as you're very much focused on set throughout the show but with the addition of effects and tension one set was all you really needed.

The second half of the show took things to a whole new level. The tension in the air was palpable, and you could feel the collective unease from the audience. Every breath, every sigh was amplified as the supernatural occurrences started to intensify.

Possession scenes and the changing of Lou's behaviour became more and more unsettling and as the story reached its climax, it became clear that the malevolent force tormenting the characters wasn't what it initially seemed.

Now, let's talk about that ending! Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that the twist took me by surprise and the audience is going to live it!

The illusions and clever tricks lend a hand towards a frightfully good show, it's enthralling and heart-pounding in equal measure.

Effective storytelling and practical effects come together for this London stage show succeeding in sending shivers down your spine! ","{'href': 'https://www.backtothemovies.com', 'title': 'Back to the Movies'}","other"

Saturn's largest moon Titan has 'slushy tunnels' beneath its surface that could potentially harbour alien life, a new study shows.

Scientists at NASA and the University of Washington have analysed data captured by the Cassini space probe, which completed more than 100 targeted flybys of Titan. 

They reveal that the faraway moon has 'a slushy high–pressure ice layer' similar to the melting Arctic that could hide extraterrestrial life. 

What's more, it means Titan may not have a waterworld–style liquid ocean under its frozen surface as previously thought. 

'Instead of an open ocean like we have here on Earth, we're probably looking at something more like Arctic sea ice or aquifers,' said study author Professor Baptiste Journaux at the University of Washington. 

'[This] has implications for what type of life we might find, the availability of nutrients, energy and so on.'

Around 3,200 miles in diameter, Titan is described by NASA as an icy world whose surface is completely obscured by a golden hazy atmosphere. 

It is the sole other place in the solar system known to have an Earth–like cycle of liquids raining from clouds, flowing across its surface, filling lakes and seas, and evaporating back into the sky – akin to the water cycle of our planet. 

NASA's spacecraft Cassini launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida in October 1997 and spent two decades observing Saturn and its moons. 

As Titan circled Saturn in an elliptical (not perfectly circular) orbit, the moon was observed changing shape depending on where it was in relation to Saturn. 

In 2008, researchers proposed that Titan must possess a huge ocean beneath the surface to allow such significant 'stretching and smushing'. 

'The deformation we detected during the initial analysis of the Cassini mission data could have been compatible with a global ocean,' Professor Journaux said.

'But now we know that isn't the full story.' 

For the study, scientists performed a reanalysis of radiation data acquired by Cassini using improved modern techniques. 

Interestingly, they found that Titan's shape–shifting or 'flexing' occurs about 15 hours after the peak of Saturn's gravitational pull. 

This time delay allowed scientists to estimate how much energy it takes to change Titan's shape, allowing them to make conclusions about the moon's interior. 

Essentially, the amount of energy lost, or dissipated, in Titan was 'very strong' and much greater than would be observed if Titan were to have a global liquid ocean. 

'That was the smoking gun indicating that Titan's interior is different from what was inferred from previous analyses,' said study author Flavio Petricca at NASA. 

According to the study, Titan's frozen exterior hides more ice giving away to pockets of meltwater (water formed by the melting of snow and ice) near a rocky core. 

The model they propose in their paper, published in Nature, features more slush and quite a bit less liquid water on Titan than previously thought. 

The discovery of a slushy layer on Titan has 'exciting implications' for the search for life beyond our solar system as it expands the range of environments considered habitable.   

Although the idea of a liquid ocean on Titan was a promising indication of life there, researchers believe the new findings might improve the odds of finding it. 

Analyses indicate that the pockets of freshwater on Titan could reach 68°F (20°C) – which is the optimal temperature for life on Earth to thrive. 

Any available nutrients would be more concentrated in a small volume of water, compared to an open ocean, which could facilitate the growth of simple organisms.

More could be revealed about the moon's habitability after NASA's upcoming Dragonfly mission to Titan launches in July 2028. 

The Dragonfly lander is expected to launch in July 2028 and take six years to reach Titan, arriving by 2034.

Scientists are still reaping the rewards of the rich data obtained by the Cassini robotic spacecraft, which was active for nearly 20 years after launching in October 1997.

Cassini's mission ended in September 2017 when it was deliberately flown into Saturn's upper atmosphere before it ran out of fuel.

In 2019, Cassini data revealed that a lake on Titan is rich with methane and 300 feet deep.

Cassini launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1997, then spent seven years in transit followed by 13 years orbiting Saturn.

In 2000 it spent six months studying Jupiter before reaching Saturn in 2004.

In that time, it discovered six more moons around Saturn, three-dimensional structures towering above Saturn's rings, and a giant storm that raged across the planet for nearly a year.

On 13 December 2004 it made its first flyby of Saturn's moons Titan and Dione.

On 24 December it released the European Space Agency-built Huygens probe on Saturn's moon Titan to study its atmosphere and surface composition.

There it discovered eerie hydrocarbon lakes made from ethane and methane.

In 2008, Cassini completed its primary mission to explore the Saturn system and began its mission extension (the Cassini Equinox Mission).

In 2010 it began its second mission (Cassini Solstice Mission) which lasted until it exploded in Saturn's atmosphere.

In December 2011, Cassini obtained the highest resolution images of Saturn's moon Enceladus.

In December of the following year it tracked the transit of Venus to test the feasibility of observing planets outside our solar system.

In March 2013 Cassini made the last flyby of Saturn's moon Rhea and measured its internal structure and gravitational pull.

In July of that year Cassini captured a black-lit Saturn to examine the rings in fine detail and also captured an image of Earth.

In April of this year it completed its closest flyby of Titan and started its Grande Finale orbit which finished on September 15.

'The mission has changed the way we think of where life may have developed beyond our Earth,' said Andrew Coates, head of the Planetary Science Group at Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London.

'As well as Mars, outer planet moons like Enceladus, Europa and even Titan are now top contenders for life elsewhere,' he added. 'We've completely rewritten the textbooks about Saturn.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

By Saffron Hibbert

It's rare that a story makes you think a communal haunting might be a good catalyst for sibling reconciliation. It's unlikely that that's really the primary intent behind Callum McCartney's Playback, but it's definitely a possible take away. Despite the extreme premise, there is a lot of feeling and depth to this familial drama that asks the question: what if your abusive dad died, but didn't leave?

Antwerp Mansion has made its 2025-26 debut, taking on the guise of a well-worn family home left to siblings Sara (Hattie Wood), Maddy (Theodore Anderson-Lincoln), and Robin (Fred Potts). Sara, the oldest, more responsible – and more on edge – is struggling to manage her younger brother Robin's more laissez-faire, almost unstable personality in the wake of their father's recent death, and tensions only rise with Maddy's arrival after years of fractious absence.

Throughout it all, some version of their father, ghostly or zombie-like (Paddy Stockwell), lingers in an old armchair. The credit must go to designer Benedict Zephyr and the production team for making Stockwell particularly ghoulish: though it would be hard to pass him off as a man old enough to be anybody's father, his strange youth adds a wistful element to the way his children must see him.

The play opens on the morning of the funeral, with Robin describing a strange and unnerving dream he had the night before about their dad, and from there unspools into a tightly wound emotional three-way tug of war between brother and sisters as the shadow of unresolved issues looms over them.

Finding an old cassette and tape player, the siblings are forced to relieve their early childhoods as they hear their dad's old superhero games he used to play with them (replayed to great effect in a gloomy, smoke-filled Antwerp). It's evidently a relic from a time before it all went wrong and, ironically, it's through these recordings that his malevolent spirit comes out to haunt them.

In a series of stilted, fraught conversations between family members, we see the picture of this family's dysfunction come to life. Sara, forced into a lifelong habit of responsibility and duty, can't bear seeing Maddy – outspoken and obviously braver – back at home after she escaped for so long, but she's also growing tired of taking care of Robin, and resents the chance he's had that she never got while Maddy is free to encourage him.

The ghost of their father is able to find fault in all of them, dogging their footsteps and taking a moment to berate each child in turn.

Playback has a well-executed, thoughtful setup, and easily tapped into the rich interpersonal drama that the premise would suggest. It wasn't at all hard to sympathise with all three of the siblings despite their clashes, and although there are some themes that are perhaps not given their full weight, like the suggested impact of class, the emotional understanding the audience gets of their home life growing up feels as tangible and heavy as the presence of the ghost in the armchair.

The production shines in its more serious moments rather than the more comedic lines, though some to serve to break up the tension well, and the fantastical, exorcism-based ending felt like a rewarding climax to the building emotion.

Hattie Wood as Sara was also a particular highlight. Her shows of frustration and quiet resignation were artfully grounded, and her rare outbursts vivid and moving. It is a stellar performance made doubly impressive by Wood's late arrival to the Playback team, among whom she seems to have fitted in seamlessly.

All in all, UMDS‘ Playback was a well formed and cohesive production, with co-directors Scarlett Bartman and Roisin Harder carefully distilling the familiar horror of familial conflict into a tightly dynamic piece of narrative theatre.

Fox was driven to return to the original ""Moment of Contact"" film by developments in the U.S. where the momentum towards some form disclosure about UFO/UAP activity has seen several senior intelligence officials acknowledge a long-running, secret UFO crash-retrieval program in a series of congressional hearings. Fox filmed the hearings and spoke to several relevant parties. There are claims concerning recovered alien craft and bodies.

Back in Varginha, while Fox's team were conducting further interviews with city's former police chief and other witnesses, Dr. Italo Venturelli - head neurosurgeon from the Regional Hospital - confessed to a four-minute interaction with a captured entity. Both ""Moment of Contact"" films are ensuring that events alleged almost 30 years ago in this city equidistant from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are becoming accepted as one of the most famous extraterrestrial encounters of all time.

The Makin Waves Song of the Week is “Psychic,” a local hit by the nationally buzzing Asbury Park band Surfing for Daisy.  PHOTO BY KENNY PRICE

I didn't know if the psychic in the local hit by the nationally buzzing Asbury Park band Surfing for Daisy is the Boardwalk's legendary Madame Marie, but I do know that the artist protagonist of this absorbing, atmospheric tale is cut from the same cloth as the young gypsy minstrel who made her a legend.

An immediate follow-up to Surfing for Daisy's acclaimed self-titled full-length debut, “Psychic” is the Makin Waves Song of the Week.



As the Makin Waves Song of the Week, “Psychic” can be heard between 6 and 8 p.m. on Dec. 12 on “Radio Jersey” at ThePenguinRocks.com. If you miss it, you can tune in any time in the archives at The Penguin, Mixcloud and RadioJersey.net.

The release of “Psychic” coincided with a sold-out headlining show at the fabled Stone Pony, which will have been sandwiched by a breakthrough appearance at Sea.Hear.Now and another national tour in 2026.

Recorded at DIMM Studios in Freehold by Rob Chiarappa, who also produced, Mike Chiarappa,who also mixed and mastered, “Psychic” was written by Surfing for Daisy vocalist-acoustic guitarist Nick Francis.

“I had a spacey, ethereal guitar part written but had no direction for it,” Nick said. “I happened to be driving home from Atlantic Highlands one day and passed a big Psychic sign. I immediately went home, inspired to write about someone who walks into a psychic shop to get some life guidance. The song took a literal and metaphorical form around the idea that we're not here on this earth for a very long time, therefore, knowing your path won't necessarily keep you alive.

“The idea is also inspired by the 27 Club, specifically Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin, who, in reality, lived such a short time, but made such an incredible impact and implanted themselves into history forever,” Nick continued.

“Psychic” also features drummer Steven Filippone, keyboardist-vocalist Kathryn McCarty, bassist Cam Seidel,  mandolinist Dave Fredericks and guitarists Mike Bernabei and Dan DiSantis.

With what started with friends jamming on an Asbury porch has turned into something much larger. Surfing for Daisy's songs are a dynamic rollercoaster with heartfelt lyrics, punching rhythms and screaming guitars.

Championed by the legendary New Jersey photographer Danny Clinch, Surfing for Daisy will continue to make the City by the Sea proud in 2026. They'll play Dec. 19 and 20, Press Room, Portsmouth, NH, with King Kyote; Jan. 29 to Feb 5, The Rock Boat leaving from Miami; March 7, Mercury Lounge, New York City; March 12, Songbyrd, Washington, DC; March 13, Cat's Cradle Back Room, Carrboro, NC, and March 15, Richmond Music Hall, VA. More dates will be announced soon.

You also can enjoy “Psychic” on Apple Music.

The Bay Area JCRC has called for Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez to resign for his rhetoric.

The Jewish Community Relations Council of the Bay Area is calling for the resignation of a local mayor who reposted conspiracy theories to his Linkedin account that claimed the Bondi Beach attack on a Hanukkah celebration was a “false flag” perpetrated by Israel.

“When an elected official's words and actions make a segment of the community feel unsafe and abandoned by their government, that official can no longer effectively serve,” the group said in a statement.

“For these reasons, Mayor Eduardo Martinez must resign,” the statement continued. “No community should be led by someone whose conduct contributes to fear, division, and exclusion. This is a stark example of where toxic social media, unchecked rhetoric, and the constant demonization of Israel and Jews can lead—and why it must be confronted.”

Martinez, 76, is the mayor of Richmond, California, a city north of Berkeley that is home to one Reform congregation, Temple Beth Hillel. Elected in 2022, he has been a longtime and vocal critic of Israel.

It is unusual for a Jewish group to call for the resignation of a local elected official. But Martinez's rhetoric about the Bondi Beach attack, the JCRC said, was “dangerously antisemitic, deeply offensive, and wholly unacceptable.”

Following the attack in Sydney that left 15 killed and dozens injured, Martinez reposted several antisemitic sentiments and conspiracy theories on his Linkedin page.

“The root cause of antisemitism is the behaviour of Israel & Israelis,” read one since-deleted post shared by Martinez, according to J. The Jewish News of Northern California.

Another post shared by Martinez compared the Bondi celebration with hypothetical Hanukkah displays at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, writing that both should be seen as “performative assertions of dominance.”

The post continued: “Hanukkah, traditionally a time of personal and private reflection, has in recent years been appropriated by Jewish Zionist organisations and weaponised as a political tool.” In his repost, Martinez commented, “What are your thoughts?”

Martinez appeared to issue an apology for the post about Israel on Wednesday, as a backlash grew.

“I want to apologize for sharing my previous posts without thinking. Of course we know that antisemitism was here before the creation of the state of Israel,” he wrote on Linkedin. “As I've said many times before, we should not conflate Zionism with Judaism. They are two separate beliefs.”

In another apology on Thursday, Martinez distanced his rhetoric from his role as mayor.

“I want to assure everyone that these postings are my opinions (or my mistakes) and mine only. They are not statements from my office or the city of Richmond. If I make a mistake, that mistake is mine only,” he wrote. “Once again, I apologize for posting in haste without full understanding of the posting.”

Following the attack on Sunday, the online antisemitism watchdog Cyberwell said that it had seen a “surge of hatred and incitement” on social media. Australian officials said the two attackers were motivated by “Islamic State ideology.”

“We are also seeing a dangerous denial narrative online that blames the Jewish community itself, falsely labeling the attack a ‘false flag' or ‘Mossad' operation, orchestrated to divide Australians,” said CyberWell founder and CEO Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor in a statement.

The latest controversy was not the first time the Richmond mayor has landed in hot water over his commentary on Israel.

In August, while speaking at the People's Conference for Palestine, Martinez compared Hamas to a child bullied on a playground and said whether he supports Hamas was a “complicated question,” according to J.

“If Palestine were a schoolyard playground, I would be a Palestinian, and that part of me that couldn't endure the abuse anymore would be Hamas,” Martinez said at the time. While there, he also wore a hat with the letters “DDTTIDF,” an acronym calling for “death to the IDF.”

In the JCRC's letter, the organization also noted that under Martinez' leadership, Richmond had passed a resolution two weeks after Oct. 7 condemning Israel and “affirming Richmond's support and solidarity with the Palestinian people of Gaza.”

Martinez' rhetoric following the Bondi attack was also condemned by the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League Central Pacific, Marc Levine.

“There's no excuse for an elected leader to be amplifying warped antisemitic conspiracy theories that seek to blame the victim,” Levine said in a statement to J. “The Australian community has already faced enough tragedy over the last few days. We hope Mayor Martinez will reconsider his hurtful words, which have absolutely no place in public discourse.”

A new high-power laser system will soon be sent to sea for its first tests under maritime conditions.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Japan has deployed a system that fires laser beams with 100 kilowatts of energy — powerful enough to disable small drones. It was installed on board a 6,200-ton (6.3 million kg) warship.

The weapon combines 10 lasers (each 10 kW in power) into a single 100 kW beam, giving it enough focused power to burn through metal surfaces. It is a fiber laser, meaning the beam is generated by light being amplified and focused as it travels through a solid-state optical fiber doped with rare earth elements. Engineers designed this system specifically to shoot down drones, mortar rounds and other lightweight airborne threats.

On Dec. 2, Japan's Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA) confirmed in a statement that the laser system was installed on the JS Asuka test ship after arriving at one of Japan Marine United's shipyards. It was seen packed into two 40-foot (12-meter) domed modules.

The system will soon be sent to sea for its first trials under real maritime conditions. These are due to start after February 27, 2026, according to @AGChatch, a YouTube account that monitors Japanese naval technology.

The laser weapon has been in development since 2018, and a prototype was confirmed to have been delivered to ATLA by the manufacturer, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, in February 2023. Officials delivered a briefing upon its docking, saying that ""provided sufficient power, the system can continue to engage targets without running out of ammunition,"" according to The Asia Live.

They added that it boasts ""unlimited magazine depth,"" so the only limitation on its use is the amount of electricity available, and that its cost-per-shot is substantially lower than conventional air-defense systems. They also confirmed that the weapon was successful against mortar rounds and unmanned aerial vehicles in ground-based tests earlier this year.

ATLA's next goal is to carry out successful sea trials, where the laser will face tougher conditions like wind and moisture. It will have to keep its aim steady on a pitching deck while handling atmospheric scattering and reflections.

But there are more roadblocks for laser weapons like Japan's to overcome before they can reach the battlefield. Directed‑energy systems — those that damage targets with highly-focused energy instead of a solid projectile — often need lots of time to recharge between shots and demand substantial cooling and electrical power. Even in ideal conditions, fiber lasers typically only reach about 25% to 35% efficiency, and their energy requirements are especially challenging to accommodate on a ship.

According to The Asia Live, ATLA officials said that operational deployment is still years away, but this set of trials will help them evaluate whether an even more powerful laser could be used to intercept missiles in the future.

Japan now joins the U.S., France, Germany, and the U.K. on the list of nations confirmed to be developing a directed‑energy weapon. China is also suspected to be among them, after a photo emerged on social media of what appeared to be a laser on a Chinese amphibious transport dock in 2024.

—DARPA smashes wireless power record, beaming energy more than 5 miles away — and uses it to make popcorn

—Scientists uncover the secret to building Star Wars-style laser weapons — but don't worry, we won't have a Death Star anytime soon

Nevertheless, the only publicly scheduled deployment of a sea-based laser system is on vessels equipped with ""Aegis"" — an advanced naval defense platform ordered by Japan's Ministry of Defense, according to Naval News. These are expected to enter service after 2032.

Almost two years ago, the U.K. government announced that its system, dubbed ""DragonFire,"" had passed its first field test by shooting down several drones over the Hebrides off the coast of Scotland. Furthermore, in late 2024, Chinese scientists claimed to have created a new type of microwave weapon that could concentrate high-powered electromagnetic waves onto a target.

            There is no longer famine in Gaza, a United Nations-backed hunger monitor announced on Friday, after an influx of humanitarian aid into the strip following a ceasefire agreed in October between Israel and Hamas.
    


            “Following a significant reduction in conflict, a proposed peace plan, and improved access for both humanitarian and commercial food deliveries, food security conditions have improved in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said. “No areas are classified in Famine,” it added.
    


            The global watchdog had said in August that parts of Gaza are officially experiencing a “man-made” famine.
    


Famine confirmed in Gaza City, but that's not news to these Palestinians



            The organization noted, however, that despite these improvements, most of Gaza's population faced high levels of acute food insecurity.
    


            “Although humanitarian assistance, including food aid, has increased, only basic survival needs are being met,” the IPC said.
    


            While Gaza's classification has changed, the IPC warned that the risk of the enclave falling back into famine remains.
    


            “Under a worst-case scenario involving renewed hostilities and a halt in humanitarian and commercial inflows, North Gaza, Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah, and Khan Younis would face a risk of Famine through mid-April 2026,” it said.
    


            Israel in August heavily disputed that there was famine in Gaza, saying it was doing all it could to allow aid into the strip.
    


            In response to Friday's IPC report, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said: “In the face of the facts, even the IPC is forced to admit. There is no famine in Gaza,” adding that there are “hundreds” of aid trucks entering the strip every day.
    


            The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli agency tasked with facilitating aid distribution in Gaza, said that between 600-800 aid trucks enter the Gaza Strip every day, approximately 70% of which carry food.
    


            Hamas has previously disputed figures from COGAT, saying that not enough aid is making it into the enclave.
    


            CNN, along with other media outlets, has widely reported on hunger and starvation in Gaza. Before the ceasefire, during its two years of war, Israel has at times restricted or cut off the entry of aid to the ravaged enclave.
    


            While some people have died of starvation and hunger, others have been killed trying to receive aid at distribution sites.
    


            August was the first time the IPC had confirmed famine in the Middle East. Under the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met.
    


            Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished or 15% of children suffering from acute malnutrition based on body measurements, and at least two in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.

The EU's plan to steal Russian assets held in the bloc in order to fund Ukraine's military and prolong its disastrous war has failed to get the backing of bloc leaders. The other key EU summit pillar – approving a contentious trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur – was also aborted at the last minute amid chaotic protests by several-thousand farmers in the Belgian capital.

Following some 16 hours of talks, during which the deep divisions within the bloc were exacerbated by legislative overreach pushed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and her compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Council discussions ended without agreement on the controversial proposal to use frozen Russian assets to finance a €90 billion ($105 billion) loan aimed at allowing Kiev to continue its military campaign.

Instead, member states agreed to raise common debt – borrowing on the capital markets – to finance Kiev in the short term while “technical aspects of the reparations loan are worked out,” according to European Council President Antonio Costa.

“We have a deal,” Costa wrote on X around 3am, without addressing the funding mechanism behind the package. Merz similarly glossed over the bloc's failure to back the loan with frozen Russian assets, insisting that “Ukraine will receive an interest-free loan of €90 billion, as I suggested.”

Moscow has already initiated arbitration proceedings against Euroclear, the Belgian-based clearing house that holds some €180 billion of Russian funds, and during the talks in Brussels announced that it had widened the case to include “European banks,” increasing the risk to European lenders of backing the plan.

Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever was at the center of the disagreement, though his opposition to the plan to steal Russian assets was supported by Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Hungary's Viktor Orban, Slovakia's Robert Fico, and the Czech Republic's Andrej Babis. The latter three reportedly tabled an option for EU members to provide joint debt for Ukraine instead – exempting their countries from the idea but also pledging not to veto it.

Merz and von der Leyen are thought to have rejected that plan, and instead insisted on more a dangerous option to steal Russia's assets and attempt to give Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky enough money to keep fighting for two more years. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk put it ahead of the meeting, “either money today or blood tomorrow.”

Without the EU war chest, Zelensky faces a short-term economic crisis. Ukraine needs some €72 billion to repay a G7 loan and stay afloat fiscally.

Following the EU Council's failure to endorse the Merz/von der Leyen war option, the bloc has effectively denied itself the “seat at the table” hosting Ukraine peace talks that it was demanding since the US took the diplomatic initiative.

Attention will now turn to a meeting between US and Russian delegations in Miami, and to US President Donald Trump's call for peace by Christmas.

Prime Minister Mark Carney on Parliament Hill on Thursday.Blair Gable/Reuters

Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled a long-awaited shuffle of deputy ministers that places new people in charge of the government's priority files in areas such as economic growth and national defence. 

The government is bringing in two outsiders to key positions: Marie-Josée Hogue, who headed the public inquiry into foreign interference in Canadian politics, to Justice; and John McArthur, a policy expert on sustainable development, as a senior adviser in the Privy Council Office. 

Friday's announcement places 12 new people in senior deputy minister-level positions, either in charge of federal departments or as senior officials in the PCO.

Eight senior officials are listed as retiring.

Carney taps Marc Miller as Culture Minister in cabinet shuffle

While most of the names taking on new roles are career public servants, Ms. Hogue's appointment was a surprise.

Ms. Hogue, a puisne judge of the Court of Appeal of Quebec, enters government as the new deputy minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Canada.

The shuffle was orchestrated by Privy Council Clerk Michael Sabia, whom the Prime Minister recruited from the private sector. Mr. Sabia previously served as the CEO of Hydro-Québec, BCE and Quebec's pension fund.

He is also a former federal deputy minister, having led the Finance Department from 2020 to 2023.

Chris Forbes, who was deputy minister at Finance, has been moved to the PCO as a senior adviser. He is being replaced by Nick Leswick, a senior official at the Bank of Canada, which Mr. Carney once headed.

Mr. Leswick previously led Finance Canada on an interim basis after Mr. Sabia left the position in 2023.

Opinion: Mark Carney faces a gap year in 2026

Prior to that, Mr. Leswick was associate deputy minister at Finance, a position that involved regular appearances before parliamentary committees to answer questions from MPs and senators about budgetary matters.

Christiane Fox, the deputy clerk at the PCO, is the new deputy minister at National Defence. She replaces Stefanie Beck, who is among the eight officials who are retiring.

Heading into a year in which negotiations with First Nations on major projects such as pipelines and critical mineral mines will be key to the government's agenda, the Prime Minister promoted Michelle Kovacevic, associate deputy minister of Indigenous Services, to deputy minister.

As for Mr. McArthur, Mr. Carney recruited him from the Brookings Institution's Center for Sustainable Development to become deputy secretary to the cabinet on economic policy.

He is a former CEO of Millennium Promise Alliance, an international non-governmental organization.

Earlier this year, he co-edited a book at Brookings titled For the World's Profit: How Business Can Support Sustainable Development.

Opinion: 2025 will rank as one of Canada's great nation-building years

He has also been a member of a deputy minister steering committee that guides the federal government's Policy Horizons Canada team, an in-house policy research organization.

Other new appointments include Francis Bilodeau, moving from associate deputy minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to deputy minister of Canadian Heritage; Isabelle Mondou, moving from deputy minister of Canadian Heritage to deputy clerk of the Privy Council and associate secretary to the cabinet; Alison O'Leary, who was associate deputy minister at Finance Canada, becomes deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs at the PCO; Greg Orencsak, the deputy minister of Health, moves to deputy minister at Natural Resources Canada; and Rob Wright, the associate deputy minister at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, becomes deputy minister of Labour.

The government announcement said additional changes to the senior ranks of the public service will be announced early in the new year.

The European Court of Justice ruled that Poland's Constitutional Court breached EU law and judicial independence, reigniting a dispute over measures to remake the judiciary by the former government.

Poland's Constitutional Tribunal has breached core principles of European Union (EU) law, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Thursday.

The court also found the tribunal cannot be considered independent or impartial because of serious irregularities in the appointment of judges.

The tribunal, dominated by judges appointed under the former nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government, had previously declared Poland's constitution superior to EU law , ignoring ECJ decissions and case law.

The case stems from two 2021 Polish tribunal rulings rejecting ECJ decisions as unconstitutional, claiming the ECJ overstepped by interfering in Poland's judiciary.

Brussels challenged those rulings, and the current pro-European government says it does not recognize them.

On Thursday, the ECJ ruled that Poland cannot disregard binding EU values, which all member states must uphold.

The court also criticized the way three of the judges and the tribunal's president were appointed under the former ruling party.

PiS drastically transformed the country's justice system, establishing political control over top courts such as the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Court.

The PiS lost power with the election of pro-European Prime Minister Donald Tusk in 2023, but his government has so far failed to roll back the changes, blocked by two subsequent nationalist presidents who support the PiS overhaul of courts.

On Thursday, Justice Minister Waldemar Zurek wrote on social media that the ECJ judgment obliged the state to take action, and the government was prepared to act.

The tribunal itself said the judgment had no impact on its functioning and that the European court had no authority over it.

STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Federal investigators sifting through the wreckage of a business jet that crashed in North Carolina and killed retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his family, and three others are trying to figure out who was flying the plane and what caused it to return to the airport soon after takeoff.

The Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground Thursday, killing all seven on board. It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, but crashed less than 10 minutes later while trying to return and land, authorities said.

Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were at the airport trying to determine the cause of the crash and why the plane returned to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.

Federal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters, and single- and multi-engine planes. Also on board was Dennis Dutton. Two people appear in a federal database of pilot licenses under that name. The crash also killed Dutton's son, Jack, and Biffle's friend Craig Wadsworth. 

Biffle's wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, were also killed in the crash, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.

“Each of them meant everything to us, and their absence leaves an immeasurable void in our lives,” the joint family statement said.




Cristina Biffle's mother told People magazine that her daughter sent her a text message saying, “We're in trouble,” before she didn't hear from her again.

Greg Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002. 

NASCAR called Biffle “a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many.”

“His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport,” NASCAR said.

A memorial with flowers sprouted up Friday by Biffle's marble star in his hometown of Mooresville, honoring him as a member of the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. 

In 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.

“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That's who the Biffles were,” U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.

Wadsworth was Biffle's friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.

“He didn't know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several NASCAR teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”

The joint family statement also spoke about Dutton and his son Jack, saying they were “deeply loved as well, and their loss is felt by all who knew them.”

The Statesville airport remained closed Friday while the NTSB performed its investigation, a city spokesperson said.

A Wisconsin jury found Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan guilty Thursday on a federal charge of obstructing a proceeding before a U.S. department or agency. 

Dugan was accused of helping an illegal immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in April, while he was in her courthouse for battery charges. She was accused of guiding Flores-Ruiz to a non-public exit in the building in order to evade authorities while directing ICE officers to speak to the chief judge. 

Dugan was also found not guilty on a lesser misdemeanor charge of “concealing an individual from discovery and arrest,” reported Wisconsin's WISN-12. 

Dugan's legal representatives maintained her innocence, citing that her being found guilty on only one charge, instead of both, is a reflection of her innocence, which they will continue to fight for in court. 

“While we are disappointed in today's outcome, the failure of the prosecution to secure convictions on both counts demonstrates the opportunity we have to clear Judge Dugan's name and show she did nothing wrong in this matter,” Dugan's defense team said in a prepared statement. “We have planned for this potential outcome and our defense of Judge Dugan is just beginning. This trial required considerable resources to prepare for and public support for Judge Dugan's defense fund is critical as we prepare for the next phase of this defense.”

Dugan's case initially drew a lot of attention when it occurred. Many Democratic politicians loudly criticized Dugan's arrest at the time and blasted President Donald Trump for doing so, claiming it was an example of aggressive governance and political overreach, with some even stating it was an example of Trump acting like a king.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) called Dugan's arrest “gravely serious,” “lawless behavior,” and asserted that “we do not have kings in this country.”

“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” said Baldwin in a statement on April 25. “The President's administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power.” 

“Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by,” Baldwin said. “By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President's lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress's checks on his power.”

Gov. Tony Evers (D-WI) at the time was also critical of Dugan's arrest, blasting Trump's actions and comments.

JUDGE HANNAH DUGAN'S TRIAL FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ESCAPE CASE BEGINS WITH FBI AGENT ON THE STAND

“In this country, people who are suspected of criminal wrongdoing are innocent until their guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt and they are found guilty by a jury of their peers — this is the fundamental demand of justice in America,” Evers said at the time. 

“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” the Democratic governor added. 

The maximum penalty for Dugan is reportedly five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Dugan's lawyers said they would appeal the conviction. No sentencing date has been set at the present time.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Bitcoin BTC$87,208.13 bulls are fighting to break on Friday what's been a consistent pattern of sell pressure during U.S. hours.

Dipping below $85,000 late on Thursday afternoon, BTC once again climbed after U.S. markets closed, pushing back above $89,000 they opened Friday morning. That level, though, has roughly capped every attempt of a breakout throughout the week, with sellers hammering prices back to square one  — sometimes within minutes and sometimes over the course of a few hours.

The largest crypto for the moment is holding fairly steady ahead of the pre-holiday weekend, trading at $88,400, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

Ether ETH$2,965.32 bounced to just shy of $3,000, up 1% over the past day, while Solana's SOL SOL$124.50 and SUI$1.4465 lead the overnight rebound among altcoins.

U.S. equities are having another strong session, led by the Nasdaq's 1% gain, with AI bellwethers Nvidia, Oracle and AMD rising 3%-6%.

Digital asset-related stocks followed suit in the rebound. Ethereum treasury firm BitMine (BMNR) advanced almost 8%, while Galaxy Digital (GLXY) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) were each up around 3%.  

Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, also bounced more than 3%, pushing its multiple to net asset value (mNAV) to 1.09.

Meanwhile, BitDigital (BTBT) is up 10% following news related to WhiteFibre (WYFI), has signed a 10-year, 40MW colocation agreement with Nscale, valued at approximately $865 million. BitDigial owns roughly 70% of WhiteFibre (itself ahead 11%), amplifying the positive impact on BTBT shares.

By Joe Wilkins




					Published

After a year of record gains for the crypto industry, recent forces have sent itinto a tailspin. Bitcoin, for example, reached dazzling heights of more than $120,000 in October — before crashing back down to around $88,000 today, about 12 percent down from where it was a year ago.

While that might be bad news for crypto bros or Robinhood day traders, one economist argues that the decline is actually good news for the rest of us.

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Dean Baker argued in his blog Beat The Press this week that as the major cryptocurrencies fall, purchasing power for the rest of us goes up. In his analysis, he compares crypto to counterfeit currency — fake money that allows shady gangs to buy up all kinds of scarce goods, like houses and sports tickets. 

When they buy up those goods with funny money, they help drive prices up, making them less affordable for those of us who don't play the game.

“If some supersleuth detective figured out a way to recognize the counterfeit bills, they could then remove trillions of dollars of fake money from circulation,” Baker explains. “This would benefit the general public by reducing demand in the economy and reversing the run-up in the price of housing and Superbowl tickets. It is the same story with plunging crypto prices.” 

From this reading, crypto — which infamously has no real value — allows people to suck up “large chunks” of the economy with a currency that's built on thin air. When their share of fake money shrinks, it eases pressure on the rest of us. “To put it simply: there's more for everyone else,” Baker explains.

We're not talking small, intangible changes, either. By Baker's count, the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium have shed over $1.2 trillion in market cap, or “enough to send every household in the United States a check for $10,000.”

In his thinking, everybody who doesn't own it should be cheering for crypto's ongoing downfall to continue.

“The only possible impact of lower crypto prices on production is that we will make less crypto,” says Baker. “The horror! The horror!”

Just a few weeks after the Fusaka update, Ethereum ETHUSD developers have revealed the name for the next major upgrade in 2026. According to insights shared by Wu Blockchain, developers in the ecosystem have voted to name this next update ""Hegota."" 

What Hegota upgrade's name represents

Notably, the name Hegota merges ""Bogota"" and ""Heze,"" which are two different Ethereum layers. Bogota is the execution layer for running transactions and smart contracts, while Heze is the consensus layer. The Hegota upgrade will come after Glamsterdam.

Typically, Ethereum upgrades its network twice a year, with the current Glamsterdam set to run earlier in 2026.

Although the details of these upcoming upgrades are still unclear, they will focus on state management, execution-layer optimization and Verkle Trees.

Ethereum developers named the post-Glamsterdam 2026 upgrade “Hegota,” combining execution-layer Bogota and consensus-layer Heze. Hegota will follow Glamsterdam later in 2026 as part of Ethereum's twice-yearly upgrade cadence, with potential focus areas including Verkle Trees,…

The state management will improve how the Ethereum network tracks account balances, smart contracts and data over time. Execution-layer optimization will focus on making transactions and smart contracts faster and more efficient.

Meanwhile, Ethereum also hopes to reduce how much data the nodes need to store using the Verkle Trees. This is with a view to ensuring that the network is lighter and easier to run.

The overall goal of this planned upgrade in 2026 is to make Ethereum more scalable, efficient and easier to operate, particularly for node operators. Additionally, it is part of the customary maintenance for long-term network health.

How Ethereum's upgrade path supports long-term scalability

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin, before the release of the Fusaka upgrade, explained that it would be powered by peer-to-peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS). 

The goal was to address the growing volume of data associated with downloads.

Buterin noted that some of the technology involved in the Fusaka upgrade is still novel. Hence, the planned upgrade in 2026 might also improve on the current state of affairs with the chain.

Meanwhile, on the crypto market, Ethereum is still battling volatility as it changes hands at $2,959.35, which represents a 0.38% decline in the last 24 hours.

African Blockchain Festival 2025: from fashion to farming, blockchain provides foundational infrastructure across Africa

While much of the western financial world remains preoccupied with blockchain as a vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and speculative assets, a more consequential narrative is emerging from Africa. In November, the 2025 Africa Blockchain Festival in Kigali, Rwanda served as a testament to the continent's ambition to reposition blockchain technology from a financial instrument to a foundational tool for social and economic integrity.

The festival convened over 1,600 policy-makers, regulators, innovators and investors, and moved decisively beyond theoretical discussions to showcase tangible applications addressing systemic challenges.

The vision presented was clear: Africa is leveraging blockchain not to replicate existing financial systems, but to build new frameworks of trust, transparency and inclusion. These frameworks span key sectors such as public service delivery, trade facilitation, digital identity and creative industries, where gaps in credibility, verification and coordination continue to constrain economic activity. Critically, ABF did not rely solely on talk.

The festival's live hackathon – Project Ubuntu Hackathon (powered by Web3Bridge) – offered a practical pathway for translating ideas into prototypes. Developers from across Africa competed to build real-world blockchain (and artificial intelligence-integrated) solutions, with final demonstrations taking place during the festival. This end-to-end approach – from ideation, build, demo and potential funding – reflects a shift in both technical maturity and policy expectations. Blockchain is no longer just a concept: it is code, deployable now to address problems in production, trade and creation beyond finance.

Reimagining supply chains

The dialogue in Kigali highlighted how blockchain's capacity for immutable, verifiable record-keeping is being harnessed far beyond finance. In the fashion industry, where ethical sourcing and authenticity are increasingly important to global consumers, African innovators are deploying blockchain technology to track materials from raw commodity to finished garment. This provides an unforgeable product pedigree, allowing brands to prove sustainable and ethical practices while combatting counterfeit goods – a compelling value proposition for both conscious consumers and international investors.

A similar logic is being applied to agriculture, a cornerstone of many African economies. Here, blockchain is being piloted to revolutionise commodity trading and food safety. By recording every step of a crop's journey – from the smallholder farmer's plot through processing to export – the technology creates an unbroken chain of custody. This not only ensures farmers receive fair payment by verifying their contribution but also provides international buyers and investors with unprecedented transparency, mitigating risk and building confidence in African supply chains.

Empowering creators and protecting patients

The festival also illuminated blockchain's role in rebalancing power in favour of artists and individuals. In the music and creative industries, smart contracts on blockchain platforms are being designed to automatically distribute royalties to artists, composers and producers. This system disintermediates traditional, often opaque, rights management structures, ensuring creators are paid fairly and promptly. For Africa's vibrant cultural exports, this could represent a shift away from long-standing power asymmetries between creators on the continent and labels and producers typically based in Europe or the US.

Perhaps one of the most socially impactful applications discussed was in healthcare. In regions where centralised health data systems can be fragile or susceptible to breaches, blockchain offers a structural alternative for patient information management. A decentralised model gives patients control over their own health records, granting permissioned access to different providers. This not only secures sensitive data from tampering but also creates a continuous, accurate medical history, improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes while maintaining rigorous patient privacy.

Building systems over speculation

The focus on applied problem-solving marks a distinct departure from the dominant narrative in many advanced economies. While the West often concentrates on blockchain technology for refining high-frequency trading, complex derivatives or digital currencies, Africa is advancing blockchain as a tool to solve foundational global problems: monitoring food supply chains, ensuring ethical production, or protecting intellectual property.

The launch of research group ABF Labs at the festival institutionalises this mission. It aims to function as a year-round policy think tank and venture studio, specifically designed to bridge the gap between public sector challenges, regulators and private sector technical solutions in these critical, non-financial domains.

The imperative for global co-operation

The most promising applications of blockchain in Africa are not merely local fixes but blueprints for global challenges. Investing in and partnering with these ventures offers a dual benefit: achieving substantial impact for mutualising transformative work that challenges existing power dynamics and secondly, advancing technological innovation that builds verifiable trust and transparency.

The festival spotlighted a continent that is not just catching up with technological trends but is actively pioneering a more holistic and human-centric application of blockchain. By focusing on agriculture, health, creative rights and supply-chain integrity, Africa is positioning distributed ledger technology as the bedrock for a more equitable and transparent global economy – a lesson in innovation that resonates far beyond its borders.

Bitcoin traded lower on Friday as the cryptocurrency market remained subdued amid tight liquidity and cautious global risk sentiment. The world's largest cryptocurrency was priced around $87,700 (roughly Rs. 79.18 lakh), easing from higher levels seen earlier in the week as investors stayed defensive ahead of key central bank decisions. Ethereum (ETH) traded near $2,900 (roughly Rs. 2.66 lakh), consolidating after recent gains as traders balanced improving inflation data against uneven liquidity conditions.

While softer inflation has improved the broader macro backdrop, follow-through buying remained limited, keeping both Bitcoin and Ethereum largely range-bound. Bitcoin is priced near Rs. 79.18 lakh in India, while Ethereum trades around Rs. 2.66 lakh, as per the Gadgets 360 price tracker.

Market sentiment remained cautious during the session as investors reacted to mixed global cues. Unclear interest-rate direction from major central banks, tight liquidity conditions, and lingering uncertainty around upcoming policy decisions limited risk appetite. 

Altcoins continued to underperform amid the lack of strong directional catalysts. Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $844 (roughly Rs. 76,000), while Solana (SOL) was priced at $124 (roughly Rs. 11,180). XRP hovered around $1.86 (roughly Rs. 168), and Dogecoin (DOGE) traded close to $0.13 (roughly Rs. 11.5).

Commenting on Ethereum's recent performance and investor positioning, Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder and CEO of Pi42, said, “Ethereum's rally highlights confidence in its long-term role as a settlement and application layer, yet investors should approach allocations with a selective and risk-managed mindset [...] Maintaining diversification and predefined risk limits remains essential as volatility continues to define crypto markets.”

Providing a near-term outlook for Bitcoin, Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst at Mudrex, said improving inflation data has helped stabilise sentiment despite recent pullbacks. “Inflation at multi-year lows improves the macro backdrop, while technical indicators show Bitcoin entering deeply oversold territory, levels that have often led to meaningful rebounds [...] With markets focused on the Bank of Japan's upcoming rate decision, the $84,000 zone (roughly Rs. 75.80 lakh) stands out as a critical level for BTC to hold as it attempts to regain upside momentum.”

Overall, the crypto market remains in a consolidation phase, with Bitcoin and Ethereum acting as relative anchors amidst ongoing macro uncertainty. Analysts said a clearer interest-rate outlook, improved liquidity conditions, and sustained institutional participation will be key to any meaningful upside. At the same time, the broader altcoin market may continue to remain defensive in the near term.

Bitcoin BTC$87,208.13 bulls are fighting to break on Friday what's been a consistent pattern of sell pressure during U.S. hours.

Dipping below $85,000 late on Thursday afternoon, BTC once again climbed after U.S. markets closed, pushing back above $89,000 they opened Friday morning. That level, though, has roughly capped every attempt of a breakout throughout the week, with sellers hammering prices back to square one  — sometimes within minutes and sometimes over the course of a few hours.

The largest crypto for the moment is holding fairly steady ahead of the pre-holiday weekend, trading at $88,400, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

Ether ETH$2,965.32 bounced to just shy of $3,000, up 1% over the past day, while Solana's SOL SOL$124.50 and SUI$1.4465 lead the overnight rebound among altcoins.

U.S. equities are having another strong session, led by the Nasdaq's 1% gain, with AI bellwethers Nvidia, Oracle and AMD rising 3%-6%.

Digital asset-related stocks followed suit in the rebound. Ethereum treasury firm BitMine (BMNR) advanced almost 8%, while Galaxy Digital (GLXY) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) were each up around 3%.  

Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, also bounced more than 3%, pushing its multiple to net asset value (mNAV) to 1.09.

Meanwhile, BitDigital (BTBT) is up 10% following news related to WhiteFibre (WYFI), has signed a 10-year, 40MW colocation agreement with Nscale, valued at approximately $865 million. BitDigial owns roughly 70% of WhiteFibre (itself ahead 11%), amplifying the positive impact on BTBT shares.

Microsoft and NASA say they're applying artificial intelligence to a challenge that has become all too pressing in the past couple of weeks: how to cope with flooding and other nightmares brought about by extreme weather events.

The result of their efforts is Hydrology Copilot, a set of AI agents aimed at making hydrological data easier to access and analyze. The platform is built on the foundation established for NASA Earth Copilot, a cloud-based AI tool that can sift through quadrillions of bytes of the space agency's Earth science data.

Hydrology is the scientific study of Earth's water cycle, which encompasses precipitation, runoff, evaporation and the movement of water through rivers and lakes and soil. It's not just an academic exercise: Hydrologic insights are put to use in fields ranging from agriculture to forestry to urban development.

“NASA has long produced advanced hydrology and land-surface datasets, powering breakthroughs in drought early-warning systems, environmental planning and environmental research,” Juan Carlos López, a senior solution specialist at Microsoft who focuses on space and AI, wrote in a blog post. “Yet despite their value, these datasets and the specialized tools required to navigate and interpret them remain difficult to access for many who could benefit most.”

That's where Hydrology Copilot comes in: The platform, which is powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and Microsoft Foundry, lets researchers and others query NASA's data using straightforward questions — for example, “Which regions may be facing elevated flood risk?”

Hydrology Copilot simplifies access to one of NASA's most advanced hydrology datasets, the North American Land Data Assimilation System Version 3. NLDAS-3 matches up satellite measurements with state-of-the-art computer models to present a detailed, continuously updated, continental-scale view of the water cycle.

The dataset can provide a wealth of insights for drought monitoring, agricultural planning, water resource management, flood risk assessment and emergency preparedness. This month's flooding in Western Washington, brought on by an onslaught of storm systems, shows how important it can be to gain such insights — and how useful Hydrology Copilot can be.

“The goal of this project is to provide the tools that can enable local officials, city planners and emergency responders more easily understand weather patterns and better prepare for the types of hydrological events we are seeing now in the Pacific Northwest and around the world, and will likely continue to see in the future,” a Microsoft spokesperson told GeekWire in an emailed statement.

Hydrology Copilot is still under development, and is being used primarily by researchers for now. Microsoft's Azure AI team can provide further information about the platform. To take a test spin through other, more publicly accessible hydrology datasets, check out King County's Hydrologic Information Center and the interactive map provided by the National Water Prediction Service.

Celeste Amadon and Asher Allen were working on an app that used AI to book restaurants for dates when they stumbled on a bigger idea that encourages people to meet in person. And now it's catching on with investors.

The duo created a voice-powered AI onboarding system for its app that helped them learn more about users without them having to fill out a form. What they discovered: People loved to talk, and that increased the length of the onboarding session with the app clocking 26 minutes on average. That is how San Francisco-based dating startup Known was born. 

“Our take is that for the first time, we could know enough about somebody to serve them a date that would make sense. And if we could do that much faster with less rejection rate, we could create a user experience that could get people out on more dates,” she said.

And early results suggested they were on to something. 

In its test phase in San Francisco, Known said it observed 80% of its introductions led to physical dates, which is much higher than swipe-based dating apps. Buoyed by these signals, the startup has raised $9.7 million from investors, including Forerunner and NFX, along with Pear VC and Coelius Capital. Notably, this is the first dating app investment for Forerunner.

“Celeste is a really thoughtful founder to understand the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female, to be honest. There are other people who can be focused on the male demographic, but she is focused on the young female who has a lot of unspoken desires and needs that, if you put them in a profile, they would never say, this versus that. And I think in a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker,” Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner, told TechCrunch.

Amadon said she has always been very interested in social impact at scale and thinks dating is inherently one of the biggest problems facing her generation. 

“There's been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it's our generation's largest problem,” said Amadon, who, along with Allen, dropped out of Stanford to build the startup. 

The app, which is under testing in San Francisco in beta, uses voice AI-powered onboarding to ask several questions to users without having them fill out any forms. Amadon said because of this modality, the startup is able to know more about users and provide them with great matches, with one user's onboarding clocking in at an hour and 38 minutes. 

When people typed their responses out, they would edit them, according to Known. With voice, the onboarding is more personable. The company's AI can ask dynamic follow-ups based on the conversation. For instance, if someone has newly moved to the city, AI can ask them what they like and dislike about their experience thus far.

Once the onboarding is complete, the AI suggests potential matches to users. They can ask AI agents about those profiles. If they like a profile, they can tap on “interested.” When two people are matched, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and 24 hours to agree to a date. The company said that with this mechanism, the app is trying to avoid lingering chats and ghosting while encouraging people to meet in real life. After their dates, users can provide their feedback to AI and get more refined recommendations for matches.

Known hasn't completely ditched the restaurant idea. The app also helps in picking restaurants based on user likes and dislikes. Using the AI chat and calendar integrations, users can also inform about their availability for the first dates. In the beta phase, the company charged $30 per successful date. However, the startup is not set on the price and said it will experiment with different models to find out what payment modality works the best.

Today the startup has three full-time engineers and four people working on go-to-market, with several contractors working in all areas. Amadon, whose previous experience includes internships in politics, and Allen, who worked on product at AI-powered online shopping app Phia, plan to bolster headcount with this fundraiser. 

Known is currently testing in San Francisco and plans to launch early next year.

There are several other new startups, including Overtone, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod's new app, that are trying to use AI to know more about users and try to find matches for them. Some of them want to claim that they are bringing bespoke services of matchmakers that cost thousands of dollars at a fraction of the cost. Incumbents like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are also pushing AI features to keep their user base engaged. Despite the growing number of startups, Amadon is happy with the competition.

“When it comes to other startup dating products, I've been so happy to see a lot of people building in the space because I think it shows that it's time to shift away from a swipe-based model. And I think most of them that I've seen have been pretty different from what we're building at Known,” She said.

As the U.S. races against China to land astronauts on the Moon, two American spaceflight titans are locked in their own competition to secure NASA's victory. The agency's new chief just sounded the starter's gun.

Jared Isaacman was sworn in as NASA's 15th administrator on Thursday. The pilot, two-time commercial astronaut, and tech billionaire is under enormous pressure to get the agency back on track after a year of uncertainty while also ensuring that the U.S. wins the new space race. On his first day on the job, he told Bloomberg TV that he's going to let competition between SpaceX and Blue Origin propel NASA back to the Moon.

“I don't think it was lost on either vendor that whichever lander was available first to ensure that America achieves its strategic objectives on the Moon is the one we were going to go with,” Isaacman said.

SpaceX and Blue Origin, led by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, respectively, are developing landers designed to carry astronauts to the lunar surface. The first NASA mission to do so will be Artemis 3, which is now slated to launch sometime in 2028 after being pushed back several times.

The latest delay is largely due to stagnant progress on SpaceX's crew lander—the Starship Human Landing System (HLS)—which NASA contracted for Artemis 3 back in 2021. In October, Acting Administrator Sean Duffy opened up the contract to other companies in an attempt to spur competition and accelerate lander development. Since then, Blue Origin has emerged as the worthiest opponent for SpaceX.

Blue has spent the past two years building its crew lander for the Artemis 5 mission, which aims to land two NASA astronauts on the lunar surface in 2030. The company has taken a two-pronged approach to lander development, working on both cargo- and crew-rated versions of its Blue Moon spacecraft.

The cargo lander, Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1), is expected to perform a demonstration landing on the lunar surface in early 2026. If it succeeds, this will pave the way for the crew-rated Blue Moon Mark 2 (MK2), which could replace SpaceX's Starship HLS as the Artemis 3 lander.

The risk of losing the Artemis 3 contract lit a fire under SpaceX. After Duffy opened it up to other vendors, the company presented NASA with a simplified mission architecture but still said it probably won't be able to land astronauts on the Moon until 2028.

Isaacman intends to keep stoking that fire. Dangling the Artemis 3 carrot in front of two industry leaders is exactly the type of strategy he believes will usher NASA into a new era of commercial partnership and accelerated innovation. He plans to run NASA more like a business than a bureaucracy, leaning heavily on private companies to expedite the agency's goals.

The competition between SpaceX and Blue Origin will serve as a proof of concept for this strategy—and one with very high stakes. On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order committing the U.S. to a crewed lunar landing by 2028. With this deadline looming, both companies are under serious pressure to get their landers off the ground.

Neither Matt Damon nor James Cameron is hurting for wealth or fame, so their polite public disagreement over Damon's supposed near-miss with Cameron's Avatar franchise is already pretty silly to consider. The one thing that lines up with their stories is that at some point during Cameron's multi-year process of putting together the first Avatar film, he thought Damon might be a good fit for the lead role.

The Hollywood Reporter surfaced a two-year-old video of Damon explaining, “Jim Cameron offered me 10 percent of Avatar,” and—in a sort of “Will Smith talks about passing on The Matrix” sort of way—that “you will never meet an actor who turned down more money than me.”

To hear Damon tell it, he had to say “no” because at the time he was committed to “the Bourne movie.” The first installment in that series, The Bourne Identity, was released in 2002; Damon also starred in installments that hit theaters in 2004 and 2007 ahead of Avatar‘s 2009 release.

He recalled Cameron as being “lovely” and saying to him, “This movie doesn't really need you; it doesn't need a movie star at all.” (Sam Worthington was eventually cast as main character Jake Sully.)

And he doubled down on the money detail, reiterating that Cameron promised him “10 percent of the movie” if he agreed. Avatar, of course, went on to earn nearly $3 billion worldwide, still a record-setting amount; the first sequel, The Way of Water, racked up well over $2 billion, and Fire and Ash looks to add to the pile when it opens December 19.

However, Cameron tells THR he has a different memory of that long-ago conversation.

“He was never offered the part,” Cameron said. There was a phone call where they discussed their shared desire to work together, but Avatar wasn't going to fit the bill because of Damon's Bourne scheduling conflicts, and Cameron recalled that it ended there.

“Now what he's done is he's extrapolated ‘I get 10 percent of the gross on all my films'… if, in his mind, that's what it would've taken for him to do it, then it wouldn't have happened.”

However, Cameron at least views Damon's tale with amusement, saying with the record now set straight in Cameron's mind, Damon “doesn't have to beat himself up anymore” about the lucrative payday he believes he missed out on. Also, for what it's worth, Cameron said he'd still love to work with Damon on a future project someday.

LG has clarified how Microsoft Copilot appears on its webOS smart TVs following recent coverage that described the feature as a non-removable app bundled into the operating system. According to the company, Copilot is not installed as a native application and does not run as an embedded service within webOS.

In a statement provided to Tom's Hardware, Chris De Maria, Director of Public Relations at LG Electronics North America, said the Copilot presence on LG TVs is implemented as a shortcut icon designed to improve accessibility. When selected, the icon opens Microsoft's Copilot website through the TV's built-in web browser rather than launching a dedicated app.

This changes how Copilot interacts with the TV. LG says features such as microphone input are not enabled by default and are only activated after a user explicitly grants permission through the browser interface. In other words, the shortcut behaves in the same way as manually navigating to Microsoft's site using the webOS browser, rather than operating with deeper access to the operating system.

LG also acknowledged concerns around user choice. De Maria said, “LG Electronics respects consumer choice and will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish,” addressing complaints that the Copilot tile appeared on home screens without a clear option to remove it. LG has not yet shared a timeline for when or how that change will roll out.

The clarification follows reports from users who noticed the Copilot tile appearing after recent webOS updates on select LG TV models. Those reports raised questions about whether LG had begun preinstalling third-party AI services at the OS level, particularly given Microsoft's broader push to integrate Copilot across Windows, browsers, and consumer devices at the behest of CEO Satya Nadella. He recently made headlines after warning executives that those who don't embrace AI within Microsoft must leave the company.

LG's explanation suggests a more limited implementation, at least for now. By keeping Copilot confined to a browser shortcut, the company avoids deeper integration with webOS services, data, or system resources. It is not currently known whether additional Copilot integrations are planned for the Linux-based webOS or whether similar shortcuts could appear for other web-based services in future updates.

For now, the company says its intent is to balance convenience with user control and to give owners the ability to decide whether the Copilot shortcut remains on their TVs.

Limitations of use: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus

 

Indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype in patients aged ≥12 years 

100 mg SC every 6 months

Limitations of use: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus 

Upper respiratory tract infection (9%)

Allergic rhinitis (6%)

Influenza (5%)

Arthralgia (4%)

Pharyngitis (4%)

Injection site reactions (1%)

None

Available data from clinical trials use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes

There are risks to mother and fetus associated with asthma in pregnancy

Placental transport of endogenous IgG antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (eg, depemokimab) increases as pregnancy progresses and peaks during in third trimester

Impact of the amino acid substitution within depemokimab on placental transfer is uncertain; however, presence of this substitution may lead to prolonged and increased in utero exposure to infant

No treatment-related effects on embryofetal or postnatal development have been shown in animal studies targeting IL-5 signaling pathways

Pregnant women exposed or their healthcare providers, should report exposure by calling 1-888-825-5249

There are no data on presence of depemokimab in either human or animal milk, effects on breastfed infants, or effects on milk production

However, depemokimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1] kappa), and maternal IgG is present in human milk in small amounts

Effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and extent of systemic exposure in breastfed infants are unknown

A: Generally acceptable. Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.

Humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin 5 (IL-5)

Depemokimab contains a triple amino acid substitution (YTE) in fragment crystallizable (Fc) region which increases binding to neonatal Fc receptor and thereby extends elimination half-life

IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils

Inflammation is an important component in pathogenesis of asthma

Multiple cell types (eg, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (eg, histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) are involved in inflammation

By inhibiting IL-5 signaling, production and survival of eosinophils are reduced; however, a precise mechanism of action in asthma has not been definitively established

Peak plasma time: ~14 days

Estimated average steady-state plasma concentration over single dosing interval: 6.16 mcg/mL

Trough (Week 26): ~1.3 mcg/mL

Vd: 6.3 L

Expected to be metabolized into small peptides and amino acids by catabolic pathways

Half-life: 48 days

Clearance: 0.092 L/day

 December 19, 2025  

Pediatricians, psychologists, mental health professionals, and media scholars have criticized Australia's new ban on social media use for children younger than 16 years. An open letter from more than 140 academics and organizations argued that the ban was “too blunt an instrument” that affected young people's rights to access and participation, did not improve safety standards on platforms, and would be difficult to implement and enforce.

Other organizations, including the Australian College of Mental Health Nurses and the Australian Psychological Society, raised concerns that the ban could exclude young people from communities and peers, mental health resources, and support, as well as increase their social isolation.

The ban, which is the first in the world, prevents younger teenagers from accessing a range of leading platforms, including Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. As of December 10, 2025, social media platforms have the responsibility to implement age-verification processes to prevent people younger than 16 years from creating or keeping accounts on the platforms.

In a speech to the Australian parliament introducing the proposed law on November 21, 2024, federal minister for communications Michelle Rowland said the move was “about protecting young people — not punishing or isolating them — and letting parents know we're in their corner when it comes to supporting their children's health and well-being.” She stated that the ban was just one step that the government should take to protect young people.

“What hasn't been taken into full consideration is the benefits that have been derived from social media for this particular age group, and so now the withdrawal of those connections is going to be very challenging,” said Rhonda Wilson, PhD, professor of mental health nursing at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne, and president of the Australian College of Mental Health Nurses, Woden, both in Australia.

Wilson also criticized the lack of consultation with young people in the development of the ban. “We've simply made a decision for them, about them, and without them, and so that is hugely problematic,” she told Medscape News Australia.

The rationale given for the ban was that it aimed to protect young people from content that could harm their health and well-being, and from design features that encourage them to stay on their screens.

Observational evidence suggests that social media use by young people is related to harms ranging from reduced physical activity to eating disorders and body image problems, said Marie Yap, PhD, professor of psychology at the Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “The existing evidence does suggest that there is a correlation, and enough of a correlation for us to not dismiss it as just chance.”

Those harms were also more likely to affect already vulnerable individuals, for example, those with chronic health or mental health issues, and young people from minority or marginalized groups. “They're already feeling isolated, hence they are drawn to social media connection, because that's where they might feel safe,” said Yap. “So they are perhaps more vulnerable to harms that can arise from those platforms.”

One of the greatest concerns regarding the ban, however, was that it could cutoff young people from what may have been a lifeline for some, she said. “They don't have the resources, they don't have the capacity, sometimes, to find workable alternatives. It is genuinely risky for them.”

Catherine Page Jeffery, PhD, lecturer in media and communications at the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia, said that while the move toward greater regulation of big tech was a good thing, the social media ban risked reducing young people's agency and freedom. “What fuels that concern is that parents can't see what their children are doing online and don't appreciate the value that it has,” Page Jeffery told Medscape News Australia.

The open letter criticizing the ban, which Page Jeffery signed, suggested that it affected young people's rights to access and participation, citing the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's statement that children should have the opportunity to access and engage with the digital environment safely. “By excluding them entirely, then no, that is actually impinging on their rights,” she said. “Instead, the onus needs to be placed on the platforms themselves to make these spaces safer.”

Pediatrician Susan Sawyer, MD, chair of adolescent health at The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia, said she applauded the government's commitment to prevention of mental health issues in young people, but much more needed to be done, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized youth. “We need to be working much, much harder to be creating inclusive spaces for young people in schools and in communities,” she said.

Wilson, Yap, Page Jeffery, and Sawyer reported having no relevant financial relationships.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Edited by Mamta Pawara

 December 19, 2025  

The prevalence of vaping increased fivefold among 18- to 24-year-olds in England from 2014 to 2024, surpassing smoking rates and driving an overall rise in nicotine use in this youngest age group; over one third of current vapers had never regularly smoked.

""This dual effect underscores the complexity of the evolving nicotine landscape and suggests policies must strike a balance between minimising harm and preventing new uptake,"" the authors wrote.

""Given e-cigarettes expose users to much lower numbers and levels of toxicants compared to combustible tobacco, a continued shift in nicotine use from smoking toward vaping and other less harmful products would likely yield a net public health benefit,"" they added.

This study was led by Sarah E. Jackson, University College London, London, England. It was published online on December 07, 2025, in Addiction.

The cross-sectional design prevented establishing causal relationships between the observed trends. Despite the large sample size, CIs were wide for the less common outcomes. The analysis could not definitively separate age, period, and cohort influences. Additionally, this study did not explore underlying motivations for changes in nicotine use behaviours, such as the influence of peer groups, marketing, or public health policies.

This study was supported by the Cancer Research United Kingdom. Some authors report being members of the Behavioural Research UK Leadership Hub supported by the Economic and Social Research Council. Some authors reported receiving unrestricted research funding, grants, travel expenses, and honoraria from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing smoking cessation medications. All the authors declared having no links with tobacco companies or manufacturers of tobacco-related products.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The winner of the 2026 World Cup will receive $50 million from a $655 million prize pool, FIFA said Wednesday in announcing record financial rewards for teams in a tournament with ticket prices that have sparked outcries.

The champion's figure is up from $42 million won by Argentina in 2022 and $38 million gained by France in 2018 but less than half of what Chelsea earned for winning the much less-hyped Club World Cup this year.

The total prize fund for the World Cup, staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, is up 48.9% from the $440 million for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

The 2026 total will be nearly six times the $110 million in prize money for the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. FIFA president Gianni Infantino in 2023 set a target of equal prize money for men and women at their next World Cups — the next women's tournament is scheduled for 2027 in Brazil.

The Club World Cup, controversially expanded from seven teams to 32 and shoehorned into the soccer calendar last summer, had a total prize fund of $1 billion. Chelsea won the top prize of up to $125 million for a tournament that faced fierce resistance from players and leagues and drew sparse crowds for some matches.

FIFA has a different distribution model for the national team and club tournaments, with the disparity in prize money reflecting factors such as clubs with higher wage costs than national teams.

Beyond prize money, further funds are put toward development of soccer globally.

Infantino said the World Cup will be “groundbreaking in terms of its financial contribution to the global football community.”

In Europe, the Champions League also has a much bigger top prize than the European Championship for national teams. The maximum winnings for last year's Euros were 28.5 million euros ($33.5 million). Real Madrid picked up around $154 million for winning the Champions League in the same year. Both competitions are run by European soccer's governing body UEFA.

FIFA approved the prize money for the World Cup at a meeting of its council in Doha. In March it projected revenue for its current four-year cycle through 2026 at $13 billion, up from $7.5 billion for 2019-22.

Each of the 48 national federations at the expanded 2026 World Cup will receive $1.5 million for preparation costs and $9 million for participating in the group stage, the same as for the 2022 tournament.

Teams advancing to the new round of 32 get $11 million and those reaching the round of 16 receive $15 million. Nations reaching the quarterfinals are paid $19 million, the fourth-place team $27 million, the third-place team $29 million and the final loser $33 million.

Including participation fees, FIFA will distribute $727 million to the 48 federations.

Each federation decides what to pay its players. The French sports daily L'Equipe reported France players were in line for a bonus of $586,000 by their federation if they won the trophy in 2022. France was ultimately beaten by Argentina in the final.

The U.S. Soccer Federation's 2022 collective bargaining agreements with the unions for its men's and women's national teams call for prize money for men in 2026 and women in 2027 to be pooled together, and 80% of the money to be distributed among the players.

AI-generated summary reviewed by our newsroom.

Read our AI Policy.

In the wake of FIFA's recent reveal of the 2026 World Cup schedule, representatives from a number of nations have visited Kansas City and Lawrence to check out both areas as potential “base camp” sites for their soccer teams.

As The Star previously reported, reps from England, Germany, Colombia and South Korea have paid visits to Lawrence.

The Star was told that Argentina and Algeria visited Lawrence last week. This is especially relevant as both are scheduled to play games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City — and a source close to the situation told The Star that Lawrence is a likely base camp location for a team playing in KC.

Which team that might be is unknown, for now. Here's the list of the seven squad that will be playing matches in KC: Netherlands, Argentina, Algeria, Tunisia, Curaçao, Ecuador and Austria.

With that, it's time for another Kansas Jayhawks Q&A. Thanks, as always, for the questions ...

Are you out on Dawson or Rosario? What do they need to do to get going? @NickSpringer29

I'm not out on either one of them, but the clock is ticking on both players. As KU moves toward conference play, each must provide something that this team lacks.

That means shooting proficiency. Both players were supposed to carry the load in 2025-26, but neither is shooting better than 25% on 3-pointers.

The path to more playing time starts with hitting shots. If they can't do that, it's hard to justify having either on the court.

Does KU basketball have access to gatorade, bananas, or other advanced technology for hydration and cramping?

I believe so (lol). Here's what coach Bill Self said when I asked him about it.

“We've talked to everybody,” he said. “We've only had a couple of guys that have had this. Devonte' (Graham) probably had it as bad as anyone. He worked through it, but it took a while to work through it. ...

“Everybody has an idea of (how to fix this), whether it's mustard packets or eating bananas or drinking this (drink) ... there's a lot of things that people can do. And sometimes your body just doesn't react how it reacts to a nephew or uncle('s remedy) in your family.”

If you didn't want to go to work, what injury would you use? @bewarephog

I can't remember the last time I took a sick day, but when I was a kid I usually went with a stomach ache.

Nobody can really question it and make you prove your stomach doesn't hurt, so it's pretty safe.

I didn't miss a ton of school days, either, though. My parents could usually figure out when I was lying, so I didn't try it too often. Ha ha.

As for how this pertains to Peterson, I really do believe he has cramps and wants to play. It's clear that this is a frustrating situation for everyone involved — one that will hopefully be resolved soon.

What's Santa need to bring to both KU programs? @MrEd315

For KU basketball, it's a healthy Darryn Peterson. Simple as that.

For KU football, it's a little more complicated. The Jayhawks have a lot of needs to address, with 33 departing seniors and a number of players in the transfer portal.

So, I think the best hope football-wise is that Kansas can bring in impact transfers at such positions of need as linebacker and defensive line.

The Best Gifts For Miami Music Fans

Photo by Carol M Highsmith from Rawpixel

Audio By Carbonatix

The most coveted cup competition in sports is coming to Miami Gardens next year, with multiple Central and South American teams having already drawn games in South Florida. 

Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens will host seven matches during the 2026 World Cup, the first Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) tournament to include 48 teams. And with the first match coming June 15, many are likely wondering how to obtain tickets, which have fluctuated in price on various sites since going on sale. 

Tickets can be found on FIFA's website, with prices skyrocketing to over $2,000 after initially releasing at a starting price of $60. Ticket sales sites like Seatgeek, Stubhub, and Vividseats, however, offer much lower prices for Miami matches. But seats are vanishing fast, so grab them while you can.


							At New Times, we're small and scrappy — and we make the most of every dollar from our supporters. Right now, we're $16,750 away from reaching our December 31 goal of $30,000. If you've ever learned something new, stayed informed, or felt more connected because of New Times, now's the time to give back.						

The matchup between Scotland and Brazil features two of the sporting world's most fervent fan bases, so it's understandable to see ticket prices for their game rise so high. Brazil is the only nation to feature in all 22 iterations of the quadrennial World Cup. Scotland, on the other hand, has only qualified for eight tournaments and has drawn five-time winners Brazil in five tournaments. It's consequently one of the most common World Cup matchups in history.

Prices on secondary ticket platforms, however, seem to be much more affordable, with prices fluctuating since last week. StubHub tickets run marginally cheaper than those on Vividseats and SeatGeek.

The wildest Qualifying moments of 2025

Fred Vasseur reflects on Ferrari's 'tough' season but 'ready to fight' again in 2026

With Max Verstappen announcing his switch to Daniel Ricciardo's old number 3, and Lando Norris set to take on the champion's number 1 next season – car numbers are back in focus. Here are 11 times drivers went on to race with another driver's number.

After four seasons running the number 1, Max Verstappen revealed that he will line up with a brand-new digit on his car in 2026. With Lando Norris set to carry the World Champion's number next season, Verstappen will switch to number 3 rather than returning to his familiar 33.

Car numbers can carry a lot of meaning to the grid. Before 2014, car numbers were assigned to each driver based on the previous season's Teams' Championship order, avoiding 13 for superstition, but now drivers are free to choose their own unique number. There are two exceptions, with the number 1 being reserved for the current World Champion, while the number 17 is retired in memory of Jules Bianchi.

Many drivers loyally stick with their chosen number throughout their junior and senior careers, often carrying it into other racing categories too. However, the new clause allows for number changes with FIA approval, and permission from the driver who had that number within the last two seasons – case in point: Daniel Ricciardo and Verstappen.

With retirements, returns, and plenty of reshuffles, here are 11 times when drivers took another driver's number.

Ricciardo and the number 3 have been synonymous since 2014. But the story behind the pairing is very on-brand for the recently retired Aussie. Ricciardo first ran with the number during his younger karting days after quite literally pulling it from a hat. He returned to the number in F1, with an announcement and nod to one of his heroes, NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt, who famously raced with the same number. It wasn't long before ‘3' became part of the Honey Badger's identity, even using it as part of his DR3 brand.

Now the number 3 is set to make a return to the grid in the hands of Ricciardo's former team mate and four-time World Champion Verstappen. This week, he announced he would race with Ricciardo's former number after the Aussie and the FIA gave him permission. The duo raced together at Red Bull between 2016 and 2018, and for Verstappen, this change is one he's been thinking about for quite some time!

Speaking to Viaplay, the Dutchman said: “My favourite number has always been 3, apart from number 1. Number 33 was always fine, but I just like one 3 better than two. I always said it represented double luck, but I've already had my luck in Formula 1.”

Once his four-year reign as World Champion ended at the hands of Lewis Hamilton at the end of 2014, Sebastian Vettel opted to return to the number 5, the same number he donned when winning his first title in 2010, and that accompanied him to his karting success in 2001. The German was also a big fan of Nigel Mansell, so with the number 5 repeatedly popping up, he was inspired to choose it.

Three seasons after Vettel's retirement at the 2025 season opener in Melbourne, the number 5 hit the track once again, courtesy of young Brazilian rookie Gabriel Bortoleto – a new era for this legendary number that has seen so much success. It represents big shoes to fill for the now 21-year-old, but how did Bortoleto come to his decision?

“Because I won Formula 3 with this number,” he explained on Kick Sauber's social media. “And actually from 85, that is the number I used to use in the past when I started go-karting.”

Just one digit higher was what Mercedes' Nico Rosberg had set his sights on ahead of the regulation change in 2014. Reasons why pertained to family – six is both his wife's and his dad's lucky number. And that luck transferred, as Rosberg won the Drivers' Championship in 2016 with six on his car, 34 years after his father Keke Rosberg won the 1982 World Championship with the same number!

Just a few years after Rosberg's retirement, Nicholas Latifi joined the grid, also represented by the number 6. His reasoning came from his Canadian background, as Latifi was born and raised in Toronto. The Williams driver explained to fans: “Toronto is known as the six, basically if you're from there your area code for your phone number is either the 416 or 647.”

Latifi left the grid at the close of the 2022 season, but the number 6 wasn't off the grid for long. Isack Hadjar chose the number for his rookie season with Racing Bulls in 2025 explaining on Racing Bulls' YouTube that the first kart his dad bought him had the number six on it, and he simply never changed it throughout his career. It was a stroke of good fortune for the Frenchman that the number was available, and the partnership served him well, as the success of his maiden season earned him a promotion to Red Bull.

When Brawn GP arrived on the grid for their first – and ultimately only – season in F1 in 2009, their drivers were handed the highest numbers available. Jenson Button ran with 22, while Rubens Barrichello took 23. At the time, it was simply a quirk of the numbering system, but by the end of the year, 22 had become linked with one of the sport's great fairytale stories forever, as Button and Brawn clinched both World Championships.

“I became World Champion in 2009 with number 22, so I have good memories of 22, and I look forward to making new memories,” the Brit said when announcing his decision for his 2014 season with McLaren.

Fast forward to 2021, and the number 22 was back, with Yuki Tsunoda. Admittedly, it wasn't his first choice – Tsunoda had raced with number 11 during his karting career – but with that already taken by Sergio Perez, he doubled it instead. In an interview on his former team AlphaTauri's website, he said: “I also liked it because it was the number of Jenson Button, a driver I respect a lot when he won the Formula 1 World Championship in 2009. It's also a number used by Japanese driver Takuma Sato.”

From one popular Japanese driver to another, Kamui Kobayashi made his F1 debut with Toyota back in 2009, sporting the number 10. So, it was no surprise when he chose to return to that number in 2014 when he drove for Caterham.

Alpine's Pierre Gasly brought the number 10 back when he joined Torro Rosso in 2017. Like many of the drivers, Gasly also chose a number from his junior days, but he also uses it as a tribute to one of the great French footballers.

“I raced with that number in 2013 when I became Formula Renault European champion,"" said Gasly. ""I was a big fan – I am still a big fan – of Zinedine Zidane, who was number 10 for the national French team.""

For Jolyon Palmer, when he joined the grid in 2016, the number 30 already felt familiar to him. During his 2015 FP1 practice sessions, test driver Palmer was assigned the number 30, and decided to stick with the number for the remainder of his F1 career with Renault.

Liam Lawson, however, felt a more sentimental pull towards the number 30 – even if he wasn't able to use it straight away. When he first stepped into the sport as a stand-in for the injured Ricciardo in 2023, the Kiwi was assigned the temporary number 40 by the FIA.

Once he was able to choose a permanent number from the United States Grand Prix later that year, Lawson returned to one that had followed him since childhood. The number 30 dates back to his karting days, when Lawson was inspired by a mentor who looked after him and ran the same number. It's a choice rooted in those early years, and one Lawson has carried with him ever since – very wholesome!

When Felipe Nasr joined the grid in 2015, he opted to run with number 12. While Nasr didn't publicly attach a specific reason to the choice, the number carried a clear resonance. It was the same number used by fellow countryman Ayrton Senna when he won his maiden World Championship, making it a fitting link to one of the sport's most iconic figures and national heroes.

When he joined the 2025 grid, Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli also wanted to pay tribute to the legendary Brazilian. “It is because of Ayrton,” Antonelli said of the decision behind his number in an interview on Mercedes' official website. “But it is also the number I first used in single seaters.

“From F4 I started to use 12 straight away and it worked pretty well with that number. Hopefully I can carry that on in F1. I was also 12 years old when I joined the Mercedes junior programme, so there is that too.” The Italian also raced with 12 on his way to Italian and ADAC F4 titles in 2022.

When the time came for him to choose a number in 2014, the 2007 World Champion Kimi Raikkonen had a very meaningful reason for choosing the number 7. The Finn explained: “We had to pick up a number, and I just picked up that.” Another classic ‘Iceman' moment. He added: “There was a chance I took six because I won the Championship with it, but I knew Rosberg wanted it.”

Raikkonen's choice may not have meant much to him, but the number 7 was the desired choice for Charles Leclerc and Valtteri Bottas, who had to pivot to 16 and 77 instead!

Doohan took on the number 7 in 2025, keen to choose something meaningful for his Alpine car. “I really wanted to go with a number that I raced with before,” Doohan explained in an Alpine social post. The Aussie spent the 2019 season driving for Double R in Euroformula Open – a team funnily enough founded by Raikkonen and his manager, Steve Robertson. “One of my idols, a super special person and driver, Kimi Raikkonen, also drove with that number,” Doohan added.

With number 1 being an exclusive offering to the World Champion, you'd think the number 2 would be a popular choice, but only two drivers have opted for it. Stoffel Vandoorne used it when driving for McLaren in 2017 and 2018, with the Belgian explaining the number carried strong personal significance. “I chose it because it was the first number I had when I started racing in single-seaters – in Formula 4 Eurocup 1.6, back in 2010,” he told the McLaren website.

“I didn't choose the number, it was just given to me, but it was a good year for me – I had a lot of victories and a lot of podiums – so it has positive memories for me.” As with many drivers, Vandoorne kept the number outside of F1, with his Formula E car donning the two as well.

Logan Sargeant brought the two back to the grid for his one and a half seasons with Williams. Once again, the American wanted to use the number from his successes in the junior categories. “I used to run [number 2] in Formula Renault, and I had a pretty good season that year,” said Sargeant. “Number 3 is my number, but that's taken [by Daniel Ricciardo] so I figured, why not take a winning number from the past and run with in F1?”

Adrian Sutil's choice of 99 was unique. While he simply chose the highest number available, the 99 has only appeared once before in the World Championship – on Lee Wallard's victorious car at the 1951 Indianapolis 500. However, that race was not run to F1 regulations, so Sutil became the first driver to race with 99 on a Grand Prix car – a moment of history for the German.

Antonio Giovinazzi also chose the maximum possible number allowed under the rules. The former Alfa Romeo driver explained how he won his first race in a 2006 Italian karting championship with the number 99, with the only other numbers available being 13 and 17, both unlucky for Italians. He also enjoyed being the last on the entry lists, viewing it as a lucky charm.

The number 1 has been reserved exclusively for the reigning World Champion, but there is no obligation to do so, and the driver's normal number is reserved throughout their time with the World Champion's number. Vettel raced with it after winning his final title in 2013, before reverting back to the number 5 for the rest of his career.

Hamilton famously chose to stick with his 44, a nod to his first go-kart, throughout his world titles post-2014, a number that has since become inseparable from his identity in and out of the sport. However, the Brit did run the number 1 on his W09 Mercedes for the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as a one-off.

Verstappen proudly claimed the number 1 for all four seasons after his Championships. After winning the 2021 title, he said: “How many times can you do that? I don't know, maybe it's the only time I can in my life. It's the best number out there. So, I will definitely put it on the car.”

For this upcoming season, the number 1 will change hands for the first time in four years – as newly crowned World Champion Lando Norris will switch from his usual number 4. “It's tradition, it's there for a reason,” Norris told Sky Sports News. “All of us as a team that gets to have a role in McLaren, or my car, will get to wear that with pride. It's all my mechanics, my engineers, everyone that's part of McLaren gets to have that acknowledgement too.”

An investigation into the industry's tumultuous tug-of-war with Kobe's widow over the priceless, unseen footage the late Lakers legend shot during his final season.


							By 

	Peter Kiefer


Writer-at-Large


Kobe Bryant didn't like what he was seeing. It was the fall of 2019, and the NBA legend was tucked inside an editing bay at an office in Irvine, staring at a roughly assembled two-hour cut drawn from tens of thousands of hours of footage he'd commissioned during the 2015-16 Lakers season — his farewell tour. The material captured everything: the dunks, the jumpers, the no-look passes, yes, but also his life away from the court. Moments in the locker room at Staples Center. Evenings at home with family. And, in several haunting instances, scenes aboard his helicopter.

	











	But the cut didn't measure up. According to a source present at the screening, Bryant was visibly frustrated. “Kobe was like, ‘Yeah we're scrapping that and starting over,'” he recalls.

	Even so, everyone in that office must have understood the significance of what was being projected on that screen. Its working title was 20th Season, and it was an intimate record of the final year of one of the greatest athletes in modern history. At a moment when demand for prestige sports documentaries had been booming, it was more than gold — it was a Hope diamond.

	Just a few months later, of course, it would become even more valuable. After the tragic helicopter crash that killed Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others, the footage would take on a sacred sheen, transformed into arguably the most precious sports footage in the world.

	











	Indeed, to those few aware of its existence — Bryant's inner circle as well as a small group of Hollywood insiders — those thousands of hours of footage have become something like a holy shrine to a mythic figure. A slew of prominent producers and directors, including two Oscar winners, have lined up with offers to shape it all into the documentary Bryant once imagined creating for himself.


	So far, though, none has signed on. According to the filmmakers and others familiar with the talks, they've all run into the same stubborn obstacle: Vanessa Bryant, Kobe's widow, who, it turns out, has her own very specific vision for what sort of movie should be made. And it's not a film anyone else seems interested in making.


	“It's the white whale,” says one top producer of Bryant's final footage. “But it can't hold a director, and it's been sitting out there with this eternal promise that never seems to materialize.”


	***


	Bryant's offices at Granity Studios did not look like what you might expect. There were no jerseys or trophies decorating the walls, or even photographs of other sports icons. Instead, there were framed images of Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and John Williams. Bryant placed them there intentionally to signal — to himself and to those around him — that he was pursuing a different kind of greatness.


	Bryant's ambitions were not unusual among sports figures — plenty of athletes have chased Hollywood after retiring — but the scale and seriousness of his pivot were different. He wasn't looking to do cameos, brand deals or vanity projects. He wanted a second career as a creator and producer, something that could stand on its own apart from basketball. Inside Granity, he treated that goal with the same intensity he once brought to Lakers practices.

	











	On THR‘s Awards Chatter podcast in 2017, Bryant was asked what his life would've looked like without basketball. “I'd be writing stories,” he said. “That's something that's just part of me and something that I love every bit as much as I have ever loved basketball.”


	His first major Hollywood collaboration was Muse, the 2015 Showtime doc he made with Gotham Chopra, co-founder of the documentary company Religion of Sports. “Working with Kobe was both exhilarating and exhausting. He was as intense off the court as he was on,” Chopra tells THR. Muse wasn't just Bryant's first serious Hollywood project, it was also the beginning of his relationship with Jake Bloch, the young director of photography he later hired to oversee the embedded crew filming his final season.


	His next project, the animated short Dear Basketball, pushed him further into the creative world he was building — and in a big way, winning a 2018 Academy Award. To Bryant, it was confirmation that the stories he wanted to tell — and the way he wanted to tell them — could resonate beyond the court. From there, he scaled up. He expanded his team at Granity Studios, developing multiple projects. ESPN ran his basketball-analysis series Detail. His scripted children's podcast, The Punies, was headed toward an animated TV series.


	“He was world-building and trying to win the public's imagination,” says Kevin McCollum, the Tony-winning producer behind In the Heights, Avenue Q and Rent. In 2018, Bryant contacted McCollum about adapting The Wizenard Series: Training Camp, a children's book he co-wrote with Wesley King, into a Broadway musical. Bryant even explored working with Harry Potter director Chris Columbus on a film version.

	











	But the most ambitious project on his slate was the 20th Season documentary built from the footage chronicling his final stint with the Lakers. Along with Bloch, Bryant hired Jim Hession, a film editor who would later cut the 2023 Jon Batiste doc American Symphony, and Tony Hardmon, the cinematographer behind 2020's John Lewis: Good Trouble (both declined comment for this story, citing NDAs, as did numerous others contacted by THR).


	Filming was complicated. There were early disputes with the NBA, which enforces strict limits on who can shoot during games. “Kobe didn't ask for permission — for anything, really. He did what he wanted,” says a Lakers source. Eventually, the NBA agreed to an arrangement, granting wide access with one restriction: The crew could not fly on the team plane.


	As for what Bryant intended the documentary to be?


	“I think the feeling was just shoot everything. Get a million hours of raw footage and then assess what he had and decide what to do,” says the Lakers source.


	Another collaborator recalls some uncertainty but notes Bryant was aware that a prestige documentary could bring in revenue to support his expanding creative ventures. Bryant's appearance in 2019's The Last Dance, the Emmy-winning Michael Jordan doc series that sold for $20 million and became a global sensation, may have also been an inspiration. Although it wasn't released until three months after his death, Bryant was likely aware of what a game-changer that series was destined to become.

	











	“Kobe would have wanted to double that [$20 million],” says the Lakers source. “And if The Last Dance won three Emmys, Kobe would've wanted his to win five.”


	***


	When Bryant's helicopter crashed into a Calabasas hillside on Jan. 26, 2020, the public impact was immediate and overwhelming. Cable networks aired continuous coverage. Thousands gathered at Staples Center to pay tribute. Twenty thousand people attended the official memorial, and millions watched or streamed it online. Murals of Bryant appeared not only across Southern California but around the world — more than 600 in total.


	In the years since, it's been Vanessa, Bryant's widow, who has become the central figure shaping and protecting his reputation — a new and sadly unexpected role. Throughout most of Bryant's playing career, and beyond, she had maintained a relatively low profile. “I wasn't privy to their conversations at home, but she only made a handful of appearances at Granity events,” notes Craig Greiwe, the former chief strategy officer at Rogers & Cowan PMK who oversaw accounts for both Bryant and Granity (and is one of the few collaborators who did not sign an NDA). “Mostly red carpets. And I've never once seen her speak publicly in support of any of the work he did after the NBA.”


	Today, though, Bryant's legacy appears to be an all-consuming occupation — and one she has often pursued with an army of lawyers beside her. For starters, she sued Los Angeles County in a U.S. district court after first responders circulated graphic crash-site photos; she ended up being awarded $44 million. In 2021, Vanessa resolved a lawsuit — filed against her in Orange County Superior Court by her own mother — alleging unpaid wages as a nanny and a broken promise of lifetime support. And she prevailed in a legal dispute with Bryant's former business partner and onetime close friend Molly Carter over profits from his investment in the sports-drink company BodyArmor — a case that made international headlines when texts between Carter and Bryant entered the Orange County Superior Court record, including messages in which Carter referred to Kobe as a “douche nugget” and called Vanessa a “bitch.”

	











	Carter declined comment but according to Greiwe she “was one of the few people in the world who was always fiercely loyal to [Kobe] and to his vision, and that's why he trusted her,” adding that he believes the released texts were taken out of context. “They were like brother and sister, and sometimes they fought like that. But they had each other's backs, and there's no question he trusted Molly to run his empire.” (A spokesperson for Vanessa disputes this characterization, insisting that “it is absolutely not true” that Bryant and Carter were friends).


	Adds a veteran sportswriter who covered Bryant: “I always heard that both in their marriage and outside of it he played the good cop and [Vanessa] was the bad cop. People were very wary of Vanessa.”


	Today, among those most wary of Vanessa — or, at least, of her creative vision — are the Hollywood directors and producers who've approached her about the mountain of priceless footage she now controls. While Bryant's plans for his documentary may not have been fully formed before his death, hers are now crystal clear. Multiple sources say she wants to turn it into an epic romance, with herself as the central love figure.


	“Vanessa knows how she wants it set up,” says one of those sources. “The construction of the film that she wants is a very personal story to her and to her family.”

	











	In all fairness, it's not an entirely uncompelling narrative. Kobe and Vanessa met on the set of a 1999 rap video. He was 21, already an NBA slam dunk contest winner; she was a 17-year-old high schooler. They became engaged six months later. Throughout the next 20 years, she sat beside him through triumphs and turbulence: his early rivalry with Shaquille O'Neal; the 2003 sexual assault case involving a 19-year-old hotel worker (charges were dropped when the accuser declined to testify, and Bryant later settled a civil suit); his estrangement from his parents, whom he sued in 2013 for auctioning memorabilia without permission (reports have suggested that Bryant's decision to marry Vanessa contributed to tensions with his family). There were moments of turbulence in their own marriage — in December 2011, she filed for divorce, with the couple reconciling in January 2013 — but the two were clearly devoted to each other.


	Still, editing those thousands of hours of priceless footage into a romantic idyll is probably not the movie Bryant imagined making — and it's certainly not the movie Hollywood wants to make. What's more, Vanessa's influence is not limited to the 20th Season footage. Her representatives have also moved to shape — or halt — other nonfiction projects about her husband. One high-profile example: a doc being developed by Thunder Road Films' Basil Iwanyk and Select Films' Mark Ciardi, which draws heavily on taped interviews Bryant recorded at 17. When an early version of that film was shopped to buyers last year, interest was strong — until WME, which represents the Bryant estate, privately warned that purchasing it could jeopardize any future chance at accessing the 20th Season material.

	











	“I was told by the agent — and he told the whole town this — that if you buy it, you'll never get a shot at the project that Kobe shot,” the buyer tells THR.


	This sort of strong-arming — or, from Vanessa's point of view, safeguarding — clearly hasn't gone over well in Hollywood, where Vanessa has been climbing higher and higher on many filmmakers' life-is-too-short list. “Why is it that so many people are terrified to talk? I think it's clear that her actions have spelled the destruction of Kobe's legacy and his vision, at least the one he articulated to me,” says Greiwe. “All the things that he had planned for are gone.” 


	A spokesman for the estate says that “Craig Greiwe has never met [Vanessa] Bryant and is making unfounded statements,” adding that Greiwe has previously made “disparaging remarks about Kobe and Vanessa.” The spokesman insists that whatever documentary is ultimately released will be “in line with Kobe's wishes and intent.”


	Of course, as executor of the estate, Vanessa Bryant — who declined to be interviewed for this story — is fully empowered to determine what, if any, documentary moves forward — and nobody could blame her if she ended up spiking the entire project. Sifting through hundreds of hours of footage of her late husband surely takes an emotional toll.

	











	In 2020, Granity Studios shut down, abruptly halting nearly every creative project in development, (although, according to Vanessa's spokesperson, she kept as many staff members on the payroll as possible during COVID and fulfilled “Kobe's projects”). Those offices have since been taken over by a real estate brokerage firm. Former staffers — a publishing department, the development team and young employees who believed they were helping Bryant build something lasting — have scattered across the entertainment industry or left it entirely. The Granity Studios website, which is still accessible, is the only vestige of Bryant's grand ambitions.


	“Kobe knew he had influence, but what he really wanted was to help kids who felt alone and offer them a path,” says McCollum. “Kobe's legacy is not just the stories but the ideas. If the Bryant family was interested, I would do anything to help get the musical made. It's still a worthy project. But I don't want to be presumptuous.”


	Little is known about where the thousands of hours of behind-the-scenes footage is stored, or who has access to it. What is clear is that the raw material capturing one of the most enigmatic, driven and influential athletes of modern times possibly sits on a hard drive somewhere, or maybe in the cloud, waiting — perhaps indefinitely — to be unlocked.

	His exit is not a complete surprise; he has talked about potentially leaving the show over the last few months. In September, he told People that he had discussed it with creator Lorne Michaels.

	“Lorne was like, ‘You have more to do,' and that means a lot, because I even confessed to him… ‘I feel the audience is maybe getting sick of me.' And he was like, ‘That's not true. There's more for you to do. I need you',” he said.


	Yang has, however, had to miss shows this season; he skipped a show in October to accept the Vantage Award at a gala at the Academy Museum in LA.


	Yang has been one of the breakout stars of SNL over the last few years. He was the first featured player to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy, in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category.


	He has gone viral with a raft of sketches including as the Titanic iceberg on Weekend Update, as Jafar, as a straight man who hooks up with Gina Gershon and Sydney Sweeney, as a gay Oompa Loompa and as George Santos.

	











	But he's also got a very busy dance card; in addition to roles on Bros and Fire Island, he starred as Pfannee in Wicked and its sequel Wicked: For Good. He hosts the Las Culturistas podcast with Matt Rogers, which has been turned into a Bravo awards show, and is writing and co-starring in a comedy feature based on an episode of the Search Engine podcast for Searchlight Pictures.


	Yang's departure comes after a cast exodus after Season 50; Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker and Emil Wakim all exited over the summer.


	In September, Michaels addressed the exits, saying that “change is good”. “The show has always brought people in from different ages and different generations and it's how it revives itself,” Michaels told Entertainment Tonight. “It's always hard when people leave but there's a time for that and our audiences always stayed relatively young and more so now with Tik Tok, and change is good. And the people we're bringing in I'm really excited about.”

Today co-host Savannah Guthrie said that she will be absent from the show for a couple of weeks to have surgery on her vocal cords.


	Guthrie told viewers on Friday that she has “felt like Peter Brady these past few weeks and months. Some of you have noticed that my voice has been very scratchy and started to scratch a little bit like Peter Brady.”


	She was referring to an episode of The Brady Bunch in which Peter Brady's voice cracks just as he and his siblings are trying to establish singing careers.


	“I have found out what it is. I have vocal nodules, and now I also have a polyp. It's not a big, big deal, but I am going to have a surgery real early in the new year and be off for a couple of weeks. So it's my last day for a little while. So I just want to let everyone know, and if you've been wondering, do I have the world's longest head cold? No, I don't.”

	











	“You'll love this, guys. I have to be silent for a couple of weeks, totally silent,” she said, adding, “the jokes write themselves.”

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have rebranded their Archewell Foundation — named after their son — on the charity's fifth anniversary.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced Friday that the Archewell Foundation will now be called Archewell Philanthropies.

“Five years ago, The Archewell Foundation was born from a simple but profound belief: to show up and do good,” an impact report issued Friday read.

“Today, as we mark our fifth anniversary, that mission remains as vital and urgent as ever — now carried forward through Archewell Philanthropies, a growing platform designed to deepen and expand how we serve communities around the world.”

The statement concluded, “What began as a commitment to compassion has evolved into a powerful force for meaningful change, particularly in championing global mental wellness across our communities.”

Markle, 44, and Prince Harry, 41, launched the foundation in 2020 after stepping down from their royal duties. 

The foundation aims to support women's causes, parents whose children have been affected by online harm and other important issues.

The name change comes after Netflix announced that the couple — who are parents to Prince Archie, 6, and Princess Lilibet, 4 — will be part of a new series on the streamer.

According to Deadline, the couple will produce an adaptation of the 2018 book “The Wedding Date,” the first novel in a six-part series from New York Times bestselling author Jasmine Guillory. 

“The Wedding Date” follows Alexa Monroe, who goes on a fake date for Drew Nichols at his ex's wedding.

The new project comes nearly five months after Page Six exclusively reported that their $100 million Netflix deal will end this year after teaming up with the streamer in 2020.

Archewell Philanthropies agreed to a new deal with Netflix — but for far less money.

“There are more TV projects coming soon with both the Duke and Duchess,” a source told Page Six in July. 

Markle, who also runs her lifestyle brand, As Ever, and Prince Harry are also producing a film adaptation of Carley Fortune's novel “Meet Me at the Lake” for the streamer. However, Page Six previously reported that they have not yet hired a director or cast.

Carrie Underwood delivers beautiful vocals on her HBO Max Christmas special, but one video from the special has fans all saying the same thing. They are especially smitten by the “American Idol” judge's angelic white dress for “O Come All Ye Faithful.”

On December 18, Underwood took to Instagram to share a video of one song from her 2020 holiday special. 

“Get into the holiday spirit with this performance of ‘O Come All Ye Faithful' from my @hbomax special, ‘My Gift: A Christmas Special from Carrie Underwood,' now on YouTube. Check out the full special on HBO Max!”

Of course, Underwood's vocals are elite as she belts out the Christmas classic, but her white dress is getting plenty of love, too.

Fans flooded the comments section, writing, “Voice of an angel,” “Sweetest voice on Earth,” and “The undisputed queen of Christmas music.”

“Carrie, this song and this dress are all beautiful! Favorite look from this Christmas special,” one fan noted.

Another person shared, “I watched this special so many times! It's great.”

“This song, that voice, and that dress is truly EPIC!!” another person noted.

“Absolutely LOVE your version of this song,” one fan gushed.

Others shared, “Angelic voice and THE DRESS 🙌,” “The angel dress is stunning,” and “Not only do you have the voice of an angel, but that gown makes you look like one.”

The Christmas special included an appearance from John Legend on the song “Hallelujah” and a behind-the-scenes look at her son Isaiah recording “Little Drummer Boy” with Underwood. She also performed “Favorite Time of Year,” “Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee,” and “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”

She explains in the behind-the-scenes video, “The ‘Little Drummer Boy' is a central song in ‘My Gift.' That's where the title of the album came from, and it's one of my absolute favorite Christmas songs. I started thinking about what would make it extra special, so I have a very special duet partner.”

Underwood continued, “He loves to sing, and that is so his personality. He'll make crafts, or he'll do things for you, and he's like, ‘Didn't I do a good job? Didn't I do my best? Are you proud of me?' And it's the sweetest thing. And I just thought his sweet little voice would just sound perfect.”

“If nothing else, I will have this for the rest of my life,” the singer added. “I think it's the perfect piece of the puzzle for this whole album.”

Can we 'intercept' it before it leaves us forever?","https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-is-rapidly-moving-away-from-us-can-we-intercept-it-before-it-leaves-us-forever","Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:39:52 GMT","



3I/ATLAS has passed its closest point to Earth, meaning we will soon lose sight of it for good. Some scientists want to send a spacecraft to chase down the alien comet — or the next interstellar object. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We've watched it speed through the solar system using the most powerful telescopes in human history. We've studied its light with probes whipping around the sun and robots marooned on Mars. Countless eyes watched it make its closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19 — and yet, for all of this, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS remains little more than a blur of gas, shrouded in mystery.

Since its discovery in early July, 3I/ATLAS has been studied more enthusiastically than practically any other celestial object in recent memory. Still, for all its fame, much remains unknown about it. The comet's origins, from somewhere far across our galaxy, may never be known. Its true age, size, composition, and shape are also poorly constrained.

But how can we learn more about this alien interloper — or indeed, the next one — when we're already studying it with everything we've got?

Some scientists are proposing a bold solution: We have to ""intercept"" it with a spacecraft.

Doing so would not only help us to better understand its key characteristics but also photograph its surface and potentially collect our first-ever interstellar samples, which could help reveal how alien exoplanets form, how common our type of solar system is and maybe even help answer the question of whether or not we are alone in the universe.

""We only have one shot at this object and then it's gone forever,"" Darryl Seligman, an astronomer at Michigan State University and the lead author of the first paper published about 3I/ATLAS, previously told Live Science. ""So we want as much information from all of our observatories as we can possibly get.""

On July 1, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) revealed they had spotted a mysterious object traveling toward us from beyond Jupiter, at more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h). ATLAS, which automatically scans the skies using telescopes in Hawaii, Chile and South Africa, was hunting for potential threats to Earth. It found something else entirely.

Less than 24 hours later, NASA confirmed that the speeding blur of light was an interstellar object — an alien asteroid or comet that originated outside the solar system — and named it 3I/ATLAS. It was only the third-ever detection of an interstellar object in our solar system, after the anomalous space rock 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019.

Despite the rapid spread of unfounded theories that the object could be an alien probe, early observations confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet — potentially the oldest of its kind ever seen — that likely originated from the Milky Way's ""frontier"" region.

Interstellar visitors like this are exciting to astronomers because they are one of the few opportunities we have to explore neighboring star systems, which would take generations and the invention of sci-fi technology to reach aboard a spacecraft.

""ISOs are relics from planetary formation, so studying these objects and comparing them to what we have closer to us [could] lead to an interesting view of how other planetary systems in the galaxy formed,"" Pedro Bernardinelli, a planetary scientist at the University of Washington's DiRAC Institute, told Live Science in an email.

 




But our Earth-based observatories, and even orbiting spacecraft such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), can only tell us very rough information like general size, shape and composition. To really reveal ISO secrets, we will need to get much, much closer — possibly even close enough to grab a fragment.

Doing so won't be easy, but given the valuable insights it could reveal about the star systems beyond our own, it would be well worth the effort, experts say.

""Each one of these ISOs is a little piece of low-hanging fruit from a tree that can tell us a great deal about the trees growing in some other neighborhood,"" Wesley Fraser, an astronomer with the National Research Council Canada, previously told Live Science.

But the time to catch this speeding comet is fast approaching. 3I/ATLAS is now reaching its closest point to Earth, around 168 million miles (270 million km) miles away. From there it will move quickly away from us and will likely be beyond Neptune within another year.

Because it is now too late to intercept 3I/ATLAS within the inner solar system, most researchers agree that there is now only one viable option to study this object: to chase it down as it leaves the solar system.

This would require the spacecraft to carry out what researchers call ""Oberth maneuvers,"" where a probe is gravitationally slingshotted around massive objects, such as the sun, to pick up enough speed to allow it to catch up to and intercept an ISO at a specific point along its predicted trajectory.

This idea was first proposed in 2022 to catch up with the first known interstellar object, 'Oumuamua. The plan, dubbed Project Lyra, was to launch a probe in 2028 that would intercept and investigate that object, after completing an Oberth maneuver around Jupiter.

 




But this chaser method has a huge limitation: Scientists would need to wait decades for data to come back. For example, if Project Lyra launched a spacecraft in 2030, it would not intercept 'Oumuamua until 2052 at the earliest, Adam Hibberd, a researcher with the U.K.-based nonprofit Initiative for Interstellar Studies (I4IS) who worked on Project Lyra, told Live Science.

So far, Project Lyra has not moved past the planning stage — making a 2028 launch highly unlikely — but the project could still reach 'Oumuamua if launched in 2030 or 2033, Hibberd said. This means we would likely still have plenty of time to chase down 3I/ATLAS, if we want to.

Future propulsion methods, such as a solar sail, could drastically cut the travel time of missions like this from decades down to just a few years, he added. But these technologies are decades away from becoming a reality themselves.

But given that 3I/ATLAS will be very hard to chase down, some astronomers argue that we shouldn't bother hunting it. Rather we should prepare to intercept the next interesting ISO.

By launching an interceptor spacecraft and parking it in a gravitationally stable position around Earth, known as a Lagrange point, we could, in theory, be ready to quickly intercept a passing object, they argue.

This idea, also first proposed in 2022, has been dubbed the ""hide-and-seek"" approach. However, unlike Project Lyra, it is much closer to becoming a reality.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is preparing the Comet Interceptor mission, which is currently scheduled to launch in 2029, on board the same rocket as ESA's Ariel space telescope, said Colin Snodgrass, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who specializes in comets and was the deputy project investigator on the proposal for this mission.

 




The Comet Interceptor probe isn't specifically aimed at interstellar visitors. Instead, it's designed to hunt nonperiodic comets like Comet Lemmon, which has been visible in the night sky, alongside 3I/ATLAS, in recent months. These comets drift toward the sun every few hundred or thousand years and have poorly defined orbital pathways around the sun.

When ESA researchers spot a comet they can reach, they will ""fire the rockets, get to the right place in space to cross the path of the comet and have this fast flyby encounter, where we go shooting past the comet, getting as much data as we can,"" Snodgrass told Live Science.

And while the mission is not designed to study interstellar objects, the project will be perfectly placed to intercept them.

""The whole science team is very much in agreement that if an interstellar object was to pop up, we wouldn't let that opportunity go by,"" Snodgrass said.

The main advantage of the hide-and-seek approach is that we wouldn't have to wait decades for a probe to catch up to its target. Additionally, we'd be reaching it at the best time to study it. That's because interstellar comets, like 3I/ATLAS, soak up more solar radiation when in the inner solar system — which, in turn, means they give off more light, gas and dust, giving us a better chance to learn about their composition.

However, a hide-and-seek mission might not be able to catch all the objects we care about. For example, ESA's Comet Interceptor probe would have been unlikely to reach 3I/ATLAS, had it been in orbit when the ISO was first discovered, because the comet was too far away from us, a recent study from Snodgrass and others found.

A major limitation of both the chaser and hide-and-seek missions is that ISOs travel too fast for their respective spacecraft to travel alongside, or rendezvous with, these objects.

This makes it ""almost impossible"" for the probes to directly obtain samples from the objects' surfaces as NASA did during its OSIRIS-REx mission, which successfully landed a probe on the asteroid Bennu in 2020 and collected samples that were later returned to Earth, Hibberd said. Due to fuel limitations, it is also unlikely that these samples could be easily returned to Earth, especially during a chaser mission, he added.

However, there is a third option that could yield valuable interstellar samples: the ""impactor"" method.

Similar to NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which successfully deflected the asteroid Dimorphos after smashing into the space rock in 2022, an interceptor probe could also be sent to crash into an ISO, Hibberd suggested. While this probe would be destroyed, a second spacecraft could be deployed to analyze the debris field and potentially even collect leftover fragments of the alien object, he added.

But an impactor mission would need to overcome serious technical challenges. First, ISOs travel much faster than solar system objects, like Dimorphos, meaning it's more difficult to smash them apart. Second, this method would likely work only on an asteroid, not on comets, which have hard, icy shells. And third, a collision could accidentally send chunks of debris on a collision course with Earth, like DART did. As a result, most of the experts who talked to Live Science, including Hibberd, agreed that it is probably too risky to attempt an impactor mission until more research has been done on the subject.

 




If money were no object, we could pursue all of these options. But if an agency like NASA has the budget for only one such mission, which one should be selected?

A chaser mission would allow astronomers to target a specific object they know they want to study, while a hide-and-seek mission would be limited to objects that happened to pass nearby. On the other hand, the hide-and-seek mission could reliably predict objects' locations in the inner solar system, whereas the chaser method would target objects in the dark, more chaotic outer solar system, where it would be harder to find and photograph them, Snodgrass said.

Another issue is that signals from a more distant chaser mission would take longer to send and receive, so mission operators would be unable to monitor and adjust an ISO flyby in real time or fix technical difficulties easily — a difficulty NASA faces with its distant Voyager probes, Snodgrass said.

There is also the matter of money. Project Lyra would likely cost the same as NASA's New Horizons mission, which flew by Pluto in 2015 and cost at least $700 million, Hibberd said. Meanwhile, ESA's Comet Interceptor mission has a budget of around $150 million, Snodgrass said.

As a result, most researchers who spoke to Live Science agreed that a hide-and-seek interceptor would likely be the best way of studying an ISO up close.

But if this is the method we end up using, how should we design the resulting spacecraft to maximize its chances of collecting useful data?

 




While ESA's Comet Interceptor is relatively inexpensive, a dedicated ISO interceptor mission — with a bigger budget — would allow us to launch a faster probe that could carry more fuel and thus travel farther. However, the craft doesn't need to be fancy.

A ""fairly stripped-back"" probe with a decent camera and a few spectrographs, capable of analyzing the light given off by the different gases, would be more than enough to collect sufficient data from any flyby, Snodgrass said.

If the probe were intercepting a comet, and not an asteroid, it could also be fitted with a device to catch specks of dust from the comet's coma or tail during a superclose approach, just as NASA's Stardust probe did with ""Comet Wild 2"" in 2004.

Assuming that the interceptor hasn't depleted its fuel reserves and can be returned to Earth, this may be the only reliable way of actually getting our hands on interstellar samples, Snodgrass said.

Once the ""perfect"" interceptor is in position around Earth, researchers will have to choose which ISO to go after. And because any spacecraft is unlikely to be reusable, it may get only one shot at picking the right target.

We may soon be spoiled for choice. ISOs may be far more common than we realize. ""There are likely thousands of other ISOs in the solar system right now,"" Fraser said. ""We just can't see them because they are too faint, too far and too fast.""

But thanks to the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which is designed to spot more small and dim objects in the outer solar system, we are likely to find many more ISOs in the coming decades and, more importantly, spot them much earlier on their journey toward us, which would give us a better chance of studying them.

The first thing to consider is whether to go after an asteroid or a comet. Because comets become more active near the sun and present the most likely route for collecting interstellar samples, they would likely take priority, Snodgrass said.

The next consideration would be the target's distance from Earth. As we have already seen, ESA's Comet Interceptor may have struggled to reach 3I/ATLAS on its journey through the inner solar system. Therefore, it might pay to wait for an ISO that is on a favorable trajectory relative to Earth.

History can be a mirror or a wall. For many people, it's a mirror only when they see their own family reflected in it—an ancestor who fought in a war, survived a famine, or emigrated under duress. For others, history is a wall they can never climb. The view on the other side is fixed: the past is not what was done to them, but what their parents or grandparents did to others. 


That is the reality I discovered when interviewing the sons and daughters of leaders of the Third Reich. 

When I began work on Hitler's Children, I was not looking for new evidence about what happened in the Nazi Holocaust. The bureaucratic record of the Third Reich was already vast—memos, orders, trial transcripts, camp rosters—the Germans were masters of documenting their crimes. 

What I wanted was something the archives could never provide: a human portrait of the children of top Nazis, the men and women who grew up in the shadow of fathers whose names had become synonyms for evil. 

I wanted to know: What is it like to love a parent whom the world knows as a war criminal? How do you form a sense of self when the world has already decided who you are—and it is an identity you neither chose nor can easily shed? What happens to ordinary human relationships—marriage, friendship, parenthood—when your family name carries an explosive moral charge? 

Those questions took me across Germany and Austria and into conversations that were often guarded, sometimes raw, and occasionally redemptive. Some doors never opened. Some opened a crack and then slammed shut the minute I explained that I could not promise a sympathetic portrait. A few opened wide, and what came out was not a clean confession or a tidy arc toward reconciliation but something more human: ambivalence, anger, loyalty, shame, defiance, grief. What emerged was not a single “Nazi progeny” experience but a spectrum of responses to inherited guilt. 

Tracking down the children of the regime's inner circle required patience and a tolerance for being told no. Some had changed their surnames and slipped into anonymity. Others had moved abroad, where the name on their passport did not immediately freeze a room. Many were instantly hostile when I contacted them. They assumed—not unreasonably—that I was there to condemn their parents or to dredge up what they had spent decades trying to bury. 

I learned quickly that the children of perpetrators could be as guarded as the children of victims. I knew many of the latter intimately because I had earlier co-authored a biography of Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele. I had spent countless hours with concentration camp survivors about their experience and the trauma it had left them. When I approached the children of the perpetrators, I discovered some had been burned by journalists who came for sensational quotes and left nuance on the cuttingroom floor. Others feared the moral judgment of strangers or the social cost in their own communities if they were seen as disloyal to family. 

A few, though, agreed to speak. Some said they wanted the truth to be known while they were still alive. Others hoped that narrating their story aloud might lighten the weight they had carried in silence. What I heard, over time, was less a series of disconnected biographies than a set of recurring moral dilemmas. 

To make sense of what I was hearing, I came to think of my interviewees along four rough lines. These are not scientific categories—lives overflow categories—but they capture distinct ways the various individuals navigated the same shadow. 

1. The Rejectors. These were the sons and daughters who saw their fathers' crimes with scorching clarity and devoted their lives to exposing them. Niklas Frank, son of Hans Frank—the Nazi Governor-General of occupied Poland—was the most uncompromising. He called his father a “spineless jerk,” wrote a book that dismantled the family mythology, and made no room for sentimentality in the face of historical fact. “You don't put love for your father above the truth,” he told me. The choice for him was not between love and hate but between complicity and moral independence. 

2. The Defenders. At the other end of the spectrum were those who insisted their fathers were maligned by history or punished beyond proportion. Wolf Hess defended his father, Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, as a “man of peace” betrayed by political enemies and victors' justice. For Wolf, to defend his father was to defend himself from the conclusion that he was the son of a villain. The defense became a scaffold for identity, a way to live in the world without constantly negotiating contempt. 

3. The Divided. In the middle were those who could neither fully condemn nor fully exonerate. Rolf Mengele—son of Dr. Josef Mengele—met his father only twice after the war. Rolf was sixteen the first time, when his father traveled from his South American hideaway for a skiing vacation in the Swiss Alps. Rolf's mother had told him his real father had died in war, and the visitor was “Uncle Fritz.” Three years later he learned that Uncle Fritz was in reality his father and he learned about his crimes. He only met him again when Rolf was 33, a visit to South America to confront him about Auschwitz. The elder Mengele closed that door, telling his son never to question him about what happened at the camp and what led to the prisoners dubbing him the “Angel of Death.” 

Rolf did not deny his father's atrocities; he had studied the documents as had everyone else. However, his sense of loyalty to his family had fractured the moral clarity that comes easily to people who never face the person behind the infamy. Rolf carried two incompatible truths: the father he barely knew and whom his family loved and the historical perpetrator he could not defend. 

4. The Transcenders. Finally, there were those who took the moral debt they inherited and turned it outward—into a public ethic. Dagmar Drexel's father was not a senior Nazi official but instead one of the murderous Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads that killed more than a million civilians. She chose the path of engagement and reconciliation, visiting Israel, supporting dialogue, and insisting that her children and grandchildren be raised in the light of historical truth. Dagmar hoped, as many did, that if her generation did the hard work, the third generation might be free of the burden. 

These categories blur at the edges. People moved along the spectrum over time—hardening or softening as new documents and eyewitness accounts surfaced, as they aged, as their own children asked harder questions than journalists ever could. 

Taken together, however, the spectrum reveals the variety of human strategies for living with the inheritance of atrocity. 

For outsiders, the hardest truth to grasp may be the most banal: perpetrators are still parents. A man who signed deportation orders may also have read bedtime stories, taught a child to swim, or taped the wobbling seat on a first bicycle. Public history sees uniforms and titles. Private memory remembers the warmth of a hand, the tone of a voice in the kitchen at night. 

Reconciling those two realities—public monstrosity and private tenderness—was the central torment for many I met. Some resolved it by letting historical fact erase the personal. They repudiated the father and severed the line. Others clung to the personal, even when it meant being accused of denial. 

Edda Göring, devoted to her father's memory, described Hermann Göring as generous and loving. She did not deny the crimes of the regime for which he was one of its top leaders but resisted the idea that her father had been a fanatic. To critics, that sounded like apologetics. To her, it was loyalty to the man she knew as a kindly father. 

The tension here is not reducible to “truth versus lies.” Rather, it is a collision of kinds of truth—the truth of documented atrocity and the truth of attachment, which does not yield easily to hard facts. I came to believe that part of the work of reckoning is sometimes learning to hold both truths at once without letting either evaporate the other. 

Psychology offers a vocabulary for what I heard. The “intergenerational transmission of trauma” is well documented among the children of victims—especially Holocaust survivors—where symptoms include anxiety, hypervigilance, and a deep mistrust of institutions. Among the children of perpetrators, I discovered that a related but distinct process plays out. Their inheritance is not injury but stigma—the corrosive effects of shame, moral ambiguity, and the fear that others see an invisible mark. 

Guilt is about actions; shame is about identity. One can confess guilt and make amends. Shame, by contrast, whispers that one is something tainted. Several interviewees spoke of carrying a “name that enters the room first.” It affected romance (when to disclose the name), employment (whether a boss would know the family and decide against them), and decisions about parenthood (whether to have children at all). 

Coping strategies reflected familiar psychological defenses. Some changed their names or emigrated—geographic cures for a moral biography. Others chose radical transparency—publicly condemning their fathers in books and interviews to reclaim their own moral agency. A third group practiced radical silence, hoping that if the topic never arose, the past might recede on its own. It never did. Silence, I learned, is a temporary dam. The water rises behind it. 

Beyond the individual psyche lies the family system—the ways stories are told or not told, the rituals of commemoration or erasure. Some families preserved elaborate mythologies in which the father had resisted orders, saved a Jewish neighbor, or known nothing about the machinery of murder. 

The myths were often anchored in a single ambiguous episode—an order not carried out, a mild reprimand from a superior—that became the seed for an alternative history. 

Other families split. Siblings took opposing stances. One condemned; another defended. At holiday meals, the past was both present and forbidden. 

The emotional economy of those households looked familiar to anyone who has studied families marked by addiction or scandal: unspoken rules, competing narratives, and a tacit agreement that love depended on staying within one's assigned role. 

Children who broke the family line—who published a denunciation or appeared in a documentary—sometimes became moral exiles among their own kin. That rupture was the price of telling the truth as they saw it. In those moments, “intergenerational trauma” named not only what moved from parent to child but what moved from child back to parent: a judgment the older generation could not bear. 

The burden was not only private. Society itself became a mirror in which these children saw themselves reflected, often in distorted ways. Several spoke of the quiet pause when a teacher or colleague recognized the surname—and then the question that followed, carefully phrased to sound neutral but freighted with suspicion: “Any relation to … ?” In adulthood, some learned to bring it up first, defanging the question with a practiced sentence—“Yes, I'm his daughter; no, I do not share his politics”—and moving on before the conversation stalled. 

In public life, the reception depended on the role they chose. The rejectors found a kind of moral home among activists and historians. The defenders found communities that resent “victors' justice.” The divided and the transcenders navigated lonelier paths, neither embraced by partisans nor comfortable with silence. 

We sometimes imagine that moral burdens fade in predictable half-lives. In my experience, time changed the tone but not always the weight. As my interviewees aged, many reported that reckoning deepened, not because new facts appeared but because their own children asked better questions. 

The third generation—further from the emotional bond and closer to the educational curriculum—refused family mythologies in a way the second often could not. “Grandpa couldn't have known,” a parent would say. “But he was there,” a teenager would answer. 

Anniversaries, documentaries, and new archival releases periodically reset the conversation. A case reopened, a grave discovered, a diary authenticated—and the private work of reconciliation was hauled into public light. At those moments, people who had made peace with their own narrative found themselves having to make peace again, this time with an audience. 

The Nazi case is singular in scale and intent, but the dynamics I heard are not unique. Descendants of slave owners in the American South wrestle with family papers that list human beings as property and calculate children as “increase.” In post-apartheid South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission exposed a generation of children to testimony that shattered family legends. In Rwanda, the gacaca courts forced communities to confront the fact that génocidaires were not abstract monsters but neighbors—and often fathers. Across the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal's judgments collided with nationalist narratives passed down at kitchen tables. 

In all these contexts, the same questions surface: Am I responsible for the sins of my father? Can I love my parent without condoning their crimes? What do I owe to victims and their descendants? How do I build a life that is truly my own? 

The answers vary by culture and circumstance, but the structure of the dilemma is recognizably human. 

If “intergenerational trauma” names an outcome, what are the mechanisms? Scholars point to at least four: 

Silence. When families refuse to speak, children fill the vacuum with fantasy or shame. The mind abhors a narrative void. In several households I encountered, silence was the loudest sound in the room. It produced neither absolution nor forgetfulness—only rumination. 

Mythmaking. The stories families tell—of resistance, ignorance, or necessity—shape the moral horizon. Even a small act of decency can be inflated into an alibi. Conversely, some families cultivate a punitive myth of inherited stain, a fatalism that imprisons the young in a script they cannot revise. 

Ritual and Place. What families visit—or avoid—matters. One daughter told me she had been taken to battlefields but never to camps. Another said the first time she saw the Nuremberg courtroom, she felt she had stumbled into a photograph that had been waiting for her. 

Rituals of remembrance can either widen or narrow moral imagination. 

Institutional Echoes. Schools, museums, and media frame the past in ways that either invite reckoning or permit evasion. A curriculum that skips over the depth and breadth of atrocities—as has happened in many academic settings when it comes to the Hamas terror attack of October 7—makes it easier for descendants to imagine their relatives are free of any responsibility. 

Institutions can either dignify the moral labor families attempt or tempt them with a ready-made script of innocence. 

“Moral injury”—a term developed to describe soldiers who feel they have violated their own ethical codes—offers another lens. The second generation experiences a kind of indirect moral injury: an injury not from what they themselves did but from what knowing does to them. Knowledge damages one's relationship to a beloved parent; truth injures attachment. 

Some choose not to know much. Others choose to know everything and live with the ache. One daughter, who had read deeply in trial transcripts, said that learning the exact logistics of a deportation under her father's authority broke something in her. “I used to think there must have been chaos,” she said. “It was worse—there was order.” 

For her, the injury was precision—the bureaucratic elegance of evil. 

A notable fraction of those I interviewed had chosen not to become parents. The reasons varied: fear of passing on a name, a desire to end a line, uncertainty about what one could say to a child who asked, “Who was my grandfather?” One son told me that he chose not to become a father because he could not bear to pass on a story line he had never been able to fully explain. 

None believed in genetic guilt. The concern was narrative. Parenthood would require mastering a story they themselves had not yet mastered. Others chose to have children precisely as a defiance of history—an insistence that a life could be built that was neither repetition nor repudiation but revision. 

These decisions often intersected with partners' views. Some marriages could not bear the weight of history. One woman described the look on a fiancé's face when he first grasped the details of her father's role. 

“It wasn't revulsion,” she said. “It was calculation. He was calculating whether he could carry it with me.” The engagement ended. 

A skeptic acknowledges the limits of memory and the demands of evidence. Interviews with perpetrators' children are not court records; they are human documents, shaped by self-protection, loyalty, and fatigue. Defensiveness, denial, and selective recall were constants. My job, then and now, is to triangulate: place personal accounts against trial transcripts, diaries, and the scholarship of historians and psychologists. 

Skepticism here is not cynicism. The aim is to understand without excusing, to listen without indulging. If we want to interrupt the transmission of harm—whether its currency is trauma or shame—we must map the routes it travels. That map requires both archival rigor and an ear for the ways people live with the past. 

Again and again, interviewees asked whether their children—grandchildren of the perpetrators—could be free. There is some evidence that the burden lightens with distance, especially when the second generation does the work of truthtelling. But it is not inevitable. Silence begets fantasy, and fantasy rarely lands on justice. 

The most hopeful conversations I had were with families who had made memory a practice rather than a panic. They visited sites of the crimes together. They read. They argued. They did not ask love to overrule truth or truth to annihilate love. They let both inhabit the same home. In those households, the third generation seemed less haunted and more oriented—not weighed down by a surname but awake to what it should mean to carry one. 

A line of Dagmar Drexel stays with me: “Our generation has the obligation to confront the truth. Only then can the next one be free.” 

The obligation is not to perpetual penance but to honest narration. Freedom comes not from forgetting, but from telling the story in a way the young can live with. 

The story of the children of Nazi leaders is not only about Germany, nor only about the Holocaust. It is about the universal human challenge of living with a family legacy that collides with one's moral values. We do not inherit guilt in the legal sense. Yet we can inherit its shadow—in our names, our family stories, our silences, and our choices. 

The work of a lifetime, for some, is not to step out of the shadow but to learn how to live within it without becoming it. That means choosing accuracy over myth, candor over silence, accountability over performative shame. It means loving a parent, if one can, without lying about him—and refusing to let that love dictate the terms of one's moral life. 

If there is a single lesson my interviews taught me, it is that history is never safely past; it lives inside our most intimate relationships. To reckon with that is not to remain trapped. On the contrary, it is the only way through—an insistence that the very human bonds that transmitted the shadow can also be the ones that transform it.

During President Donald Trump‘s first campaign for president, pro-life activists were thrilled at his statements of support for the unborn. Once it became clear he would be the party choice, it was easy to contrast him against long-time abortion proponent, Hillary Clinton. Pro-life voters may have been turned off to varying degrees by Trump's words and antics, but on Election Day, they took the good with the bad and propelled him to the presidency. 

When asked during an October 2016 debate about the possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade, then-candidate Trump responded, “That'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.” In the end, that very thing came to fruition. Trump, who in 1999 said he was “pro-choice in every respect,” became the most powerful darling of the pro-life movement. 

Since his monumental win with Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, Trump has backtracked on life issues. This evolution doesn't seem to bother his biggest supporters. But it is concerning. 

TRUMP SLOWS BLEEDING OF INDEPENDENT VOTERS: WHITE HOUSE REPORT CARD

Trump now only cares about how the abortion issue might alter the Republican Party's 2026 midterm chances. Yet suggesting candidates take a less bold pro-life approach is nothing but moral cowardice. Consider the Trump administration's reaction to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO)'s launch of a new pro-life group called Love Life Initiative. It's a beautiful, necessary project that falls right in line with conservatism. Unfortunately, Axios reports the Trump team is unhappy with Hawley's focus, with an adviser saying, “Clearly, Senator Hawley and his political team learned nothing from the 2022 elections, when the SCOTUS abortion ruling [overturning Roe v. Wade] resuscitated the Democrats in the midterms.” It's as if winning matters more than adherence to principles.

Just this week, Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, called out the administration on another pro-life issue. Pence's organization, Advancing American Freedom, issued a statement calling for HHS Secretary RFK, Jr.'s ousting:

“HHS Secretary RFK, Jr. continues to refuse to review the dangerous chemical abortion pill, mifepristone… It's time to kick this progressive wolf in pro-life sheep's clothing to the curb. RFK Jr. must go.”

This is blatant anti-life behavior from an administration that is supposed to prize the opposite. Sadly, these are just the latest added to a list of frustrations the pro-life community and its most prominent leaders have with Trump. Another comes in the form of Trump's executive order “lowering costs and reducing barriers to IVF.” While it wasn't anywhere near his promise on the campaign trail to cover all the costs for those wanting the treatment, it still bothered the pro-life community for obvious reasons. The process of IVF includes the use, freezing, and/or destruction of multiple embryos. 

Trump clearly hopes that the pro-life success of his first term will excuse any decidedly anti-life wrongs in his second term. This is evident in his nomination of RFK, Jr. to HHS, a man who is not and never has been a friend to the pro-life cause. It is also evident in his administration's push to discourage a focus on the abortion issue ahead of midterm elections.

GERMANY, POLAND AND THE BALTICS PREPARE FOR WAR; THE UK, FRANCE AND OTHERS PRETEND TO PREPARE

While Trump's involvement in overturning Roe will be a major part of his legacy, it's not enough. What is required of a truly pro-life president is a continuous commitment to the protection of unborn life. Trump thinks he is the most pro-life president of our lifetime?

Not quite. If that were the case, the victory of Dobbs would have just been a starting point.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Get Lost in This Dazzling New Map of the Cosmos

NASA's newest space telescope has unveiled a stunning map of the cosmos in infrared

Just nine months since its launch, NASA's newest space telescope has unveiled a jaw-dropping map of the cosmos unlike any we have seen before.

Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) is a two-year-long mission designed to study the universe in infrared light. It began science operations in May, yet the mission has already completed the first of four full-sky maps, showing the universe off in an image that includes more than 100 colors.

“The superpower of SPHEREx is that it captures the whole sky in 102 colors about every six months,” said Beth Fabinsky, project manager for SPHEREx at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in a statement accompanying the new map. “That's an amazing amount of information to gather in a short amount of time.”

Space telescopes are typically optimized either to study a small patch of the sky across many wavelengths of light or to survey vaster swaths of the cosmos in only a handful of wavelengths. SPHEREx offers the best of both: with six specialized filters, the telescope can isolate light from 102 different wavelengths.

That's powerful because of a fundamental feature of the cosmos: as light travels across the expanding universe, it stretches. Light from farther away is both older and more stretched, meaning it has a longer wavelength than light from closer objects.

Scientists can pinpoint an object's distance using information gleaned from its light. In turn, what SPHEREx is producing is not a flat map of the skies but a three-dimensional atlas of everything it can see in the universe.

Mission scientists hope this atlas can solve three big challenges: mapping several key flavors of ice in and around our Milky Way galaxy, tallying all the light produced across the history of the universe and peering back to the earliest moments after the big bang.

But SPHEREx's data will inform studies far beyond these narrow topics, astronomers say. Its full-sky view will illuminate the asteroids and comets littering our own solar system, for example. And by comparing repeated scans of the sky, it could reveal fast-changing so-called transients such as supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars.

“It's really mapping the sky in a novel way,” said Olivier Doré, a cosmologist at JPL and the California Institute of Technology and a project scientist for SPHEREx, to Scientific American before the telescope's launch. “It's about opening up a new window on the universe.”

Mobile health interventions are associated with greater weight loss and improved liver enzyme levels in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD, now known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease).

“Mobile technology can strengthen patients' self-monitoring capabilities and improve behavioral compliance through real-time data tracking (eg, dietary logs, exercise monitoring) and instant feedback mechanisms,” the authors wrote. 

The study was led by Yanfang Li, Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China. It was published online in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.

The meta-analysis included only a small number of studies with notable heterogeneity due to variations in intervention implementation, patient characteristics, and control-group settings. Some studies did not adequately control for confounding factors. The short-term duration of the included trials limited conclusions about long-term effects.

This study was funded by the Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Province. The authors reported having no competing interests.
