                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An undefeated champion at the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals will walk away with a record $5,071,000, the richest payout in the event's history. The prestigious season finale, held from 9-16 November at the Inalpi Arena in Turin, will feature an event record $15.5 million in total prize money. Last year, Jannik Sinner set a new benchmark when he stormed to the title without dropping a set, collecting $4,881,100 — then the largest prize awarded at the event. Now a Nitto ATP Finals champion could break $5 million in winnings for the first time. Each match from the semi-finals onwards will be worth more than $1 million. An undefeated doubles team will secure $959,300. See below the full doubles prize money breakdown. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz faced perhaps the sternest examination of his debut run at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships on Monday, but he emerged with flying colours to book his spot in the final. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings overcame a resilient Casper Ruud and his own fitness concerns to secure a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory at the ATP 500 event. Alcaraz, who displayed limited movement at times during the opening set, eventually rediscovered his sharpness to set up a title showdown with former Tokyo champion Taylor Fritz. “I had a lot of chances in the first set,” said Alcaraz. I was a little bit mad with myself, so I just tried to play with joy again, putting a lot of positive thoughts in my mind.” “I know he's playing great tennis lately,” Alcaraz said of Fritz, who also defeated Alexander Zverev in San Francisco. “Since the Laver Cup against me, against Zverev, and here in this tournament, he's feeling great and really comfortable on the court. Since tweaking his left ankle in his Tokyo opener against Sebastian Baez, Alcaraz had downplayed concerns and proved it with assertive wins. Yet against Ruud, who tested him relentlessly with heavy topspin and court-stretching angles, the Spaniard's discomfort was more apparent. Facing break point in the seventh game, Ruud attacked with a deep approach into Alcaraz's backhand corner. Though he got the ball back at his opponent's feet, Alcaraz hesitated when stretching for that ball and chasing the ensuing drop volley — a moment of vulnerability that underscored his struggles in the first set. Watch Alcaraz struggle to deal with Ruud on break point: Alcaraz's aggressive, risk-heavy tactics in the first set yielded 15 unforced errors, but he recalibrated in the second, finding consistency on serve: He dropped just four of 24 points behind his delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to overwhelm Ruud and level the match. From there, Alcaraz carried that momentum into the deciding set, where he showcased his freedom of movement and fearless shotmaking, silencing any injury doubts. Though outplayed at times from the baseline, Fritz compensated for 13 aces to secure his first hard-court final of 2025 and climb to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. “Honestly, just by botting,” Fritz said when asked how he was able to triumph. “I served insanely well: High percentage first serves and spots too. It felt like any game that I didn't hit three aces, he was really outplaying me from the baseline.
