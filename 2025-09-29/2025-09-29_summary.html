The “MedBed” conspiracy theory has led to websites seeking to scam people who wrongly believe that the product is real.

Over the weekend on his Truth Social account, President Donald Trump shared (then quickly deleted) a seemingly AI-generated video that included a deep-fake version of himself promoting a nonexistent product related to the broader QAnon conspiracy theory.

The video, which purported itself to be a Fox News segment hosted by Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, featured a product called a “MedBed” — fictional health care technology that supposedly heals the ailments of any individual who lays in it. Some variants of the “MedBed” conspiracy theory also allege that it can reverse aging or regrow missing limbs.

Conspiracists allege that MedBed technology is only available to the rich and well-connected, but that Trump may make it available to the public one day.

In his Truth Social post, the deep-fake version of Trump says he is giving every American “guaranteed access” to the “advanced technology” and to MedBed hospitals, which do not exist. By doing so, the fake Trump in the video says, he will “restore every citizen to full health and strength.”

The video further alleges that more information on how to register for MedBed cards will be coming soon. Websites for MedBed cards do exist, but they are money-making scams meant to deceive people who believe the conspiracy theory. 

It is unclear why Trump shared the video. The president frequently shares news reports of himself on social media, but sharing an AI-generated video, showcasing a statement he has never actually made, bewildered a number of people online, leading some to question whether the post was a sign that Trump's mental acuity is declining. 

During the 2024 presidential campaign, several commentators noted that signs that Trump could potentially be facing cognitive decline were underreported on. New polling indicates that a large bloc of Americans is concerned about the president's current cognitive state.

According to an Economist/YouGov poll published earlier this month, only 40 percent of voters believe Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 50 percent say he does not. On the question of whether Trump's age or health is affecting his duties as president, 34 percent believe they are severely limiting what he can do, while another 27 percent say they are having little effect on his job performance. Just 26 percent believe Trump's age and health do not affect his handling of the presidency. 

A Data for Progress poll published in July showed similar worries from voters, with a plurality, 49 percent, saying Trump was “too old” to be president — a 10-point increase from one year prior, when he was a candidate for the White House. A similar number, 48 percent, say they think Trump is experiencing symptoms of cognitive decline, while 45 percent say they disagree.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Video posted on Truth Social touts CBD as a ‘gamechanger' and promotes Medicaid coverage of CBD products

Cannabis stocks are on a high after Donald Trump shared a video on Sunday promoting cannabis use for seniors and Medicaid coverage of CBD products.

The nearly three-minute-long video, posted on the president's Truth Social platform, touts the usage of hemp-derived CBD as a “gamechanger” that is a pain and stress reliever for seniors.

Stocks for cannabis companies, including Canopy Growth, Tilray and Cronos Group jumped Monday when stocks opened for the week. MSOS, an AdvisorShares Cannabis exchange-traded fund (ETF), also soared on Monday, after Trump posted the video.

The video was produced by the Commonwealth Project, a group promoting cannabis use for senior healthcare, and praised Trump for his 2018 farm bill that legalized industrial hemp.

“Now it's time to educate doctors … provide Medicare coverage for CBD and give millions of seniors the support they deserve,” the video said.

The cannabis industry has long hoped the White House would take further steps to decriminalize cannabis at a federal level.

Under Joe Biden's administration, the Department of Health and Human Services requested that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reclassify cannabis as a lower-risk substance. Marijuana is now classified as a Schedule I drug in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, which means it has no accepted medical use and has a high risk for abuse.

But the Trump administration had been silent about decriminalizing marijuana until August, when Trump told reporters that his administration is “looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks”.

“I've heard great things have to do with medical, and I've heard bad things having to do with just about everything else,” Trump said. “It's a very complicated subject.”

Currently, 40 states allow the use of medical cannabis products, and 24 states allow non-medical cannabis use.

Tilray led a rally by industry stocks in New York on Monday, surging by more than 40% in the wake of Trump's video.

Advocates for cannabis for medical use say legalizing marijuana at a federal level will allow for better investment into research and broaden access.

“While the DEA plans to reschedule cannabis, today it is still a Schedule I drug – a controlled Substances Act classification for the most dangerous drugs such as heroin and LSD,” the Commonwealth Project says on its website. “As a result, studying cannabis is challenging and not integrated into comprehensive medical care, depriving millions of Americans aged 65 and older of potential life-changing alternative therapies for medical ailments.”

But it's unclear where Terrance Cole, Trump's DEA administrator, stands on reclassifying cannabis. Advocates pointed out that upon Cole's appointment in July, he did not mention cannabis reclassification among his priorities, instead focusing on cracking down on fentanyl.

Israel has held hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya in its torture camps for nine months.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, has lost about 55 pounds since Israeli forces abducted him in December, and is suffering from a serious case of scabies, according to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), which visited him last week. The renowned pediatrician was given a new pair of clothes for the first time on September 25, the morning of his visit with PHRI, the group reported. 

Abu Safiya's request to see a doctor for the scabies and heart problems have been ignored, according to PHRI. 

“Dr. Abu Safiya described the violence perpetrated by prison guards during frequent cell searches,” PHRI posted on X. “According to him, detainees receive very small amounts of food, many of them have lost a significant amount of weight, and they have been held in dirty clothes for months.”

“Six months have passed since the publishing of our report, which documented the arbitrary detention of more than 100 medical personnel from Gaza,” the group continued. “Since the report's publication, our organization has visited more than 25 of them and gathered additional testimonies about ongoing physical violence, repeated cell raids, lack of food and medical treatment, and months of detention in dirty clothes.” 

All detained health care workers are “currently being held without charge, some for more than a year,” according to the group, which called for their immediate release. 

Israeli forces targeted Kamal Adwan Hospital long before the military abducted Abu Safiya in December. A year before his abduction, in December of 2023, Israeli forces conducted their first raid on the hospital and abducted its then-director, Dr. Ahmed Kahlout, according to a new documentary, “The Disappearance of Dr. Abu Safiya,” produced by Al Jazeera Fault Lines.

Israeli intelligence contacted Abu Safiya numerous times to try to get him to leave the hospital, as per the documentary. But the beloved pediatrician was undeterred. He spoke out about Israel's genocide, the miltiary's attacks on Kamal Adwan Hospital, and pleaded for help from the international community.

On October 25, 2024, Israeli forces raided the hospital again, and beat and interrogated more than 40 staff members, including Abu Safiya, according to DropSite News. The soldiers told him not to speak with journalists. During the attack, Israel killed the doctor's son at the hospital gates. 

On December 27, Israeli forces raided the hospital for the last time, and burned it to the ground. 

“Everyone in the hospital,” the Israeli military said on a loudspeaker, as per footage in the documentary. “The army surrounds you. You are surrounded.” 

“A big tank entered and stood by reception,” a nurse told Al Jazeera. “And it started firing. It was firing forward, firing and turning. And then they pointed the muzzle through the reception door and it was [pointing at] patients.”

At about 6 a.m., Israeli forces demanded to see Abu Safiya. Video captured him walking over rubble to the tank, wearing his white coat. The military ordered him to get everyone out of the hospital; with no other choice, he complied. At the time, about 350 patients, caregivers, and health care workers were in the hospital. 

That night, the army stripped, shackled, blindfolded, and beat the male members of the medical staff, including Abu Safiya, as per the documentary. 

Abu Safiya has been detained in Israel's torture camps without charge ever since. Numerous human rights groups have demanded his release. 

Israel has launched a yearslong assault on Gaza's hospitals, health care workers, and patients. Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed more than 1,700 medical staff, attacked close to 40 hospitals, and abducted hundreds of health care workers. Israel's blockade has deprived doctors of necessary medical supplies, forcing them to perform operations, including amputations, without anesthesia. 

Those held in Israel's prisons, where soldiers routinely torture Palestinians, have included “irreplaceable consultants and specialists in essential specialities like General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Orthopaedics Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Cardiology, Paediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology,” according to a report released last year by Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), an organization that tracks Israel's systematic and brutal attacks on Gaza's health care system.

“Every healthcare worker who was interviewed by HWW following their release from detention in Israel described being subjected to severe pain and suffering while detained, in acts that amounted to inhumane treatment and torture,” the group wrote. 

Health care workers told HWW that they had been beaten; subjected to deafening music, sleep deprivation, and extreme cold; sexually assaulted with foreign objects; sexually humiliated; threatened with rape; and hung from ceilings. 

One nurse said that they were taken to a “10 x 6 metre room with four large loudspeakers and an air conditioner blasting extremely cold air, along with large fans.” (Truthout is using they/them pronouns to identify the individual victim as their gender is not shared in the report.)

“We were so cold and in so much pain that we couldn't stop moaning, but every time we made a sound, the soldiers would beat us,” the nurse said.

A paramedic told HWW when soldiers removed their blindfold, they saw at least 20 people in diapers, hanging from a warehouse ceiling. 

“[A]ll the detained had their heads down while they were hanging by their hands,” the paramedic said. “There were more than 10 more than 20, the whole warehouse had people hanged, everywhere I looked on the right, on the left, in front, in the back, it was an overwhelming number. From the screams it indicated dozens. He wanted me to see the torture and pain, he said this was only the first phase.”

Another paramedic said he was hung from the ceiling and electrocuted. 

“They put me in an overall that had electricity wires around it and put, like a headband with wires on my head,” they said. “I swear, it was so degrading, it was unbelievable. I was helping people as a paramedic, I never expected something like this.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            • All the missing have been accounted for, police said Monday, a day after a gunman rammed a truck into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan, began shooting, then set a fire that destroyed the building, sources have said.
    


            • Four people were killed and eight others injured in the attack during a Sunday morning service, police said. Some of the injured were shot, while others suffered from smoke inhalation, a doctor at a hospital where many were treated said in a Monday news conference.
    


            • The gunman was “take(n) down” by officers within minutes. Investigators identified him as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, who served with the Marines and was an Iraq War veteran. His family is cooperating as the FBI investigates the attack as an act of targeted violence.
    


            • The siege was among 324 mass shootings this year in the US and the latest place of worship – from a Catholic church in Minneapolis to a synagogue in Pittsburgh and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin – devastated by American gun violence.
    


            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has brought in one of its “world-renowned” specialized rapid response teams to investigate the church shooting and fire, officials said in a news conference Monday.
    


            The group, one of several National Response Teams maintained by the ATF, investigates large fires, explosions and bombings across the nation. These teams can include explosives specialists, bomb technicians, forensic chemists and canine handlers.
    


            “They have been used all over the world, and they come from places as far as California, Hawaii, and they're here in Michigan now,” ATF acting special agent in charge James Deir said.
    


            The team arrived Sunday night and is examining the scene, he added.
    


            National Response Teams have aided in some of the nation's most high-profile crisis investigations, including the 9/11 World Trade Center attack and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
    


            Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye described the church attack as an “evil act” but said the township would move forward.
    


            “This is not Grand Blanc. This does not define Grand Blanc and who we are,” Renye said during a news conference. “We are a community, and I am confident that together we're going to build a stronger community due to this incident.”
    


            Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were found at the scene of the attack, according to James Deir, acting special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Michigan.
    


            A bomb squad was assessing a suspicious item found on church property that was believed to be a possible IED, according to a source familiar with the incident, CNN has reported.
    


            “The FBI is investigating this as an act of targeted violence, and we are continuing to work to determine a motive,” said FBI acting special agent in charge Ruben Coleman.
    


            Investigators are working around the clock to follow up on leads, including public tips, Coleman said.
    


            “Our special agents, victim specialists, child advocates, forensic interviewers and local partners have interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses to date, and are continuing to interview individuals as we speak,” he added.
    


            Everyone has been accounted for following Sunday morning's mass shooting at a Michigan church, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said Monday.
    


            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her “heart is breaking by another mass shooting in a place that is supposed to be defined by togetherness.”
    


            “We've seen gun violence in our schools, stores, parades, festivals and our houses of worship. These are places that we go to feel connected, to feel safe, to be together,” the governor said Monday during an update on Sunday's attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township.
    


            “But today, this place has been shattered by bullets and broken glass. And this might be a familiar pain, but it hurts all the same every time.”
    


            The Democratic governor ordered flags lowered statewide.
    


            Whitmer also said she spoke with President Donald Trump, who shared his condolences Sunday.
    


            Authorities are holding a news conference at the Grand Blanc Township Police Department to provide an update on the investigation into Sunday's shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel that left four people dead.
    


            Federal and local agencies will provide updates, authorities said.
    


            A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints described seeing the church Monday morning, saying it feels like a “lifetime of memories is just gone.”
    


            Brandt Malone has been been going to the LDS church in Grand Blanc Township for many years, he told CNN.
    


            Malone said his wife and daughter had been at the church on Saturday night – the night before the shooting and fire – for a youth activity.
    


            “The hardest thing for our community right now is feeling like that security blanket has been ripped away,” Malone said.
    


            A Grand Blanc Township resident described Sunday's shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as “disturbing.”
    


            CNN's Leigh Waldman spoke with Jeff Caryl on Monday morning.
    


            Caryl, who lives about four houses down from the church, said he heard what he initially thought were firecrackers on Sunday morning, but it turned out to be gunfire.
    


            Thick black smoke filled the air, and Caryl said he saw flames reaching as high as 60 to 70 feet.
    


            “It just doesn't make sense,” Caryl said. “If you're a good human being, you don't pick on churches and schools and it's just disturbing to tie all that together.”
    


            Portions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints lay burned Monday morning, just 24 hours after a gunman set fire to the building and opened fire on worshippers.
    


            Video captured by CNN shows the remains of the building in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan.
    


Here's what the church looks like this morning:



            A man in a red car drove through a barricade midday Monday near where a gunman a day earlier rammed his pickup truck into a church, opened fire on congregants and then set the church ablaze.
    


            Photos of the red car show what appears to be a long gun in the front seat. That driver was taken into a law enforcement vehicle. His identity and motive were not immediately clear.
    


Four people were killed Sunday in the multipronged attack at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan. The gunman was killed in a shootout with police.
    


            Thomas Jacob Sanford, who authorities say was the gunman in Sunday morning's fatal shooting and fire at a Michigan church, was an Iraq War veteran and outdoorsman, according to military records and social media posts.
    


            Police say Sanford, 40, of Burton, Michigan, rammed his pickup truck into the front of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township before shooting at congregants with an assault rifle and, at some point, setting the building on fire. At least four people were killed and eight injured. Sanford died during an exchange of gunfire with police, authorities said.
    


            Authorities did not immediately provide a motive for the attack.
    


            A Marine Corps spokesperson told CNN that Sanford served as a sergeant and received several medals for his service, which lasted from 2004 to 2008. He was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom for several months starting in the summer of 2007.
    


            Sanford graduated from Goodrich High School in 2004 and was recognized among other veteran alumni, according to an archived page from the school's website. A local news profile of Sanford from 2007 said he was deployed with the US Marine Corps to Japan before preparing to head for service in Iraq.
    


            Social media accounts linked to Sanford's family show he was married with at least one child, a young son. According to a GoFundMe page from 2015, the family was in need of donations to help pay for the medical care of Sanford's son, who was born with a rare genetic disorder.
    


Read more about Sanford here. 



            Kris Johns, Burton city council candidate, near Michigan's Grand Blanc Township, spoke with a potential voter on the campaign trail — just days before that individual carried out a deadly attack on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel.
    


            “What are your thoughts on guns?” Thomas Jacob Sanford — the US Marine and Iraq War veteran who died at the scene of Sunday's shooting and arson — asked Johns just one week ago, the Burton candidate recalled to CNN. “What are your thoughts on Mormons?”
    


            Otherwise, the conversation wasn't political, Johns said.
    


            At least four people were killed, and several others were wounded after an attacker rammed his car into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, during a Sunday service, before opening fire on worshippers and setting a fire that destroyed the building.
    


            The gunman is dead and the motive remains unknown as federal officials investigate the incident as targeted violence.
    


            Authorities are still combing through debris.
    


The victims: At least two of the people who were killed died from gunshot wounds, according to police. Eight others were injured, including children, a source told CNN. Authorities said they believe they will find more victims after they secure the chapel, which is now a “total loss.” Up to seven people were still unaccounted for as authorities concluded search efforts on Sunday, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


The gunman: A 40-year-old man from Burton, Michigan, was identified as the shooter. The man used an assault rifle during the attack and was shot dead by police. Officials believe there is only one person involved.
    


The fire: Authorities believe the suspect “deliberately” set fire to the church using an accelerant. Some suspected explosive devices linked to the incident were also found. It's unclear if any explosives were also used to start the fire, authorities said.
    


The investigation: The FBI is investigating the incident as an “act of targeted violence.” The FBI's assumption of leadership in the case signals authorities have potentially uncovered violations of federal law. A search of the perpetrator's residence is underway and authorities are working to obtain search warrants for digital media that may help shed light on a motive, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            As of Sunday afternoon, there have been at least 324 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people – not counting the shooter – are shot.
    


            Sunday's attack at the church in Michigan followed another mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier: Saturday night, a gunman opened fire on a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, killing three people and injuring at least eight others.
    


            Sunday's attack occurred at a chapel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a religious faith with millions of followers that was founded in New York in the 19th century.

The directive labels common beliefs such as “anti-capitalist” opinions as terrorism “indicators.”

With the mainstream media distracted by the made-for-TV drama of James Comey's indictment, Trump has signed a little-noticed national security directive identifying “anti-Christian” and “anti-American” views as indicators of radical left violence. Called National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, it's being referred to as “NSPM-7” by administration insiders.

“This is the first time in American history that there is an all-of-government effort to dismantle left wing terrorism,” Trump's homeland security advisor Stephen Miller said, referring to the issuance.

To the extent that the major media noticed the directive at all, they (even C-SPAN!) incorrectly labeled it an “executive order,” like last week's designation of “Antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization.

It's hard to overstate how much different NSPM-7 is from the over 200 executive orders Trump has frantically signed since coming back into office.

An executive order publicly lays out the course of day-to-day federal government operations; whereas a national security directive is a sweeping policy decree for the defense, foreign policy, intelligence, and law enforcement apparatus. National security directives are often secret, but in this case the Trump administration chose to publish NSPM-7 — only the seventh since he's come into office.)

Previous national security directives have been controversial, even politically earthshaking. In 1980, for example, President Jimmy Carter signed the Top Secret Presidential Directive 59 (“PD-59”) directing new nuclear warfighting policies that persisted until the end of the Cold War. When revealed, PD-59 caused a public furor.

Similarly, President George W. Bush signed a series of classified national security directives after 9/11, the most famous of which authorized NSA's unlawful domestic intercepts, a directive that wasn't publicly revealed until four years later.

In NSPM-7, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” President Trump directs the Justice Department, the FBI, and other national security agencies and departments to fight his version of political violence in America, retooling a network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces to focus on “leftist” political violence in America. This vast counterterrorism army, made up of federal, state, and local agents would, as Trump aide Stephen Miller said, form “the central hub of that effort.”

NSPM-7 directs a new national strategy to “disrupt” any individual or groups “that foment political violence,” including “before they result in violent political acts.”

In other words, they're targeting pre-crime, to reference Minority Report.

The Trump administration isn't only targeting organizations or groups but even individuals and “entities” whom NSPM-7 says can be identified by any of the following “indicia” (indicators) of violence:

“The United States requires a national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies before they result in violent political acts,” the directive states (emphasis mine).

A “pre-crime” endeavor, preventing attacks before they happen, is core to the post-9/11 concept of counterterrorism itself. No longer satisfied to investigate acts of terrorism after the fact to bring terrorists to justice, the Bush administration adopted preemption. Overseas, that led to aerial assassination by drones and “special operations” kill missions. Domestically, it led to a counter-terrorism campaign whose hallmark was excessive and illegal government surveillance and the use of undercover agents and “confidential human sources” to trap (and entrap) would-be terrorists.

Now, with Donald Trump's directive retooling the counter-terror apparatus to go after Americans at home, this means monitoring political activity, or speech, as an investigative method to discover “radicalism.” (Contrary to other national security documents all during the post-Watergate era, NSPM-7 doesn't even mention the First Amendment or the fundamental right of Americans to organize and protest.)

The focus on speech is evident throughout NSPM-7. The directive says that political violence is the result of “organized campaigns” that often begin (with the left) dehumanizing targets in “anonymous chat foras, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions.”

To give a sense of how broad this formulation is, Trump's earlier designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist group was accompanied by a White House fact sheet singling out people who “celebrated” Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. As I wrote at the time, this describes a lot of Americans!

Trump's new national security memorandum also alludes to Mangione but adds to it even larger categories of potential targets.

NSPM-7 is fundamentally a law enforcement directive, and it dispenses with the complications of using the active duty military or the National Guard in pursuit of political violence. It directs the Department of Justice to focus the FBI's approximately 200 Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) to the new mission. The FBI network of task forces comprises over 4,000 members — including FBI personnel and task force officers (or TFOs) from more than 500 state and local agencies and 50 federal agencies, including special agents, police officers, intelligence analysts and surveillance technicians. First established in New York City in 1980 to systematize FBI and NYPD cooperation, today there are task forces around the country, including at least one in each of the FBI's 55 field offices.

For the Trump White House, the beauty of using an already existing network is that it bypasses Congressional oversight and scrutiny and even obscures federal activity to governors and legislatures at the state level. States, cities, and local police have already signed Memoranda of Agreements with the feds to fight terrorism and officers are already assigned as task force officers.

NSPM-7 says the JTTFs “shall investigate” potential federal crimes relating to “acts of recruiting or radicalizing persons” for the purpose of “political violence, terrorism, or conspiracy against rights; and the violent deprivation of any citizen's rights.” It authorizes the JTTFs to investigate individuals, organizations, and funders “responsible for, sponsor, or otherwise aid and abet the principal actors engaging in the criminal conduct.”

“The Attorney General shall issue specific guidance that ensures domestic terrorism priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder,” NSPM-7 says. Civil disorder?

I don't want to sound hyperbolic but the plain truth is that NSPM-7 is a declaration of war on anyone who does not support the Trump administration and its agenda. Yes, it repeats the word “violent” over and over to purport only to go after citizens who are moved to take up arms, but it also directs monitoring and intelligence collection to map and target the new “evildoers,” to borrow a Bush label he took from the Bible just days after 9/11.

The partisan focus couldn't be more obvious.

“The real problem is this: since Charlie [Kirk] was murdered — a friend of mine, assassinated — nothing's changed on their side,” White House counter-terrorism czar Sebastian Gorka told Newsmax after NSPM-7 was signed. “Not one leader — not one left wing thought leader, member of Congress, Senator — nobody has said we distance ourselves from the violent rhetoric.”

“The left refuses to rid themselves of the justification for violence,” Gorka continued, “and as such, President Trump is taking measures to protect us from the violent rhetoric that becomes snipers and bullets.”

Church set ablaze on weekend when shooting attacks also took place in North Carolina, Texas and New Orleans. Plus, the secrets of Birkenstock's enduring success

Good morning.

At least four people were killed and eight others injured after a gunman opened fire at a Mormon church in Michigan and then set the building ablaze, authorities said.

Two of the shooting victims died and eight others were hospitalised, officials said initially, while the gunman was shot dead by police. Several hours after the shooting, police reported finding at least two more bodies in the charred remains of the church, which had not yet been cleared and may contain other victims.

The police chief of Grand Blanc Township, William Renye, said a 40-year-old male suspect drove a vehicle through the front door of the church yesterday morning, got out and began firing an assault rifle at hundreds of church attenders.

Was it the only mass shooting this weekend? No, the shooting happened during a particularly violent weekend in the US and marked the 324th mass shooting in the US in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Multiple mass shootings – cases in which four or more people are shot or killed – were reported in the US in public places including in North Carolina, Texas and New Orleans.

Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention, as revealed in a stark new court filing.

Legal experts able to witness conditions made a barrage of allegations about deprivations, violations of legally agreed basic detention standards and humanitarian concerns at the only known Ice center currently holding families.

At the facility in Dilley, a small town an hour south-west of San Antonio, children and their parents described a “prison-like environment” and said they lived in “cell-like trailers”.

What did the facility say? The facility, which is run by the private corrections and detention company CoreCivic, directed the Guardian to Ice for comment, which in turn directed the Guardian to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency, though a report from Ice's juvenile coordinator said the agency was complying with legal requirements. Comment was requested from DHS but a response was not received prior to publication.

The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, announced yesterday that he is abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day, delivering the message in a social media video set to the strains of My Way.

Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a Democrat but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were then dropped by the Trump administration in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.

What did he say about his decision to drop out? In his video statement, Adams said that it had been impossible for him to mount a winning campaign, blaming “constant media speculation about my future” and a decision by the city's campaign finance board to withhold millions of dollars in matching funds over suspicious donations.

Israel has pressed on with its offensive in Gaza as Donald Trump claimed again to be on the brink of a breakthrough in ceasefire negotiations for the devastated territory. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is visiting the White House on Monday, after telling Fox News Sunday that Israel was working on a new ceasefire plan with the US.

The indictment of the former FBI director James Comey is part of a concerted effort by Donald Trump to “rewrite history” in his favor, a former senior White House lawyer claimed yesterday.

The Taliban yesterday freed a US citizen from an Afghan prison, weeks after they said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations.

More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign tomorrow, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. Workers have described how months of “fear and intimidation” left them feeling like they had no choice but to depart.

Louisiana v Callais is a major challenge to what remains of the Voting Rights of Act of 1965, and could radically rework the structure of political representation in the United States. A successful challenge to the VRA would allow the Republican party to further cheat democracy by engaging in even more partisan gerrymandering.

In 1993, Tim Berners-Lee convinced his managers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) to donate the intellectual property of the world wide web, putting it into the public domain. He writes: “We gave the web away to everyone. Today, I look at my invention and I am forced to ask: is the web still free today? On many platforms, we are no longer the customers, but instead have become the product.”

Food and agriculture contribute one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions – second only to the burning of fossil fuels. And yet the vast majority of media coverage of the climate crisis overlooks this critical sector, according to a new data analysis from Sentient Media.

When two brothers called Johannes and Johann Adam Birkenstock began making shoes in a tiny hamlet near Frankfurt in the 1770s, they could never have imagined what they were starting. Birkenstock now sells tens of millions of pairs of shoes every year. How did a brand described even by some of its fans as the world's ugliest shoe become one of the world's most popular?

I deeply value free speech and debate. The watchlist created by Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA is anathema to both.

After the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk — one that I unequivocally found to be unconscionable, unacceptable, and sickening — I thought about his wife and children. I am married, and I have children. I can't imagine the unspeakable sorrow that Kirk's wife and children must be experiencing. So, I will continue to mourn his death and their loss. I do so because I believe in love, forgiveness, and the sanctity of human life. I also believe in the First Amendment. So, here we are.

In the aftermath of Kirk's tragic death, a great deal is being discussed now about his legacy regarding free speech and open debate. What I have to offer to readers in this regard is my own very personal experience of the organization that Kirk founded — Turning Point USA (TPUSA).

In 2016, TPUSA produced an online list titled “Professor Watchlist,” a site designed to identify professors who purportedly “discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” I don't “teach leftist propaganda in the classroom,” and I never discriminate against conservative students, but I was nevertheless placed on the list soon after its creation in 2016, apparently because I am a philosopher who examines the complex ways in which white people are socially and psychically complicit in the perpetuation of anti-Black racism in the United States.

There's no way for me to know whether or to what extent my placement on the Professor Watchlist extended or intensified the ongoing avalanche of racist threats and slurs that I had already started receiving after I published an open letter in The New York Times in 2015 titled “Dear White America” — a letter that sought to challenge the racist “innocence” of white people and was the source that Turning Point USA cited as grounds for placing me on their watchlist. But being placed on the Professor Watchlist undoubtedly magnified the feelings of trepidation and outrage created by the racist invective constantly pouring down on me throughout that time.

In response to “Dear White America,” I received an ongoing series of hate messages via email, voice message, and postal mail such as:

“Dear N***** Professor… You're a f***ing smug N*****. You are uneducated with education. You are a f***ing animal. Just like all Black people in the United States of America.”

“Hey Georgie boy… You wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for affirmative action. Somebody needs to put a boot up your ass and knock your f***ing head off your shoulders…”

“There are two ways you can return to Africa: On a passenger ship, or in a coffin freighter. Choose quickly.”

“In a sane world, this ugly n***** would be just beheaded ISIS style. Make America WHITE Again.”

With apologies to those who already encounter this kind of triggering hate speech regularly and do not need more of it in their lives, I reprint these examples here to show the ways in which there is a failure of vulnerability to truly listen to those deemed “the other,” dreams of returning to a white mythical past of “racial purity,” an unabashed ascendancy of white nationalism, political disinformation about white “victimhood,” an intentional disregard for civic responsibility, and an intentional fomentation of hatred by a Trumpian regime hell-bent on creating and exacerbating racial, political, and religious divisiveness. All of this is at the heart of what is actually shutting down space for civil debate and free speech in this country.

My personal experience underscores how projects such as this watchlist are not really about protecting “civil debate” and “free speech,” as some of Kirk's fans have argued.

And my personal experience of receiving this ongoing avalanche of hate in response to publishing an op-ed, and then being placed on the TPUSA's Professor Watchlist as an additional response to the same op-ed, underscores how projects such as this watchlist are not really about protecting “civil debate” and “free speech,” as some of Kirk's fans have argued.

The process through which I was placed on TPUSA's list was anathema to public debate. Instead of writing an op-ed in response to my New York Times op-ed, or inviting me to a public debate on these issues, TPUSA instead added me to an online list that is — as I explained in another New York Times op-ed back in 2016 — essentially a new species of McCarthyism.

I would never dream of subjecting the people I disagree with most vehemently to a list like this. I have no desire to create a watchlist that monitors conservatives and fuels their public denial or subjects them to violent retribution; I don't believe in shaming entire groups of people or targeting individuals through a list such as this.

The list — a dangerous and antidemocratic tool — follows a draconian playbook by spying on professors and labeling them as “troublemakers” for the U.S. establishment. It is a site for surveillance, control, name-calling. Functioning like a modern-day scarlet letter, the list can lead to ostracization, condemnation, and even the practice of self-silencing (because of the fear of being the object of actual or potential violence) for those who are placed on it.

Before placing me on this list, no one from TPUSA asked to speak with me. Kirk never asked to debate me about my views on whiteness, white privilege, or white embodiment. In being placed on the list, I was falsely labeled and marked in ways that are not true. I have recently listened to clips of Kirk complaining that there are those who didn't listen to him; in the clips he expresses frustrations about times when others just made assumptions about things that he didn't say, or distorted what he meant by what he said.

I understand his point because that's exactly what his organization, TPUSA, did to me. I was placed on the list without a mumbling word about making sure that I was given democratic space to debate my position on whiteness. TPUSA sought to tar and ostracize me as an “enemy” of conservative thought without first inviting me for civil debate.

Kirk and I would have had much to debate if our engagement had involved an in-person conversation rather than his organization simply placing me on a McCarthyist shunning list. It appears that we disagreed on many topics.

For example, though Kirk never said that all Black women lack “the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,” he did accuse Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson as “lacking” such brain processing power. All these women are Black and all of them graduated from Ivy League schools. So, what was the basis for Kirk's insult? He can't simply make such an egregious claim without that claim being mediated by the history of anti-Black racism. Indeed, his accusation was loaded with white racist overtones. So as not to miss Kirk's nuance, he says these women lack such brain power because they have benefited from affirmative action. He says they stole “a white person's slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.” The assumption that because they may have benefitted from affirmative action they are therefore not bright enough is a blatant non sequitur. He assumes that affirmative action involves the automatic lowering of standards. Affirmative action was never designed to discriminate, but to create an equitable playing field. To hold this position about brain power and affirmative action, it would follow, based upon Kirk's reasoning, that white women, the group that has benefited most from affirmative action, are also cognitively incompetent.

Similarly, when asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), Kirk responded, “Obviously [DEI is] about trying to destroy the excellence of the country and elevating racial tribal politics.”I'm not cherry picking here. Notice that he says, “obviously.” But to whom is this “obvious”? Certainly not to Black people, who have been enslaved in this country longer than we have been “free.” But let's face it, the United States was founded upon white racial tribal politics. 

Kirk also problematically raised the issue of race, affirmative action, and DEI while clarifying a statement that he made about Black pilots. Originally, his comment was within the context of United Airlines saying that it wanted 50 percent of its pilots to be people of color or women, which still disproportionately favors white men. Kirk went on to talk about how there are relaxed standards anytime there are racial quotas. And he extended his reasoning to air traffic controllers, professors, and college admissions.

He later clarified, “Boy, if I see a Black pilot, I'm now going to wonder is that individual qualified or were they selected because of their race.” He went on to assert that he had this thought not because of who he is, but because affirmative action and DEI hiring practices made him think that way.

Here's the problem. Being a qualified Black pilot and benefitting from affirmative action or DEI hiring practices are not mutually exclusive. When I've seen a Black pilot, I don't “hope” that they can fly the plane. I'm proud to see them. And if they have benefitted from affirmative action or DEI, this in no way creates trepidation for me about their qualifications. I am fine with the fact that United Airlines cares both about making sure some pilots are Black and also making sure that those same pilots are well-qualified.

This is a conjunction that Kirk rejected. Kirk also didn't seem to understand why United Airlines would be concerned with the color of the skin of the pilot. To wonder about this is to pretend ignorance about white supremacy in this country. Since Kirk didn't address this, I will. Actually, it is Kirk who was concerned with the color of the skin of pilots. His concern was part of the perpetuation of white racism and had everything to do with the whiteness of the skin of those pilots who have dominated aviation. United Airlines does not hire based upon racial quotas, which are illegal. Its aim was merely to open possibilities and opportunities for those who have been systemically and systematically excluded from the field and from the cockpit.

I hope that articulating my disagreements with Kirk here isn't interpreted as a virulent attack. I just think that he was wrong on these issues. In a functional democracy, to disagree with someone is a politically protected right, and it ought to be productive of greater mutual understanding and clarity. In fact, philosophically and democratically, agonism (a creative tension between interlocutors) is to be valued and treasured. In his book The Multivoiced Body, philosopher Fred Evans argues that agonism exemplifies an enduring creative interplay between voices, “not a reaction to enemies.” 

To engage in critique and productive disagreement should be the lifeblood of a democracy, and of this fragile experiment known as U.S. democracy. Yet, Donald Trump, JD Vance, Stephen Miller, and many right-wing activists are using the tragic occasion of Kirk's murder to foment retribution on those who disagree publicly with Kirk's views. Indeed, they are effectively and anti-democratically weaponizing the death of Kirk.  

Trump and his sycophants are implementing political repression, censorship, and politically targeting free speech, which means that those of us who believe in democratic speech, in dissent, in open and critical debate, are being targeted, are being silenced, are being marked for further violence. This is not new for Trump. As someone who aspires to be a political strongman, his modus operandi is to threaten to use government power to imprison and to prosecutethose who he sees as his political enemies, despite it being unconstitutional. The Justice Department is not, or should not be, a political tool to be wielded against one's perceived or real political rivals.

The soul of this country is at stake, if it has a soul worth saving. I don't say this flippantly. I say this because I mean it, and I am serious about it. I say it because I refuse to feign ignorance about what is happening to this country before our eyes. It is becoming increasingly fascistic. Is it now a crime to use that term, to speak freely? If it is, then that only confirms the truth that I speak.

The reactionary call for blood and collective punishment after the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk is a form of ethical debauchery and warmongering. For those who encourage it, especially those who identify as “Christians,” you might as well spit in the face of Jesus. Some of us — many of us — detest the murder of Kirk, even as we passionately disagree with his politics. I am one of those. As Frantz Fanon writes in Black Skin, White Masks, “Today I believe in the possibility of love; that is why I endeavor to trace its imperfections, its perversions.”

My question is, what do you believe in?

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Investigation to come after body was found by maintenance workers at Charlotte airport after flight arrived from Europe

Airplane maintenance workers at a North Carolina airport found the body of a suspected stowaway in the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight that had recently arrived from Europe, police said.

The body was found on Sunday morning while the plane was undergoing maintenance at Charlotte Douglas international airport. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department said in a statement that it is investigating the death.

Neither the airline nor police have offered information about the person who died, including a possible cause of death, or said where the flight originated.

The airport said it was deeply saddened by the discovery and that it will support the police investigation. American Airlines said it was working with law enforcement on its investigation and directed questions to police.

Experts believe roughly three-quarters of stowaways do not survive if they hide on a plane's undercarriage because of the extreme cold and lack of oxygen they experience as the plane reaches cruising altitude.

In January, two bodies were found in the landing gear compartment of a JetBlue aircraft at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood international airport. The bodies were discovered in the wheel well area during a routine post-flight inspection.

The aircraft had arrived in Fort Lauderdale shortly after flight from John F Kennedy international airport in New York. The jet had been in both Kingston, Jamaica, and Salt Lake City, Utah, earlier that day.

In December, a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane after it landed in Maui from Chicago.

Trump and Republicans are unfazed at prospect of shutdown, and talks with Democrats are anticipated to be confrontational

US politics – latest updates

Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for a crunch White House meeting with Donald Trump in an 11th-hour bid to avert a potentially damaging federal government shutdown.

Monday's gathering is aimed at reaching an agreement over funding the government and largely hinges on Democrat demands for an extension of funding subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, beyond the end of the year, when they are due to expire.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, and Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate, will meet Trump along with their Republican counterparts, Mike Johnson, the House speaker, and John Thune, the Senate majority leader, for talks that are expected to be tense if not confrontational.

It will be Trump's first meeting with the two Democrats since his return to the White House in January. Jeffries and Trump have never previously met in person.

Expectations for the encounter are low, with failure likely to result in large swathes of the federal government shutting down from 1 October.

Trump and the Republicans have signaled that they are unfazed at that prospect, calculating that the public will blame Democrat intransigence.

The White House office of management and budget (OMB) has also indicated that it will exploit a shutdown to carry out more mass firings as part of its crusade to slash government bureaucracy.

An OMB memorandum said government agencies have been instructed “use this opportunity to consider reduction in force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities”, The Hill reported.

Republicans have also warned that Trump could make a shutdown politically costly by targeting spending programmes that are disproportionately used by Democrat-run states and cities.

CBS, citing a source close to Trump, reported that he privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it would “enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries”.

“I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,” Trump told the network in a telephone interview. “They [the Democrats] are not interested in waste, fraud and abuse.”

Some Democrats have acknowledged that they have “no good options” in trying to end the standoff.

“It's doubly made no good because it's very clear that Republicans want [a shutdown]. Trump wants it. He's fine with that, happy to have it,” The Hill quoted a Democratic Senate aide as saying.. “I don't really know what your good option here is when they want one.”

However, Schumer is under pressure to be seen taking a more actively confrontational stance after being fiercely criticized by fellow Democrats for backing a Republican funding packing in March to avert an earlier government shutdown.

With Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican senator, likely to vote against the funding package, it would need the support of eight Democrats to overcome a Senate filibuster.

Bad Bunny will bring his Latin trap and reggaeton swagger to the NFL's biggest stage next year: The Grammy winner will headline the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show in Northern California.

The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California.

The Puerto Rican superstar's selection comes amid another career-defining run: He's fresh off a historic Puerto Rico residency this month that drew more than half a million fans and is leading all nominees at the Latin Grammys in November. He has become one of the world's most streamed artists with albums such as Un Verano Sin Ti, an all-Spanish-language LP.

Bad Bunny will host Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4.

“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement. “It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”

Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honoured to have him on the world's biggest stage.”

The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as Bullet Train, Caught Stealing and Happy Gilmore 2, and collaborated with top fashion houses. He'll enter the Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera.

Roc Nation and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show. Hamish Hamilton will serve as director.

“We know his dynamic performances, creative vision, and deep connection with fans will deliver the kind of unforgettable experience we've come to expect from this iconic cultural moment,” said Jon Barker, SVP of Global Event Production for the NFL.

Last year, Kendrick Lamar shined with guest SZA in New Orleans, setting the record for the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show with 133.5 million viewers. His performance surpassed the audience for Michael Jackson's 1993 show.

“His music has not only broken records but has elevated Latin music to the center of pop-culture and we are thrilled to once again partner with the NFL and Roc Nation to deliver this historic performance to millions of fans worldwide,” said Oliver Schusser, the vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “We know this show will be unforgettable.”

MOSCOW, September 29. /TASS/. The European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), along with its two related protocols, are no longer valid in Russia due to the refusal of the Council of Europe to provide Russia's representation in the organization's statutory bodies, according to a law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.

At the same time, the Russian authorities will continue to combat human rights violations by applying national legislation in this area.

"Denounce the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of November 26, 1987 and Protocols No. 1 and No. 2 of November 4, 1993 thereto, signed on behalf of the Russian Federation in Strasbourg on February 28, 1996," the newly-signed law reads.

State Duma (the lower house of the Russian Parliament) Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin pointed out earlier that Russia's work in the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture "has been blocked by the Council of Europe itself, which has not allowed the election of a new Russian member to the committee since December 2023."

The explanatory note to the bill stipulated that these "discriminatory circumstances" violate Russia's representative rights in the European Committee and undermine the mutual monitoring mechanism for compliance with international obligations in the field of torture prevention, "which is why it is proposed to denounce the said convention and its protocols."

The Russian government previously submitted a proposal to the Russian president on denouncing the convention. Russia, which has been a member of the Council of Europe since 1996, announced its intention to withdraw from it in 2022, after the organization's Committee of Ministers suspended Moscow's right to representation in the Council of Europe's statutory bodies.

At that time, Russia notified the Council's secretary of its withdrawal and denunciation of the key document of the Council of Europe - the European Convention on Human Rights.

Since that time, Moscow has been gradually denouncing the documents of the Council of Europe, as current circumstances make enforcing them impossible.

At the same time, the Russian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they will not abandon their international obligations to combat crimes and human rights violations, actively enforcing national legislation in this sphere.

If the Trump administration forces me to transfer to a men's prison, I question whether I will make it out alive.

Whenever a natural disaster is headed towards the prison where I am incarcerated, we all joke that we are in a fortress: safe because nothing can get in and no one can get out. But on January 25, 2025, I was reminded that outside disasters affect us here, too. That day, the Bureau of Prisons flipped my life upside down.

It was a cold Saturday morning, and the rest of the women and I were catching up on sleep. I awoke to banging on my door.

“Get up and get dressed!” a voice yelled.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

I began frantically asking where I was going. My bunkie woke up and tried to assure me that I was probably being drug tested or taken on a medical trip; she told me that I would be back shortly.

“A medical trip on the weekend? No way,” I thought to myself.

I threw on a coat and exited my room to find not one, not two, but three male officers waiting for me. Something was not right. One of the officers told me to place my hands behind my back. The cold metal of handcuffs hugged my wrists, and my heart began to echo my mind's suspicions. But the officers kept talking, claiming that they did not know what was happening, as they escorted my trembling body to the place no prisoner wants to go: the Special Housing Unit (SHU), solitary confinement.

Once inside, I was made to strip, squat, and cough, before being handed a thin orange jumpsuit. I wondered if I was dreaming, or having a flashback to when I was first arrested. Hours went by slowly as I stood in a holding cell with nothing but my racing thoughts, a stool, and a cage door facing the officer's station. A nurse, an officer, and a counselor walked by. I asked the same question, again and again. They said they didn't know why I was there. They casually told me to calm down; the lieutenant would be here shortly to explain.

Upon the lieutenant's arrival I begged for an explanation.

“Look,” she said. “Ever since Trump got back into office there have been many changes.”

And that's when I knew: The “rumors” I'd heard about Trump sending transgender women to men's prisons were not rumors after all. My bunkie and I had recently laughed about the crazy idea of me sharing a room with a man, but this situation was no joke.

“He signed an executive order recognizing only two genders,” the lieutenant continued. “We're sending you to a men's facility.”

That's when I let out a noise from deep inside my soul that I had never heard a human make before. Everything froze as my perception of time slowed. Seconds turned into hours as tears ran from my eyes.

“This has to be a mistake!” I began screaming. “I'm a woman, an aunt, I'm my mother's daughter!”

I leaned against the wall and slid onto the dirty floor, my physical self mirroring how low my mental self felt. “I can't go to a men's prison!” I screamed. “They will rape me to death!”

“We're sorry, there is nothing we can do. His new executive orders are affecting us as well,” the lieutenant told me. “I will give you a phone call to alert your family before we pack up your property for transfer.”

Within seconds, my temporary prison term became a potential death sentence, handed over by the president. All for merely existing.

I always thought that if I just minded my own business, educated myself, and kept my faith strong, I would eventually leave prison and return to my family in one piece. Now, I questioned whether I would even make it out alive.

My family and I immigrated to this country from Bosnia after we escaped the genocide in the 1990s. We were chasing the “American dream,” which, for me, had included my gender transition at 24 years old. I never believed that in 2025 the American government could put one of its own citizens in grave danger just for being themselves, or that being trans would constitute a death penalty.

Everything I believed was clearly wrong.

After being assigned to a cell in the SHU, I was granted my phone call. My mother already suspected that something evil had happened because my bunkie called to notify her that her daughter had been taken away somewhere. She broke down as I explained what happened. Her screams echoed my earlier words. “But you're a woman!” she cried. “You're my daughter. How can they do this?”

I had to end the phone call as she tried reassuring me that our family would find a solution.

Days went by as my hope disappeared and suicidal thoughts invaded my mind.

“I'll kill myself before I allow the government to do it,” I thought.

The following week slowly passed without relief. Finally, one afternoon, God whispered to me, telling me to finally rest. Yet once again, I was woken up by someone banging on my door. “Get your stuff, you're going back onto the compound!” the captain yelled.

I never imagined that I would be so excited to go back to prison. I rolled up everything within seconds and grabbed my mat. Apparently, the psychology department and central office had spoken and decided to let me stay – for now.

I found out that a lot happened in the days following my life-altering SHU experience. GLAAD had connected my family with a team of lawyers that, to this day, are fighting for my life, struggling to keep me from ever stepping foot into a men's prison. At the time of this writing, a federal judge has granted a temporary injunction requiring the Bureau of Prisons to keep me at a women's facility. I pray it will be made permanent.

Random women I'd never spoken to have approached me to tell me that they prayed for me after hearing the news, affirming that I belong with women and not men.

But none of this keeps the nightmares away. I have constant, graphic night terrors of men in prison uniforms raping and killing me. I have had to start mental health medication to minimize the debilitating panic attacks I now suffer every time I hear keys rattling at night.

While in prison, I have learned to choose my battles. I can roll my eyes at some petty issues. But others are so serious that they have to be treated as long, uphill struggles for change. The battle I'm in right now is for my very existence. By the grace of God, I have an army of kind people supporting me on my way to the top of the hill. I do not know what the future holds for me, but I believe that love will always trump hate. And for that belief, I am thankful.

            Before a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular disease hit, there are almost always warning signs, according to a new study.
    


            Those warning signs are well-known cardiovascular disease risk factors, but more can still be done to reduce cases of heart disease, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
    


            For this study, researchers analyzed data from two groups: more than 600,000 cases of cardiovascular disease in South Korea and another 1,000 cases in the United States.
    


Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies. Here's how to be part of one



            Researchers analyzed what percentage of those cases were preceded by traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including blood pressure levels, blood sugar, cholesterol and smoking.
    


            In more than 99% of cases of cardiovascular disease, heart failure or stroke, the patient had at least one of the risk factors before the incident occurred, according to the data.
    


            “Even ‘mild' elevations of these 4 factors should be addressed with lifestyle treatments or medications,” said Dr. Philip Greenland, one of the study's lead authors, in an email. He is also a professor of preventive medicine and the Harry W. Dingman Professor of Cardiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
    


            The new study is particularly important because it reinforces that doctors and patients can manage the risk factors for almost all cases of heart disease, said Dr. Susan Cheng, professor and vice chair of research affairs in the department of cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was not involved in the research.
    


            Some research has suggested that a growing number of cardiovascular disease cases have no traditional indicators of risk beforehand. That could imply that although the health care profession has addressed the factors you can control, other elements researchers don't yet understand could be a factor, and so they don't have good prevention strategies to offer, Cheng added.
    


            What differentiates this research, she said, is that scientists did not rely solely on a diagnosis of diabetes or high blood pressure to determine if the risk factors were present –– they looked at the patients' medical data.
    


Making these lifestyle changes reduces chronic disease, even if you have a genetic risk



            Sometimes, just because someone isn't labeled as having high blood pressure or high blood sugar doesn't mean their levels don't indicate risk factors. And by looking at the broader scope of medical data, these researchers found that almost all the cases did have traditional, modifiable risks in their chart before developing cardiovascular disease, Cheng said.
    


            So, if clinicians and patients want to mitigate heart disease risk, the best course of action is likely to continue encouraging management of risk factors like blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, she said.
    


            The medical field has learned a lot about heart disease in the past century, and the common knowledge on how to prevent it has been consistent for many years, said Dr. Karen Joynt Maddox, professor of medicine in cardiology at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, Missouri. She was not involved in the research.
    


            But still, implementing those changes continues to prove difficult. Part of the problem is often the abstract nature of heart disease risk, Joynt Maddox said.
    


Some added sugar sources are worse than others for disease risk, study suggests



            When a patient has a disease, it is easier to motivate making changes and implementing treatments to address what they are dealing with, she said. But it is harder to effectively communicate the importance of taking steps to address the very real risks a person faces for a disease down the line.
    


            Another roadblock is that adding medications or other protocols to address heart disease risk can be associated with the aging process, which can feel scary and unappealing to some patients, said Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was not involved in the research.
    


            Instead, he thinks of it as steps toward longevity. Managing blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol doesn't mean you are losing things — it means you are taking steps to preserve your lifespan and health span, creating more years for yourself to feel young and do the things that have meaning for you, he said.
    


            While the risk factors for cardiovascular disease have remained consistent, the technology for managing them has evolved.
    


            Managing high blood pressure is often a good place to start, and just getting a blood pressure cuff means you can get a sense of your levels at home, Joynt Maddox said. Then, work with your doctor to keep an eye on your risk factors and make a plan for management.
    


            In addition to the clinical risk factors studied in the research, it is also important to improve your lifestyle risk factors, Tawakol said.
    


            Maintaining good sleep, exercise, nutrition, a healthy weight and low levels of stress are key to lowering cardiovascular disease risk, he said.
    


            “For example, stress and depression turn out to be as potent risk factors as smoking and diabetes,” Tawakol said.
    


            “I'm hoping that the more we double down and show the efficacy of treating all these things together, that more people will combine these approaches and actually enjoy much longer health spans.”

MOSCOW, September 29. /TASS/. Although a war between Russia and Europe is unlikely, Russia should still stay vigilant, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

"Scenarios of a war with Russia in the next five years are peddled to people from every newsstand in Europe. It just cannot be," the politician wrote, adding that "the likelihood of a fatal accident happening always exists." So, he recommended being "on alert."

"And such a conflict is fraught with an absolutely real risk of escalating into a war using weapons of mass destruction," the senior Russian security official concluded.

Some of the world's biggest investors are looking beyond a boom in artificial intelligence to longer-term spending by governments tackling geopolitical, technological and demographic pressures set to reshape markets over the next few years.

Asset managers are spreading bets across infrastructure, energy transition, healthcare and defence, to capitalize on fiscal stimulus from governments, even as Wall Street debates whether the AI-powered rally in stocks is sustainable.

As concerns over some countries' ballooning fiscal debts draw attention, many investors “underestimated the impact that (stimulus) could have on real and financial assets,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.

Hafele told the Reuters Global Markets Forum his firm, which oversees US$4.5-trillion in assets, is “investing thematically along with what governments are doing,” diversifying into areas such as power, resources, healthcare and defence.

July's sweeping U.S. tax-cut and spending bill will add trillions to government debt by extending tax cuts from U.S. President Donald Trump's first term, ramping up funding for border security and defence, and trimming Medicare and Medicaid.

Europe's fiscal support is just as dramatic, with sentiment boosted by Germany's 500-billion-euro (US$586-billion) infrastructure fund exempt from its strict debt brake and NATO members' pledges to lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP.

“Fiscal stimulus is always a big element of the performance of the financial markets,” said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Asset Management, which manages US$430-billion in assets.

The magnitude and persistence of these fiscal commitments on both sides of the Atlantic were unprecedented compared to previous market cycles, he said, adding that the structural realignment they drive would last for years.

“It takes time before those moneys actually percolate (through) the system ... before you see them becoming reality,” Cavarero said.

Nuclear power, energy infrastructure, biotech innovation and defence were industries that “cannot be ignored by the market,” he added, while warning, “At some point, we will need to deal with these debts.”

A rise of nearly 14 per cent this year in the S&P 500 index has largely been powered by AI-related momentum, versus more modest gains of 9.5 per cent in Europe's benchmark STOXX 600.

But the aerospace and defence index .SXPARO of the latter has surged almost 68 per cent, showing that fiscal priorities are lifting defence and industrial plays even in a broader market environment still dominated by AI.

Saira Malik, chief investment officer at U.S. asset manager Nuveen, which manages $1.3 trillion in assets, expects equity gains to broaden beyond the U.S. tech-heavy trade to cyclical sectors, small-caps and value plays.

“U.S. outperformance is not the only game in town this year, thanks to a weaker dollar,” she said.

Malik advised investors to stay balanced, but with a tilt toward U.S. markets. “I don't think investors should just own U.S. (assets) at the expense of everything else, but I would fully argue against betting against the U.S.”

Malik also sees opportunities in infrastructure, utilities and waste management, describing them as resilient and effective hedges against inflation.

Both UBS and Nuveen stressed active management over passive bets. “It's less of a time for beta and more of a time for active investing,” Haefele said.

Washington has authorized specific instances where Ukraine can carry out long-range strikes within Russia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said on Sept. 28 in an interview with Fox News.

"The answer is yes, use the ability to hit deep, there are no such things as sanctuaries," Kellogg replied when asked if it is U.S. President Donald Trump's position that Ukraine can conduct long-range strikes.

President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly asked Trump to supply Kyiv with Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles during a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last week.

The U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28.

The final decision on whether Ukraine may conduct long-range strikes within Russia falls to Trump on a case-by-case basis, Kellogg noted.

As Ukraine develops long-range missiles and drones of its own, Kyiv continues to rely on weapons provided by its allies to conduct such strikes, which often require authorization from the country supplying the missiles.

In light of Russia's recent provocations, it is more important than ever to be careful not to make a "mistake" when facing Moscow, he said, adding that "this is a global issue, and we should react accordingly."

Russia has intensified violations of the EU's and NATO's airspace in recent weeks. Moscow violated Polish airspace on Sept. 10, prompting Warsaw to shoot down Russian drones over its territory in a first for any NATO member in over three years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. On Sept. 19, three Russian jets violated Estonian airspace.

As the U.S. allows Ukraine to conduct strikes deep within Russia, Washington is looking into providing Kyiv with additional weapons.

"That is one of the reasons I believe that this last week, and it has been confirmed, that President Zelensky asked President Trump to give Tomahawk missiles," Kellogg said, adding that the final decision has not yet been made.

As Russia continues to press along the front line with little progress and high losses, Kellogg noted that Moscow is not meeting its goals as it wages its war against Ukraine.

"Russia is not winning this war. If they (were) winning, they would be in Kyiv, Odesa, they would be over the Dnipro river," he said.

Russia has lost approximately 1,109,590 troops in Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the latest assessment of the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces on Sept. 29.

Trump's position marks a shift from earlier in the year. The U.S. leader previously criticized Ukrainian strikes on infrastructure within Russian territory.

In a letter published Aug. 22, Trump told Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban he was "very angry" about Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline.

In recent weeks, Trump has instead increasingly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin as the U.S. fails to broker an end to Russia's war against Ukraine.

"I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia is doing and what President Putin is doing," Trump told reporters during a press conference on Sept. 25. "I haven't liked it at all. He's killing people for no reason whatsoever."

"The path Russia has chosen is that of a repressive, murderous state. Its denunciation of the convention only confirms that torture and inhuman treatment are systemic practices of the Kremlin," Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.

The ZNPP, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Hungary blocked 12 Ukrainian media outlets in response to Kyiv's earlier ban on several foreign, including Hungarian, publications over Russian narratives, Hungarian Cabinet Minister Gergely Gulyas said on Sept. 29.

"Russia's recent attack with more than 580 and over 40 missiles have once again underlined the importance of strengthening Ukraine's air defense," German Defense Minister Boris Pistoruis said.



The largest number of injuries was reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where a Russian attack wounded 49 people.

Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles.

"There is growing evidence that Russia may have used tankers in the Baltic Sea to launch drones — the drones that caused major disruption in Northern Europe," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The EU had warned that Moldova was facing "an unprecedented campaign of disinformation" from Russia ahead of the election. 

The 59th Brigade of the Unmanned Systems Forces destroyed the Russian helicopter near the village of Kotliarivka, in Donetsk Oblast.

Over the past month, Ukrainian forces have been pushing back Russian troops who had advanced 15-20 kilometers (6 miles) toward the strategic Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, near the contested city of Pokrovsk.

The number includes 1,080 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

 Bolsonaro's Conviction Was the Fruit of U.S. Democracy Promotion

 Omar G. Encarnación

It's hard to imagine Washington taking a more heavy-handed response to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for having led a coup to stay in office after his 2022 loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. U.S. President Donald Trump has characterized the conviction as a “witch hunt” and retaliated with a 50 percent tariff on many Brazilian goods. The U.S. Treasury Department has hit Alexandre de Moraes, the Brazilian Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial, with some of the harshest sanctions in the U.S. toolkit, including those intended for human rights abusers. 

Even U.S. military action against Brazil, which Trump designated a major non-NATO ally in 2019, appears to be on the table. When asked about the possibility of a Bolsonaro conviction, White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt warned: "This is a priority for the administration, and the president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world.” 

The harsh U.S. response to Bolsonaro's prosecution represents a tremendous irony: the conviction resulted from the work of institutions that the United States fostered for decades by pushing for reforms to strengthen the independence of the Brazilian judiciary. Put simply, the Bolsonaro trial was a triumph of U.S. democracy promotion. 

At the moment, democracy promotion is anathema in Washington. The Trump administration has made unprecedented cuts to democracy, human rights, and governance programs, including dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, slashing the State Department's democracy bureau, and freezing nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign assistance. Trump has said “there's no reason for USAID,” which he has called a “left-wing money-laundering scam.” These positions represent a wholesale retreat from the bipartisan post–Cold War liberal consensus positing that democracy promotion as a form of soft power could both benefit foreign countries and advance U.S. interests and principles. 

U.S. democracy promotion can rightly be criticized for its misplaced idealism and its excesses. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration tried to carry out nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq on a scale not seen since the aftermath of World War II. Bush's disastrous campaign to democratize the Middle East soured the American public on such policies, which in turn allowed Trump to position himself as an opponent of democracy promotion and foreign assistance more broadly. And even in Latin America, U.S. democracy promotion has a checkered history, beginning with President Woodrow Wilson's moralistic crusade to impose democracy on Mexico in 1914. 

After the Cold War, however, Washington embraced a softer and smarter approach in Latin America, nurturing fledgling democratic systems across the hemisphere by strengthening democratic governance, elections, human rights, and the rule of law, including reforming judicial institutions and criminal justice systems. Investing in that form of democracy promotion paid significant dividends in Brazil. But in the years to come, Trump's abandonment of democracy promotion will make it harder for civil society and opposition parties to dislodge the autocratic forces that once again have begun to take root in Latin America. 

Historically, USAID was at the core of U.S. democracy promotion in Latin America, administering programs designed to strengthen democratic institutions, including by advising on elections, encouraging a free press, and promoting civic education. The agency also funded civil society groups working to expose and prevent corruption and increase government transparency. Less well known is the work of the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-autonomous agency whose government funding is currently in legal limbo. Created in 1983 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration, with an eye toward bringing change to the communist world, the NED has long enjoyed bipartisan support. 

In the 1980s and early 1990s, as countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay began to independently transition away from military dictatorship and toward democracy, the work of USAID and NED complemented U.S. counternarcotics programs, economic development assistance, humanitarian aid, and environmental protection. Throughout the 1990s, Washington prioritized judicial reforms intended to bolster the rule of law by training judges, prosecutors, and public defenders; helping law enforcement agencies build modern criminal investigative units; and offering fellowships for Latin American public servants to study at universities in the United States and intern at U.S. government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. 

The mission of strengthening the rule of law faced particular challenges in Brazil. The country has endured 14 military coups, from the 1889 coup that ended the monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of Brazil to Bolsonaro's failed 2022 attempt to prevent Lula from taking power. Only half of these succeeded. But after almost every failed attempt, the coup plotters enjoyed amnesty, most famously in 1985, when Brazil underwent its last transition from dictatorship to democracy. 

Other Latin American countries that had suffered under military dictatorships vigorously prosecuted the perpetrators of human rights abuses, but Brazil did not follow suit. It instead swept the regime's offenses under the rug, enacting a broad amnesty law in 1979 that was upheld by the Federal Supreme Court in 2010 and remains in place to this day. It was only in 2011 that Brazil organized a truth commission to chronicle human rights abuses the military committed between 1964 and 1985. 

Nonetheless, with help from the United States, Brazil made significant strides, mostly by enhancing the independence of its judiciary. Brazil's Federal Supreme Court has taken dramatic steps to expand the rights of historically marginalized communities including Afro-Brazilians, Indigenous people, and LGBTQ people. For example, when Brazil legalized gay marriage in 2013 (before the United States), the court noted that its intervention was needed given the lack of action from the Brazilian Congress. 



The strength of the judiciary has also enabled federal prosecutors to confront large scale corruption. In 2014, prosecutors launched Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash, a money-laundering investigation that exposed a host of criminal activities, including bribery, tied to Petrobras, the state-run oil company. The investigation became the biggest anticorruption dragnet in Brazilian history, leading to nearly 280 convictions and implicating top business people and politicians. It led to the imprisonment of the best-known of all Lava Jato defendants, President Lula, who served 580 days in jail. The investigation also provided the backdrop for the 2016 impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, who previously chaired Petrobras's board of directors, but was impeached on separate charges that she manipulated the budget. 

Nowhere has the strength of Brazil's judiciary been more evident than in the courts' bold confrontation of Bolsonaro and his illiberal agenda. Just months after Bolsonaro left office in 2023, the Superior Electoral Court, which oversees federal elections, prosecuted the former president for abuses of power linked to spreading misinformation about Brazil's electoral system. That conviction banned him from running for public office until 2030. In September, a panel of five judges on the Federal Supreme Court ruled 4–1 to convict Bolsonaro on five separate charges, including seeking to stage a coup, leading an armed criminal group, and attempting a violent abolition of the democratic rule of law—the first time the country has held coup plotters accountable. 

It's important not to overstate the role of U.S. influence, of course: the lion's share of the credit for this remarkable turnaround goes to the Brazilian people, who have erected strong democratic institutions in a remarkably short time. In 1988, following a participatory amendments process through the National Constituent Assembly, Brazil enacted a new constitution that guarantees a broad menu of civil, political, and human rights. It abolished the Electoral College (a holdover from the old regime used by the military to ensure that its candidates won the presidency) and afforded the Federal Supreme Court considerable powers to protect vulnerable communities and to prosecute corruption. In 2004, a constitutional amendment created the National Council of Justice to manage the judiciary, which has vastly improved the functioning and autonomy of the courts. 

But until Trump's return to power, U.S. support for democracy in post-transition Brazil had been steadfast, and never more so than when democracy itself came under attack. After Bolsonaro supporters stormed Brasilia on January 8, 2023, an act that eerily mirrored the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, U.S. President Joe Biden telephoned Lula to affirm Washington's “unwavering support for Brazil's democracy.” At Biden's request, Lula visited the White House in February 2023 to discuss strengthening democratic institutions and values. Following that meeting, the United States and Brazil initiated a series of collaborative projects intended to deepen the quality of Brazilian democracy, including a USAID-sponsored program to combat racial discrimination against Afro-Brazilians and Indigenous communities. 

Of course, Brazil's justice system is hardly beyond reproach. According to the Brazilian NGO Rio de Paz, only about eight percent of murders in Brazil lead to a criminal conviction. Many of the corruption-related convictions and sentences that resulted from Operation Carwash have been overturned—including Lula's. Washington has not made much of either issue. Moreover, some Brazilians have raised legitimate concerns about whether the Federal Supreme Court has grown too powerful for the good of democracy. And for a policy that purports to support the rule of law, U.S. democracy promotion has done little to advance transitional justice policies that seek accountability for the human rights abuses committed by the military. 

Nevertheless, it is difficult to ignore the cruel irony that at the precise moment when democracy promotion is bearing fruit in such a dramatic fashion in Brazil, the United States is turning its back on the policy. This will result in fewer resources dedicated to upholding the rule of law. Indeed, many Latin American NGOs are bracing for a “civil society recession,” as groups that depend on U.S. assistance close shop. Among the consequences will be a shrinking of the civic arena, which could create an opening for nondemocratic actors such as China and Russia to expand their regional influence. 

For its part, Trump's intimidation campaign over Brazil's conviction of Bolsonaro will also likely discourage other Latin American countries from prosecuting their own antidemocratic leaders. Because of Trump's actions, leaders who should be held accountable for undermining democracy, human rights, and the rule of law—including Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and Nayib Bukele of El Salvador—are resting more comfortably today. Brazil's successful prosecution of Bolsonaro still offers Latin American countries a model to emulate. But it will be harder to do so without help from the United States.

 Beijing's Plans to Exploit American Retreat

 Jeffrey Prescott and Julian Gewirtz

A great unanswered question of the second Trump administration has been how its outright rejection of the existing global order would affect China's international strategy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called this order both “obsolete” and “a weapon being used against” the United States, and in his speech at the United Nations on September 23, President Donald Trump pilloried the “globalist” institution for “creating new problems for us to solve.” In the early months of this year, Beijing's response to Washington's attacks on the international order seemed mostly cautious and measured. China traded tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States, but it otherwise remained content to sit back and accrue benefits from Trump's alienation of U.S. allies and withdrawal from international institutions. 

That period of caution is now over. Beijing has decided on a much more ambitious course, putting its plans on vivid display at a September meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Hosting the once sleepy regional economic and security body, Chinese leader Xi Jinping clasped hands with Russia President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and met with 18 other leaders from across the Eurasian continent. A few days later, flanked by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xi presided over a massive military parade in Beijing to show off China's fast-growing arsenal. Trump's comment about seeing the summitry on TV—“They were hoping I was watching, and I was watching”—inadvertently revealed the precise position in which China hoped to place the United States: the American president, so often the prime mover of global politics, had become a spectator on the sidelines of a changing world.

Xi aims to establish China as the fulcrum of an emerging multipolar world, and he is advancing a new, more active diplomatic strategy to realize that goal. Rather than force the United States out of its leading position in the international system or overturn the existing order, China is exploiting Trump's rapid, willing abdication of Washington's role. And China is building up its own power and prestige within existing institutions, seeking to shift their centers of gravity irrevocably toward Beijing. If this gambit succeeds, it will transform the international order from the inside out, placing China at center stage and undermining U.S. influence in ways that future American administrations may find difficult to reverse.

Not too long ago, foreign policy analysts might have shrugged off the pageantry of the China summit. After all, meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are often heavy on optics and light on substance. Disagreements among the group's key members, such as a long-running border dispute between China and India, have tended to outweigh their areas of commonality. Indeed, some commentators and U.S. officials dismissed the recent Chinese-hosted events as “performative,” “for show,” and merely a “photo op.”

Eight months into Trump's second term, this reading is optimistic at best. It discounts the extent to which global reactions to Trump's actions are reshaping the world. The international order that the United States built and maintained for decades is coming to an end, and what follows is up for grabs. Many countries are competing for influence, and short-term, transactional dealmaking rather than long-term cooperation is becoming the new norm, ushering in a phase that one of us called “mercenary multipolarity” in Foreign Affairs. The United States and China remain the two most powerful countries, but others, such as India and Russia, as well as the European Union, are significant players with their own agendas. And as U.S. alliances fracture under Trump, rivals of the United States are collaborating in increasingly meaningful ways.

Yet with the ultimate shape of this new order still undefined, Xi sees a window of opportunity to forge a China-centric world without directly taking on the United States by moving assertively into areas where Trump's “America first” policies leave openings. This project extends well beyond the optics of gathering global leaders in Chinese cities. While the U.S. president feuded with the leaders of Brazil and India, Xi addressed a virtual BRICS meeting hosted by Brasilia on the topic of “resisting protectionism” and welcomed Modi to China to shore up ties with these two key powers. While Trump imposes tariffs on much of the world and eliminates U.S. foreign assistance, Xi is courting the leaders of the developing world: Beijing announced cuts to Chinese tariffs on African goods in June and claimed in September that it would bolster efforts to reform the World Trade Organization to benefit developing countries' economic growth. While the Trump administration embraced unabashed technology nationalism, titling its AI action plan “Winning the Race,” China hosted its annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference under the headline “Global Solidarity in the AI Era,” claiming that Beijing wants to share the benefits of AI and announcing a new global AI governance project to do so. And whereas Trump attacked climate change as “the greatest con job ever” and skipped a UN summit on the issue, Xi has set an emissions reduction goal that, although remarkably unambitious, has earned him plaudits in some quarters. The list goes on.



Perhaps most worryingly for Washington, Xi's actions have made clear that this China-centric world will reward resistance to the United States. There is no better symbol of this promise than Xi's decision to give pride of place during the military parade in Beijing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose country has been under punishing sanctions for decades and has sent troops to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine. Xi similarly embraced other leaders who have pushed back against the United States in some way: Putin, Modi, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian all received a lavish welcome in China, too.

China is now focused on being seen not as a disrupter but as the defender of the international order, putting a new spin on its long-standing effort to secure a privileged position in existing institutions and to boost its capacity to set norms and rules inside them. Until recently, China preferred the safer course of criticizing unpopular U.S. policies and focusing its activities in areas that attract limited international attention, such as development, culture, and peacekeeping. But with a combative Trump questioning the very purpose of the UN at his speech before the General Assembly, Beijing has an international audience that may be more receptive to its overtures. “China has all along acted as a staunch defender of world peace and security,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at the UN just a few days after Trump's speech.

In September, Xi announced his Global Governance Initiative, which aims to put China's stamp on the United Nations system. It invokes the desire of many countries for a more “just and equitable” international order and makes China—rather than any other country or international body—the arbiter of what that new order will entail. Beijing is already advancing principles that work in its favor, such as an absolutist but selective conception of national sovereignty that it applies to itself but not to all countries, and marginalizing values that it sees as threatening, such as universal human rights. China has offered few details about how it would resolve disputes within or introduce reforms to international institutions, and it has no desire to foot more of the bill for costly UN programs. But given the disdain that the Trump administration has showed toward the UN, countries that are committed to the UN system may well accede to China's entreaties to support its new initiative and its positions on a variety of substantive issues. Paired with prominent if modest Chinese investments in UN bodies and their personnel, Trump's continued neglect, Xi hopes, will enable China to reshape these institutions to its liking.

As with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, analysts might once have rolled their eyes at the Global Governance Initiative as mere sloganeering. But it is one of a set of projects—including the Global Development Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative, and the Global Security Initiative—that Chinese officials are working intently to translate into reality. The scholars Sheena Chestnut Greitens, Isaac Kardon, and Cameron Waltz recently found, for instance, that China's internal security agencies have significantly increased their international policing partnerships and non-military security cooperation under the banner of the Global Security Initiative, especially in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific Islands but also in Africa and Latin America. As the United States steps back, China is quietly layering new kinds of partnerships on top of its already robust trade ties, with the aim that, over time, more countries will see Beijing—not Washington—as their most important relationship.

It is unrealistic to expect the Trump administration to suddenly change its approach to diplomacy and multilateralism or to see the wisdom of embracing allies and competing with China for influence at the UN. Such steps would have support among the American people, a strong majority of whom think that U.S. alliances benefit the United States and that the UN plays a necessary, if imperfect, role in the world. But these moves would simply be too much at odds with the administration's “America first” ideology to gain traction. For the next few years, therefore, the United States is likely to leave China with an open field in international institutions.

Xi's efforts may build additional momentum thanks to Trump's approach to diplomacy with Beijing. Ahead of his planned visit to China in 2026, Trump is focused on the optics of his personal relationship with Xi and on striking a bilateral deal—which, if prior negotiations are any guide, much of the world may judge as a good deal for China, even if Trump touts it as a win. Other countries are watching these negotiations closely, and any agreement that appears to reward China's resistance to U.S. demands will further entrench the view that China is gaining influence relative to the United States.

But China's success is not a foregone conclusion. Beijing may struggle to translate its grand aspirations into a real global realignment. Many countries understand that a China-centric world would come with strings attached, and Beijing may be unable to resist escalating its numerous territorial disputes in Asia or flexing its coercive capabilities. Time and again over the past decade, Beijing's actions—from punitive economic measures against major trading partners to maritime harassment of rival territorial claimants in the South China Sea—have invited pushback from countries that prize their autonomy. Now, those countries could resist China's order-shaping efforts by reducing their reliance on both Beijing and Washington. A more fragmented, anarchic world is not necessarily one that China will dominate.

Missteps by China or resistance from other countries could well thwart Xi's designs. For the United States, such setbacks can buy time—until different leadership in Washington once again has a vision of the future built around more than looking out for itself.

Ukrainian forces struck the Elektrodetal factory in the town of Karachev, located in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff confirmed on Sept. 29.

The confirmation follows earlier reports in Russian local media of a drone strike on the factory. Prior to the attack, Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz had issued a warning about a possible missile threat in the Karachev area.

The Elektrodetal factory produces a range of electrical connectors for both military and industrial use. Its products include low-frequency, high-frequency, and combined connectors used in sectors such as aerospace, electronics, and instrumentation.

These components are employed in military equipment, aircraft, antennas, base stations, printed circuit boards, and various measuring systems.

The strike on the facility reportedly caused explosions and a fire on the site. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed.

According to the General Staff, the attack was conducted by Ukraine's missile and artillery forces in coordination with other branches of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The strike reached a target approximately 240 kilometers (149 miles) away.

Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles.

Bryansk Oblast sits along Ukraine's northern border with Russia. Karachev is located about 115 kilometers (72 miles) from the border.

Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

On Sept. 28, Ukrainian HIMARS rockets reportedly struck a thermal power plant near the Russian city of Belgorod, Russian Telegram channels reported. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov confirmed a strike on the region's critical infrastructure as well as "significant power outages."

Separately on Sept. 28, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed that it killed at least four Russian drone operators in the city of Melitopol in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

An explosion rocked a guarded military base on an airfield in occupied Melitopol, destroying a Soviet-era UAZ-452 van and killing at least four operators, HUR claimed.

Russia holds conscription drives twice a year, spring and fall. This autumn's draft will run from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31.





"The path Russia has chosen is that of a repressive, murderous state. Its denunciation of the convention only confirms that torture and inhuman treatment are systemic practices of the Kremlin," Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.

The ZNPP, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Hungary blocked 12 Ukrainian media outlets in response to Kyiv's earlier ban on several foreign, including Hungarian, publications over Russian narratives, Hungarian Cabinet Minister Gergely Gulyas said on Sept. 29.

"Russia's recent attack with more than 580 and over 40 missiles have once again underlined the importance of strengthening Ukraine's air defense," German Defense Minister Boris Pistoruis said.



The largest number of injuries was reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where a Russian attack wounded 49 people.

Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles.

"There is growing evidence that Russia may have used tankers in the Baltic Sea to launch drones — the drones that caused major disruption in Northern Europe," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The EU had warned that Moldova was facing "an unprecedented campaign of disinformation" from Russia ahead of the election.

Electronic Arts, the maker of video games like “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is being acquired for $55 billion in what could become the largest private equity-funded buyout in history. 

Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners will pay EA's stockholders $210 per share. Affinity Partners is run by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The equity value of the deal is $55 billion, far exceeding the $32 billion price tag to take Texas utility TXU private in 2007, which had shattered records for leveraged buyouts. 

PIF, which was currently the largest insider stakeholder in Electronic Arts, will be rolling over its existing 9.9% investment in the company. 

The commitment to the massive deal is inline with recent activity in the gaming sector by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote Andrew Marok of Raymond James. 

“The Saudi PIF has been a very active player in the video gaming market since 2022, taking minority stakes in most scaled public video gaming publishers, and also outright purchases of companies like ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely,” he wrote. “The PIF has made its intentions to scale its gaming arm, Savvy Gaming Group, clear, and the EA deal would represent the biggest such move to date by some distance.” 

PIF is also a minority investor in Nintendo.

If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted 52 cents. 




The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by “Strat-O-Matic” as a teenager during the 1960s.

CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013 and he will remain in that role, the firms said Monday. Electronic Arts would be taken private and its headquarters would remain in Redwood City, California.

“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future,” said Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. “I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.”

The size of the video game market has attracted large investors in recent years. 

One of EA's biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft for nearly $69 billion in 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified.

This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake is also part of a newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the U.S. oversight of TikTok's social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven't been divulged yet.

Silver Lake also bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9 billion deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9 billion buyout of personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returned to the stock market with publicly traded shares in 2018.

By going private, EA will be able to retool operations without worrying about market reactions. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA's annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion.

Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company thinks the proposed deal's $210 per share offer price may be falling short of EA's intrinsic value.

“With Battlefield 6 about to launch and a pipeline that could add more than $2B in incremental bookings by FY28, the true earnings power of EA is only beginning to emerge,” he wrote.

Hickey is unsure if the transaction is in shareholders' best interest.

“In our view, this transaction is a self-serving, opportunistic move by management and the investor group,” he wrote. “Management has long been rumored to seek a sale around $200 per share, a level that may have been defensible in prior years but not in the current environment where visibility into growth, franchise momentum, and pipeline strength is far more robust. The board's decision to recommend a sale at $210 per share suggests a prioritization of near-term certainty and legacy over maximizing long-term shareholder value.”

But Nick McKay of Freedom Capital Markets believes the offer makes sense for EA because share price appreciation is likely limited given that the success of its sports franchises and various live services streams are already mostly baked into the stock. 

“The financial backing and resources of the investor consortium should enable EA to increase its focus on long-term growth opportunities that may have been viewed as too risky or expensive as a public company,” he wrote in an analyst note.

EA shares, which rose nearly 5% on Monday, had jumped 15% on Friday after rumors of a takeover began to circulate. 

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027. It still needs approval from EA shareholders.

Pres. Donald Trump said he's “very confident” about a peace deal in Gaza as he greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for talks. The visit comes after Netanyahu's defiant speech at the UN rejecting demands to end the Gaza war.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday they've agreed to a plan to end the war in Gaza, but it's unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms.

Trump on Monday laid out a 20-point plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war and establishing a postwar governance in the war-battered Palestinian territory. Trump's plan would establish a temporary governing board that would be headed by Trump and include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

The plan does not require people to leave Gaza and calls for the war to end immediately if both sides accept it. It also calls for all remaining hostages to be released within 72 hours of Israel accepting the plan. 

Trump said Israel would have the “full backing” of the United States to take steps to defeat Hamas if it doesn't accept the proposed peace deal. 

“I think we are beyond very close,” Trump said at the start of a news conference with Netanyahu where he detailed the plan. “We're not quite finished. We have to get Hamas.”

“If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself,” Netanyahu said. “This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done”

The president went on to urge Palestinian people to take responsibility “for their destiny” and embrace his peace proposal.




Netanyahu earlier extended a formal apology to his Qatari counterpart for a recent military strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emirate that infuriated Arab leaders and triggered rare criticism by the U.S. of Israel.

Netanyahu made the call to Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, as he met with Trump, according to the White House.

Trump described the exchange between the Israeli and Qatari leader as a “heart-to-heart” call.

“As a first step, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,” the White House said in a statement. “He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future.”

The White House talks, and apology from Netanyahu, come at a tenuous moment. Israel is increasingly isolated, losing support from many countries that were long its steadfast allies. At home, Netanyahu's governing coalition appears more fragile than ever. And the White House is showing signs of impatience.

The question now is whether Trump, who has offered steadfast backing to Netanyahu throughout the war, will change his tone and turn up the pressure on Israel to wind down the conflict.

As he welcomed Netanyahu to the White House, Trump responded affirmatively when asked by reporters whether he was confident a deal would be soon reached to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas.

“I am. I'm very confident,” Trump said.

Israel stuck the headquarters of Hamas' political leadership in Qatar on Sept. 9 as the group's top figures gathered to consider a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

The strike on the territory of a U.S. ally was a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed at winding down the war and freeing hostages. No senior Hamas officials were killed in the strike.

The attack on an energy-rich Gulf nation hosting thousands of American troops, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas throughout the war and even before, was described by Trump as out of step with Israeli and U.S. interests. And Trump sought to move quickly to assuage his Qatari allies.

Qatar, meanwhile, condemned the strike as a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” as smoke rose over its capital, Doha. Other key U.S. allies in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, promised their support to Qatar.

The White House said al Thani welcomed Netanyahu's “assurances” and emphasized “Qatar's readiness to continue contributing meaningfully to regional security and stability.”

But even as the White House was spotlighting the apology, Israel's far right national security minister newly defended the decision to carry out Israel's attack.

Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner of Netanyahu's, in a posting on X called the operation “an important, just and ethical attack.”

“It is very good that it happened,” he added.

Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt urged both sides to finalize an agreement to bring an end to the nearly two-year-old war in Gaza.

“Ultimately the president knows when you get to a good deal, both sides are going to leave a little bit unhappy,” Leavitt told reporters. “But we need this conflict to end.”

Trump and Netanyahu were first holding talks with aides in the Oval Office and over a private lunch. A joint press conference is expected later. 

Meanwhile, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said Palestinian officials stood ready to work with Trump and Arab countries in bringing an end to the war.

“Let us not delay a single minute more in doing what is necessary for this just peace to replace the unbearable reality of today,” Mansour said during a Security Council meeting on the Middle East.

Trump joined forces with Netanyahu during Israel's brief war with Iran in June, ordering U.S. stealth bombers to strike three nuclear sites, and he's supported the Israeli leader during his corruption trial, describing the case as a “witch hunt.”

But the relationship has become more tense lately. Trump was frustrated by Israel's failed strike this month on Hamas officials in Qatar.

Last week, Trump vowed to prevent Israel from annexing the West Bank — an idea promoted by some of Netanyahu's hard-line governing partners. The international community opposes annexation, saying it would destroy hopes for a two-state solution.

On Friday, Trump raised expectations for the meeting with Netanyahu, telling reporters the U.S. was “very close to a deal on Gaza.” 

Trump's proposal to stop the war in Gaza calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan has not been formally unveiled.

Hamas is believed to be holding 48 hostages, 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. The militant group has demanded Israel agree to end the war and withdraw from all of Gaza as part of any permanent ceasefire.

Trump discussed the plan with Arab and Islamic leaders in New York last week on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. It doesn't include the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which Trump appeared to endorse earlier this year.

The 21-point proposal also calls for an end to Hamas rule of Gaza and the disarmament of the militant group, said the officials briefed on the plan. Hundreds of Palestinians, including many serving life sentences, will be released by Israel, according to the proposal.

The plan also includes the establishment of an international security force to take over law enforcement in postwar Gaza, they said. 

A Palestinian committee of technocrats would oversee the civilian affairs of the strip, with power handed over later to a reformed Palestinian Authority, they said. Netanyahu has rejected any role for the authority, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinians, in postwar Gaza.

A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The group has repeatedly rejected laying down arms and has linked its weapons to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports the latest on the investigation into the suspect Nigel Max Edge. 

A weekend shooting that left three people dead and five others injured was "highly premeditated" and targeted a waterfront North Carolina restaurant, officials said.

The shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 27, at American Fish Company in Southport, a maritime town in the southeastern part of the state. The popular spot is known locally not only as a waterfront bar and restaurant, but also as a filming location for "Safe Haven," the 2013 romantic thriller based on the Nicholas Sparks novel.

Investigators allege that 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge positioned himself in a white, center-console boat just off the restaurant's deck before opening fire. At the time, live music was playing, and patrons were gathered along the bar's waterfront area.

Authorities said chaos broke out as bullets struck people on the deck as patrons scrambled to safety. Edge, police said, sped away.

SUSPECT IN NC RESTAURANT SHOOTING IDENTIFIED, CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER 3 KILLED, AT LEAST 5 WOUNDED

"This was not random. It was highly premeditated," Police Chief Todd Coring said at a press briefing Sunday.

Edge, an Oak Island resident and military veteran, has not yet entered a plea. He appeared for his first court hearing Monday afternoon, logging in by video at 2 p.m. from the neighboring sheriff's office jail.

A judge denied bond, citing him as both a flight risk and a danger to the community. Edge is scheduled to return to court on Oct. 13 for a probable cause hearing. He requested a public defender.

Prosecutors said in court that Edge used a .300 Blackout Sig Sauer rifle outfitted with a suppressor and scope, and also had a .380 handgun tucked in his waistband when he was arrested. Some of the rifle ammunition was tipped for maximum ballistic impact, authorities noted.

Two deputies responded on a sheriff's department boat after the shooting, later spotting Edge as he walked to retrieve his boat trailer. Deputies moved in and apprehended him as he backed the trailer in to pull his vessel from the water.

Officials said the attack may have originally been planned for Friday. Witnesses, prosecutors said, saw Edge with his boat lights off that night before he suddenly fled when approached.

The police chief said that Edge said he has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Coring said that he "self-identifies" as a veteran. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment. 

"We understand this suspect identifies as a combat veteran. He self-identifies. Injured in the line of duty is what he's saying, he suffers from PTSD," Coring said.

In a 2024 federal lawsuit dismissed earlier this year, Edge made sweeping claims that included references to what he called "a Hate Crime (LGBQT toward a straight man (me)) who was raised as a straight male for (LGBTQ) purposes in an illegal pedophile sex ring." 

He also accused his parents of being "LGBQT White Supremacist Pedophiles" who falsified his birth certificate, drugged him and tried to profit from him, while tying his alleged mistreatment to the Iraq War, the Abu Ghraib scandal and the Jeffrey Epstein case.

On March 12, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina dismissed the case. Judge Louise W. Flanagan ruled that Edge failed to state any viable constitutional or tort claims, noting that his filings were filled with extraordinary accusations but lacked legal grounding. The case was formally closed with all counts dismissed.

ACTIVE SHOOTER REPORTED AT NORTH CAROLINA DOCKSIDE WITH RESTAURANTS AND BARS

District Attorney Jon David said Sunday "a lot" of the victims were on vacation and were not Southport locals. 

"Sadly, a lot of the victims in this case appear to be not members of our community, but people who are here on vacation," David said.

The filings also identify five victims by initials – JS, WP, JB, LB, and TL – tied to counts of attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. In addition to those victims, three others were fatally shot during the attack, though their names have not yet been publicly released.

In a statement, American Fish Company said that it, along with the neighboring Frying Pan restaurant, would be closed indefinitely.

"Our hearts are broken, and our prayers are with the victims, their families and everyone affected by this tragedy," they said. "God bless Southport."

New York Mets team owner Steve Cohen addressed disappointed fans on Monday after the team suffered a dreadful collapse and missed the postseason.

The Miami Marlins brought the final bit of doom to the Mets, defeating them 4-0 in the season finale on Sunday.

"Mets fans everywhere," Cohen wrote on X. "I owe you an apology. You did your part by showing up and supporting the team. We didn't do our part. We will do a post-mortem and figure out the obvious and less obvious reasons why the team didn't perform up to your and my expectations.

"We are all feeling raw emotions today. I know how much time and effort you have put into this team. The result was unacceptable. Your emotions tell me how much you care and continues to motivate the organization to do better. Thank You to the best fans in sports."

Minutes after the loss, first baseman Pete Alonso said he was going to opt out of his deal and test free agency.

"There's some great guys in this clubhouse, there's some great people on the staff," he said. "And every single day, it's just been a pleasure coming to work and putting on the orange and blue. I've really appreciated and been nothing but full of gratitude every single day. Nothing's guaranteed, but we'll see what happens.

2025 MLB WILD CARD ODDS: YANKEES, DODGERS FAVORED TO MAKE DIVISIONAL SERIES

"I've loved being a Met, so hopefully they've appreciated me in the same (way)."

The Mets got off to a hot start. New York was 45-24 on June 12, one of the best records in MLB at the time, and only went 38-55 the rest of the season to finish 83-79 after their latest crushing loss on Sunday evening.

New York came into the 2025 season with the second-highest total payroll – more than $341 million – and the second-highest active roster payroll with $266.6 million, according to Spotrac. Juan Soto came over to the Mets from the New York Yankees on a 15-year deal reportedly worth $765 million. And while the bats were hot to start the year, the team cooled off when it mattered.

The Mets suffered an eight-game losing streak at the worst time, starting with a series against the Reds and continuing through the Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers matchups. The team bounced back against the San Diego Padres and then dropped two of three against the Washington Nationals.

The series against the Marlins was crucial, but New York was only able to pull out one win out of the three games. New York was 11-17 in August and finished 10-15 in September.

Board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, based in Savannah, Georgia, explains why VO2 max and muscle mass are the main indicators of longevity.

The key to a good workout could be sitting in your kitchen cabinet.

A viral social media trend claims that taking a spoonful of honey and salt before hitting the gym provides an energy boost.

Some say this combination mimics the effects of pre-workout supplements, which are meant to enhance physical performance and energy levels when exercising.

EATING FOODS IN THIS ORDER COULD HELP WITH WEIGHT LOSS AND BLOOD SUGAR, EXPERTS SAY

TikTok creators and influencers have been filming themselves pouring honey onto a spoon, or even on the back of their hand, and sprinkling it with salt — many opting for natural options of both — and taking a dose before heading to the gym.

Honey, a "rapidly digesting carbohydrate," and the sodium from salt could be beneficial as a workout booster, an expert says. (iStock)

In an interview with Fox News Digital, certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco confirmed that this strategy "does make sense" as a pre-workout boost.

The combination mixes a "rapidly digesting carbohydrate" with sodium, both of which are thought to be "beneficial for an effective workout," the New Jersey-based nutritionist said.

"It's usually suggested to eat a snack of carbohydrates (usually mixed with some protein or a bit of good fat) before a workout to help increase sustained energy and muscle re-building, so this is just saying to use honey as the carbohydrate/sugar," she said. 

"Essentially, some applesauce or fruit juice can be used the same way as the honey."

The combination mixes a "rapidly digesting carbohydrate" with sodium, both of which are thought to be "beneficial for an effective workout," the nutritionist said. (iStock)

DeCicco believes this trend is most likely popular because honey is digested quickly into the bloodstream and breaks down easily.

She does not, however, recommend consuming only honey and salt before a workout. Adding a snack with more substance, such as whole-grain crackers with tuna fish or a banana with peanut butter, could offer more energy, according to the expert.

"These types of snacks will work to provide energy throughout the entire workout," she said. "The snacks can be eaten one to two hours before a workout, and then the honey and salt directly before."

An expert recommends drinking electrolytes before, during and after a workout to prevent dehydration, especially if it's a sweaty session. (iStock)

The nutritionist also advises her clients to drink electrolytes before, during and after a workout to prevent dehydration, especially if it's a sweaty session.

"Someone could also put a pinch of sea salt into water with some coconut water or fruit juice and reap the same benefit as the honey, minus the antioxidants found in honey," she added.

Erika Kirk appears as a guest host on "The Charlie Kirk Show" and reveals untold hours of content from her late husband is forthcoming.

Erika Kirk told the audience of her late husband Charlie's show to "buckle up" on Friday as she promised countless hours of previously unseen content from him and discussed the responsibility she feels to continue his movement.

The new CEO of Turning Point USA, Erika Kirk appeared as a special guest host on "The Charlie Kirk Show," where she said the program will continue on as a "north star" for conservatism with rotating hosts and casts.

"Charlie and ‘The Charlie Kirk Show' is not just a show," she said. "It has a movement attached to it… This is not going anywhere. It's just not."

Erika Kirk added that she had "decades worth of my husband's voice" in archives that no one had seen or heard. Clips of Charlie Kirk's viral sparring sessions on college campuses and past speeches have spread across social media in the weeks since his assassination on Sept. 10.

OPINION: ERIKA KIRK SHOWS HOW WE SHOULD FORGIVE, ‘BECAUSE IT WAS WHAT CHRIST DID'

"We have unused material from speeches that he's had that no one has heard yet," she said. "We have Sunday specials lined up to the brim because my husband was so intentional about making sure that there was enough content always."

"He made sure we recorded everything," executive producer Andrew Kolvet said.

"We have speeches that no one's heard of. We have interviews that no one's heard of. We have stuff from Korea and Japan that no one's heard of," she said. "In the words of my husband, buckle up, because there is a lot of content to be had, and we have so many amazing things down the pipeline that we are working on… I am so excited."

Erika Kirk added that her husband had a plan for the show past 2030, the same as he had with Turning Point USA, the conservative nonprofit he co-founded at age 18.

"We have the blueprints," she said. "We have our marching orders. And we are just remaining humble and grateful to God. And we're remaining just stewards to what God has blessed us with. And I know Charlie is going to continue to guide us and the Lord will continue to guide us."

She added it was "weird" to use a term like "excited" to describe her emotions, but she said Charlie was in Heaven rooting everyone on. Kolvet added Charlie's life and mission couldn't be contained even after his death.

"It's on us, and Charlie would look at us and expect us to do the right things here," Kolvet said.

During her appearance, she also discussed a connection Charlie shared with his daughter while hosting the show. He would bring a puppet or some other item that she gave to him and sometimes show it off on the program.

"We will never be silenced," she said in agreement. "We will never be silenced, and that's why continuing his platform in a beautiful, honorable way will reinforce that we will never be silenced."

Interest in Kirk and Turning Point USA has surged in the weeks since he was killed, and Erika Kirk received widespread praise for forgiving her husband's alleged assassin during his memorial service last week.

The 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk appears for a court hearing.

PROVO, Utah (AP) — An attorney for the 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk asked a judge Monday for more time to review the large amount of evidence in the case before deciding if the defense will seek a preliminary hearing.

A preliminary hearing would determine if there is enough evidence against Tyler Robinson to go forward with a trial. Defendants can waive that step, but Robinson's newly appointed attorney Kathryn Nester said her team did not intend to do so.

Utah prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and plan to seek the death penalty. 

Both the defense and prosecution acknowledged at a brief hearing Monday that the amount of evidence that prosecutors have is “voluminous.” Robinson was not present for the hearing and appeared via audio from jail at his defense team's request.

Judge Tony Graf set the next hearing for Oct. 30.

Defense attorneys for Robinson and prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney's Office declined to comment after Monday's hearing. It took place in Provo, just a few miles from the Utah Valley University campus in Orem where many students are still processing trauma from the Sept. 10 shooting and the day-and-a-half search for the suspect. 

Authorities arrested Robinson when he showed up with his parents at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from the site of the shooting, to turn himself in. Prosecutors have since revealed incriminating text messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing.

A note that Robinson left for his romantic partner before the shooting said he had the opportunity to kill one of the nation's leading conservative voices, “and I'm going to take it,” Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray told reporters before the first hearing. Gray also said Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his partner: “I had enough of his hatred.”




The assassination of Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism, has galvanized Republicans who have vowed to carry on Kirk's mission of moving American politics further right.

Trump has declared Kirk a “martyr” for freedom and threatened to crack down on what he called the “radical left.”

Workers across the U.S. have been punished or fired for speaking out about Kirk after his death, including teachers, public and private employees and media personalities — most notably Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show was suspended then reinstated by ABC.

Kirk's political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through his podcast, social media and campus events. Many prominent Republicans are filling in at the upcoming campus events Kirk planned to attend, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Sen. Mike Lee at Utah State University on Tuesday.

October's “kitchen cabinet” tax will affect homebuyers and renters alike.

Housing in America is about to get more expensive, thanks to new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that will take effect this Wednesday, October 1.

The new tariffs include a 50 percent tax on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30 percent on upholstered furniture, and 25 percent on heavy trucks used in construction. These will join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have been driving up construction costs this year. Back in April, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimated that tariffs were adding about $10,900 to the cost of building a typical new home — and that was before the steep August tariffs took effect. No doubt the October ones will only escalate the problem.

Some companies stockpiled materials before the tariffs kicked in, creating a temporary buffer. But those inventories won't last forever, and the building industry faces a fundamental challenge: Each additional $1,000 in home construction costs prices out more than 115,000 potential home-buying families, according to NAHB.

This all comes at the worst possible time. Housing experts estimate the country needs at least 3.7 million homes to bring down costs and ease the severe housing shortage. More than 770,000 people were officially counted as homeless last year, mortgage rates hover around 6.4 percent, and nearly 75 percent of American households can't afford a median-priced new home. The affordability crisis touches everyone—from renters competing for scarce apartments to homeowners delaying renovations to builders struggling with supply chain chaos. Now, tariffs are pouring fuel on these already raging fires.

When Trump slaps a 50 percent tariff on kitchen cabinets from abroad, American importers — not the foreign companies manufacturing the cabinets — pay that tax. They then pass those costs along to builders, who pass them to homebuyers. If a developer was planning to install $15,000 worth of imported cabinets in a new home, they're now looking at an extra $7,500 in costs. Multiply that across appliances, fixtures, lumber, and steel, and the numbers add up fast.

In total, about 7 percent of all goods used in new residential construction come from foreign countries, according to NAHB. That might sound small, but it represents $14 billion worth of materials in 2024 alone.

The impact varies dramatically by location. A June study by the real estate firm Evernest found that tariffs could add anywhere from $26,180 to the cost of a new home in Oklahoma to over $100,000 in Hawaii. In expensive markets like California and Massachusetts, the additional costs from tariffs are estimated to exceed $60,000 per home.

The Trump administration, for its part, maintains it holds no blame for whatever affordability crisis renters and homeowners might experience as a result of their trade decisions.

“America's housing affordability was dramatically worsened by Joe Biden's open border policies that let tens of millions of illegal migrants walk into the country and overburden housing markets that were already grappling with cumbersome regulatory hurdles,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Vox. “The Trump administration is taking a multi-pronged approach to address housing affordability concerns: from mass deportations to deregulation to deflationary policies that are paving the way for further interest rate cuts.”

The tariffs aren't just making materials more expensive — they're making them scarcer and harder to predict. This uncertainty is in some ways more challenging for developers than the costs themselves. Developers planning projects months or years in advance suddenly confront moving targets for material prices, and this unpredictability is already showing up in construction data. Single-family housing starts fell to a near 2.5-year low in August, while permits — a leading indicator of future construction — dropped to levels not seen since April 2023.

Developers have been sounding the alarm. Anthony Hrusovsky of Chicago's Mavrek Development told the Chicago Tribune recently that tariffs “killed” negotiations with a major equity investor for a planned 25-story, 400-unit project. The tariffs introduced “a level of uncertainty around cost, which had previously been riskless in our eyes.”

Gusto, a payroll services firm for small businesses, conducted an annual survey in August and September and found that 50 percent of companies thought tariffs had hurt their business this year, and 56 percent expected them to do so next year.

Perhaps no material illustrates the tariff trap better than lumber. Canada supplies roughly 85 percent of all US softwood lumber imports and represents nearly a quarter of America's total lumber supply. Last month, the Trump administration more than doubled its 14.5 percent tariff on Canadian lumber to a rate of 35 percent.The fact is that American sawmills simply don't produce enough lumber to meet domestic demand, and it takes time to ramp up production. So homebuilders will face higher costs whether they buy Canadian lumber with tariffs or American lumber from a market with limited supply. And those costs will trickle down to everyone else.

Tariffs don't just hit new construction — they're expected to drive up renovation costs too. The levies on kitchen cabinets and on furniture mean that updating one's home could get much more expensive. In effect, homeowners may become much less willing to invest in home improvements, potentially affecting property values and slowing the broader house renovation industry.

For now, the NAHB is staying relatively quiet. In a statement released on Friday, the homebuilder trade group said they are working to get more details from the administration.

For renters, the pain from the forthcoming tariffs will be more indirect but no less real. When it becomes more expensive to build apartments, developers build fewer of them. That tightens an already competitive rental market and makes things more costly for tenants. Some would-be homebuyers, priced out by higher home costs and mortgage rates, also remain in the rental market longer, further increasing demand for apartments.

Then there are the ripple effects beyond construction. Tariffs can drive up prices economy-wide, keeping interest rates — and mortgage costs — elevated. Trade uncertainty has already rattled the stock market and slowed economic growth in 2025.

These tariff-driven cost increases are particularly maddening because they directly contradict the administration's stated housing goals. Trump has repeatedly pledged to make housing “affordable again” and has signed executive orders directing agencies to reduce regulations that drive up housing costs.

But while deregulation might save money on development costs, tariffs are adding thousands of dollars per home. Even if the administration could eliminate 25 percent of regulatory costs — an optimistic scenario — that still might not fully offset the price increases from import taxes. Earlier this month, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that if current tariff levels remain steady, construction output could go down by 3.8 percent in the long run. And tariff levels are not remaining steady — they're about to increase.

Another irony is that Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make mortgages cheaper, but his tariff policies make rate cuts less likely by fueling the inflation the Fed is trying to control.

All of these contradictions become even starker when combined with the administration's immigration enforcement policies. More than one-third of construction workers are foreign-born, according to 2023 Census data, and in some states — like California and Texas — the share is much higher. The Trump administration's immigration raids have already started to affect construction sites, and reports reveal that other foreign-born workers have stopped showing up to work out of fear. A July analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that construction jobs are likely to be hardest hit from the president's deportation agenda; the think tank estimated that the industry could shrink by over 18 percent.

A 2024 study examining the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program (which was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and removed roughly 400,000 people from the US) found that the average county lost about a year's worth of residential construction over four years following enforcement. New homes became 18 percent more expensive within three years, and overall home prices increased 10 percent.

The researchers found that native-born workers didn't replace deported immigrant workers — in fact, US-born construction jobs also declined. “You need the relatively lower-skilled folks to come in and frame the house before you need the relatively higher-skilled workers to come in and finish the house,” Troup Howard, the lead researcher, told Vox. “And so when you have net losses in those low-skilled occupations, it does lead to a slowdown overall.”

For a country desperate to solve its housing crisis, Trump's trade war is building a bigger problem, one tariff at a time.

Pin Ni, an automobile executive identified in corporate documents as a member of the Chinese Communist Party, has donated roughly $45,000 to support New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

The donations Pin made to support Sherrill span across her career in Congress and her current bid for New Jersey governor. In February, Pin cut a $30,000 check to One Giant Leap PAC, the super PAC supporting Sherril's bid for the governor's mansion, campaign finance records show. Between February 2022 and September 2024, meanwhile, Sherrill accepted $14,500 in donations from Pin through her congressional campaign account. 

Pin sits on the board of directors for the Wanxiang Group, one of the world's largest automotive components manufacturers, and is the president of the conglomerate's American branch. During his tenure at the company, Pin has been recognized as an “outstanding Communist Party Member” 15 times and has taken on leadership roles at nonprofit organizations, such as the US-China Strong Foundation and the China General Chamber of Commerce, that outside observers have accused of working on behalf of the CCP.

Lu Guanqiu, the founder of Wanxiang Group and Pin's late father-in-law, received praise directly from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who said that his company is “in line with the Party Central Committee” and that he “always actively does what our Party committees and governments at all levels advocate.”

Guanqiu's son, Lu Weiding, took over the company after his father's death in 2021. 

New Jersey campaign finance records show that Lu donated $5,800 to Sherrill's gubernatorial campaign in November 2024. 

“Everyone here is a Communist Party member,” Lu said in a 2018 speech, which honored the 97th anniversary of the CCP. “Wanxiang's hallmark is to promote cadres from among its members and recruit party members from among its cadres. … A towering tree must have its roots; a stream flowing through a mountain must have its source.”

Sherrill is the second Democrat running in a competitive governor's race who counts Pin as a financial backer.

Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Abigail Spanberger received $50,000 in donations from Pin to support her campaign, the Washington Free Beacon reported in August. Additionally, federal campaign finance records reveal that Pin and Lu are massive donors to candidates and political committees across the country — primarily Democrats, but with some smaller contributions earmarked for Republicans. Examples include former President Joe Biden, the nonprofit group that put on the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ). 

HOW THE CCP'S PROPAGANDA MACHINE USES WESTERN ELITES TO BOLSTER ITS LEGITIMACY

The donations made by Pin have raised legal concerns among some experts. 

Chinese law, for instance, typically forbids members of the CCP from holding foreign citizenship or permanent residency. To make campaign contributions, people must either be green card holders or citizens of the United States. 

“It's bad enough if Spanberger is taking illegal campaign donations from a foreign source, but outrageous that it's from a member of the Chinese Communist Party,” National Legal and Policy Center counsel Paul Kamenar told the Washington Free Beacon in reference to its reporting on Spanberger, noting that the group would file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.

Sherrill is a longtime supporter of policies favoring electric vehicles. Those same policies could be beneficial for Wanxiang Group's bottom line. Recent polling indicates that, despite New Jersey's historically Democratic leanings, Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli is locked in a statistical tie with Sherrill as controversies mount for the Democrat.

The Sherrill campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the Michigan church shooting, the effort to end the war in Gaza, a possible government shutdown and more.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update Monday on the FBI investigation into the shooting and fire at a Michigan Mormon church on Sunday.

"Based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note. All of those questions have yet to be answered, but certainly will be answered by the FBI," Leavitt told "Fox & Friends" after speaking with FBI Director Kash Patel.

Leavitt said the FBI is "currently executing multiple search warrants at the residences and the family homes of this perpetrator to try to get to the bottom of why he would commit such an act of evil."

The White House press secretary praised local law enforcement for their response to the shooting.

"Local police officers were on the ground of this scene within minutes and neutralized this shooter, no doubt saving lives, and they should be commended. Our police officers are heroes and this president will always respect them and support them," Leavitt continued.

Leavitt said the shooter was a member of the community and previously served in the United States Marine Corps in Iraq. 

"His family is cooperating with the FBI. And so they are currently trying to dig in and get to the bottom of why he committed – there's just this heinous act of violence. It's unfathomable. And as the president rightfully put in his Truth Social yesterday, this appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians," she added.

Acting US Attorney for Northern Texas Nancy Larson says new video showing I.C.E agents protecting detainees proves ‘lie' about agency wrong on ‘America Reports.'

An anti-ICE agitator is facing federal charges after allegedly threatening to kill a U.S. Border Patrol agent during a protest at an Illinois facility over the weekend. 

A crowd gathered outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago, on Saturday to protest immigration enforcement operations in the area, federal prosecutors said. 

According to the criminal complaint, Paul Ivery approached an agent outside the facility and said words to the effect of, "I'll f---ing kill you right now," and, "Do something." Ivery then fled from Border Patrol agents and, at one point, pulled one agent's helmet, authorities said.

He then allegedly ran away from agents and jumped on top of an occupied civilian vehicle on the street, which resulted in damage to the car.

Ivery is one of at least four people facing federal criminal charges stemming from the protests in Broadview.

The others are Jocelyne Robledo, Ray Collins and Hubert Mazur. Both Collins and Robledo allegedly had loaded guns on them at the time, authorities said. 

The Trump administration has vowed to criminally prosecute those who act violently toward immigration authorities. 

On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that America has entered a "new era of political violence," amid a rise in attacks and threats against federal officers.

"Assassins have tried to murder President [Donald] Trump twice and tried to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh," Bondi said in a post on X. "In Minnesota, legislators, and even children attending Mass, were gunned down in cold blood in two separate incidents, and an assassin targeted and murdered our friend Charlie Kirk. A sniper shot three people at a Texas ICE facility, and now more than 200 violent rioters were at a Chicago ICE facility, chanting, ‘Arrest ICE, shoot ICE.' At least one had a gun."

She noted if protesters "so much as touch one of our federal officers," they will be sent to prison.

"We've seen this before. We saw it in Portland and with the LA riots. These are not peaceful protests. These are coordinated attacks by radical extremists, and they end now," Bondi said.

"Anyone who threatens or assaults our federal officers will be arrested and charged federally, not in some liberal state court," she added. "Same goes for anyone who's funding and aiding these extremists. You will be dismantled brick by brick. We are taking our country back. Make America safe again."

Bondi's remarks came a day after she announced that Justice Department agents will be deployed to ICE facilities nationwide.

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., weighs in on efforts to avoid a government shutdown as the president is set to meet with Jeffries and Schumer.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has signaled that Democrats are not budging on their key demands ahead of a high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump about government funding.

The federal government will enter a partial shutdown at midnight on Wednesday if Republicans and Democrats do not reach a deal on funding priorities for fiscal year (FY) 2026, which ends at the end of the day on Sept. 30.

All but one House Democrat rejected Republicans' plan for a roughly straightforward extension of FY 2025 funding levels, through Nov. 21, aimed at giving appropriators more time for a longer-term deal.

Jeffries blasted the measure — called a continuing resolution (CR) — as partisan and has demanded that Republicans make concessions on healthcare in exchange for Democratic support.

He signaled during a last-minute news conference on Monday that Democrats would reject anything less than a written plan to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"No one can trust their word on healthcare. Are you kidding me? These people have been trying to repeal and displace people off the Affordable Care Act since 2010. That's 15 years," Jeffries said. "And on behalf of the American people, we're supposed to simply take their word that they're willing to negotiate? The American people know that would be an unreasonable thing for us to do."

Jeffries also pointed out that an alternate CR offered by Democrats would expand those subsidies under the ACA, colloquially known as "Obamacare," permanently.

It comes hours before he, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., are set to meet with Trump to discuss government funding at 3 p.m. on Monday.

Johnson and Thune, along with other Republicans in Congress, have been pushing Democrats to accept the deal on the table — pointing out that funding levels have remained roughly the same since former President Joe Biden's time in office.

"We are ready, we are willing, we are able to find a bipartisan path forward and reach a spending agreement that actually keeps the government open, but meets the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety, and their economic well-being related to lowering the high cost of living, as opposed to allowing tens of millions of Americans to experience dramatically increased health care costs," Jeffries told reporters.

"What we will not do is support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people."

The COVID-era Obamacare subsidies are due to expire at the end of this year without any action by Congress.

Thune told NBC News' "Meet the Press" on Sunday that he would be open to negotiating a deal but not paired with the current government funding talks.

"We can have that conversation, but before we do, release the hostage. Set the American people free, keep the government open, and then let's have a conversation about those premium tax credits. I'm certainly open to that. I think we all are," he said. 

"I will say … that particular program is desperately in need of reform. It's fraught with waste, fraud and abuse. So we are going to have reforms if we take action there, but I think there's potentially a path forward."

The GOP-led CR passed the House earlier this month largely along party lines.

It's now on the Senate, where at least several Democrats will be needed to reach the 60-vote threshold to proceed with the bill.

Schumer is under tremendous pressure by his left flank after playing a key role in advancing Republicans' earlier CR in March, which extended through Sept. 30.

This time, however, Jeffries assured that he and Schumer are in "lock-step" on bucking the Republican plan unless a compromise is reached.

He said of their upcoming sit-down with Trump, "We're heading into the meeting to have a good faith negotiation about landing the plane in a way that avoids a government shutdown but does not continue the Republican assault on the healthcare of the American people."

"Republicans control the House and the Senate, and there's a Republican president. If the government shuts down, it's because Republicans want to shut the government down," Jeffries said at another point.

Johnson, meanwhile, hammered Democrats' position in an appearance on "Sunday Morning Futures."

"We passed a continuing resolution, a simple, very clean, 24-page continuing resolution to keep the government open for seven more weeks, so the appropriators can finish that process," Johnson said.

"And [Schumer] said, 'No. Instead, I want to add $1.5 trillion in new spending to a seven-week stopgap bill…we want to reinstate free healthcare to illegal aliens paid for by U.S. taxpayer dollars. We want to claw back the $50 billion that we passed, Republicans passed, in our big, beautiful bill, the Working Families Tax Cuts, to provide for rural hospitals and healthcare, and a laundry list of other partisan priorities. He knows it's a nonstarter."

In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI “therapy” as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice. 

But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.

“The reality is millions of people are using these tools and they're not going back,” said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.

___

EDITOR'S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.

___

The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users' health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn't human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.

The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity. 




And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.




Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, said the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.

Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.

“This could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,” she said. “That's not what's on the commercial market currently.”

That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.

Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies — including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat — on how they “measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.” And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.

Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.

From “companion apps” to “AI therapists” to “mental wellness” apps, AI's use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around. 

That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada. 

But even a single app can be tough to categorize.

Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is “very muddy” about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.

Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.

Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick's website described its chatbot as “Your empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,” but now it's a “chatbot for self care.” 

Still, “we're not diagnosing,” Stephan maintained. 

Users can set up a “panic button” to call a trusted loved one if they are in crisis and the chatbot will “nudge” users to seek out a therapist if their mental health worsens. But it was never designed to be a suicide prevention app, Stephan said, and police would not be called if someone told the bot about thoughts of self-harm.

Stephan said she's happy that people are looking at AI with a critical eye, but worried about states' ability to keep up with innovation.

“The speed at which everything is evolving is massive,” she said.

Other apps blocked access immediately. When Illinois users download the AI therapy app Ash, a message urges them to email their legislators, arguing “misguided legislation” has banned apps like Ash “while leaving unregulated chatbots it intended to regulate free to cause harm.”

A spokesperson for Ash did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.

Mario Treto Jr., secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, said the goal was ultimately to make sure licensed therapists were the only ones doing therapy.

“Therapy is more than just word exchanges,” Treto said. “It requires empathy, it requires clinical judgment, it requires ethical responsibility, none of which AI can truly replicate right now.”

In March, a Dartmouth College-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.

The goal was to have the chatbot, called Therabot, treat people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response. 

The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot's response was harmful or not evidence-based.

Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.

“The space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,” he said.

Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples' thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not. 

Therabot's team sought to avoid those issues.

The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective. 

“They want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,” he said. “So, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.”

Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers.

“Not everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,” he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, “telling them, ‘I know that there's a workforce shortage but here's a bot' — that is such a privileged position.”

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Authorities in the Bahamas closed most schools Monday as Tropical Storm Imelda dropped heavy rain in the northern Caribbean, including over Cuba where landslides killed at least one man.

The storm was located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Great Abaco Island of the Bahamas, which is still recovering from Hurricane Dorian after it slammed into parts of the Bahamas as a devastating Category 5 hurricane in 2019.

Imelda had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) and was moving north at 9 mph (15 kph). It was forecast to become a hurricane on Tuesday and spin out to open ocean, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for parts of the northwestern Bahamas, including Eleuthera, the Abacos, Grand Bahama Island and the surrounding keys. Power outages were reported in some areas, with authorities closing government offices on affected islands. Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for some islands over the weekend.








Imelda was expected to drop 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, and 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) across eastern Cuba. State media in Cuba reported that 60-year-old Luis Mario Pérez Coiterio died in Santiago de Cuba following landslides in that area. 

“After two days of intense rains in the municipality of Santiago de Cuba, we are now in the stage of saving human lives and the economy of the entire city,” Mayor Indira Oliva Bueno said, according to a broadcast aired by the official Caribe channel.

In the easternmost part of Cuba, from Camagüey to Guantánamo, authorities supplied food and drinking water to residents, according to official TV reports.

Overall, Imelda forced the evacuation of some 1,291 people across Cuba, with 158 of them staying in shelters.

“We are working with our agricultural colleagues to provide food to the population, which is essential,” said Alexander Olivares, president of the San Antonio del Sur Defense Council in Guantánamo.








Meanwhile, Hurricane Humberto, a Category 4 storm, churned in open waters nearby, which forecasters said would cause Imelda to abruptly turn to the east-northeast, away from the southeastern United States coast.



AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Tropical Storm Imelda forms and is expected to become hurricane off the US East Coast in coming days.

“This is really what's going to be saving the United States from really seeing catastrophic rainfall,” said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert for AccuWeather, a private U.S. weather forecasting company.

DaSilva said the two storms would draw closer and start rotating counterclockwise around each other in what's known as the Fujiwhara effect. 

“It's a very rare phenomenon overall in the Atlantic basin,” he said.

Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph). It was located about 320 miles (515 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda, moving north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). A tropical storm watch was in effect for Bermuda.

“This is going to be no threat to the United States,” DaSilva said.



However, moisture from Imelda was expected to move up the Carolinas, with heavy rain forecast through Tuesday morning. The heaviest rains will be limited to the coastline, from Charleston in South Carolina to Wilmington in North Carolina, while Charlotte and Raleigh might receive only 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) of rain, he said.

The Carolinas might see wind gusts of 40 mph, but only along the coastline, DaSilva said, as he warned of dangerous surf and heavy rip currents all week. 

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said authorities were prepositioning search and rescue crews over the weekend.

In North Carolina, Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency even before Imelda formed, while authorities on Tybee Island off the coast of Georgia handed out free sandbags to residents.

Even though Imelda was not making landfall in Florida, its impact was still felt. 

At the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, crews found a couple of turtle hatchlings that rough surf had tossed ashore.

“We actually had two washbacks come in over the weekend,” said Justin Perrault, the center's vice president of research. “We may get more as the day goes along.”

He said typically beachgoers will see a hatchling resting in the seaweed and call the center for help.

Further south in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Carl Alexandre exercised at the beach on Monday. He said he was grateful the storm was not heading toward South Florida, but that he would pray for those in the Bahamas.

“It's great that we're not having one as of right now,” Alexandre said. “And now we get to run in the Florida sun.”

Mick Varley, who was visiting Fort Lauderdale from London, said he's delighted the storm will remain offshore.

“I'm very happy it's not going to disrupt our plans,” he said.



As Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane Humberto swirled in open waters, authorities in Bermuda prepared for two near misses.

“It's going to be a double whammy for Bermuda, Humberto first and Imelda following close behind,” Da Silva said.

He said Imelda could pass within 15 miles (24 kilometers) of Bermuda as the Atlantic season's soon-to-be fourth named hurricane. Meanwhile, the center of Humberto is expected to pass west and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Michael Weeks, Bermuda's national security minister, urged residents to prepare, warning that there have been “some near misses this season regarding severe storms.”

“Hurricane Humberto is a dangerous storm, and with another system developing to our south, every household in Bermuda should take the necessary steps to be prepared,” he said.

Flights to and from the islands in the Bahamas were canceled, with airports expected to reopen after weather conditions improve.

Electronic Arts, the maker of video games like “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is being acquired for $52.5 billion in what could become the largest buyout ever funded by private equity firms. 

Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners will pay EA's stockholders $210 per share. Affinity Partners is run by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The deal is valued at $55 billion if EA's debt is included, far exceeding the $32 billion price tag to take Texas utility TXU private in 2007, which had shattered records for leveraged buyouts. 

PIF, which was currently the largest insider stakeholder in Electronic Arts, will be rolling over its existing 9.9% investment in the company. 

The commitment to the massive deal is inline with recent activity in the gaming sector by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote Andrew Marok of Raymond James. 

“The Saudi PIF has been a very active player in the video gaming market since 2022, taking minority stakes in most scaled public video gaming publishers, and also outright purchases of companies like ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely,” he wrote. “The PIF has made its intentions to scale its gaming arm, Savvy Gaming Group, clear, and the EA deal would represent the biggest such move to date by some distance.” 

PIF is also a minority investor in Nintendo.

If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted 52 cents. 




The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by “Strat-O-Matic” as a teenager during the 1960s.

CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013 and he will remain in that role, the firms said Monday. Electronic Arts would be taken private and its headquarters would remain in Redwood City, California.

“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future,” said Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. “I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.”

The size of the video game market has attracted large investors in recent years. 

One of EA's biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft for nearly $69 billion in 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified.

This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake is also part of a newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the U.S. oversight of TikTok's social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven't been divulged yet.

Silver Lake also bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9 billion deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9 billion buyout of personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returned to the stock market with publicly traded shares in 2018.

By going private, EA will be able to retool operations without worrying about market reactions. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA's annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion.

Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company thinks the proposed deal's $210 per share offer price may be falling short of EA's intrinsic value.

“With Battlefield 6 about to launch and a pipeline that could add more than $2B in incremental bookings by FY28, the true earnings power of EA is only beginning to emerge,” he wrote.

Hickey is unsure if the transaction is in shareholders' best interest.

“In our view, this transaction is a self-serving, opportunistic move by management and the investor group,” he wrote. “Management has long been rumored to seek a sale around $200 per share, a level that may have been defensible in prior years but not in the current environment where visibility into growth, franchise momentum, and pipeline strength is far more robust. The board's decision to recommend a sale at $210 per share suggests a prioritization of near-term certainty and legacy over maximizing long-term shareholder value.”

But Nick McKay of Freedom Capital Markets believes the offer makes sense for EA because share price appreciation is likely limited given that the success of its sports franchises and various live services streams are already mostly baked into the stock. 

“The financial backing and resources of the investor consortium should enable EA to increase its focus on long-term growth opportunities that may have been viewed as too risky or expensive as a public company,” he wrote in an analyst note.

EA shares, which rose nearly 5% on Monday, had jumped 15% on Friday after rumors of a takeover began to circulate. 

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027. It still needs approval from EA shareholders.

Top Democrats celebrate Trump's conviction as accountability, but call the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as political payback.

Top Democrats are striking two very different notes on accountability: cheering President Donald Trump's felony conviction as proof that "no one is above the law," while blasting the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as pure political payback.

COMEY INDICTMENT SPARKS FIERCE POLITICAL REACTIONS NATIONWIDE

In 2019, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said during a discussion at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco that Democrats believe "no one is above the law," including the commander-in-chief. 

"Everybody wants the president to be held accountable in the most serious way. And everybody believes, now I'm talking on the Democratic side, that no one is above the law, especially the President of the United States," Pelosi said.

Former President Joe Biden reiterated the "no one is above the law" mantra before his White House remarks on the Middle East on May 31, 2024.

He said the New York case against Trump was "a state case, not a federal case," decided by "a jury of 12 citizens" after five weeks of evidence and deliberation. 

COMEY DENIES CHARGES, DECLARES 'I AM NOT AFRAID'

The jury, Biden noted, "reached a unanimous verdict" finding Trump guilty on 34 felony counts, while emphasizing that Trump has the right to appeal.

"That's how the American system of justice works," Biden said, calling it "reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible" to claim the trial was rigged simply because of an unfavorable outcome.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., addressed Trump's conviction in a June 3, 2024, floor speech saying that "former President Donald Trump is now a convicted felon."

"The most important takeaway from this case is that nobody's above the law, including Donald Trump," he added.

On the heels of Comey's indictment, Schumer said Sunday that he has "no faith in Trump's judicial system."

Schumer said on NBC News' "Meet the Press" that Trump "has turned this judicial system to be his own political fighter."

"He tells them to go after people he doesn't like. He tells them to exonerate people that he likes," Schumer said.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., denounced what he called a "malicious prosecution," reminding reporters that Trump previously fired a prosecutor who refused to bring "frivolous charges."

TRUMP ANSWERS WHETHER COMEY INDICTMENT IS ABOUT JUSTICE OR REVENGE

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued an even sharper rebuke.

"This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power," he warned. "By ousting a respected, independent prosecutor and replacing him with a partisan loyalist, Trump is undermining one of the most important U.S. attorney's offices in the country and eroding the rule of law itself."

As Democrats leaned on the "no one is above the law" refrain, Trump struck back — telling reporters Friday at the White House that the indictment against the former FBI chief was about rooting out corruption, not political payback.

"It's about justice really, it's not revenge," Trump said. "It's also about the fact that you can't let this go on. They are sick, radical left people, and they can't get away with it, and Comey was one of the people."

"He wasn't the biggest, but he's a dirty cop," Trump said, adding, "He's always been a dirty cop. Everybody knew it."

Trump's comments came after Comey was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. He was indicted on two counts: alleged false statements within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.

Comey's arraignment is set for 10 a.m. on Oct. 9 before District Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff. If convicted, Comey faces up to five years in prison.

Colin Cowherd explains why fans should slow down the Chicago Bears' hype despite Caleb Williams' preseason success (so far). 

Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson had an awkward interaction with an NFL sideline reporter before the third quarter of their game on Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders.

CBS' Aditi Kinkhabwala caught up with Johnson before the second half began. She qualified her question with the Bears' struggles on offense and asked what he told his team in the locker room.

"That it wasn't our brand of football. We're capable of a lot more," Johnson said. "So, we're hitting the reset button here at halftime. We're gonna come back and establish our identity here in the second half."

Kinkhabwala then added, "You need to change what you're doing."

Johnson appeared to be a little stunned with the response.

"I don't know. You think so?" he said as Kinkhabwala smiled. "We're gonna be just fine."

The interaction sparked a frenzied response on social media.

But whatever Johnson told his team in the locker room seemingly had an effect on his players.

Bears quarterback Caleb Williams started the team's first drive of the second half strong. He led a seven-play, 40-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to Rome Odunze. The team scored a field goal and another touchdown in the fourth quarter – thanks to D'Andre Swift.

Chicago caught a break at the end of the game.

Geno Smith led the Raiders on a six-play, 22-yard drive to give kicker Daniel Carlson a decent shot at the go-ahead field goal. However, Carlson had his 54-yard attempt blocked.

            Police in Madagascar's capital fired teargas on Monday at thousands of people who returned to the streets for a third round of youth-led protests against water and power cuts, with many calling for the government's resignation.
    


            Inspired by the so-called “Gen Z” protests in Kenya and Nepal, the demonstrations are the largest the Indian Ocean Island has seen in years, and the most serious challenge President Andry Rajoelina has faced since his re-election in 2023.
    


            Authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Thursday after protests in the capital Antananarivo turned violent.
    


            Protesters on Monday gathered at a university in Antananarivo where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march through town, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed.
    


            In another part of town, police cleared rocks and telephone poles that protesters had used to barricade roads, and fired teargas to disperse the crowd, footage broadcast on Real TV showed.
    


            Many in the crowd called for the resignation of Prime Minister Christian Ntsay, his government, and Rajoelina.

            The latest protests come after Rajoelina said on Sunday he would thoroughly review and reform the governance in the country.
    


            “If there have been mistakes, I recognize them, and I am now looking for ways to correct everything,” he said in a speech in the Anosibe neighborhood of Antananarivo, where some looting and vandalism took place on Friday.

            Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina said on Monday he was dissolving the government following youth-led protests over water and power cuts in which the United Nations says at least 22 people have been killed and more than 100 injured.
    


            Inspired by the so-called “Gen Z” protests in Kenya and Nepal, the three days of demonstrations are the largest the Indian Ocean island has seen in years, and the most serious challenge Rajoelina has faced since his re-election in 2023.
    


            “We acknowledge and apologize if members of the government have not carried out the tasks assigned to them,” Rajoelina said in speech on state broadcaster Televiziona Malagasy (TVM).
    


            The president said he wanted to create space for dialog with young people, and promised measures to support businesses affected by looting.
    


            “I understand the anger, the sadness, and the difficulties caused by power cuts and water supply problems. I heard the call, I felt the suffering, I understood the impact on daily life,” he said.
    


            The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the casualties include protesters and bystanders killed by members of the security forces, but also others killed in subsequent widespread violence and looting by individuals and gangs not associated with the protesters.

            Madagascar's ministry of foreign affairs rejected the casualty figures reported by the UN, saying the data did not come from competent national authorities “and are based on rumors or misinformation.”
    


            On Monday protesters gathered at a university where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march towards the city center, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed.
    


            Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd, after authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew last week.

            The protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign this month and have also used similar online organization tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation.
    


            Rajoelina first came to power in a 2009 coup. He stepped down in 2014 but became president again after winning the 2018 election, and secured a third term in a December 2023 poll that his challengers said was marred by irregularities.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

New Mexico lawmakers are to open a special session Wednesday to boost funding for food assistance and rural health care — actions the Democratic governor contends are needed to “minimize the damage from President Trump's disastrous bill” cutting federal taxes and spending. 

The special session follows one in Colorado, where the Democratic governor asserted Trump's tax cuts wreaked havoc on the state's budget. Oregon's Democratic officials also are wrestling with whether a special session is needed. And California Democrats recently passed new spending measures meant to counteract Trump's big bill.

Nothing like that is happening in Republican-led states. 

The diverging responses highlight the partisan schism over Trump's signature legislative accomplishment of his second term and raise the question: Are Republican-led states ignoring the financial fallout, or are Democratic-led states overstating the urgency?

“Probably Democrats are doing a little bit for grandstanding,” said Steven Rogers, an associate political science professor at Saint Louis University who focuses on state governments.

“On the Republican side, they may also just be OK with it — or they don't want to poke the Trump bear,” Rogers said.

The sweeping new law, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by Republicans, is likely to affect some states more than others. Federal tax cuts could reduce revenues for states that link their own income taxes to the federal code, starting with 2025 tax returns.

Federal spending reductions on Medicaid and food benefits also could cause states to spend more of their own money on social safety net programs. But new Medicaid work requirements, which are among the most prominent changes, don't begin until 2027. Administrative cost shifts to states for food stamps begin in October 2026, with additional performance-based cost shifts in subsequent years. 

Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has called upon New Mexico lawmakers to preemptively earmark more money this fiscal year toward food assistance and rural health care. 

Lawmakers also are looking to expand state subsidies for health insurance policies bought through the Affordable Care Act exchange, which covers about 75,000 residents. They point to the potential for enhanced federal subsidies to expire at the end of this year. 

“We're not going to sit idly and watch that disaster happen,” said Democratic state Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth. 

Though New Mexico expects to lose about $200 million annually because of new federal tax cuts, starting this fiscal year, it still has a large surplus thanks to booming oil production.

“We're in a position fiscally to be able to be proactive,” Wirth said, “and really try and hold New Mexicans as harmless as we can to these cuts that are coming.”

Legislation recently signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom provides $255 million for California's response to Trump's big bill and other federal policy changes. That includes $84 million to try to reduce errors in benefit payments in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Those food benefits currently are fully covered by the federal government, but states with error rates greater than 6% could have to pay part of the cost starting in October 2027.

Trump's big bill also expands work requirements for adults participating SNAP, which is expected to force some people off the program in the coming months. The California legislation provides $40 million for counties to implement the new SNAP requirements and pumps $20 million into emergency food banks, a one-third increase over previously approved state funding.

“We have been as diligent, as strategic as we can to backfill as much of those dollars as we can,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat, told The Associated Press. 

The new spending comes as California budget officials warn of a looming multibillion-dollar deficit.

Because their tax codes are closely linked to the federal one, most of the new federal tax breaks automatically apply to state income taxes in Colorado and Oregon.

In August, Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis became the first to call lawmakers into special session while citing Trump's bill. His administration said the federal tax cuts blew an estimated $783 million hole in the current state budget. 

The Democratic-led Legislature filled part of that gap by eliminating some corporate tax breaks and authorizing the sale of state tax credits to raise revenue. 

In Oregon, Democratic officials are weighing whether to decouple from some of Trump's tax changes to avoid losing hundreds of millions of state tax dollars. Such a move could allow the state to continue taxing tips and overtime wages. 

“It is a very politically risky bill to pass, let alone have a special session again for ANOTHER tax vote,” Democratic state Rep. Rob Nosse said in a recent newsletter. “But at the same time it will allow us to stave off some of the cuts coming to health care and to food stamps.”

Like Colorado and Oregon, the Republican-led states of Iowa, Montana and North Dakota also use “federal taxable income” as the starting point for their state taxes and automatically incorporate federal tax changes. Yet officials there haven't raised major concerns.

Montana stands to lose an estimated $114 million annually as a result of the new tax cuts. But lawmakers likely can wait until their next regular session in 2027 to address any impacts, said Republican state Rep. Larry Brewster, chair of the Legislature's interim revenue committee. 

“I think it's a concern, but I don't think it's an urgent problem for us,” he said.

Leaders of the North Dakota Legislature, which isn't scheduled to meet until 2027, are discussing holding a session early next year, but not because of federal tax cuts. Rather, lawmakers would decide how to spend the state's share of $50 billion of rural health care grants included in Trump's big bill.

Iowa's conformity to the federal tax code could cost its general fund $437 million this fiscal year, according to the state revenue department. The state's finances also could suffer from Trump's trade war with China, a top export market for farmers. The state still has billions of dollars in reserves. 

“We're in a good position to weather some of the ag and some of the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said, “but we also have to be mindful as we move forward.”

            Video game maker Electronic Arts is going private in a $55 billion deal that's funded by Saudi Arabia and a Jared Kusher-backed investment firm.
    


            The company, which makes hits like “Madden NFL,” “The Sims,” and “Battlefield,” announced Monday that the consortium is led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Kushner's Affinity Partners. They are paying shareholders $210 per share — making it the largest buyout on record.
    


            Shares of EA (EA) jumped about 5% in early trading. The purchase is a 25% premium on Friday's closing price prior to reports of a buyout, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
    


            “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a press release.
    


            Kushner said he's admired EA's “​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​— and now enjoys them with his ​kids — I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead.”
    


            The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027 and is subject to regulatory approval.
    


EA, founded in 1982, has a broad portfolio of well-known hits, ranging from sports to first-person shooting games, including the eagerly awaited release of “Battlefield 6.”
    


            Last year, the company laid off 5% of its workforce, joining other video game companies that have reduced their headcount after experiencing a boom during the height of Covid-19 and changing consumer habits.

EXCLUSIVE — Rep. Byron Donalds's (R-FL) campaign for Florida governor received a boost on Monday with the endorsements of law enforcement leaders across the Sunshine State. 

Over a dozen sheriffs backed Donalds, one of two Republicans who have announced bids to succeed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Donalds received one of his first high-profile endorsements in February when President Donald Trump endorsed his candidacy. 

The endorsements “cement Donalds as the MAGA candidate and the law and order candidate for Florida,” the Donalds campaign said. Five of the sheriffs representing the state's top 10 counties by population were among the authorities to back Donalds this week. They include Miami-Dade County Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz, Hillsborough's Chad Chronister, Duval's T.K. Waters, Lee's Carmine Marceno, and Pasco's Chris Nocco. 

“Congressman Byron Donalds is the leader that Florida needs in this moment, as we work and stand with President Trump to implement the mandate he received from the American people and the citizens of our great state of Florida,” said Nocco, the first sheriff to endorse Donalds, in a statement touting the congressman's ties to Trump. 

Nocco cast Donalds as DeSantis's natural heir. The governor has yet to endorse a successor, as his wife, Casey DeSantis, is rumored to be weighing her own bid for the office. 

“I know Congressman Donalds will stand with law enforcement as we work to keep Florida safe and will be innovative in his ideas to create jobs, improve education, and make our economy more competitive. Florida has been blessed to have a fantastic legacy of Governors with Governor Rick Scott and Governor Ron DeSantis. I know future Governor Byron Donalds will continue that legacy, and he will keep making Florida great,” Nocco said. 

Other sheriffs who supported Donalds's bid for office this week included Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith, Brevard's Wayne Ivey, Collier's Kevin Rambosk, Hendry's Steve Whidden, Indian River's Eric Flowers, Jackson's Donnie Edenfield, Martin's John Budensiek, Monroe's Rick Ramsay, St. Lucie's  Richard Del Toro, and Wakulla's Jared Miller. 

Donalds is one of multiple leading House Republicans declining to run for reelection in the midterm elections. Instead, they are choosing to back away from national politics by mounting bids for offices in their home states. 

Donalds and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, who entered the race earlier this month, are the two Republicans challenging Democrat David Jolly to become Florida's next governor. 

The Donalds campaign has highlighted recent polling giving the congressman a commanding lead in the Republican primary. A survey by the American Promise gave Donalds 40% of the vote outright. Renner and another rumored GOP candidate would each take 2%, with another 54% of voters remaining unsure of which Republican to support ahead of the 2026 election.

A poll looking at where voters place Donalds in relation to Democratic candidates ahead of the general election gave the congressman an 8-point lead over Jolly, 49% to 41%. Of those surveyed in the poll, conducted in late August by the AIF Center for Political Strategy, 11% of Floridians remained undecided about their candidate.

BYRON DONALDS TARGETS DAVID JOLLY ON GUN CONTROL AS FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE HEATS UP

Jolly's campaign has touted a poll it commissioned in early September showing the Democrat in a statistical tie with Donalds and Renner, with nearly 20% of voters undecided. 

Jolly's internal polling also indicated that with over 13 months to go until the general election, the leading candidates lack name recognition. More than half the respondents reported they do not know who Donalds, Jolly, or Renner are, with Donalds receiving the highest name recognition rate.

﻿Why are so many young men turning toward fatherhood?

There is a real case of baby fever going around — and it's coming from America's young men. Fifty-seven percent of men 34 and under want to be parents now. Compare that to just 45 percent of women the same age who want to have a kid now, and it's a stat that turns antiquated notions of parenthood on its head.

In a time where report after report tells us that men are in crisis, why do so many men want to turn to fatherhood? Phillip Maciak thinks the answer could be found on our television screens. He's a TV critic at the New Republic and teaches a course on fathers and in pop culture at Washington University in St. Louis. He's also the author of an upcoming book, titled Dad: A Pop History. Maciak says that young people have a different perception of what it means to be a father. “Largely Gen Z students have grown up in a time when dad is an adjective as much as a person,” he says. “I think it's a more malleable thing for them.

The adaptability of fatherhood may sound like a new phenomenon, but according to Maciak, even our “traditional” picture of what it means to be a dad is fairly new. “One of the things that is really at the center of my research on this is that this is a relatively modern idea,” Maciak told Vox. “I think that the idea of the dad is constantly evolving. We see it changing rapidly and transforming every day.”

How has our image of fatherhood changed over the decades? And what mirror does television hold up to us about the ways we parent? Maciak answers these questions on this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Maciak, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Where did the pop culture idea of the dad first originate? 

The dominance of this idea is a post-World War II thing. It was tied in with men's experience of returning from World War II to the suburbs. The central media that helped to synthesize all of that stuff was television, and specifically the family sitcom. These television shows were both reflecting something about American culture and providing a model within American culture that tracks pretty closely to a kind of timeline of the evolution of this figure.

What are the greatest hits of TV dads?

There's a lot of places to start, but it starts for me with Ward Cleaver of Leave It to Beaver as the archetypal 1950s dad of suburbia. He works all day and comes home at night, but when he comes home, it's very clear that his role as a father is of central importance to him. It tells us a lot about the idea of fatherhood in the 1950s as being an identity category for American men. You feel alienated at work. You feel alienated in all these other realms of your life. But as a father, that's who you can be.

I think Archie Bunker on All in the Family is a really good example of a generational clash. He's a conservative blowhard who's got a feminist daughter and a son-in-law who is a campus activist. They're negotiating this difference in an understanding of not just what society is, but what manhood is.

I think then the next sort of big ones are Cliff Huxtable, The Cosby Show in the 1980s, and also Steven Keaton on Family Ties. These are dads who are the product of feminist reimaginings of what fatherhood is in contemporary life. They support their wives' careers. They take an active role in co-parenting their children.

All of the things that have happened to our understanding of Bill Cosby in the years since then are startling because Cliff Huxtable is such a good dad.

The biggest TV dads of the 21st century are the anti-heroes of the prestige dramas: Tony Soprano, Walter White, Don Draper. They're all dads, and the center of their drama in lots of ways is “What does fatherhood mean?”

Who is the dad of 2025? If you had to pick a symbol from our pop culture moment right now, who is that dad?

I think this feels like a particularly fraught year for the dad. For a long time, the dad as an archetype has been this kind of liberalizing figure, even when it applies to a politically conservative dad. It's about moving away from an idea of fatherhood as disciplinary and more about support and presence.

But I also think that that model is under threat more than it has been in a while. [You also have] this retro, patriarchal vision of fatherhood that you get out of the manosphere, where fatherhood is about giving orders and fatherhood is about leadership and fatherhood is about sternness rather than flexibility, adaptability. It's a weird time for pop culture dads.

﻿What the Supreme Court plans to do to America in its upcoming term.

Three issues dominate the Supreme Court term that begins next week, based on the cases the justices have agreed to hear so far. Realistically, however, there is little uncertainty about how this GOP-dominated Court will resolve two of them.

The uncertain question is whether the Court will strike down President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariffs — a question the justices will take up in November. The tariffs are clearly illegal under a doctrine the Republican justices used to halt many of President Joe Biden's policies. And many leading conservatives are vocal opponents of the tariffs, some of whom are even involved in this case. But the Court's Republican majority rarely breaks with Trump.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

There's less mystery about how the Court will handle two other groups of cases, which concern election law and LGBTQ+ issues.

The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a 2021 dissenting opinion, “has treated no statute worse” than the Voting Rights Act — the landmark 1965 law that banned race discrimination in elections. Kagan's Republican colleagues repealed central provisions of the law, and misread other provisions of the law so egregiously that it is hard to believe they are acting in good faith.

In its upcoming term, the Republican justices are widely expected to expand on this project — abolishing the Voting Rights Act's longstanding safeguards against racial gerrymandering. And they are expected to do so at the very moment that President Donald Trump is pushing Republican lawmakers to gerrymander their states to lock the Democratic Party out of power.

The Court is also likely to advance another of the Republican justices' longstanding projects: destroying campaign finance regulation. One of the few campaign finance laws that even most Republican judges have historically supported is a cap on donations to individual candidates. During the 2026 election cycle, for example, congressional candidates may only accept up to $3,500 from each individual donor to their primary election campaign, and another $3,500 for their general election campaign.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC, however, the Republican justices are likely to open up a loophole that would effectively allow donors to give tens of thousands of dollars to individual candidates, thus increasing wealthy donors' ability to trade money for favors.

The other big loser in the upcoming term is likely to be queer people. The Court seems poised to strike down bans on “conversion therapy,” where therapists try to suppress their patients' sexual orientation or gender identity. It's also likely to uphold state laws requiring student athletes to play on a sex-segregated team that aligns with their sex assigned at birth.

Many of the biggest cases of the upcoming term, moreover, are yet to be determined. The Court announces which cases it will hear during its October to April argument sessions on a rolling basis, typically finalizing the full list during the winter. Last term, the Court handed down a long string of temporary decisions handing significant victories to Donald Trump — including a decision permitting him to fire so many federal employees that many federal programs cease to function. Several of these cases are likely to return to the Court in 2026, so we will find out soon if the justices intend to permanently endorse many of Trump's most aggressive attempts to remake American society.

In the meantime, here are the significant cases the Court already plans to hear in its upcoming term, and what's at stake in each of them.

If you've paid attention to US economic policy or business news these past several months, you're already familiar with the tariffs cases. Trump has imposed very high, and frequently changing, taxes on goods imported to the United States. Many federal judges have determined that these tariffs are illegal. The justices will decide in the upcoming Supreme Court term whether they agree.

Trump claims that the tariffs are permitted under a federal law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which enables the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” IEEPA, however, only permits the president to use this power “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.”

The plaintiffs challenging the tariffs raise several statutory arguments against them. Among other things, they argue that the power to “regulate” imports does not include the power to tax them. And they also argue that Trump hasn't identified any “unusual and extraordinary threat” that can justify the tariffs. The president points to trade deficits with other nations; those have been commonplace since the 1970s.

Additionally, the Republican justices frequently struck down Biden-era policies that, in their words, involved questions of “vast ‘economic and political significance.'” Trump's tariffs have enormous economic and political significance. So, if the Court's Republicans intend to apply the same rules to Trump that they did to Biden, they must strike the tariffs down.

In 2023, the Supreme Court shocked pretty much everyone who follows election law when it upheld a lower court decision requiring Alabama to redraw its congressional maps to include an additional Black-majority district. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in Allen v. Milligan, the lower court's decision holding that Alabama's original maps violated the Voting Rights Act “faithfully applied our precedents.” But the Republican justices had shown such unrelenting hostility to the Voting Rights Act that the Court's decision to honor those precedents was shocking.

Now, however, it appears that Milligan was a one-off decision, and the Court's decision in that case was likely due to bad lawyering by Alabama's attorneys. On October 15, the Court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case that is virtually identical to Milligan, and the justices asked for special briefing on whether the Voting Rights Act's anti-gerrymandering safeguards violate the Constitution.

So it's not hard to guess how this case will turn out. A decision abolishing those safeguards is likely to devastate Black representation in red states where voting is racially polarized — meaning that Black people overwhelmingly vote for Democrats while white voters similarly favor Republicans. It's also likely to supercharge Trump's efforts to gerrymander Congress to lock the GOP into power, because it will remove a barrier that Republican lawmakers had to overcome in order to draw partisan gerrymanders.

In their infamous decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), the Republican justices held that corporations may spend unlimited amounts of money to influence US elections. That led to a proliferation of entities, such as super PACs, that can spend millions of dollars on behalf of a particular candidate, but which are at least nominally distinct from that candidate's campaign. In theory, super PACs are not supposed to coordinate their spending or messaging with the candidates they support.

Direct donations to candidates, by contrast, are still capped; in the 2026 election cycle, congressional candidates may raise no more than $7,000 per donor. Political parties, meanwhile, may accept donations subject to a higher cap. Party committees like the Republican State Leadership Committee or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for example, may accept donations up to $44,300 per year.

Federal law prohibits these party groups from coordinating with individual candidates to determine how these larger donations are spent. As the Supreme Court warned in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), “expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign might well have virtually the same value to the candidate as a contribution and would pose similar dangers of abuse.” If the DCCC, for example, can accept a $40,000 donation from a donor who wants to use that money to elect Joe Smith to Congress, and if the DCCC can work with Smith's campaign to determine how that money is spent, then the law might as well allow donors to give $40,000 directly to Smith's campaign.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP asks the Court to tear down this prohibition on coordinated expenditures, and effectively permit wealthy donors to give tens of thousands of dollars directly to candidates. Given the Republican justices' hostility to campaign finance laws, it is likely that Republicans will get what they want.

Much of transgender politics over the past several years have focused on the issues at the heart of Little and B.P.J. Many states have laws that prohibit trans student athletes from playing on sports teams that align with their gender identity. The Supreme Court is going to decide whether those laws violate either the Constitution or a federal ban on sex discrimination in education.

Realistically, these would be tough cases for the trans community to win even if the Court were not dominated by conservative Republicans. In Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), the Court held that a federal law prohibiting “sex” discrimination by employers forbids anti-trans discrimination in the workplace. The Court reasoned that if an employer “intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth,” then it is treating workers differently based on their sex.

But the Bostock framework does not apply to sports, because sports teams are one of the few areas where US law generally tolerates sex segregation. Sex discrimination is inherent in the very concept of a men's or women's sports team, so trans advocates cannot challenge exclusionary policies simply by pointing out that they engage in sex discrimination.

And, of course, the Court is dominated by conservative Republicans who, in United States v. Skrmetti (2025), recently held that states may prohibit minors from receiving gender-affirming health care. So trans advocates face a difficult uphill climb in Little and B.P.J.

About half of US states have laws restricting “conversion therapy,” a discredited method of counseling that attempts to turn LGBTQ+ patients cisgender or heterosexual. The Colorado law at issue in Chiles, for example, bars conversion therapy for patients under age 18, though it also exempts counselors who are “engaged in the practice of religious ministry.”

As one federal appeals court explained, “every major medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional mental health organization opposes the use of conversion therapy.” The American Psychological Association, for example, says that it “‘puts individuals at a significant risk of harm' and is not effective in changing a person's gender identity or sexual orientation.”

That said, Chiles does raise a difficult First Amendment question. On the one hand, it's not hard to imagine how a law prohibiting some forms of talk therapy implicates the constitutional guarantee of free speech. On the other hand, the law has historically permitted states to regulate professional misconduct, even if that misconduct involves speech. A lawyer may be disbarred for telling a client that it is legal to rob banks, and a physician can be charged with murder if they tell a patient to drink a jug of arsenic.

Will those examples be enough to persuade this Supreme Court that the Colorado law is a regulation of professional misconduct, and not an attack on free speech? Unlikely. But the justices will, at least, need to wrestle with how to distinguish speech by a lawyer or doctor from speech by a therapist.

Nearly a quarter century ago, in Atkins v. Virginia (2002), a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican justices held that offenders with an intellectual disability may not be sentenced to death. They reasoned that these individuals have diminished mental capacity, at least as compared to nondisabled adults, and thus bear less moral responsibility for homicide crimes. Another decision three years later applied the same logic to juvenile offenders.

Both decisions were met with mockery and derision from the Court's right flank, and that right flank now controls the Supreme Court. So the question in Hamm v. Smith is just how far these justices will go to roll back decisions like Atkins.

The death row inmate at the heart of Smith, Joseph Clifton Smith, took several IQ tests where he scored slightly above 70. Courts often look at whether an inmate's IQ score is below 70 when determining if they are intellectually disabled, though the Supreme Court has held that other factors can support a finding that Smith has an intellectual disability. Nevertheless, if a majority of the justices want to decide Smith narrowly, they could simply rule that borderline cases such as Smith do not fall within Atkins, and that Smith may be executed.

A second possibility is that the Court could overrule Atkins, thus permitting people who unquestionably are intellectually disabled to be killed by the state.

And then there's a third possibility. Writing for the Republican justices in Bucklew v. Precythe (2019), Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to suggest that the past six decades of Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishments should be tossed out, and that courts should simply ask whether a particular form of punishment was considered too cruel in 1789.

If Gorsuch gets his way, that would be a catastrophic event for all criminal defendants. Among other things, Gorsuch's approach would likely eliminate any constitutional concerns about disproportionate punishments. So someone could potentially get the death penalty for shoplifting, or life in prison for jaywalking.

It's also theoretically possible that the Supreme Court will agree with a lower court that held that Smith may not be executed. But, given the Republican Party's broad support for the death penalty, that outcome seems unlikely.

The specific legal issue before the Court in Bost is fairly low stakes: The Court will decide if the plaintiffs in this case — candidates for federal office — are permitted to bring a lawsuit seeking to toss out many ballots in states that permit voting by mail. Even if these plaintiffs prevail in the Supreme Court, though, that will only give them an opportunity to pursue their (entirely ridiculous) legal challenge in lower courts.

The case is worth watching, however, because three of the Trumpiest judges in the country handed down a decision last year claiming that it is illegal for states to count mailed-in ballots that are mailed before Election Day, but that arrive afterward.The three Fifth Circuit judges' opinion in that case, known as Republican National Committee v. Wetzel, claims that an 1872 law setting the date for federal elections also prohibits states from counting ballots that arrive after that date, and somehow no one noticed this fact for the previous 152 years.

In any event, the Fifth Circuit routinely hands down decisions that are too outlandish even for this Supreme Court, and it is likely that the justices will eventually reverse the decision in Wetzel. Depending on what the Court says in Bost, that decision may wind up shutting down Wetzel as well.

The cases listed above are drawn exclusively from the matters the justices have already agreed to hear on their merits docket. They will undoubtedly be joined by several more blockbuster cases, including multiple challenges to Trump's mass firings, attempts to cancel federal spending, and his aggressive use of federal law enforcement.

Even without these additional cases, however, the 2025–'26 term is already shaping up to be extraordinarily consequential.

            At 20, the young woman was struggling. She'd just given birth and had tuition, rent and baby formula to pay for. A single mother in Phoenix, she was trying to make ends meet and build a future, studying for her psychology degree.
    


            “It kind of gets (to be) so much that you can't ask somebody for help,” she told CNN.
    


            Then one night, a Snapchat post seemed to offer a way out: “5-10k in a day lmk.”
    


            Desperate, she swiped up.
    


            “I said, ‘What is this for? What you guys doing?' And they had explained to me, ‘You're going to be picking up people.' And I'm like, ‘People? Do they need a ride? What's going on?'”
    


            She stopped short of pressing for details. She didn't have a car or even a license, so she was convinced she couldn't do the job anyway.  But she couldn't stop thinking about the money. A week later she had another idea: Her friend had a car and could drive. Could they split the money?
    


            “Yeah, we'll still pay,” came the reply.
    


            She didn't stop to think much about the dangers or whether the offer was too good to be true — or legal.
    


            Her friend headed south, collected a group of migrants near the border, and drove back again. Later that night, a man handed the young woman a wad of cash.
    


            She was now involved in migrant smuggling, enlisted by a Mexican cartel recruiter through social media. An American operating entirely inside the United States, she was nevertheless extending the reach of cross-border gangs making money from trading people and drugs.
    


            CNN has spent six months investigating how the cartels recruit, how people get sucked in and how law enforcement is tackling the problem which can, at first glance, look as innocent as a young, licensed person taking a drive through the desert.
    


            The easy money kept coming for the young woman, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals but spoke with CNN by phone.
    


            She said she did not know the man who brought her the money that first time, or all the times that followed.
    


            “It would always be random people … that would bring me the money to get paid,” she said. “And from that point forward, it was just me finding people that would go and … drive, and we would split the money.”
    


            For months, she reposted the same message on her own Snapchat story: “5-10k in a day lmk.” She helped to recruit scores of drivers who smuggled nearly 100 people north from the US-Mexico border, according to court documents.
    


            The risks became clear only when one of those drivers was stopped, she said.
    


            “That one guy I had on Snapchat messaged me like, ‘Hey, this person got pulled over, they got arrested, they're getting questioned, make sure you have everything off of your phone.' And I was like, whoa … what's happening. That's when I realized, OK, this is what's going on,” she said.
    


            But she didn't stop.
    


            “I feel like I fell too deep into what was going on … the money that was being made … I was, at the time, being selfish. … I really didn't care.”
    


            It took federal investigators at least four months to flag her account, and she was arrested soon after. She pleaded guilty to charges connected to being a social media recruiter and was sentenced to prison.
    


            Even after her release, she said, she never knew who was on the other end of the account.
    


            “To my knowledge it was one person that I would communicate with. But now … it could have been multiple people on one account … I truly have no clue who I was working for.”
    


            Experts believe the anonymous account was most likely run by an operative of the Sinaloa Cartel, which dominates smuggling routes through Arizona. Most of these anonymous accounts, authorities say, trace back to cartel-linked recruiters.
    


            Tech companies sporadically work with local police to track and deplatform harmful accounts, law enforcement sources say. The Drug Enforcement Agency, which specifically monitors narcotics smuggling nationwide, “works closely with numerous social media companies to strengthen their ability to combat drug trafficking on their platforms,” a spokesperson said. Without identifying specific platforms, the representative said that “while some companies have been highly receptive, others have been less engaged.”
    


            CNN reached out to several platforms that host smuggler recruitment material for comment.
    


            A TikTok spokesperson told CNN its teams use automated moderation technology to counter some of this material, which identifies harmful posts before they reach users' feeds; between January and March, the platform says it “proactively removed 95.6% of content which breached (TikTok's) policies on the trade or marketing of regulated goods.”
    


            The spokesperson also referenced an excerpt from the platform's community guidelines: “We respect human dignity and are committed to protecting people from exploitation. That's why we don't allow content that promotes or facilitates human trafficking or smuggling.”
    


            For its part, Snapchat said it similarly employs proactive detection designed to target the hiring of smugglers across the southern border of the US. The platform told CNN it has been able to detect and remove thousands of pieces of such content and noted that it blocks search results associated with smuggler recruitment.
    


            Meta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Its community policies instruct users not to post content that “offers to provide or facilitate human smuggling” or “asks for human smuggling services.”
    


            The offers of cash for criminal work can pop into anyone's feed. CNN's six-month investigation uncovered hundreds of recruitment posts on Facebook, TikTok and Snapchat—some in Spanish but many in English.
    


            Those recruited are usually young adults between 18 and 25, according to more than two dozen attorneys who represent accused smugglers and were interviewed for this story.
    


            Among them, there's no distinct profile. Accused smugglers may be addicts, wannabe cartel foot soldiers, or straitlaced high schoolers, the lawyers said. Vicki Brambl, an assistant federal public defender in Tucson, Arizona, says certain risk factors—like a prior criminal history, drug use or growing up in a low-income household—can increase the likelihood someone will get involved with smuggling. But in one case, the son of a local cop was involved.
    


            “Anyone can be a target,” says Brambl, who's supervised dozens of smuggling cases. Many recruited to these networks, like the young woman in Phoenix, are desperate and see stacks of cash advertised on social media as either a way out or a risk worth taking; Brambl added many don't have the maturity or judgment to realize the dangers.
    


            The hundreds of social media posts advertising smuggling jobs analyzed by CNN show patterns and some veiled terminology.
    


            The word “smuggler” almost never appears; recruiters opt for terms like “drivers” or “choferes” or simply “taxis.” A taxi or car emoji can also put out a call for drivers, sometimes with chicken emojis to indicate “pollos,” Spanish slang used to refer to migrants.
    


            Emojis and coded language enable cartel-linked recruitment accounts to circumvent content moderation restrictions on mainstream social platforms, which have seen scattered attempts to clamp down on narco-related content. TikTok banned the hashtag #carteltok earlier this year, though it is almost never used by members of these stateside criminal networks.
    


            But the cartels do want the posts to be elevated into people's feeds, so many use hashtags, like #fyp (for you page) and #viral, in addition to tagged locations in population hubs along the US-Mexico border.
    


            After establishing communication on mainstream social platforms, the recruiter often moves the conversation to Meta's WhatsApp, with its end-to-end encryption and ability to track others in real time.
    


            Next, the smuggler travels hours or even days to coordinates sent by their anonymous recruiter — some from as far as New York or Seattle, law enforcement officers and recruiters in Arizona and Texas said.
    


            Coordinators can use real-time location tracking to monitor their drivers en route — and post screenshots to encourage prospective recruits.
    


            At the pickup location, often down a remote dirt road, lawyers said, a group of migrants jumps into the car. What happens next is up to chance: Some drivers make it to drop-off locations in Phoenix or Tucson, dodging license plate readers and checkpoints on desert highways saturated with police.
    


            It's possible to circumvent law enforcement — one active cartel recruiter boasted about having ‘bought off' three checkpoints and federal agencies have admitted several of their officers helped facilitate smuggling in recent years.
    


            Other drivers are arrested — collateral damage in a massive criminal enterprise they can only begin to grasp.
    


            Now, the incentive for young Americans to get involved is on the rise: With illegal border crossings falling amid the Trump administration's crackdown, the price to cross has increased dramatically, and bigger payouts are available for drivers, according to the active recruiter and a former federal law enforcement official.
    


            In a Phoenix parking lot, a man grumbled that the Trump administration has made his job more difficult.
    


            The senior Sinaloa Cartel operative, whom CNN interviewed to better understand the inner workings of these cross-border networks, is responsible for directing the flow of migrants and drugs in southern Arizona.
    


            Several of his associates have been jailed since Trump took office.
    


            Earlier this month, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced 617 arrests and over $12 million in currency and asset seizures during a concentrated effort to dismantle Sinaloa Cartel operations in the US and abroad.
    


            The man, whose position CNN confirmed independently, said he could be arrested too, but that would not stop the business.
    


            “People are still going to bring things” into the US, he said, adding he thought the administration's focus was misguided. “(Trump) wants to fight with the Mexicans, with others … but the problem is here.”
    


            He said the drivers recruited through social media should know the risks. “When you want to work … yes, you understand.”
    


            But it seems even he wishes he had never gotten involved.
    


            Years ago, he said, he began working for the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico, smuggling marijuana to feed his family. Now, he might make a different choice. “No vale la pena,” he says: Cartel work isn't worth the risk.
    


            Nearing 9 p.m. in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, a team of counter-smuggling detectives was wrapping up for the night.
    


            In the final days of an 18-month investigation, the officers spent the afternoon surveilling suspects they believed were involved in managing one corridor where migrants and drugs pass into the US.
    


            Then, one of the Cochise County Sheriff's deputies spots a suspect's gray sedan parked outside a nearby ATM.
    


            The officer swung his undercover truck around, radioing his team to converge on a man who was depositing a $50 bill into the machine. “All right, I'll pull behind him and pin him in.”
    


            They closed in. “Police, don't move!” one of the officers yelled, drawing his rifle.
    


            They detained the man, a 21-year-old out with his girlfriend and their toddler, and then searched his Chevrolet Malibu.
    


            They found a baptism gown wrapped in plastic hanging in the back seat and an iPhone in a bedazzled case, which the couple shared. Police said its screen still showed a WhatsApp conversation about a group of “pollos” who had just crossed the border nearby.
    


            Another conversation from just a few days before mentioned a failed attempt to pick up a group of migrants. “We dipped because that pollo stopped answering and there was border patrol,” one of the man's associates told him, according to law enforcement.
    


            The officers told CNN the young man helped run a criminal syndicate that transported migrants and drugs across the border. A detective walked him across the parking lot to say goodbye to his family, then guided him into a waiting squad car.
    


            The iPhone was bagged as evidence to be brought back to the Cochise County Sheriff's Office and searched for signs of his involvement with cross-border smuggling, like recruitment ads posted to social media.
    


            Away from targeted operations, the counter-smuggling team patrols Cochise County's 83-mile stretch of the border. The desert sprawls into the Mexican state of Sonora and on distant peaks, the sheriff's deputies say, cartel scouts sit with binoculars watching their every move.
    


            To evade law enforcement, smugglers have used repurposed school buses, fake border patrol trucks and other means to move their product, and only close inspections can distinguish these from the real thing.
    


            So, the patrols flag down suspicious vehicles and check them, one by one, harnessing a sophisticated network of license plate readers and other high-tech monitoring tools to suggest who might be out of place, like a college student, far from home, hoping for a quick payday after clicking on a post in a social media feed.
    


            Federal prosecutors levied smuggling charges against 431 people over the past six months in Arizona alone, Department of Justice data shows.
    


            Earlier this year, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and several other legislators introduced a bipartisan bill calling for a crackdown on cartels using social media to recruit. It has made no progress in the Senate or the House of Representatives.
    


            The recruitment posts, however, continue.

Democrats are refusing to back away from calling President Donald Trump and his allies “fascist,” as Republicans intensify warnings that the rhetoric is reckless and fuels political violence.

A gunman opened fire last week at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, killing one detainee and injuring two others. Less than two weeks earlier, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated, with officials saying the suspect left behind ammunition etched with a reference to fascism.

Democratic lawmakers and leaders, however, have refused to walk away from the label, most typically associated with Nazi Germany, arguing that Trump's conduct in office leaves them no choice but to call it the way they see it. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on her book tour last week, compared Trump and his allies to “a communist dictatorship” for quashing dissent. 

That defiance was echoed about two weeks ago at a press conference in which Democrats denounced what they described as an assault on free expression, held after ABC suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for remarks about Kirk's assassination.

“Fascism is not on the way. It is here,” Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) said at the event. “The First Amendment is how generations of Americans, from civil rights activists to labor organizers, American workers, LGBTQ+ activists, have fought for progress, and it is our power.”

At the same press conference, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) was asked by a reporter whether Democrats' rhetoric was partly to blame for political violence. He said candor was essential.

“Donald Trump is trying to destroy our democracy. He is trying to silence free speech. He is acting in a way that is scarily similar to many would-be despots all across history,” Murphy said. “We have no obligation to sugarcoat the gravity of this moment. The only way we save this nation is if the people of this country rise up in peaceful protest, if they mobilize all across America.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) was equally blunt in a House Oversight Committee hearing that same day. “We need to stand up against this fascist takeover,” she said. “That's not a bad word, it's a fact.”

Democrats have steadily escalated their warnings about Trump by invoking the language of fascism. Back in 2022, then-President Joe Biden described Trump's governing philosophy as “semi-fascist.” By the next year, Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), her running mate, dropped any qualifiers, calling Trump a fascist outright. 

The message sharpened further in August 2025, when Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin delivered a fiery address at the party's summer meeting, declaring Trump represented not just partisan opposition but an existential threat. 

“This is not politics as usual, my friends,” Martin told the crowd. “This is authoritarianism. It's fascism dressed in a red tie. And we, each of you in this room, and all of the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.”

Martin has not backed away from the “fascist” label. But in a statement after the ICE shooting last week, he struck a different tone, condemning the violence and urging unity. 

“It will take all of us, not just one side of the aisle or the other, to quell this epidemic of violence, which has no place in our democracy,” he said.

A Democratic strategist, speaking on background to reflect candidly on the situation, acknowledged the risks of that approach. 

“I think there's no doubt that the political temperature in our country is a bit too hot right now,” the strategist said. “At this moment, I would advise any Democratic candidate or politician I work with not to use the word ‘fascist' or ‘dictator' in their jargon, especially after what has played out lately.” 

Even so, Democrats and their allies argue the president's actions aren't making it easier to hold back. They denounced Thursday's move by federal prosecutors to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime Trump target, as politically motivated and lacking merit. 

“The Comey stuff makes this all really complicated,” the strategist added. “But I think two wrongs don't make a right, and Democrats need to take the high road.”

Republicans argue the Democrats' language is incendiary and dangerous. 

“If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you politically is a Nazi,” Vice President JD Vance told a crowd in North Carolina last Wednesday, a reference to both the ICE shooting in Dallas last week and Kirk's killing two weeks earlier as proof of rising risks. 

Strategists echoed the warning. 

“They are inciting crazy people to do crazy things through their very words,” GOP strategist Dennis Lennox said. “Democrats aren't going to win next year by pouring gasoline on the fire.”

Greg Manz, another Republican strategist, argued Democrats were guilty of projection: “Their history, especially during the Biden administration, is riddled with censoring free speech and weaponizing the government,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Now they stand idle as law enforcement faces surging assaults. This smear tactic won't stick; it'll backfire.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee recently cited polling showing liberals are more likely than conservatives to say political violence is sometimes justified. 

“For far too long, Democrats have excused riots, smeared conservatives as ‘fascists,' and winked at violent rhetoric from their own ranks,” spokesman Mike Marinella said. “Now the numbers prove it: The Left has normalized hate and turned political violence into just another talking point.” 

And a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), the Congressional Leadership Fund, has begun targeting Democrats in vulnerable districts who have used the term, accusing them of crossing a line and abandoning “decency and morality.”

DEMOCRATS DECRY COMEY INDICTMENT AFTER PRAISING CASES AGAINST TRUMP: ‘NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW'

Trump, speaking at Kirk's memorial last Sunday, tied the killing to the broader fight over rhetoric. He said the same people now “screaming fascism” had implied Kirk deserved his fate.

“No side in American politics has a monopoly on disturbed or misguided people,” Trump said. “But one part of our political community believes they have a monopoly on power, thought, and speech. Well, that's not happening anymore.”

Oregon filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump on Sunday, claiming the president unlawfully deployed the National Guard in Portland.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said sending 200 National Guard troops to his state was not due to any legitimate threat but was done so the president could exert his political strength “under the guise of law and order.”

Trump ordered the National Guard to Oregon after numerous protests targeting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, some of which have been reportedly violent. Trump ordered “all necessary troops” to Portland on Sunday. 

“I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,” Trump posted to his Truth Social on Saturday. “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

PORTLAND MAYOR SAYS NUMBER OF NECESSARY TROOPS IN CITY IS ‘ZERO' AFTER TRUMP ORDERS DEPLOYMENT

Rayfield, Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman, and other state officials filed the lawsuit. They said deploying such troops for law enforcement duties violated federal law.

“The ‘traditional and strong resistance of Americans to any military intrusion into civilian affairs' has ‘deep roots in our history,'” the lawsuit read. “Our nation's founders recognized that military rule — particularly by a remote authority indifferent to local needs — was incompatible with liberty and democracy. Foundational principles of American law therefore limit the President's authority to involve the military in domestic affairs.”

The plaintiffs cited the 1972 court case Laird v. Tatum as evidence for their claim. They also said the Constitution prohibited the president from deploying such troops and that, typically, only Congress had the authority to do so.

“Those principles stem first from the U.S. Constitution, which reserves the general police power for the states while establishing civilian control over the military,” the lawsuit read. “It also affords Congress, not the President, the power ‘to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.'” 

“While Congress has delegated a portion of that power to the Executive, it carefully limited the President's authority to exert control over a state's National Guard — the modern term for the militia — to specific circumstances. And for over a century and a half, Congress has expressly forbidden federal military interference in civilian law enforcement,” the lawsuit noted. 

Rayfield said, “Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference. Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal.”

Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR) shared Rayfield's sentiments. She also accused the president of violating federal and constitutional law, including the 10th Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act, among other things.

“This is not necessary. And it is unlawful,” Kotek said. “There is no insurrection or threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland or any other city in our state.”

“Defendants have trampled on these principles by federalizing members of the Oregon National Guard for deployment in Portland, Oregon, to participate in civilian law enforcement,” the lawsuit read. “On September 28, 2025, the Secretary of Defense (now referred to as the Secretary of War) issued a memorandum calling into federal service 200 members of the Oregon National Guard.”

TRUMP ORDERS HEGSETH TO DEPLOY TROOPS TO PORTLAND

“Citing nothing more than baseless, wildly hyperbolic pretext — the President says Portland is a ‘War ravaged' city ‘under siege' from ‘domestic terrorists' — Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon's sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,” the plaintiffs claimed.

“The facts cannot justify this overreach,” the plaintiffs claimed in the lawsuit.

            New York City Mayor Eric Adams ended his reelection bid Sunday to the tune of Frank Sinatra's “I Did It My Way,” walking down the stairs of Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, and sitting down next to an enlarged photo of his late mother to say he was exiting the field.
    


            “Only in America can a story like this be told,” Adams said.
    


            It was an ending similar to the beginning, when Adams, standing in the middle of Times Square held a photo of his mother as he was sworn in as New York City's second Black mayor, promising to represent the interests of working-class New Yorkers.
    


            Nearly four years later, Adams said he was ending his bid for reelection because of a lack of funding and a media campaign that he felt had sought to undermine his chances.
    


            Adams' exit from the race will breathe new, if temporary life into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's struggling campaign.
    


            There was cautious optimism among members of Cuomo's operation on Sunday. Two senior aides to Cuomo who were granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations said the campaign was confident Adams' exit would help consolidate badly needed support behind the former governor including from some unions and Black supporters who were supporting Adams.
    


            The sources said high-powered donors who could pitch in significant sums of money were also expected to help the Cuomo campaign – a crucial boon for any candidate particularly as the race enters its last stretch before the general election in New York City's expensive media market.
    


            Over the next few weeks, Cuomo is expected to broaden his message and try to appeal to more than just moderate Democrats who do not support candidate Zohran Mamdani who is a democratic socialist. The sources said the campaign also wants to target Republicans who do not believe Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa is a viable candidate.
    


            Cuomo's campaign does not expect Sliwa to leave the race, the sources said. Instead, the campaign hopes to “minimize” his presence and broaden its appeal to Republicans who do not see Curtis as a serious candidate and do not want to “waste their vote.”
    


            A senior aide to Cuomo also left open the possibility for a potential endorsement from Adams who appeared to highlighted the importance of experienced candidates in his video.
    


            Cuomo aides are not sure they want an outright endorsement but are hoping to keep relations warm. Cuomo's statement after Adams' announcement praised his record despite their past differences. As of Sunday afternoon, though, Cuomo had not spoken with the mayor directly.
    


            News that Adams would end his reelection bid reached Mamdani as he was about to greet volunteers at a canvas event in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Mamdani continued his scheduled stops on Sunday, including a visit to Black-owned small businesses in Brooklyn before rushing to campaign headquarters in Manhattan where he recorded a video response to Adams' announcement and did a round of TV interviews.
    


Obama's advice, socialists' demands, meetings with skeptics: Inside Mamdani's prep to run New York City



            Over the next few weeks, Mamdani's campaign expects to roll out several endorsements and continue the frenzied pace of campaigning Mamdani has sustained in recent months. While Mamdani has decreased the number of publicized events, aides say he spends most days in meetings bouncing between coalition building and setting up his potential transition while continuing to appear in houses of worship across the city and attending volunteer events.
    


            Internally, aides to Mamdani see Adams' exit from the race as a boost and confirmation of a central line of attack Mamdani has deployed against his chief opponent in recent weeks: That Cuomo is Trump's chosen candidate and that his campaign represents the interests of the city's elite business class, billionaire donors and real estate powers who already spent millions of dollars during the primary to try and derail Mamdani's campaign.
    


            Sliwa, a radio host whose claim to fame is founding the Guardian Angels – a vigilante watchmen group that patrolled the streets of New York City in the 1980s – showed no signs of exiting the race as of Sunday.
    


            Although Sliwa is polling ahead of Adams in the most recent surveys, Democrats largely outnumber Republicans in New York City by more than 6 to 1, making his path to victory extremely unlikely.
    


            Sliwa, who has never held public office and has no prior government experience, has focused his campaign on public safety.
    


            The writing had been on the wall for Adams' reelection bid for weeks.
    


            Facing a pressure campaign to leave the race, Adams lashed out in recent days, blaming the media for trying to “undermine” his reelection, saying a constant stream of negative headlines about his reelection prospects had made it virtually impossible for him to raise money to fund his run.
    


            “I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the campaign finance board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign,” Adams said in a video announcing he was leaving the race.
    


            In reality, it was a steady stream of corruption scandals involving members of his inner circle and senior members of his administration coupled with Adams' efforts to cozy up to Trump after his own federal indictment last year that proved fatal for his reelection chances.
    


            Adams, a retired New York Police Department Captain has overseen a record drop in crime over the last three years and notched significant accomplishments during his administration – including a major overhaul of the city's land use rules which have opened the door to build much needed housing and development.
    


            Governor Kathy Hochul – who endorsed Mamdani earlier this month – praised Adams' record, saying she had been proud to work with him.
    


            “He leaves New York City better than he inherited it and that will always be central to his legacy as mayor,” Hochul said in a statement.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York who has held back his endorsement of Mamdani and is not considered an ally of Adams, also praised the mayor's record. Jeffries made it clear he would not weigh in on the race just yet, saying he would do so “well before the start” of early voting in New York City, which begins at the end of October.
    


            Adams, who had recently increased campaign-style events is now expected to focus the next few months on solidifying his legacy as prepares to leave City Hall and it remains unclear whether he will seek to help or hurt any of the remaining candidates in the race. Adams – the city's second Black mayor – is on track to repeat the same fate of the first. David Dinkins, who made history as the city's first Black mayor lost his reelection bid to Rudy Giuliani in 1993.

The White House on Monday released a 20-point plan by President Donald Trump to end the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

The release came minutes before Trump began speaking at the White House about the proposal, which has not been agreed to by Hamas. 

Trump was joined by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Trump said that Israel and other nations have accepted the outline he detailed.

"If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages, immediately, but in no case more than 72 hours," Trump said. That provision would require all dead and living hostages to be released by Hamas.

"I hope that we're going to have a deal for peace, and if Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they're the only one left," Trump said.

"Everyone else has accepted it. But I have a feeling that we're going to have a positive answer. But if not, as you know Bibi you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do."

The plan calls for Gaza to "be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. 

The plan also calls for Gaza to "be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza," and, "If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end."

"Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release," the proposal said.

"Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty," the proposal says. "Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries." 

"Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip."

Netanyahu said, "I believe that today, we're taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East." 

"I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims," Netanyahu said.

He warned that Israel would continue to prosecute the war if Hamas refuses Trump's plan.

"If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then, then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself," Netanyahu said.

"This can be done the easy way, or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done."

The S&P 500 inched up on Monday as Wall Street tried to regain its footing after a week in which the artificial intelligence trade lost some steam.

The broad market index climbed 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, however, falling 60 points, or 0.1%.

AI chip darling Nvidia rose after skepticism around the AI trade put pressure on the broader stock market last week. Some traders even questioned whether there was enough energy to power an infrastructure plan between Nvidia and OpenAI. Nvidia was last higher by 2%. Other AI stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology added 2% and 3%, respectively.

Meanwhile, shares of Electronic Arts jumped 4% after the video game company announced that it's going to be taken private in a $55 billion deal. U.S. M&A announced has surpassed $1 trillion year-to-date so far this year, up 29% from the same time a year ago, according to Goldman Sachs.

U.S. stocks slipped last week as cracks appeared in a key pillar of the bull market rally — enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence buildout. The S&P 500 saw its worst weekly performance since Aug. 1. The Nasdaq also recorded its weakest week since early August, and the Dow posted first loss in three weeks.

But Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays, believes that capital expenditures in the AI industry is still ultimately providing a boost to the market.

"The AI capex story is showing no signs of slowdown. Moreover, other industries have also been benefiting from the tidal wave of AI infrastructure spend," he said in a note on Monday. "Concentration warrants some caution, but with AI gaining momentum as the focal point of global growth, S&P 500 should be well-positioned vs. peers given its Tech-heavy sector mix."

All eyes are watching for a possible shutdown of the federal government as this week's funding deadline looms. The Labor Department is preparing to not release any data, including the September nonfarm payrolls report that was slated for release Friday, if a shutdown cannot be averted. Additionally, President Donald Trump told NBC News over the weekend that mass firings of federal workers could take place in the event of a shutdown.

"We are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis," the president said, adding that he'd "rather not do that."

Government shutdowns have historically not impacted markets much, but sentiment could take a hit if any delays around the release of key economic data muddy the interest rate outlook for the Federal Reserve.

The market is still poised for modest gains for the month of September. The S&P 500 has increased 3% this month, while the Dow has risen 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been the outperformer with a 5% rally.

Coal stocks are rising after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to keep power plants from closing. 

Peabody Energy jumped nearly 8%, Ramaco Resources rose more than 3%, and Core Natural Resources was up more than 1%.

The Department of Energy will invest $625 million to support the struggling industry, with $350 million dedicated  to upgrade and recommission coal plants. 

And the Interior Department announced Monday it would make 13.1 milion acres of federal land available for the industry to lease.

President Donald Trump signed a series of exceutive orders in April aimed at boosting coal production in the U.S. The coal inudstry has struggled as plants have been displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable energy in recent years.

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking "to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse."

While the department's scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

"BLS will suspend all operations," the 73-page plan stated. "Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released."

Alibaba shares gained about 4% on Monday, reaching a fresh 52-week high, after Morgan Stanley earlier lifted its price target on the Chinese cloud giant.

After Alibaba's Apsara Conference 2025, analyst Gary Yu walked away more bullish on the company's cloud revenue business, upgrades in its AI models and accelerating international expansion. He maintained his overweight rating on the stock while lifting his price target by $40 to $200, which suggests 16.3% potential upside from its latest close. 

Yu pointed out that Alibaba management during the conference highlighted strong demand, saying the number of tokens it was processing has been doubling every 2 to 3 months.

"BABA also announced new developments during the conference, such as 1) its flagship model Qwen3-Max (ranking top 3 globally) and Bailian agent platform upgrades, 2) partnership with NVIDIA on physical AI, and 3) accelerating overseas expansion with the first data centers launching in Brazil, France, Netherlands etc," Yu added. "We expect these initiatives, in addition to increased capex, to further accelerate cloud growth, and thus we raise our cloud growth estimates to 32% for F26 and 40% for F27 (vs. 30% for each of F26 and F27 previously."

Novo Nordisk could be due for even more losses over the coming months, spurred by a pullback in the growth rate of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, according to Morgan Stanley.

U.S. shares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant were under pressure in late morning trading Monday after analyst Thibault Boutherin downgraded the stock to underweight from equal-weight, saying that there's a "tough path ahead." The analyst also cut his price target to $47 from $59, which reflects more than 15% downside from Friday's close.

"We expect downward revisions to 2026-27 consensus from slower US GLP-1 prescription growth and competitive pressure, and we see catalysts with downside risk over the next 6 months," Boutherin wrote on Monday. He added that a "lack of momentum" in U.S. prescriptions for Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus specifically makes him "cautious on the short-term growth profile."

"As the window before semaglutide US/EU [Loss of Exclusivity] narrows, we expect valuation multiples to compress," Boutherin also said.

Monday's losses put the stock's year-to-date fall at more than 35%.

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Monday said the U.S. central bank faces challenges as it attempts to balance fighting stubborn inflation or protecting jobs.

"On the inflation side right now, I continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective," Hammack told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"We have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than four-and-a-half years and I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation both in the headline, in the core, and particularly, where I am worried about it, is I'm seeing it in the services," she added.

Asked whether it is mistake for the Federal Reserve to be cutting interest rates given the economic backdrop, Hammack described it as "a challenging time for monetary policy," saying the U.S. central bank was facing pressure on both sides of its mandate.

There was more good news for the housing market Monday as pending home sales unexpectedly rose in August.

The National Association of Realtors reported that houses under contact increased 4% for the month, much better than the Dow Jones forecast for no change.

"Lower mortgage rates are enabling more homebuyers to go under contract. In the Midwest, low mortgage rates combined with high levels of affordability are attracting more buyers compared to other regions," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.

Borrowing costs declined during the month, with a typical 30-year mortgage rate falling from 6.75% to 6.58%, according to Bankrate.

President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he's going to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas.

"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit!" Trump said in a Truth Social post. "Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States."

Trump first announced such plans early May. He previously said foreign productions could be a national security threat.

Shares of media and entertainment companies came under pressure Monday on the heels of the announcement. Warner Bros Discovery and Comcast, for example, dipped 0.5%. Others like Disney and Netflix were last higher, however, after initially falling in premarket trading.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

There could be more room to run for stocks, according to Goldman Sachs.

The firm upgraded global equities to overweight from neutral for the next three months, saying that "good earnings growth, Fed easing without a recession and global fiscal policy easing will continue to support equities."

"Markets have continued with their 'risk on' shift supported by a Goldilocks backdrop based on optimistic growth expectations (boosted by AI) with dovish Fed expectations," said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman's head of asset allocation research in London, in a Monday note. "While Goldilocks regimes with strong growth and low inflation can last for a long time as seen since the 1990s, the current backdrop is different as weak labor market conditions drive Fed dovishness rather than anchored inflation. 

Mueller-Glissmann noted that investor sentiment and positioning has "not picked up materially" even with the risk-on performance in the market.

"Unlike previous Goldilocks periods, positioning hasn't reached very bullish levels - flows into bonds, gold, and money markets stay strong while surveys remain somewhat bearish (only retail investors are more bullish)," he said. "We remain modestly pro-risk in our asset allocation," he added.

To be sure, Mueller-Glissmann pointed out that the Goldilocks backdrop could meet a bearish scenario in one of three ways: firstly, a growth shock due to rising unemployment rate or AI disappointments; secondly, a rate shock from the Federal Reserve not delivering on more dovish expectations or from long-term yields signaling more risk of fiscal dominance; or thirdly, increasing pessimism about the prospects of the U.S. dollar.

OpenAI on Monday announced Instant Checkout, a new feature that allows users to buy products through its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. 

Instant Checkout initially supports single-item purchases directly from U.S. Etsy sellers, and it's available to U.S. ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Free users. OpenAI said more than one million Shopify merchants, including Skims and Glossier, are coming soon. 

Shares of Etsy closed up nearly 16% on Monday. Shopify's stock closed up more than 6%.

OpenAI will take a fee from transactions that are completed through ChatGPT, which means Instant Checkout could become an important new revenue stream for the startup. OpenAI is not yet profitable, and is burning through cash as it works to scale up its computing infrastructure. 

The company declined to share specific details about how large the fees are since they are determined through confidential contracts with Etsy and Shopify. Instant Checkout is free to users and will not affect their prices, OpenAI said. 

"Our vision for ChatGPT — and a lot of the technology we create, but especially ChatGPT — is that it's not just providing you information, it is also helping you get things done in the real world," Michelle Fradin, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT commerce, told CNBC in an interview. 

The company plans to introduce multi-item carts and expand the regional availability of Instant Checkout moving forward. 

OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months and introduced product recommendations as part of its search experience in April. ChatGPT surfaces products from across the web, and the results are ranked by relevance to the user and not influenced by partnerships with OpenAI, Fradin said.

Following the launch of Instant Checkout, if users are browsing and come across a product from an Etsy seller, for instance, they'll be able to purchase that item directly through ChatGPT instead of clicking out to the merchant's site.

Instant Checkout is powered by OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol, which is the underlying technology that allows users to complete a transaction directly with a merchant through ChatGPT. OpenAI built the framework in partnership with the fintech company Stripe, which powers ChatGPT subscriptions.

"If you are already a subscriber, you're already using your card in ChatGPT, then when you go to buy something from Etsy, you don't have to redo that work," Fradin said.

OpenAI initially decided to use Agentic Commerce Protocol for e-commerce, but Fradin said the company thinks it could be used to facilitate other types of purchases or payments as well. OpenAI is open-sourcing the framework to help merchants build integrations more quickly, and so that developers can explore different use cases, she said. 

ChatGPT surpassed 700 million weekly active users in August, and Fradin said "a huge portion" of the questions people are asking are related to shopping and commerce in some capacity. The questions can be specific, such as asking for help finding a pair of black boots, or more broad, such as how to plan a birthday party for 12 kids.  

"What we wanted to do is make it even easier for users to complete their journey in ChatGPT, and for merchants and developers to convert those conversations into checkouts," Fradin said.

Anthropic on Monday announced its latest artificial intelligence model: Claude Sonnet 4.5.

The model is better at coding, using computers and meeting practical business needs, and it excels in specialized fields like cybersecurity, finance and research, Anthropic said. The Amazon-backed startup, which is valued at $183 billion, is making Claude Sonnet 4.5 available to all users. 

Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the "best coding model in the world" according to industry benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities.

"People are just noticing with this model, because it's just smarter and more of a colleague, that it's kind of fun to work with it when encountering problems and fixing them," Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's co-founder and chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview.

The model generates higher-quality code, is better at identifying code improvements and can follow instructions more reliably, the company said. 

Claude Sonnet 4.5 comes after Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.1 in August and Claude Sonnet 4 in May. It's the latest example of the breakneck pace of innovation within the AI industry.

Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers in 2021, and the two companies have been fierce competitors ever since. 

OpenAI kick-started the generative artificial intelligence boom following the release of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. The startup, which has seen its valuation swell to $500 billion, announced its latest model, GPT-5, in August. The rollout was rocky, as some users complained about losing access to the company's prior models.

Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, said that Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be the default for users and that Anthropic recommends the model for "basically every use case."

Even so, users will have options. Paid subscribers can still choose to use Opus, and users with specific workflows can select an older generation of Sonnet if they aren't ready to migrate overnight, he said.  

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is smaller than Claude Opus 4.1 but smarter than it in "almost every single way," Krieger added. 

"We have found it, and our customers are finding it, very useful for real, actual work," Krieger said.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 can run autonomously for 30 hours, and Anthropic said it's able to maintain focus on complex, multistep tasks throughout that period. Claude Opus 4, which the company launched in May, could run autonomously for just seven hours. 

Anthropic has also been able to improve the model's behavior through extensive safety training, the company said. It has reduced "concerning behaviors" like deception, power seeking and sycophancy, which is when a model tells a user what they want to hear. 

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is also more resistant to prompt injection attacks, where a model can get tricked into doing something malicious, like exposing sensitive data.  

"This is the biggest jump in safety that I think we've seen in the last probably year, year and a half," Kaplan said. 

Additional model launches are already on the horizon for Anthropic. Kaplan said better models are coming, including "very likely Opus."

"No promises," he said. "But I think that we'll probably have one or two more releases before the end of the year."

President Donald Trump on Monday bashed New York City mayoral race front-runner Zohran Mamdani and renewed a threat to withhold federal funding from the Big Apple if the Democratic nominee wins.

Trump's rant came a day after Mayor Eric Adams said that he is suspending his campaign after pressure from the president and others to quit the race to improve former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's chances of beating Mamdani in November.

"Self proclaimed New York City Communist, Zohran Mamdani, who is running for Mayor, will prove to be one of the best things to ever happen to our great Republican Party," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"He is going to have problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great City," Trump wrote. "Remember, he needs the money from me, as President, in order to fulfill all of his FAKE Communist promises. He won't be getting any of it, so what's the point of voting for him?"

Mamdani, who is a self-described democratic socialist — not a communist — bested Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Cuomo is running as an independent, as was Adams.

The Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, has refused to drop out despite pressure from Trump and entreaties from others.

President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made films and slap "substantial Tariffs" on any country that does not make furniture in the United States.

Trump's statements left key questions about the plans unanswered.

In a pair of Truth Social posts, Trump claimed that California's movie-making business and North Carolina's furniture industry have been lost to other countries, and that the new duties on imports would reverse the slide.

"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby,'" Trump wrote. "Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States."

Trump made an identical threat to tariff foreign-made films in May. 

But the White House quickly softened its tone and no action was taken. It was unclear what, if anything, was different between Trump's prior threat and his current one.

Separately on Monday, Trump wrote, "I will be imposing substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States."

That statement raised the question of whether Trump would go beyond his vow last week to slap 50% duties on imports of kitchen and bathroom furnishings, as well as 30% tariffs on upholstered furniture. 

Those product-specific tariffs, which Trump also unveiled on social media, will take effect starting Wednesday, he wrote at the time.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about Trump's latest tariff threats.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The federal government will shut down on Wednesday unless Congress can agree on a stopgap funding bill. President Donald Trump is expected to meet with the top four congressional leaders today after abruptly canceling a meeting with Democratic leadership last week. The president has warned of mass firings of federal workers if a deal cannot be reached.

Here's what to know:

Last year, a group of friends learned that a man they knew turned their social media pictures into pornographic deepfakes using a so-called "nudify" site. Such platforms represent a small but growing segment of the artificial intelligence space.

The dark side of the AI boom typically flies under the radar, but has caught the attention of lawmakers. As CNBC's Jonathan Vanian reports, the group of women have become key in the fight against nonconsensual, AI-generated pornography. Read CNBC's full investigation into these sites here.

Stocks ended last week in the red, a significant vibe shift after recently hitting all-time highs. The benchmark S&P 500 recorded its first losing week in four, while the small cap-focused Russell 2000 snapped a seven-week win streak.

Despite last week's pullback, the stock market's recent gains have pushed a measure of public U.S. companies' total value against GDP to an all-time high of 217%. That's past levels indicating traders are "playing with fire," Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in 2001.

Looking ahead, investors are gearing up for a slate of employment data due this week. Follow live markets updates here.

Honeywell is testing out new alerts that would give pilots more reaction time in hopes of avoiding close-call situations at airports, which have dominated headlines in recent years.

While serious airplane accidents are rare, a series of recent incidents have raised concern about how to best ensure safety in situations when every moment matters. Safety experts have pushed for innovation in cockpit alerts similar to what Honeywell is currently exploring.

CNBC's Leslie Josephs rode in a Boeing 757 test plane for Honeywell's new alert system. Here's what she saw.

With the help of social media and reality TV, the "dirty soda" craze is expanding far beyond its Utah roots.

"Dirty soda" — which refers to pop-based drinks with flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients mixed in — was first coined by the Utah-based chain Swig 15 years ago. Now, companies from PepsiCo to TGI Fridays are jumping on the trend as it gains traction nationwide, CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports.

The numbers don't lie: 2.7% of U.S. eateries serve a carbonated soft drink that contains cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago, per Datassential.

Here's some of what we're keeping an eye on this week:

Electronic Arts said Monday that it has agreed to be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in an all-cash deal worth $55 billion.

Shareholders of the company will receive $210 per share in cash.

EA's stock climbed 5% on Monday. The shares gained about 15% on Friday, closing at $193.35, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was nearing a deal to go private.

PIF is rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company and will, by far, be the majority investor in the new structure, people close to the deal told CNBC's David Faber.

The acquisition is the latest in a "recent gaming spree" by the Saudi PIF, which has been active in gaming since 2022, analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note early Monday.

The fund's gaming arm, Savvy Gaming, has taken stakes in public video gaming publishers and bought ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely, the analysts noted, but the deal for EA is "the biggest such move to date by some distance." 

Affinity CEO Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, touted EA's "bold vision ​for ​the ​future" in a release announcing the deal.

"I've admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids - I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead," Kushner said in a statement.

The group of companies is making a total $36 billion equity investment, with $20 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan, according to the release. JPMorgan was brought in a couple of weeks ago, people familiar with the deal told Faber.

The take-private deal for the maker of popular games like Battlefield, The Sims and the Madden series of NFL games, among others, is set to be the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.

In a note to employees, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he is "excited to continue as CEO."

"Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment," he wrote. "They are committed with conviction to EA – they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together."

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027.

There is a 45-day window to allow for other proposals, people familiar with the terms of the deal told Faber. The deal talks started in the spring, the people said.

Silver Lake, which is led by co-CEOs Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, is also one of the key investors in Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.

CNBC has reached out to EA for further comment and information on the deal.

DETROIT — Automakers and investors are about to find out what the "natural demand" is for new all-electric vehicles in the U.S., starting this week.

Amid what's set to be a record year for EV sales, including a record for units sold in the third quarter, demand for EVs is expected to decline. That's because federal incentives of up to $7,500 to purchase a plug-in vehicle are getting discontinued after Tuesday.

Many automakers have relied on the incentives to boost consumer demand for EVs, which they've spent billions of dollars developing even as the vehicles remain largely unprofitable.

Industry analysts and executives have said they believe EV sales can continue to grow in the future, but that there will soon be a boom-and-bust situation regarding demand for electric vehicles before there's a new normal.

"We're going to see some noise in October and November, and I expect that EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously," General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said during an investor event earlier this month. "We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural demand going and how do we meet that natural demand and ultimately try to lead customers to electric vehicles. That's going to take a little bit of time."

Jacobson's remarks echo those of other industry leaders such as Hyundai Motor CEO José Muñoz and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

"We are adjusting to the new situation and … we expect the mix of batteries to probably [not] grow as much as we already thought," Muñoz told reporters earlier this month. "I think, in the short term, it's going to go down, but in the mid-, long-term, we expect it to continue to grow."

Musk, when discussing the company's second-quarter results in July, said the EV maker could see "a few rough quarters" with the end of federal incentives and as Tesla's automation plans are in their infancy.

But that might not happen immediately. Ahead of the federal EV program ending, many automakers encouraged consumers to purchase or lease new vehicles. That has included U.S. EV leader Tesla having a countdown on its website to the end of the federal incentives, which the company has historically used to promote lower vehicle prices on its site.

The federal incentives for consumers to purchase electrified vehicles have been in place since 2008, in varying forms. They were first introduced under Republican President George W. Bush, and were expanded under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.

The incentives are coming to an end as part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which stripped the old enticement but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle, regardless of it being an EV.

"Policy really matters, and pulling away all these levers will slow the growth relative to what the path was before," Elaine Buckberg, a senior fellow at Harvard University and former GM chief economist, said Wednesday during the Move America conference in Detroit.

Once the bill was passed, sales of EVs quickly gained traction, especially as some automakers added even more discounts to move out older models.

Cox Automotive forecasts sales of EVs hit 410,000 during the third quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. That would easily be the highest amount of EVs ever sold in a quarter in the U.S., as well as a record 10% market share.

"The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment. This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further," said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive director of industry insights.

Cox expects many buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase an EV before the federal incentives sunset. That was the case for buyer Paarth Sharma of New Jersey.

"I've been in the market for two to six weeks," Sharma, who leased a Kia Niro EV, told CNBC. "It just accelerated because of the upcoming Sept. 30 order by Donald Trump and the EV rebates going away."

The sales increase corresponded with a notable uptick in automaker incentives for EVs, as more buyers who qualified for offers rushed out to buy vehicles. Cox Automotive reports average incentive spend for EVs was more than $9,000 – more than double the industry average.

"The quarter delivered record EV sales and market share, but the pace will ease in Q4 and beyond as the impact of the IRA tax incentive begins to fade," Valdez Streaty said.

While automakers have said they will continue to offer EVs, many companies are already taking steps to prepare for the expected impacts to sales, including laying off workers, cutting production of EVs or eliminating vehicles entirely.

Honda Motor on Wednesday, citing market conditions, confirmed plans to end U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric crossover that was being produced by GM in Tennessee.

Separate from the Acura EV, GM has made several changes to its production plans for EVs that have included implementing downtime at plants, cutting upcoming production shifts and slowing its rollout of several models.

Others such as Volkswagen, Porsche and Rivian Automotive have announced changes to their EV plans or reductions in workforces related to EVs.

"EVs are not going away … but it's not going to be a linear increase that we've seen over the last couple years, like we're in for a short-term dip," said Steve Horaney, senior vice president of the Mema Original Equipment Suppliers, said Wednesday during the Move America event.

But some plans are already too far along to go back on. New models are coming soon, such as a redesigned Nissan Leaf – arguably the first mainstream EV that was offered in the U.S. back when it was launched in 2010.

Nissan officials at an event touting the new model said the end of the credits timing with the fall release of the new Leaf is "tough," but even without the tax credit, the price of the vehicle — starting at around $30,000 — should attract buyers.

Those kinds of lower-priced vehicles are expected to be even more important for EV customers and companies after the elimination of the tax credits, according to Valdez Streaty.

"The arrival of truly affordable models is so critical," she said, citing upcoming EVs from the likes of GM and Ford Motor. "[They] could reshape the market."

Everyone is into watches these days, but which brand or style you gravitate toward could depend on your generation.

A new report from The RealReal, a luxury consignment shop, found the number of new watch buyers on its platform rose by 46% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same time period last year.

The pre-owned luxury watch market got a boost earlier this year in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, as some watchmakers announced they were increasing retail prices partly due to import costs.

The United States in August placed a 39% tariff on some goods from Switzerland, where many luxury watchmakers are based. Some resellers said they saw an increase in demand for secondhand watches in the wake of the tariffs and higher retail prices.

The RealReal found that interest in secondhand luxury watches was not limited to any generation, but that each generation was searching for different brands and styles. Here's how it broke down.

The report found that boomers, ages 61 to 79, were most interested in long-standing watch brands. They purchased the Rolex Datejust, which is The RealReal's most popular watch for both men and women, more than any other generation.

The Datejust is often considered an entry point into luxury watches. A reseller told Business Insider last month it was one of the top styles shoppers were purchasing pre-owned as they sought to avoid price hikes.

The report found the Rolex Datejust was also one of the smarter investment pieces, noting the resale price of the classic watch on The RealReal had increased 17% since 2021.

Sales for legacy brands like Audemars Piguet, Chopard, and Chanel also doubled among baby boomers this year, The RealReal found.

Gen X shoppers buy more watches than any other generation, according to the report.

The most bought watches for Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, were Rolex Daytonas and Bvlgari Tubogas, for men and women, respectively.

The Rolex Daytona is an iconic watch for the brand, always in demand and often cited as a good investment piece.

Millennials are especially interested in gold watches, with searches for the term up 30% compared to last year, the report found.

The most bought watches among millennials, ages 29 to 44, were Rolex Day-Dates for men and Patek Philippe Nautiluses for women.

The Rolex Day-Date was one of the styles the brand raised prices on at the top of the year, before the new tariffs were announced. The price hike was potentially driven in part by the surging price of gold.

The Patek Philippe Nautilus is another style that some consider a good investment, as it often sells for above its retail price

The report found that Gen Z was the most likely generation to seek out less typical brands. The generation, ages 13 to 28, searched for the Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer 105% more this year compared to last year, the sharpest search increase for any brand or age group.

Omega sales have doubled among Gen Z, while Audemars Piguet and Gucci sales increased by 117% and 35%, respectively.

Gen Z's interest in luxury watches has been credited with boosting the secondhand market, as the generation in general has been found to buy more pre-owned items than its older counterparts.

In this article

President Donald Trump is looking to restrict and overhaul the H-1 B visa program, which has allowed U.S. companies to hire foreign talent in occupations such as IT, healthcare and engineering for decades.

The program has been a topic of debate among lawmakers in Washington for years, with many opponents arguing that it removes job opportunities for U.S. nationals and is rife with abuse.

In response, Trump announced a plan to impose $100,000 fees on H-1B applications, which could severely impact American companies' ability to support the visas.

One thing that can't be disputed, however, is that the program has been part of the journey of a considerable number of American technology and business leaders since its inception in 1990.

Here is a list of some of the highest-profile ones. 

Elon Musk, the world's richest man and the founder of a raft of prominent tech companies in the U.S., is not only one of the most prominent H-1B visa recipients but also one of the most vocal advocates of the program.

Originally born in South Africa, Musk moved to the U.S. in 1992 when he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania to pursue his studies. He later attended Stanford before dropping out to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in Silicon Valley. 

While some details of his early visa situation have been debated, Musk has gone on record saying the reason he is in the U.S., along with "so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong," was the H-1B visa. 

Still, the billionaire, who has become highly involved in U.S. and global politics, has also supported the overhaul and reformation of the H-1B system in the past. 

Eric Yuan,  the 55-year-old founder and CEO of Zoom, immigrated to the U.S. from China in 1997 on an H-1B visa, though his journey was anything but easy.

Yuan was sponsored for an H-1B visa by video conferencing company Webex — later acquired by Cisco Systems — but was only approved on his ninth try, he said on a Cloud Giant podcast in 2020.

Despite speaking very little English upon his arrival in the U.S., he would go on to launch Zoom in 2011. The company's IPO in 2019 valued Yuan's shares in the billions.

While Yuan has not publicly commented much about the H-1B visa program, he told CNBC in 2019 that the United States' openness to immigration is healthy and that he expects that culture to persist.

Born and raised in India, Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, is also a former recipient of an H-1B visa, though his circumstances were quite unique. 

Having been in the U.S. since 1990, he held a highly coveted green card until he gave it up to bring his wife into the country through a successful, but otherwise risky, H-1B visa application in 1994. 

"The idea that you have to give up your green card to get an H-1B is, in retrospect, silly. And so therefore let us in fact take the reform so that it works for us, both our security but as well as our competitiveness," said Nadella in a 2017 interview with CNBC. 

Back in 2017, speaking on the 'Make Me Smart' podcast, Nadella defended the H-1B visa program, saying that it provided Microsoft with high-skilled labor that helped it remain globally competitive, though he welcomed an executive order reviewing H-1B for abuses under the first Trump administration.

Jayshree Ullal, CEO of cloud networking company Arista Networks, was born in the United Kingdom and raised in New Delhi, before she moved to the U.S. at the age of 16 and began her studies at San Francisco State University.

After completing a master's degree at Santa Clara University, she went on to work for prominent tech companies, including Fairchild Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Cisco.

Somewhere in that time, Ullal had been a recipient of an H-1B visa, a representative of the CEO had previously disclosed to Forbes. Arista did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

While details of Ullal's H-1B journey are unknown, she has voiced support for immigration reform and easier pathways for foreign workers to the U.S. in the past.

Speaking to Times of India in 2023, she said the immigration process had become overly challenging with permanent residence visas taking up to 15 years to secure, which is "a large chunk of a professional person's work life."

"At Arista, we believe that the best developers can come from anywhere and there is a global distribution of engineering talent — virtual or physical," she added.

Ullal is one of the handful of immigrant billionaires in the U.S. today with a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes.

Jeff Skoll, the first President of eBay — now a philanthropist and chairman of Capricorn Investment Group — is another former H-1B visa holder who has advocated for the program, while supporting targeted reforms.

As a Canadian, he graduated from the University of Toronto in 1987 before he came to America to study at Stanford University. He would later obtain an H-1B visa in 1996 when he began working for eBay and its founder, Pierre Omidyar. 

In December of last year, Skoll joined Elon Musk in defending the need for H-1B visas, although they supported some changes, such as a higher minimum salary and yearly fees that could incentivize domestic hires.

"For me personally it was a life [and] death fight to get and keep an H-1B visa, even though I had come out of Stanford Business School, worked with Pierre Omidyar on [a student work visa] while we built eBay from scratch," he said in an X post.

According to Skoll, he nearly needed to leave the country after being turned down for an H-1B visa extension, had it not been for his strong connections at the time.

He added that eBay and his other organizations have encountered numerous problems applying for H-1Bs, even when hiring for specialized work in which there were no domestic applicants.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Varun Goyal, a 25-year-old AI startup engineer, based in California. It's been edited for length and clarity.

In 2022, I was standing at the crossroads between quant trading and tech. It was my final year of undergrad. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm as a quantitative strategist for the summer.

I was learning so much and working with incredible people, but I was increasingly convinced that I should go back to school. I decided to move from India to the States for my master's.

When I was about to graduate with my master's last year, the path in quant was clearer. I could accelerate my career quickly, whereas in AI, it was much messier and unpredictable because we're still in the first stages of the AI revolution, and the industry is changing every day.

After interviewing in both fields, I chose an AI startup. The hours are long, the base pay is lower than I would've gotten in quant, and it's been an intense year, but I don't regret my decision, and here's why.

When I moved to the US to get my master's in computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I already knew that I wanted to pursue courses in quant, AI, and computer science.

Both AI and quant roles require core computer science algorithm skills.

During my master's, I had more time to pursue research and talk to senior industry folks. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like 10 years down the line.

When I entered my master's, I leaned heavily toward quant because the initial compensation there is almost always higher, but these conversations helped me see beyond the starting paycheck. I heard about the day-to-day work itself, the culture, and the opportunities for growth in each field.

People I knew who were two or three years out of school were working at some of the best quant firms in New York and Chicago. I definitely didn't want to skip that option, but a few things stood out to me as I spoke to some of them.

At bigger firms, teams often compete, and you can't really discuss your work outside your group. As an extrovert who thrives in a collaborative environment, that felt restrictive. The exit options in quant felt more constrained, too.

It's typical to grow into roles like senior quant researcher, strategy owner, or portfolio manager. Those are excellent paths, but they're tied to very specialized expertise. It's good to be specialized if you like that, but I feared it because I didn't know if I wanted to stay in the field forever.

I applied for both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup.

Quant reminded me of a single-lane speed track: fast, sharp, but narrow, while AI felt more like a racing track with a lot of turns and curves.

When I was in my master's, the AI boom was happening. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I started leaning toward working in AI because it's redesigning the capacity of human productivity from the ground up, which is so exciting.

In AI, especially at startups, the day-to-day challenges are broader, less predictable, and that mix of liberty and freshness appealed to me much more. I could imagine paths into founding, venture capital, and leadership roles in Big Tech, and I could start honing all of those skills early in my career.

AI ultimately left my options more open with what I could do later in life, and working at a startup provided the collaborative environment I wanted.

In AI startups, the base salary still provides a good standard of living, but the real upside comes from equity. The opportunity to learn is everywhere in an AI startup. Part of the appeal is the chance to learn how to make a company successful rather than optimizing within a well-established machine.

The biggest surprise at the startup this past year has been how much I'm learning outside coding. I'm learning to hire, adapt, lead the product direction, and sell. These skills make me more than just an engineer. I'm trying to jump on customer meetings, understand their needs, contribute to hiring decisions, and shadow and learn from the founders where I can.

The year has been pretty intense with the race that various AI startups are in.

If we don't launch the features and tools in a new research paper within a few days, we've basically lost that one to the competition, so it can be stressful, but it also keeps me sharp.

In AI, I'm in an uncomfortable seat every few months trying to keep up with the market pace, but I'm happy with my decision. I've been pushed to grow so much.

If I were in the decision stage again, one thing I'd consider is the difficulty of moving from quant to AI or vice versa later in you're career. Having spent one year in AI, I'd feel a little uncomfortable jumping into quant.

Quant narrows your skills down to a specialty very quickly, and if you want to expand outside that, it's hard. But I have some friends from undergrad who did a year or two in quant and then later moved over. It's possible.

I love working in AI. I believe we're like the builders of the machines in the Industrial Revolution, laying the foundations for how the world will actually use AI. There's a lot left to be built, and this is the opportunity the brightest graduating minds should take.

Earlier this month, an OpenAI engineer announced he was hiring for a new team.

OpenAI is building a new team called "Applied Evals," which helps businesses refine complex processes using AI, like refund requests or migrating code. The team will also focus on voice AI and multi-step reasoning tasks, said Shyamal Anadkat, who is leading that team at OpenAI. Pay ranges from $255,000 to $325,000 for the role plus equity, the new listing said.

Evals refer to measuring the capabilities of AI models, which Anadkat called "the most critical part of actually building AI products."

This new team reflects a shift across the AI talent landscape.. The tech industry has long hired technical minds to build and train AI models, and now people with specific subject-matter expertise are being tapped to make these models useful, AI founders and executives told Business Insider.

Anadkat's post said his team will comprise engineers with "real, deep, lived expertise." He said it will start with generalists. He plans to bring in specialists from different fields, such as software engineers for code-related tasks and, perhaps eventually, humanities-focused workers if there is more demand for tasks like writing.

Anadkat told Business Insider the team will work with companies using OpenAI's developer platform to help them create their own evals for specific use cases.

"OpenAI started as a research lab, and then we built a product," he said. "Now the shift that, at least I hope we'll see, is how research and product can work very closely together and collaborate on some of this to basically define what good looks like."

Anadkat's team is starting small and will grow with demand. It's exclusively focused on business customers, operating separately from the teams working on OpenAI's consumer-facing businesses, like apps or consulting.

Applied Evals will work with OpenAI's sales and business teams to determine what projects to prioritize based on customer need and where its models are underperforming, Anadkat said.

The AI industry has long had engineers work on evals within companies, large and small, though they mostly evaluated if the AI model was working well or not.

Over time, they've shifted from "thumbs up or down" to being more focused on context and asking the right questions, said Michael Jacobides, a strategy and entrepreneurship professor at London Business School.

"There's probably a hundred people in the world that could lead a team to build these frontier models," said Justin Farris, vice president of product at Read AI, "but there's so much work that needs to be done to take those and make them useful."

AI is increasingly moving from generic to specific use cases, said Tanmai Gopal, CEO of PromptQL.

"For a lot of applied use cases, the ways of working out what good is and what bad is start to become quite nuanced," he said.

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Monday said the U.S. central bank faces challenges as it attempts to balance fighting stubborn inflation or protecting jobs.

"On the inflation side right now, I continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective," Hammack told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"We have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than 4½ years and I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation both in the headline, in the core, and particularly, where I am worried about it, is I'm seeing it in the services," she added.

Asked whether it is mistake for the Federal Reserve to be cutting interest rates given the economic backdrop, Hammack described it as "a challenging time for monetary policy," saying the U.S. central bank was facing pressure on both sides of its mandate.

Her comments come shortly after stronger-than-expected economic data appear to have dented Wall Street's hopes for sharp monetary easing.

The Fed approved a widely anticipated rate cut earlier this month, lowering its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 4.00%-4.25%, and signaled two more were on the way before the end of the year.

A robust batch of economic data since, however, has prompted investors to dial back their expectations for rapid rate cuts.

Investor attention now turns to the September nonfarm payrolls report, scheduled for Friday, although its release could be disrupted by a possible government shutdown.

Hammack said the U.S. labor market looks "reasonably healthy" and broadly in balance, while inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's target, adding that she doesn't expect prices to fall back to 2% until the end of 2027 or early 2028.

"So, again, to me, when I balance those two sides of our mandate, I think we really need to maintain a restrictive stance of policy so that we can get inflation back down to our goal," Hammack said.

A former Goldman Sachs executive, Hammack is not a voter on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.

U.S. core inflation was little changed in August, according to data published Friday. The personal consumption expenditures price index posted a 0.3% gain for the month, putting the annual headline inflation rate at 2.7%, the Commerce Department reported late last week.

Excluding food and energy, the more closely followed core PCE price level was 2.9% on an annual basis after rising 0.2% for the month.

Hammack has previously suggested she would be hesitant about lowering interest rates as long as inflation remains a threat.

Indeed, more recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned of a tricky path ahead on interest rates.

"Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside — a challenging situation," Powell said on Sept. 23 during a speech to business leaders in Providence, Rhode Island.

"Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path," he added.

Jensen Huang said President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee could put the American dream further out of reach for immigrants, marking a more critical take on the visa change after he initially offered positive feedback on it last week.

The Nvidia CEO said on an episode of the "BG2 Pod" published Friday that the Trump administration's move to change America's H-1B visa program is "a great start," but added that the $100,000 fee "probably sets the bar a little too high."

The policy "at least eliminates illegal immigration" and abuse of the visa system, but the steep cost might mean more investment outside the US, Huang said.

He agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the fee also tilts the playing field toward Big Tech firms that can more easily afford to sponsor visas, leaving startups at a disadvantage.

Huang said the US must remain mindful of how such policies affect global talent flows, saying they could make "foreign students uncomfortable."

He pointed to Chinese researchers as one example, separating the ideas of the US competing with China as a country from American policies that affect Chinese people.

"We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed," he added.

Talent inflow is an early indicator of the country's future success. "Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs," Huang said, referring to key performance indicators.

The Taiwan-born CEO has often described his own journey as a product of the American dream. America's immigration system is in a "difficult situation," and Trump has limited time to improve it, Huang said. Any move that addresses the country's ability to attract and keep top talent is a step in the right direction, the CEO said.

The H-1B visa change is a good start — but it shouldn't be the end, he added.

Nvidia is one of the largest tech employers of H-1B visa holders in the United States. At the end of fiscal year 2025, the company had 1,519 H-1B filings and 36,000 employees worldwide, a Business Insider analysis found in March.

An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

Business leaders have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. The White House told Business Insider earlier this month that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

Trump has said the visa changes are meant to encourage employers to hire US workers instead of international ones.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering

Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last week that he was "glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making."

"We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream," Huang said during an interview with CNBC. "Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future."

Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of the fee was the right move.

"We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during the joint interview.

Starbucks presented its laid-off baristas with a severance package less than a week after it announced sweeping layoffs and store closures.

On Thursday, the Seattle-based coffee giant said it would close about 1% of its stores across North America, which amounts to more than 100 locations. Its flagship Capitol Hill Roastery in Seattle was one of the outlets that will shutter.

In addition to the retail staff cuts caused by the store closures, the company announced that 900 non-retail employees would be laid off.

Starbucks sent documents of its severance package to laid-off retail employees on Sunday, which Business Insider has viewed.

According to a Starbucks document titled "Severance Summary," laid-off baristas and shift supervisors would be entitled to 60 and 84 hours of pay, respectively.

Starbucks baristas earn about $15 to $22 an hour, depending on the store's location in the US, per job listings on Starbucks' careers website. Shift managers earn roughly between $20 and $29 hourly.

Café attendants — entry-level service staff in charge of keeping the cafés clean and organized — would be entitled to 30 hours of pay after being laid off, per the document.

States do not typically require companies to provide hourly workers with severance.

Laid-off retail staff can also claim a lump sum payment equal to three months' worth of their health insurance premiums. Affected staff have healthcare coverage for three months from the end of October, which is in line with the Department of Labor's COBRA Act.

The document said employees would get 45 days to decide whether to sign a release agreement in exchange for their severance pay.

In a separate document titled "Partner Separation FAQ — U.S. Retail Stores," seen by Business Insider, Starbucks said that employees in nine states would be paid for their accrued vacation hours. Employees with granted but unused vacation hours will not be paid out for unused time.

In response to a request for comment, Starbucks directed Business Insider to CEO Brian Niccol's open letter from Thursday.

"We're working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them," Niccol wrote in the letter. "For those we can't immediately place, we're focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages."

In an SEC filing dated September 23, Starbucks said it expected to incur a $1 billion bill from its store closures. It said about $150 million of that cost would be linked to employee separation benefits.

The store closures are part of Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" turnaround plan, which aims to revitalize the chain after several quarters of declining sales.

The company said in the SEC filing that it had assessed its stores' financial performance and customer experience and decided to close stores that had not fulfilled the criteria.

Starbucks' stock price is down more than 14% in the past year.

When Starbucks announced on Thursday that it would shutter more than 100 coffeehouse locations across North America, the company didn't publicly specify which stores would close.

So, Business Insider has begun creating a list compiled from accounts from affected in-store staff members, reporter visits, and verification through the Starbucks "store locator" feature. While incomplete, it begins to show which neighborhoods and states are most affected by the closures.

When reached for comment by Business Insider, Starbucks pointed to a message it's sending its customers about the store closures: "We know this isn't just any store to customers. It's their coffeehouse, a place woven into their daily rhythm, where memories were made, and where meaningful connections with our partners grew over the years. We're deeply grateful for the communities that have been built."

I've always been an entrepreneur. I dropped out of university before my final year to launch a web marketing business in Japan. I sold the company, started learning about the real estate business, and launched a share house company. After leaving that company, I moved to Kenya in 2018, where I had traveled in college, to launch a startup.

My first year in Kenya was a nightmare. I had built and sold several businesses at that point, but still struggled to raise money from external investors for a new startup. After a while, I decided to put in my own money and launch a startup called Hakki. I built a microfinancing platform for people who wanted to buy cars because Kenya seemed to have a lack of credit options.

After working on Hakki for six years, where we financed over 3,500 cars, growth in Kenya seemed limited. Africa has about 1.4 billion people, but they are scattered. Kenya only has about 50 million people. India, with its 1.3 billion people and rapidly growing economy, felt like the next best target market for us.

I moved to Bengaluru in 2024 to expand the company in India. We now have four employees based in India, 74 in Kenya, and two in South Africa, where we also have a presence. Our headquarters is in Japan, where most of our fundraising has happened, and we aim to go public in the Japanese market in 2028.

There are a lot of things I like about living in Bengaluru. For one, I like to wear casual T-shirts instead of suits, and Bengaluru's weather is stable and comfortable.

The people are kind, have lots of energy, and are positive about the future, which I really like. That's not the case in Japan, where, because of the aging population, people are worried about the economy and the future of the country.

I have a group I play football with every evening after work. I've also made some friends I watch cricket matches with, accompanied by alcohol and chicken, which was surprising to me because I always thought most Indians are vegetarian.

There are challenges too. I don't like the spicy food and haven't gotten used to it, so I spend most of my time eating noodles I bring over from Japan.

The way business is done in India is very different from Japan, too. Indians have the attitude to try or take up something challenging without needing accurate projections of what will happen. Japanese businesses spend a lot of time in meetings and making sure everything is done with the consensus of the majority of the people. Investment decisions move much faster in India than in Japan.

India also feels like a much friendlier market for startups because people are open to trying new products and don't get suspicious of new companies that may be offering a cheaper solution than existing brands.

The people are hardworking. We've hired four Indian employees, and I'm surprised to say that they work more than me. They come into the office at 9 a.m. and easily work until 9 p.m. Even our company driver is up early in the morning and available with the car until midnight, which I was not expecting.

I may have to move out of India in a few months to expand the company in other countries like Thailand. But I'm commited to growing the startup here and having a big presence in India. I plan to travel back and forth and can see myself moving back to India again.

Crypto.com announced its strategic partnership with Sharps Technology, Inc. (STSS) to manage the latter's Solana-based digital asset treasury. With more than 2 million SOL tokens in its holdings, valued at over $400 million, STSS aims to use Crypto.com's platform for managing these assets. This collaboration will also drive greater institutional participation in the Solana ecosystem, aligning both companies with Solana's future growth.

STSS has been expanding its digital asset treasury strategy, with a clear focus on the Solana network. As part of the agreement, Crypto.com will offer its institutional-grade custody infrastructure, along with access to its OTC desk. The partnership aims to maximize returns on STSS's Solana holdings while maintaining secure management. Crypto.com's platform will allow STSS to deploy a portion of its assets into Solana-native projects, contributing to the broader growth of the Solana ecosystem.

The strategic collaboration marks a pivotal moment for Solana as both companies focus on fostering institutional involvement. Through Crypto.com's secure custody solutions and OTC services, STSS will deploy its Solana holdings more efficiently and transparently. This approach aligns with institutional needs for compliance, security, and liquidity access.

Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, commented on the partnership, saying, “STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision.” 

He further emphasized that Crypto.com's infrastructure is uniquely suited for institutions looking to safely manage digital asset treasuries. The partnership underlines the growing importance of bridging traditional finance with the Solana blockchain.

The collaboration between STSS and Crypto.com will go beyond simple asset management. STSS plans to actively engage with Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, allocating capital into staking, liquidity provision, and validator support. These efforts are designed to strengthen the Solana network's infrastructure, increasing liquidity and supporting long-term growth. 

By generating yield through these strategies, STSS will also play a role in the sustainability of Solana's ecosystem.

James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS, explained, “Partnering with Crypto.com provides us with institutional-grade tools and liquidity access to responsibly manage one of the largest Solana treasuries, while also contributing to the growth of the Solana ecosystem.” This move shows how institutional players are increasingly looking to capitalize on the blockchain's potential, integrating these assets into real-world financial strategies.

Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's Hypurr non-fungible token (NFT) collection is changing hands at around $55,000 on Monday, Sept. 29, just one day after its deployment on HyperEVM, the ecosystem's Layer 1 (L1) blockchain.

The 4,600 NFT collection currently has a floor price of 1,250 HYPE ($55,000), with the top offer at 1,161 HYPE ($52,000). Meanwhile, its total 24-hour volume has reached 1.5 million HYPE, or roughly $70 million. HYPE is currently trading at $46.94, up 6.3% on the day, according to CoinGecko. 

About 11% of the collection is listed, with 3,955 unique owners representing roughly 86% of the total supply, according to OpenSea data. Of the 4,600 NFTs in the collection, 4,313 were allocated to Genesis Event participants, 144 to the Hyper Foundation, and 143 to core contributors, including Hyperliquid Labs and NFT artists.

However, shortly after the airdrop, a threat actor reportedly stole eight Hypurr NFTs from compromised wallets, profiting approximately $400,000, according to blockchain analyst ZachXBT, who shared the news on Telegram. Despite this, enthusiasm around the NFT collection remains strong. 

Even before their official launch, Hypurr NFTs drew strong interest, trading on OTC markets for $30,000 to $60,000 throughout much of 2025. By Sept. 19, demand had pushed the floor price to $100,000 on DripTrade, a Hyperliquid-based NFT platform, The Defiant reported at the time. 

The Hypurr NFT launch underscores Hyperliquid's efforts to reward its early supporters, strengthen community engagement, and expand its ecosystem through new features. 

“The goal of the Hypurr NFT collection was to share a memento with those who believed in and contributed early on to Hyperliquid's growth,” the Hyper Foundation posted on X. “Each NFT is unique and captures the different moods, hobbies, tastes, and quirks of the Hyperliquid community, as depicted by Hypurr.”

Hyperliquid currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $5.86 billion, per DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid L1 boasts a TVL of $2.2 billion. 

The Hypurr NFT launch coincides with Hyperliquid's ongoing ecosystem expansion. Most recently, the project rolled out its native stablecoin USDH through Native Markets, following its successful bid to develop the asset.

Currently, USDH, which is Hyperliquid's first dollar-pegged asset, has a market capitalization of $1.44 million. 

Hyperliquid also made headlines earlier this summer for, at one point, handling more Bitcoin (BTC) spot volume over a single weekend than both Coinbase and Bybit, highlighting its growing influence, The Defiant previously reported.

Hyperliquid launched HyperEVM in February. At the time, the Hyper Foundation called it “a major step toward the vision of housing all finance by bringing general-purpose programmability to Hyperliquid's performant financial system.”

Zhimin Qian pleads guilty after wallets with 61,000 bitcoins, currently worth over £5bn, seized from north London home

A woman has been convicted for her role in a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud after what is thought to have been the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure.

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, 45, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket.

She stored the proceeds in bitcoin, but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.

The Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world.

Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring cryptocurrency that was criminal property and possessing it between October 2017 and April 2024.

She had fled China using a bogus St Kitts and Nevis passport in 2017 and entered the UK, where a year later she attempted to launder the money by buying property with the help of Jian Wen, 43, a Chinese takeaway worker. Wen was jailed for six years and eight months for her part in the scam in May 2024.

Qian appeared in court aided by a Mandarin interpreter. She will be sentenced at a later date.

Wen had arrived in the UK in 2007 and lived modestly in Leeds between 2011 and 2017 before working at a Chinese takeaway in south-east London. She moved in with Qian at a six-bedroom house in Hampstead Heath, north London, in September 2017.

While laundering the proceeds of the fraud, Wen drove around in a Mercedes and flew her son over from China 18 months later to attend a private school.

Qian fled after police raided the Hamsptead property, known as the Manor House, and seized a safety deposit box containing digital wallets that held vast sums in bitcoin.

Wen insisted she had no idea that the bitcoin came from the proceeds of fraud and claimed Qian had duped her. She said she helped Qian run a jewellery business which had branches in Singapore, Malaysia and China.

In January this year a judge ordered Wen to pay back more than £3m within three months or serve another seven years in jail. The recoverable amount derived from the bitcoin and two properties in Dubai.

The head of the Met's economic and cybercrime command, Will Lyne, said: “This is one of the largest money-laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally. I am extremely proud of the team.

“Through a meticulous investigation and unprecedented cooperation with Chinese law enforcement, we were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK … My thoughts are with the thousands of victims defrauded in this scheme.”

DS Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation, said: “Today marks the result of years of painstaking work. When our team located Zhimin Qian, she had been evading justice for five years, and her arrest triggered a complex investigation requiring evidence from multiple jurisdictions and the careful review of thousands of documents.

“I am immensely proud of the investigation team and our partners who have worked tirelessly on this case.”

For more than a century, the United States and the United Kingdom have been amongst the most influential nations in finance, working together to create the playbook for global trade and markets. Today, that partnership is entering a new phase as both countries commit to closer cooperation on digital assets—a gambit that could further entrench Washington and London at the vanguard of global finance, even as hubs like Singapore and Dubai emerge as formidable challengers.

This latest U.S.-UK tie-up comes via the recent creation of the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future, which calls for joint recommendations on digital assets and capital markets within six months. The new body signals that the countries recognize that alignment—not isolation—is critical at a time when the likes of Singapore, Dubai and others are already seeing the financial and economic benefits of an inclusive approach to crypto regulation. 





The new taskforce brings together both banks and crypto firms, underscoring how central digital assets have become to the future of markets. Stablecoins, blockchain infrastructure, and programmable digital securities are no longer fringe concepts. They are fast becoming the backbone of 21st-century financial innovation.





The US and UK are at pivotal moments. In the US, Congress is advancing legislation to establish a stablecoin and digital asset framework. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England are designing rules under FSMA 2023, laying the groundwork for robust regimes around stablecoins and distributed ledgers.





Legislators and regulators in both countries are in rare bipartisan agreement on the benefits of crypto and blockchain. The fact that President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are engaging on the issue underscores their belief in how critical this technology will be. Likewise, England's main financial regulators—the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England—as well as Chancellor Reeves are actively creating regulatory frameworks and working groups. They have even taken the step of allowing at least six major banks to launch pilot programs for tokenized crypto deposits, while increasing collaboration with highly regulated markets like Singapore to assess the impact crypto can have on global trade.




 By aligning now, both countries can set a global precedent – encouraging others to work across borders to build a more efficient, accessible, and stable financial system. This is not just about economics. It is about ensuring the next generation of payments and infrastructure are efficient, secure, and widely available.





Recent discussions about joint digital sandboxes and shared oversight show how practical cooperation can take shape. Just as the UK's Faster Payments System redefined real-time settlement, and Wall Street pioneered financial instruments that reshaped markets, a joint effort on stablecoins and digital currencies could anchor the next era of global innovation.





I write this as someone who has spent the past decade building OKX into one of the world's largest regulated crypto exchanges, with licensed operations across the US, EU, Middle East, and Asia. From this vantage point, I see how quickly digital assets are moving from the periphery of finance into the mainstream.





History shows that financial leadership is sustained by openness to innovation. Properly regulated stablecoins and robust blockchain infrastructure are not threats to systemic stability; they are the new building blocks of trust in the digital economy. Both the US and UK already recognize this.





The opportunity is huge when it comes to stablecoins. Properly regulated, they create a bridge between traditional money and blockchain-based systems, offering trust at the core while unlocking efficiency at the edges.




In the US, proposed legislation mandates 1:1 fiat reserves. In the UK, regulators are moving toward high-quality backing requirements, though final rules remain under consultation. Stablecoins could become a reliable medium of exchange once these regimes are live. More importantly, by operating on blockchains, they can dramatically lower the cost of remittances, payroll, and B2B trade – giving companies of all sizes greater liquidity and competitiveness.





Digital ledger technology is the foundation of this transformation. Its transparency and interoperability can reduce risk in clearing and settlement, improve auditability, and give regulators better tools for oversight. Together, stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure could reinvigorate financial systems in both countries, ensuring they remain leaders in the future of global finance.





Chancellor Reeves and Treasury Secretary Bessent have laid out an aggressive 180-day sprint to identify the first areas of crypto collaboration. I, for one, look forward to the findings. If London and Washington succeed, the entire world stands to benefit.

The Chinese national, 47, was the alleged mastermind of a £5bn fraud before coming to the UK.

A woman has pleaded guilty to money laundering offences over the UK's biggest-ever cryptocurrency seizure of Bitcoin, currently worth more than £5bn.

Chinese national Yadi Zhang, 47, who is also known as Zhimin Qian, was arrested in April last year after spending years on the run.

She first arrived in the UK on a false St Kitts and Nevis passport in September 2017 after allegedly carrying out a £5bn investment scam in China involving 130,000 investors in fraudulent wealth schemes between 2014 and 2017.

Police first raided her £5m six-bedroom rented house near Hampstead Heath, in north London, on 31 October 2018.

But it was another two and a half years before investigators discovered more than 61,000 Bitcoin in digital wallets - one of the biggest ever cryptocurrency seizures in the world.

The cryptocurrency was worth £1.4bn at the time but its value has now risen to more than £5bn and the fortune is at the centre of an intense battle between the UK government and Chinese investors over who gets to keep it.

The seized assets have reportedly been earmarked by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to help plug the hole in the public finances.

Zhang was due to face trial at Southwark Crown Court but has pleaded guilty to charges of possessing criminal property and transferring criminal property on or before 23 April 2024.

She appeared in the dock wearing glasses and a beige cardigan over an animal print blouse, nodding to confirm her identity before entering her pleas with the help of a Mandarin interpreter.

Judge Sally-Ann Hales remanded Zhang in custody ahead of sentencing at a later date.

Prosecutor Gillian Jones KC said she would not apply to launch confiscation proceedings because of the ongoing proceedings in the High Court.

Jian Wen, 43, was last year jailed for six years and eight months after being found guilty of one count of money laundering between October 2017 and January 2022 relating to 150 Bitcoin, now worth around £12.5m.

Her trial heard Wen was not involved in the alleged fraud but was said to have acted as a "front person" to help disguise the source of the money, some of which had been used to buy cryptocurrency and smuggled out of China on laptops.

Will Lyne, the Metropolitan Police's head of economic and cybercrime command, said Zhang's guilty pleas marked the culmination of "years of dedicated investigation".

"This is one of the largest money laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally," he said.

Zhang's solicitor, Roger Sahota of Berkeley Square Solicitors, said: "By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses."

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BMNR) is trading around $53 on Monday, up over 5% intraday, as the company disclosed its Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) holdings have surpassed 2.65 million, cementing its position as the world's largest ETH treasury.

The company reported total crypto and cash holdings of $11.6 billion, including 2,650,900 ETHvalued at $4,141 per token, 192 Bitcoin, $436 million in cash, and $157 million in "moonshot" equity investments such as Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS).

This puts BitMine ahead of peers in Ethereum accumulation, controlling more than 2% of supply.

It ranks as the No. 1 ETH treasury globally and the No. 2 overall crypto treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns roughly 640,000 BTC.

Fundstrat data shows BMNR trades an average of $2.6 billion daily, ranking it the 26th most traded stock in the U.S., ahead of Visa Inc. (NYSE: V).

Support comes from prominent backers including ARK's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, and Galaxy Digital.

Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, BitMine's chairman, said Ethereum remains the firm's primary treasury asset given its reliability and role as infrastructure for both AI and financial markets.

Lee reiterated the company's long-term goal of acquiring 5% of ETH supply.

BMNR Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

Technical analysis: BMNR stock is compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, holding above its 20-day EMA at $51.85, with the 50-day EMA at $47.06 reinforcing support.

A push above $56 could accelerate momentum toward $65–70, while a slip below $52 risks exposing $47 and potentially $38.

The RSI near 55 suggests neutral momentum, leaving scope for either a breakout or a breakdown as the price nears the apex.

BitMine's accumulation of more than 2% of Ethereum supply shifts the narrative from trading flows to structural ownership.

By anchoring ETH on a public company balance sheet, the firm is effectively institutionalizing a portion of the asset that would otherwise circulate in open markets.

This alters liquidity dynamics, raises the floor for scarcity, and creates a new vector for equity investors to gain indirect Ethereum exposure.

For investors, BMNR is no longer just a mining or tech stock, it is evolving into a proxy vehicle for Ethereum's monetary base.

Hyperliquid releases 4,600 Hypurr NFTs with a floor price that soars over 60,000. Those who backed at the beginning enjoy huge gains in a historic decline.

Hyperliquid has deployed 4,600 Hypurr NFTs on the mainnet HyperEVM. These NFTs pay tribute to early patrons of its November 2024 Genesis Event. The platform listed participants, core contributors, and Hyper Foundation as owners without requiring minting.

The collection should be seen as an embodiment of the varieties of personalities and styles of the Hyperliquid community in the form of differentiated feline characters. 

The digital cats have moods, hobbies, and oddities that resemble the attachment of their owners to the project. The Hypurr NFTs exploded in the market soon after their launch.The price per unit took off on the floor to 1,463 HYPE tokens or more than $68,900. 

The volume of trading reached almost 45 million dollars in the course of 24 hours. Hypurr, the most unique NFT, sold 9,999 tokens of HYPE, which is equivalent to 467,000 dollars, one of the highest prices formed in the recent NFT sales history.

This airdrop rewarded those who were early adopters, not requiring payment, which made Hypurr unique in comparison to most NFT launches, where you have to buy it directly. 

There was no step to be taken by the recipients; the NFTs were automatically given out after vetting to guarantee fairness and stop abuse.

The Hypurr drop stresses the importance of community trust and rewards. The Hyper Foundation created the NFT drop as a token to recognize the early supporters of Hyperliquid. 

The tie-in to the native HYPE token and HyperEVM ecosystem created a buzz of speculation and collector demand around the NFTs.

Although certain doubts exist regarding the practical use of NFTs, the rarity of the collection and rapid increase in price have created a momentum of trading.

Over-the-counter sales before its launch were reportedly selling at high prices up to 88,000, which showed that there was a lot of demand even before trading started publicly.

Insecurity issues arose when hackers stole eight Hypurr NFTs from compromised wallets and sold them for $400,000.

This has not dulled the excitement surrounding the success of the collection and the fact that it was a trailblazer in the airdrop of the NFT industry.

The model of Hyperliquid in the Hypurr NFTs is an insight into how blockchain projects can enrich early adopters through meaningful rewards and create natural buzz without standard gatekeeping strategies such as fundraising and minting.

The Algorand Foundation has tapped Nikolaos Bougalis, a veteran cryptographer and former Ripple engineering lead, as its new chief technology officer, the company said in a press release Monday.

Bougalis, who spent nearly a decade guiding development of the open-source XRP Ledger, will lead Algorand's engineering efforts and help advance its 2025 technical roadmap.

Algorand's ALGO (ALGO) token was trading 2.6% higher over 24 hours alongside a generaly rally in crypto prices.

Algorand's roadmap, unveiled in July, focuses on decentralization, Web3 adoption, enterprise use cases, and cutting-edge cryptography. Bougalis is expected to play a key role in aligning the foundation and Algorand Technologies around those goals.

“Nik brings a wealth of experience in distributed systems, cryptography, and blockchain, as well as a demonstrated ability to foster collaborative development communities,” Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden said in the release. “He will help us double down on decentralization, performance, and security.”

Bougalis will be based in the U.S. as the foundation seeks to expand its footprint among domestic enterprises and institutions looking for compliant, scalable blockchain infrastructure. 

His background in security and cryptography is expected to strengthen Algorand's work on privacy, quantum resistance and scalability.

Algorand, launched in 2019, aims to offer instant finality and low fees for builders creating projects in payments, identity, supply chain, and asset tokenization. The ecosystem now includes millions of users and a global network of developers using familiar programming languages like Python and TypeScript.

ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. — The Orlando-based team NFT Boombox claimed the top prize at the first Red Bull Tandem Rollercoaster event held in the U.S.

NFT Boombox won first place for both “most creative tandem Bicycle Entry' and ‘Most Creative Build,' securing the top overall prize in the competition.

The team attributes their success to the extensive time spent practicing.

“It's pretty high up there,” said co-winner Jensin Holmgren. “This and graduating college are right next to each other. I have to say, this is the ultimate, ‘dad lore.' Ten years from now, when I have kids, I'll be telling them this story all the time.” 

“I think the countless hours we spent practicing on that bike really paid off,” co-winner Joey Iorio said. “I gave him full control to do whatever he wanted. That's why I told him – I only need one hand to hold a GoPro and one hand to hold on to him. That's all I need.” 

Thirty teams competed on themed tandem bicycles that ran on a rollercoaster-themed track above Cranes Roost Lake on Saturday. More than 40,000 spectators were there.

Crypto credit firm Maple Finance and Elwood Technologies are joining forces to make it easier for large financial institutions to enter digital asset credit markets. The companies announced Monday that Maple's on-chain lending and asset management platform will link up with Elwood's execution, portfolio management, and risk tools.

Maple, founded in 2021, specializes in structured lending products and yield strategies built on public blockchains. Elwood, the trading company backed by hedge-fund manager Alan Howard, provides connectivity to global crypto exchanges, custodians and fund administrators, along with analytics and risk monitoring tools for institutional investors.

The collaboration targets a key friction point for traditional players. Banks and asset managers looking to diversify into digital assets face fragmented infrastructure and operational hurdles. By combining Maple's lending expertise with Elwood's institutional trading and risk systems, the firms aim to create a framework that mirrors what professional investors expect in traditional markets.

Sid Powell, Maple's CEO, said the partnership will extend “institutional-grade” access to on-chain credit opportunities. Elwood CEO Chris Lawn added that credit markets are an essential piece of crypto's evolution and need the same type of infrastructure as other asset classes.

The move comes as demand for tokenized credit and fixed-income products grows. For example, Ripple and Credbull recently launched initiatives that bring U.S. Treasuries and private credit onto blockchain rails. Maple and Elwood's tie-up underscores how service providers are trying to position themselves as gateways for institutional capital entering the decentralized economy.

On September 26, 2025, RTX Corporation witnessed a 2.31% surge in stock value amid news of securing a $1.7 billion defense contract. This deal, acquired through RTX's Raytheon division, involves providing nine Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) radar systems to both the U.S. Army and Poland, marking Poland's first foray into employing this technology. This significant deal not only positions RTX favorably within the competitive global defense market but also illustrates the company's capability to garner considerable international contracts in the midst of intensifying geopolitical tensions and increases in defense budgets worldwide.

The LTAMDS radar system is engineered to counteract sophisticated threats, including hypersonic weapons, boasting cutting-edge technology capable of delivering a full 360-degree surveillance radius to track multiple threats at once. Such advanced technology cements RTX's standing in next-gen defense systems, piquing the interest of several nations eager to adopt the radar technology, opening avenues for future revenue growth.

With U.S. Department of Defense funding expected to hit $1.01 trillion for FY2026—steering focus towards modernization, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital transformation—fintech companies are becoming increasingly acknowledged as pivotal components in defense ecosystems. This burgeoning budget provides fertile ground for fintech to ease the burdens faced by defense industrial bases and supply chains, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Rising defense allocations stimulate demand for advanced financial solutions. Increased fintech innovations cut financial frictions for SMEs by broadening credit accessibility, reducing costs of capital, and amplifying transparency via improved risk assessment. This is particularly vital for SMEs embedded within defense supply chains that frequently encounter convoluted financing predicaments. Through these innovations, SMEs can better manage cash flow volatility as well as recover more quickly from setbacks—perfectly aligning with the defense sector's necessity for resilient suppliers.

The potential involvement of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in bolstering defense financial operations cannot be understated. The digital transformation in finance, which has been sped up by tools such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, is redefining the finance landscape, including procurement and supply chain financing. This evolution lays the groundwork for integrating crypto solutions into defense-related financial operations, facilitating faster, more transparent, and secure payment options.

Acknowledging the strategic significance of fintech in defense ecosystems bolsters the argument for innovating financial services that enhance national sovereignty. Fintech firms are anticipated to contribute to strengthening strategic autonomy through deploying crypto and blockchain solutions for secure transactions. Such integration could refine the efficacy of defense financial operations, rendering them less vulnerable to geopolitical risks.

The advent of fintech solutions in the defense arena presents SMEs with enhanced access to financial resources and cutting-edge payment systems. Innovations from fintech can mitigate financial frictions, allowing SMEs to tackle financing complexities with renewed vigor. With stablecoins becoming increasingly integrated into payroll systems, they provide employees in inflation-sensitive regions clarity regarding salary values.

Furthermore, fintech enables more seamless cross-border payments, simplifying processes for SMEs seeking to employ international contractors and manage offshore payroll services. The rise of USDC payroll solutions resonates well, attracting startups looking to entice global talent who prefer crypto compensation. This is critical in today's geopolitical climate where cryptocurrencies are often deemed as hedges against inflation and systemic risks.

Looking ahead, several trends are set to redefine crypto payroll and financial management. The ascendancy of stablecoins is anticipated to serve as a buffer against the volatility of cryptocurrencies, establishing a level of salary value stability for employees. There is an increasing inclination among startups to adopt hybrid models, amalgamating crypto with stablecoins for effective management of income fluctuations.

Additionally, the adoption of advanced technologies like AI and blockchain in payroll systems will elevate security and transparency, making crypto payroll solutions attractive to businesses. Interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto payment channels is expected to facilitate cross-border transactions, reducing expenses and optimizing performance.

By 2030, salaries could predominantly shift toward cryptocurrencies, with firms employing crypto treasury management strategies to enhance financial operations. The buzz around "Pay Me in Bitcoin" among tech workers indicates a significant shift in how compensation is regarded across the modern workforce.

In essence, the synthesis of escalating defense contracts, growing defense expenditures focused on technology, and fintech's validated capacity to facilitate SME financial access and resilience points to a transformative era. Crypto-enabled solutions may very well become synonymous with defense supply chains, fundamentally changing how companies engage with financial operations in an increasingly complex world.

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies stock rose Monday morning after the company announced that it purchased nearly $1 billion worth of Ethereum over the last week, pushing the valuation of its total ETH treasury to $11 billion.

The Ethereum treasury firm's stock rose more than 6% to a recent price of $53.60, following the announcement. Even with the uptick, BMNR remains down nearly 4% over the last week.

The Las Vegas-based company disclosed crypto and cash holdings nearing $11.6 billion, including 2.65 million ETH valued at $11 billion, 192 Bitcoin (about $21.6 million worth), and $436 million in unencumbered cash.

That Ethereum tally is 234,846 ETH larger than the previous week's reported total, or about $980 million worth. BitMine is the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury company, and continues to widen the gap between itself and runner-up SharpLink Gaming, which holds about $3.37 billion worth of ETH.

Overall, BitMine ranks as the second-largest global cryptocurrency treasury behind Strategy Inc., which holds approximately $72 billion in Bitcoin.

Myriad users are broadly confident that BitMine will hit a total of 3 million ETH by October 27, currently giving that an 81% chance. The odds have climbed 15% over the last day—even before the announcement—as predictors gain confidence. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

The 7 Largest Publicly Traded Ethereum Treasury Firms

BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, who also leads research firm Fundstrat, has positioned Ethereum as central to converging trends in AI and cryptocurrency.

In a statement, the firm compared recent regulatory developments—including the GENIUS Act passage and the SEC's Project Crypto—to the 1971 abandonment of the gold standard, predicting similar transformational effects on financial services.

"As we enter the final months of 2025, the two supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto. And both require neutral public blockchains. Naturally, Ethereum remains the premier choice given its high reliability and 100% uptime,” he said. “These two powerful macro cycles will play out over decades. Since ETH's price is a discount to the future, this bodes well for the token and is the reason BitMine's primary treasury asset is ETH.”

The price of Ethereum started to rebound over the weekend after dipping late last week, with the asset showing only a 0.6% loss over the last week at a recent price of $4,173. ETH is up 4% on the day, though it remains down about 5% over the last month.

Hyperliquid introduced permissionless spot quote assets and dropped its Hypurr NFT collection, driving tens of millions in trading volume and rare NFT sales over $400,000.

Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid has launched its permissionless spot quote asset feature on the mainnet. 

Essentially, this means any asset that meets onchain requirements can be used as a quote asset for trading pairs without requiring centralized approval.

The Hyperliquid team noted that any quote asset can be specified as the quote asset in the first spot pair of an HIP-1 deployment. Subsequent quote asset launches will be subject to a Dutch auction to determine a fair starting price.

In trading terms, the “quote asset” is the stable currency used to price other assets. USDH, Hyperliquid's newly launched stablecoin from Native Markets, has already been deployed as the first permissionless quote asset.

Hyperliquid also distributed 4,600 Hypurr NFTs on the HyperEVM earlier in the day, as a reward to early ecosystem participants. Some rare NFTs from the collection have seen extraordinary sales, such as Hypurr #21, which sold for 9,999 HYPE or $467,000.

Data from NFT marketplace OpenSea shows that the Hypurr NFT collections generated more than $36 million worth of trading volume.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion said its holdings have now surpassed 2.65 million ETH — worth around $10.8 billion — following its latest weekly acquisitions.

BitMine bought approximately 234,846 ETH ($961.5 million) since its last update on Sept. 22, reporting its total crypto and cash holdings had reached $11.6 billion on Monday. 

As of Sept. 28, BitMine also holds 192 BTC ($21.5 million), a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash. The company's ETH holdings are equivalent to around 2.2% of Ethereum's current circulating supply, which sits at approximately 120.7 million ETH, according to The Block's price page.

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 838,730 ETH and 495,360 ETH, respectively, according to SER data. BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,031 BTC ($71.8 billion) — equivalent to more than 3% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply — following Strategy's latest acquisition announcement on Monday.

Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH.



"As we enter the final months of 2025, the two Supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto," Lee said in a statement. "And both require neutral public blockchains. Naturally, Ethereum remains the premier choice given its high reliability and 100% uptime. These two powerful macro cycles will play out over decades. Since ETH's price is a discount to the future, this bodes well for the token and is the reason BitMine's primary treasury asset is ETH."

BitMine is now among the top-traded U.S. equities, with a five-day average daily volume of $2.6 billion as of Sept. 26. That ranks it 26th nationwide, just behind Marvell Technology and ahead of Visa, per Fundstrat and Statista data.

"At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock," Lee, who is also co-founder of Fundstrat, said.

Singapore, Singapore, September 29th, 2025, Chainwire

Former Ripple engineering leader to accelerate innovation, decentralization, and real-world scale

The Algorand Foundation announced the appointment of Nikolaos Bougalis as its new Chief Technology Officer. Bougalis brings deep experience in blockchain, cryptography, and security. Notably, he spent nearly a decade at Ripple, where he led engineering teams responsible for the open-source XRP Ledger.

Bougalis joins the Foundation at a critical inflection point for the Algorand ecosystem and the broader blockchain industry. Algorand released its 2025 technical roadmap in July, focused on four strategic pillars: Web3 core values, mainstream adoption, high-potential use cases, and bleeding edge technology. Bougalis will focus on leading the engineering team and collaborating with Algorand Technologies to drive the roadmap.

“Nik brings a wealth of experience in distributed systems, cryptography, and blockchain, as well as a demonstrated ability to foster collaborative development communities and build consensus across diverse technical and non-technical teams,” said Staci Warden, CEO of the Algorand Foundation. “He will help us double down on decentralization, performance, and security, solidifying Algorand's position as the blockchain of choice for enterprise-scale blockchain applications.”

Bougalis will be based in the United States and play a key role in Algorand's move back to the U.S. He will support Algorand's position as the blockchain of choice for U.S. enterprises and institutions seeking secure, compliant, and scalable infrastructure. Bougalis' expertise in enterprise security will further enhance Algorand's leadership in privacy, quantum resilience, and scalability.

 Bitcoin failed to follow gold to all-time highs this month, but analysts argue that BTC usually follows three to four months later, setting targets as high as $300,000. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's bull market still has room to run with a target range of $150,000-$300,000, analysts say.

BTC must decisively push above the $112,000-$114,000 zone to ignite a possible rally to $140,000.

Bitcoin's (BTC) sudden drop to $108,000 last week made it a 13% drawdown from its $124,500 all-time high, sparking fears that the BTC price might have peaked. 

Despite this drawdown, some analysts argued that Bitcoin's bull market had not even started, citing its performance relative to gold. 

As Cointelegraph continues to report, both gold and US stock markets have posted repeated all-time highs, while Bitcoin remains stuck as liquidity games keep bulls away.

Analysts were not worried about gold front-running Bitcoin, as analyst Milk Road Macro said, 

The comparative analysis showed that both gold/USD and BTC/USD pairs had formed rising wedge patterns, with gold breaking out to the upside in January. 

In March, “$BTC began to mimic gold's ‘rise → pause → last minute spike' pattern” highlighted in the green below, the analyst said, adding: 

Milk Road Macro further explained that while gold's breakout represented about a 10% gain, “Bitcoin has been known to outperform these percentage returns by 5-10x.”

They added that this puts Bitcoin's potential upside gains in the 50% to 100% range, or $160,000 to $220,000.

The “bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet,” said 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero in an X post on Monday.

He highlighted that the BTC/XAU pair traded in a “massive cup and handle” pattern in the weekly time frame, which could lead to new price discovery for Bitcoin over the next few weeks.

A break above the neckline at 37 XAU opens the way for the BTC/XAU pair to rally 446% toward the measured target of the cup-and-handle pattern at 160 XAU.

This points to a major price breakout for Bitcoin over the next few months.

Tapiero's argument was a response to crypto investor Zynx's analysis, who said the BTC/USD pair needed to rise above $150,000 to “equal its all-time high in gold.”

Historically, “Bitcoin has more than doubled its price in gold at a minimum, usually much more than that,” wrote Zynx's, adding:

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant contributor XWIN Research Japan argues that Bitcoin is still in its bull market, based on several onchain metrics. 

Bitcoin hit an intra-day high of $112,293 on Monday, reclaiming the $112,000 level after losing it on Thursday. It was trading at $112,233 at the time of writing, up 2.4% over the last 24 hours, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

“$BTC broke out of the down trend line overnight after squeezing all the late shorts,” said AlphaBTC in his latest analysis on X.

An accompanying chart showed that a key area of interest for Bitcoin bulls was today's open at $112,000. Holding this level would see the price push toward the local high at $114,000, signalling the strength of the recovery.

The 24-hour Bitcoin liquidation heatmap showed that BTC price could target a large block of bid liquidity as it moves higher. There is over $612 million in ask orders between $112,350 and $114,000. 

A sweep of this liquidity seems highly likely in the coming days, and a break above $114,000 could signal the end of the correction.

As Cointelegraph reported, a decisive move above the $113,000-$114,000 resistance zone could confirm a breakout from a bull flag, opening the door for a rally toward $140,000 in the months ahead.

In collaboration with leading token fundraising platform Legion, Kraken has introduced Kraken Launch, a token sale launchpad with retail crypto investor access. The launchpad enables individual investors to participate in transparent and fair token sales before they get listed on exchanges for public trading.

Retail investors usually get access to early-stage tokens only after VCs, institutions, and other private participants have already invested. As a result, individual investors often face disadvantages in early crypto investing, where ICOs are typically restricted to insiders.

Kraken aims to address this insider exclusivity issue through its new and innovative ICO participation platform, Kraken Launch. It enables users to invest in trusted crypto presales alongside VCs and institutional investors. Additionally, the platform is based on Legion's merit-based token allocation, which rewards dedicated community members.

Overall, Kraken Launch fosters a fair crypto fundraising environment that enhances token distribution and unlocks greater opportunities for passionate community members and everyday crypto investors.

Let's highlight Kraken Launch's main features and how it excels as a new token sale launchpad.

With the Legion partnership, Kraken Launch benefits from the crypto fundraising platform's merit-based ICO funding technology. It combines blockchain transparency with regulatory compliance, primarily adhering to MiCA rules in Europe, utilizing AI-assisted compliance tools.



Legion provides retail-friendly access to crypto token sales, enabling anyone, regardless of their financial situation, to potentially secure early-stage allocations. For client safety, the platform uses a compliance-focused fundraising approach, requiring crypto ICO projects to provide transparent details and adhere to MiCA standards, with no hidden terms.

At the core of the entire crypto fundraising system is the Legion score, a reputation system that rewards active, value-adding community members with larger token allocations. It bases the score on social activity, on-chain history, and developer contributions to give the most deserving users greater token access.

Kraken Launch, leveraging Legion's merit-based crypto fundraising model, offers key advantages for investors and crypto project teams.

Retail investors benefit from a safe ICO investing experience thanks to Kraken's proven platform security and Legion's compliance-focused fundraising framework. They also receive transparent project information with no hidden allocations. The platform also rewards higher token allocations to the most dedicated investors.

For crypto project teams, Kraken Launch offers global distribution and greater liquidity through more inclusive capital formation. Through Legion's fair model, the ICO participation platform ensures presale tokens go to committed users who are more likely to support the project's long-term growth, rather than purely VCs and institutions that might only be interested in capital gains.

Blockchain technology was built to democratize finance, promising inclusivity, fairness, and permissionless security. Leaders from both Kraken and Legion see Kraken Launch as a return to broad asset ownership and real community distribution.

“Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow's financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” explained Brett McLain, Kraken's Head of Payments and Blockchain. “Together with Legion, we're scaling a product that democratizes token sales and aligns communities with builders.”

Aligning with this vision, Legion co-founder Matt O'Connor added, “Crypto gave us the tools to rebuild capital markets from first principles. This partnership combines Legion's approach to regulation and merit-based access with Kraken's global distribution, compliance infrastructure, and deep liquidity.”

Kraken Launch stands out compared to other popular launchpads, such as Binance Launchpad or KuCoin Spotlight, mainly due to the platform's Legion partnership. It allows Kraken to offer a dual sale model, where crypto token sales occur on-chain and are further facilitated by the Kraken exchange.



Additionally, Kraken Launch enforces a compliance-first approach to crypto fundraising based on Legion's model. In particular, this helps investors stay aligned with MiCA regulations. Featured ICO projects provide transparent tokenomics with no hidden round allocations.

By leveraging the Legion score, Kraken's new launchpad platform provides a more community-driven fundraising environment compared to other platforms that lack the merit-based allocation system. As a result, Kraken Launch features early-stage cryptos with the most potential, supported by more committed token holders.

What can you do now to prepare for the first few projects at Kraken Launch? Here are some easy steps to follow:

Kraken Launch, in partnership with Legion, is making crypto fundraising more accessible, fairer, and transparent. By adopting a compliance-first approach, it is paving the way for increased regulatory approval in early crypto investing and ICO projects.

Participate in the first industry-exclusive token sale on Kraken Launch before the project goes public. Visit Kraken today and discover how to gain early access to upcoming Web3 projects, as well as receive significant presale token allocations.

Sharps Technology (NASDAQ:STSS) has announced a strategic partnership with Crypto.com to enhance its digital asset treasury management capabilities, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. The company has already acquired over 2 million SOL tokens, currently valued at more than $400 million with SOL trading above $200.

Through this collaboration, STSS will utilize Crypto.com's institutional-grade custody infrastructure and OTC desk for managing its digital assets. Crypto.com will integrate several Solana projects, aiming to expand access to the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians. STSS plans to deploy capital through Crypto.com into Solana-native projects to generate yield while expanding ecosystem liquidity.

STSS partners with Crypto.com to manage its $400M Solana treasury, boosting institutional legitimacy for SOL ecosystem investments.

This partnership represents a significant institutional advancement for the Solana ecosystem. Sharps Technology has accumulated an impressive 2 million SOL tokens (worth over $400 million) and is now leveraging Crypto.com's institutional infrastructure to manage this substantial treasury. The decision to use Crypto.com's custody solutions, OTC desk, and liquidity services indicates STSS is implementing sophisticated treasury management practices rather than merely holding SOL as a passive investment.

The strategic importance lies in how STSS plans to deploy capital across Solana-native projects, which serves dual purposes: generating yield on their treasury while simultaneously improving liquidity throughout the Solana ecosystem. This creates a positive feedback loop where their investment activities directly strengthen the network they're invested in.

Notably, Crypto.com's commitment to integrate several Solana projects represents significant validation, as it connects Solana to Crypto.com's massive user base of 150 million users. This integration will likely reduce friction for institutional capital entering the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians - addressing a critical infrastructure gap that has historically limited institutional participation.

The collaboration positions STSS as one of the largest institutional Solana treasury holders, establishing them as a significant player in Solana's financial ecosystem. While the treasury strategy carries execution risks and exposure to SOL's price volatility, this partnership demonstrates a sophisticated approach to digital asset management that could become a blueprint for other corporations exploring similar strategies.


NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Crypto.com and Sharps Technology, Inc. (the "Company" or "STSS") (Nasdaq: "STSS" and "STSSW") today announced that STSS has expanded its digital asset treasury strategy with Crypto.com services for its holdings.







STSS is an emerging leader in digital asset treasury management, with a bold vision to align traditional finance with the Solana ecosystem. The Company has previously announced plans to establish a Solana-focused digital asset treasury strategy and, to date has acquired more than 2 million SOL.

As part of this collaboration, STSS intends to use Crypto.com's platform, including its institutional-grade custody infrastructure and OTC desk, which offers deep liquidity, competitive pricing, and discreet execution, to manage its digital asset treasury. Crypto.com will also integrate several Solana projects, representing a significant step in expanding access to the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians. This partnership underscores STSS's commitment to advancing the growth of the Solana network in close alignment with key Solana ecosystem players.

The Company's Solana holdings are currently valued at over $400 million, with SOL trading above $200. By deploying a portion of this capital through Crypto.com into Solana-native projects, STSS aims to generate yield while simultaneously expanding liquidity across the Solana ecosystem.

"STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision," said Eric Anziani, President and Chief Operating Officer of Crypto.com. "Crypto.com is uniquely built to offer the comprehensive capabilities required by institutions to safely and effectively manage digital asset treasuries."

"At STSS, we view our digital asset treasury not only as a balance sheet strategy, but as a commitment to advancing the future of open, efficient financial infrastructure," said James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS. "Partnering with Crypto.com, a platform with over 150 million users, provides us with the institutional-grade tools and liquidity access to responsibly manage one of the largest Solana treasuries, while also directly contributing to the growth of the Solana ecosystem. This collaboration marks a pivotal step in aligning our long-term corporate strategy with innovation at the forefront of digital finance."

 Swift is teaming up with Consensys and over 30 unspecified institutions to build a blockchain-based settlement system for 24/7 real-time cross-border payments. 

The Swift interbank communication network is working with Ethereum ecosystem developer Consensys to develop a blockchain settlement system.

According to a Monday announcement, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is developing a blockchain in collaboration with over 30 financial institutions and Consensys. The initial focus is on developing infrastructure for “real-time 24/7 cross-border payments.”

One of the objectives of the new blockchain will be interoperability with “existing and emerging networks,” while also maintaining compliance. Consensys is tasked with developing the conceptual prototype in the first phase and defining the future work phases.

“The ledger will extend Swift's financial communication role into a digital environment,” the announcement said. Swift added that the platform will support the exchange of tokenized assets, though the types of tokens will ultimately be determined by central and commercial banks.

Blockchain, once described as a solution in search of a problem, is now being adopted rapidly by the traditional finance industry. Per the announcement, the vision for Swift's new infrastructure is “a secure, real-time log of transactions between financial institutions.”

This would be important considering that Swift underpins most international payments in the modern financial ecosystem. According to the organization's website, over 11,500 institutions in over 200 countries rely on the company's infrastructure to process their transactions.

Swift does not directly move any money; instead, it provides an interbank communication network. It is meant to reduce errors and fraud risk. It is so pervasive that sanctions or exclusion from Swift can effectively cut a country or bank off from the global financial system.

“Because there are very few alternatives to SWIFT, financial sanctions that limit access to this network have become particularly costly for sanctioned entities,” according to a US Federal Reserve Bank of New York report.

This is not Swift's first move into blockchain. In March 2024, Swift publicly recognized the value of tokenization and the shared ledger model. The organization sees a continuing role for its messaging layer within a blockchain-based financial system:

In November 2024, Swift provided its global financial messaging network to integrate tokenized fund processes with existing fiat payment systems. The initiative was carried out in collaboration with UBS Asset Management and blockchain oracle network Chainlink as part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Guardian.

Also in late 2024, Swift announced that North American, European and Asian banks would begin digital asset trials on its network. The trials aim to explore how the banking network can provide financial institutions with unified access to “multiple digital asset classes and currencies.”

Meta introduces subscription model at £2.99 monthly following ICO guidance on consent or pay frameworks, setting UK apart from stricter EU regulations.

Meta will introduce a subscription option for Facebook and Instagram users in the UK during the coming weeks, allowing them to access the platforms without personalised advertising for £2.99 per month on web browsers or £3.99 monthly on iOS and Android devices. The announcement, made on September 26, 2025, responds to regulatory guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office published on January 23, 2025.

The subscription model applies to users over 18 years old. Those who choose to pay will avoid having their personal information used for personalised advertising purposes. Users declining the subscription will continue using the services at no cost while receiving personalised advertisements, maintaining access to existing ad preference controls and privacy settings. A third option allows users to leave the platforms entirely.

Web purchases cost less than mobile subscriptions because Apple and Google charge fees through their respective app store purchasing policies. Regardless of purchase location, the subscription applies to all Facebook and Instagram accounts linked within Meta's Accounts Center. Additional accounts listed in the Accounts Center incur reduced fees of £2 monthly on web or £3 monthly on mobile platforms.

The ICO's guidance establishes a framework examining four critical factors for consent or pay models: power imbalance between organisations and users, appropriate fee levels, service equivalence across paid and free options, and privacy by design principles. Organisations must document assessments through data protection impact assessments under Article 35 of the UK GDPR. The guidance updated on January 23 confirmed publishers can implement consent or pay approaches provided they offer genuine choice and meet strict data protection requirements.

The ICO framework differs substantially from positions taken by European Union regulators. The European Data Protection Board adopted Opinion 08/2024 on April 17, 2024, determining that most consent or pay models failed to meet GDPR standards for valid consent. Meta challenged that opinion through General Court litigation filed on June 27, 2024, presenting seven pleas alleging violations of fundamental rights and improper interpretation of GDPR provisions.

Meta's subscription pricing in the UK represents a fraction of rates charged in other European markets. The company launched similar subscription services across the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland in October 2023 at €9.99 monthly for web access and €12.99 for mobile applications. Those prices significantly exceeded the UK rates announced in September 2025.

Research examining consent or pay implementations across Europe revealed substantial disparities between advertising revenue and subscription charges. A comprehensive report released in July 2025 documented that publishers earn approximately €0.24 per user monthly from tracking-based advertising, while pay options generate €3.24 per user monthly. The analysis found digital advertising accounts for roughly 10 percent of European press revenue, with programmatic advertising requiring personal data representing only 5 percent of total newspaper and magazine income.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office emphasized that fees must be "appropriate" and not "unreasonably high" to avoid effectively coercing users into consenting to data collection. The guidance recommends separating core service access fees from data protection opt-out charges. Where power imbalances exist between organisations and users, regulators expect companies to provide alternative options such as contextual advertising that does not require consent or payment.

Service equivalence represents another pillar of the ICO framework. Publishers must ensure comparable core functionality regardless of whether users choose to consent or pay. While premium features may differ across options, the fundamental service should remain consistent to preserve genuine choice. Organisations must also comply with privacy by design obligations under Article 25(1) of the UK GDPR, ensuring data protection is integrated when designing services.

Meta's announcement highlighted differences between UK and EU regulatory environments. The company stated that EU regulators continue requiring less personalised advertising experiences beyond legal requirements, creating worse outcomes for users and businesses. The UK approach allows clearer user choice while enabling personalised advertising tools to function as engines of growth and productivity. According to Meta, its advertising technologies connected to £65 billion in economic activity and over 357,000 jobs across the UK during 2024.

The contrast between regulatory approaches extends to enforcement patterns. Privacy advocacy group noyb filed lawsuitsagainst German data protection authorities on June 17, 2025, over nearly four years of inaction on complaints about consent or pay systems implemented by news websites. The cases revealed significant administrative dysfunction and reluctance to take decisive action against established media companies using questionable consent mechanisms.

UK news publishers began implementing consent or pay models following the ICO guidance. The Daily Mirror established pricing at £1.99 monthly for ad-free access with clear data collection options and partner information. The Times, The Sun, Daily Mail, Express, and Independent adopted similar approaches during late 2024 and early 2025. The ICO announced plans to expand cookie tracking scrutiny to the 1,000 most-visited UK websites following successful compliance improvements among initial review sites.

Personalised advertising builds profiles based on three data categories: provided information intentionally shared when signing up for services, observed data gathered through tracking activity across products and devices, and inferred data about interests or behaviour. The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations require organisations to obtain consent before using storage and access technologies such as cookies on user devices. Combined with UK GDPR requirements, organisations must secure valid consent to deliver personalised advertising relying on these technologies.

Meta maintains that personalised advertisements help users discover relevant products and services while allowing businesses to reach interested customers. Studies indicate personalised ads boost revenue for companies displaying advertisements on Meta platforms, with every pound spent on ads driving an average £3.82 in revenues for UK businesses choosing to advertise. UK advertisers will continue running personalised advertising campaigns reaching users who select free, ad-supported access.

Children require special consideration under consent or pay models. The ICO guidance notes that children merit special protection regarding personal information due to potential lack of financial independence and limited understanding of processing activities. Services offered to children under 13 years old must comply with Article 8 UK GDPR. Organisations seeking consent from users under 13 must obtain parental consent and implement effective age assurance measures.

Standard 12 of the Children's Code requires switching profiling for children off by default, including for personalised advertising purposes. Services should always provide privacy settings for personalised advertising used to fund services but separate from core functionality children wish to access. In most cases, funding models remain distinct from core services and should be subject to privacy settings disabled by default.

The consent or pay model differs from "take it or leave it" approaches that condition service access solely on accepting data processing for personalised advertising. The ICO determined most take it or leave it approaches fail to comply with requirements for freely given consent because they provide no genuine choice. Consent or pay models differ by offering payment as an alternative to consent, though this raises separate issues when fees combine access to core services with charges for avoiding data sharing.

Organisations can offer additional options alongside consent or pay choices. These include access with contextual advertising targeted based on page content rather than user profiles, or menu options with different premium subscription tiers featuring additional functionality. Such approaches may address power imbalance concerns by ensuring users have meaningful choices beyond binary consent or payment decisions.

The ICO stated that when organisations identify clear power imbalances with users, they should take additional steps demonstrating consent or pay models comply with data protection law. Power imbalances may exist where users have no realistic choice about whether to use services, particularly affecting existing users who may face significant barriers to switching providers. Factors indicating power imbalances include market position, network effects, switching costs, and data portability limitations.

Recital 43 of the UK GDPR explains that consent should not be regarded as freely given if individuals have no genuine free choice or cannot refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. The phrase "without detriment" means individuals should not face unfair penalties for refusing or withdrawing consent. However, it does not mean consent becomes invalid due to any level of negative consequence. The ICO uses the term "unfair penalty" throughout its guidance.

Articles 12 and 21 of the UK GDPR require organisations processing personal data for direct marketing purposes to demonstrate that individuals can exercise their right to object free of charge. The ICO guidance explains that direct marketing definitions include processing for personalised advertising purposes. In consent or pay contexts, the right to object to direct marketing can operate similarly to withdrawing consent to personalised advertising.

Meta's implementation will notify UK users over 18 about their choice to subscribe for fee-based access without advertisements. The notification will be dismissible initially, allowing existing users time to consider options before decisions are required. Social media services remain personalised for subscribers, but their personal data will not be used to display advertisements.

The announcement contrasts with Meta's ongoing disputes with European regulators over data processing practices. The Court of Justice of the European Union previously limited Meta's data use for advertising, requiring data minimisation principles even when users consent to personalised advertising. A Leipzig District Court awarded a Facebook user €5,000 compensation on July 4, 2025, for data protection violations involving Meta's Business Tools that track users across third-party websites.

The UK regulatory environment appears increasingly divergent from European Union approaches. While digital advertising trade associations defend consent or pay models in EU consultations, arguing they provide genuine user autonomy, privacy advocates continue documenting concerns about coercive design and excessive pricing. The tension between commercial viability and privacy protection remains central to ongoing regulatory debates.

This matters for the marketing community because it establishes a precedent for how major platforms can balance personalised advertising capabilities with privacy requirements. The relatively low subscription pricing compared to European rates may influence user decisions and affect targeting reach for advertisers. The ICO's framework provides clearer parameters for implementing similar models while maintaining compliance with UK data protection law.

The approach also affects measurement of advertising effectiveness. Users selecting subscription options will not contribute to personalised advertising metrics, potentially impacting campaign optimisation and audience insights. Advertisers must adapt strategies to account for reduced data availability while maintaining campaign performance for users choosing ad-supported access.

Polymyxin antibiotics target lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) in both membranes of the bacterial cell envelope, leading to bacterial killing through a poorly defined mechanism. Here we demonstrate that metabolic activity is essential for the lethality of clinically relevant doses of polymyxin B (PmB) and leverage this insight to determine its mode of action. PmB killed exponential-phase Escherichia coli but did not eliminate stationary-phase cells unless a carbon source was available. Antibiotic lethality correlated with surface protrusions visible by atomic force microscopy and LPS loss from the outer membrane via processes that required LPS synthesis and transport but that were blocked by the MCR-1 polymyxin resistance determinant. While energy-dependent outer-membrane disruption was not directly lethal, it facilitated PmB access to the inner membrane, which the antibiotic permeabilized in an energy-independent manner, leading to cell death. This work reveals how metabolic inactivity confers tolerance of an important, membrane-targeting antibiotic.

The bactericidal activity of many antibiotics is dependent upon cellular metabolic activity1,2,3,4,5. For the efficacy of membrane-targeting antibiotics or peptides, however, it has been proposed that metabolic activity is not required, because intact membranes are presumed essential in all physiological states6,7,8. In support of this, many membrane-targeting compounds are effective against metabolically active and inactive bacteria9,10,11,12,13.

Polymyxin antibiotics are the only membrane-targeting drugs used clinically against Gram-negative bacteria, but often lack efficacy in vivo, despite potent bactericidal activity in vitro14,15,16,17,18. Two polymyxins are used therapeutically, polymyxin B (PmB) and polymyxin E (colistin), both of which consist of a cationic cyclic peptide component coupled to an extracyclic peptide chain which in turn is linked to an acyl tail14,15,18. Both polymyxin antibiotics target lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) via high-affinity, long-lasting interactions, leading to disruption of the outer membrane (OM)18,19,20. However, the nature of this OM disruption and the mechanism by which bacteria are killed by the antibiotic is largely unknown14,15,18,21,22,23,24.

Several previous studies have shown that inner-membrane (IM) permeabilization, which is proposed to be required for killing, occurs after OM disruption14,15,21,25,26,27,28. Our previous work showed that LPS is the IM target of polymyxins, just as it is for the OM27,28. While it is unknown how polymyxins cross the OM to access the periplasmic space, the predominant model is ‘self-promoted' uptake, by which the cationic properties of the antibacterial disrupt cation bridges between LPS molecules, compromising barrier function and enabling antibiotic ingress through the OM14,29,30.

Despite the membrane-damaging effect of polymyxins, they do not eradicate persister cells of Escherichia coli or Acinetobacter baumannii31,32. Stationary-phase E. coli has also been shown to have a high level of polymyxin tolerance, suggesting that the bactericidal activity of these membrane-targeting antimicrobials is affected by metabolic activity and/or growth state10. Accordingly, metabolic activity was found to be required for colistin lethality at clinically relevant doses13. However, at concentrations above those typically achieved clinically (>10–50 µg ml−1), polymyxin lethality was found to be unaffected by growth phase or metabolic activity13,32,33.

In summary, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of how polymyxin antibiotics kill bacteria, and the requirement for metabolic activity remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether and why metabolic activity was needed for polymyxin lethality and thereby gain a significantly improved understanding of the mechanism by which this class of antibiotics kill bacteria.

To assess the role of growth and metabolic activity in PmB-mediated killing, we took equal numbers of E. coli in exponential phase (high metabolic activity) or stationary phase (low metabolic activity) and exposed them to a clinically relevant concentration of the antibiotic (4 µg ml−1) in minimal medium only (MM) or with glucose (MM + G) to stimulate metabolic activity (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a)34,35,36. Exponential-phase E. coli cells were rapidly killed by PmB regardless of whether glucose was present (Fig. 1a), and PmB efficiently killed stationary-phase bacteria in the presence of glucose, albeit after a lag phase of 15 min during which there was no decrease in viability (Fig. 1a). Strikingly, however, there was no detectable killing of stationary-phase E. coli during exposure to PmB in the absence of glucose, indicating that metabolic activity is required for the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic (Fig. 1a). This effect of glucose was dose dependent, and the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose did not support PmB-mediated killing of stationary-phase E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Conversely, there does not appear to be a requirement for cell division for PmB killing, as MM without antibiotic (±glucose) did not support noticeable growth of E. coli from either exponential or stationary phase during the assay.

Except for stationary-phase cells without glucose, all bacteria were SYTOX positive by the end of the imaging (Supplementary Fig. 6a). It is worth noting that a lower PmB concentration was used for AFM relative to other experiments, due to the low density of cells used in these assays.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the effect of the antibiotic on the OM of living bacteria37,38, we tracked the effects of the antibiotics in real time: PmB exposure of exponential-phase E. coli resulted in rapid and profound changes to the cell surface, with the appearance of numerous protrusions, regardless of the presence of glucose (Fig. 1b). By contrast, stationary-phase E. coli only showed PmB-induced OM changes in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1b), correlating with the effects on bacterial viability (Fig. 1a,b). Scanning electron microscopy replicated the AFM observations, confirming these distinct, glucose-dependent phenotypes of stationary-phase cells exposed to PmB, while the antibiotic caused surface protrusions in exponential-phase E. coli regardless of the presence of glucose (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Next, using the small hydrophobic dye NPN (N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine)39, we showed that the binding of PmB to its lipid A target was unaffected by glucose or growth phase (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1a). This finding was supported by mass spectrometry27, which ruled out the presence of lipid A modifications in stationary-phase cells that might reduce PmB binding but intriguingly did show a large reduction in LPS abundance in cells exposed to PmB in MM + G (Extended Data Fig. 3). We further investigated changes to OM integrity by measuring the leakage of heterologously expressed mCherry (28 kDa) from the periplasm40. In the presence of PmB and glucose, stationary-phase E. coli showed a significant increase of mCherry in the supernatant, compared with cells not exposed to the antibiotic from 90 min onwards. This suggests that minor OM permeabilization/disruption occurs rapidly, as measured by NPN, but that major disruption to the OM—as measured by mCherry release—occurs much more slowly, possibly via lysis (Fig. 1d).

Finally, we used SYTOX green nucleic acid stain, to assess permeability of both the OM and IM during PmB exposure. As expected from the viability data (Fig. 1a), stationary-phase E. coli showed significantly increased permeability in the presence of glucose, after a lag of 15 min (Fig. 1e); permeability also occurred in the absence of glucose, but at significantly lower levels than for cells exposed to the antibiotic in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1e). Again, consistent with the viability data (Fig. 1a), PmB-induced IM permeability was unaffected by glucose in exponential-phase E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Taken together, these data show that PmB binds to E. coli regardless of metabolic state, leading to minor OM disruption sufficient to allow NPN ingress, but that bactericidal activity, OM protrusions and release of periplasmic protein require metabolic activity. It is worth noting that stationary-phase viability and OM/IM permeation were similarly dependent on glucose across a diverse panel of laboratory and clinical isolates, indicative of a broadly conserved phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 4).

High-resolution AFM imaging of the OM of stationary-phase E. coli showed a similar abundance and organization of OM protein networks as previously reported37,38 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 5; note porous appearance of the OM in phase images). The porin networks were initially unaffected by PmB, but over time, the appearance of the PmB-exposed OM was dominated by protrusions at a scale >10 nm (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). On these living E. coli cells, we did not observe any PmB-induced LPS rearrangement into hexagonal lattices, such as previously reported based on AFM on solid-supported, collapsed OM vesicles22,23,24.

Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; NS, not significant.

Further examination of PmB-induced OM changes revealed that LPS was released from cells exposed to PmB in the presence of glucose but not in the absence of the antibiotic or glucose (Fig. 2b). Analysis of bacterial cells found a corresponding loss of LPS from E. coli exposed to PmB in the presence but not absence of glucose (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2), which was maximal by 15 min and fully consistent with the mass spectrometry results reported above (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 6a). This coincided with the appearance of surface protrusions, which subsequently increased in abundance, up to IM permeabilization as measured by SYTOX (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, LPS loss at 15 min was not due to cell lysis as, in contrast to LPS, there were no differences in levels of the cytoplasmic protein GroEL or OM porin OmpF across our experimental conditions (Fig. 2c).

Combined, these data revealed that PmB at least initially leaves the OM protein networks intact but causes substantial and rapid LPS loss in the presence of glucose. PmB-induced LPS loss also occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and with exponential-phase E. coli in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB), indicative of a conserved process (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4).

The observed dependence on metabolic activity for PmB lethality suggests an energy-dependent bacterial response to PmB challenge. As PmB-triggered LPS release required metabolic activity, we hypothesized that LPS synthesis and/or transport to the OM contributed to bacterial killing.

To establish energy dependence, we sought to distinguish between carbon- and energy-related effects. Using equimolar concentrations of various carbon sources in MM, we measured stationary-phase E. coli survival under PmB challenge and, in parallel experiments without PmB, bacterial ATP production and overall LPS abundance (Fig. 3a). In these experiments, bacterial PmB susceptibility correlated with ATP production and with the amount of LPS associated with cells in the absence of PmB (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7). In the presence of PmB, the amount of LPS dropped to lower levels in the presence of carbon sources that yielded higher ATP production (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7), confirming the importance of energy for PmB-induced LPS loss and bacterial killing.

To establish a link between LPS production and PmB-induced LPS loss and killing, we performed PmB killing assays in the presence of various inhibitors41. Inhibition of UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC), the rate-limiting step of lipid A synthesis, reduced the rate and degree of PmB-mediated killing of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas the protein synthesis inhibitor tetracycline had no effect (Fig. 3c–e and Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). There was also a slower progression of PmB-triggered surface protrusions in the presence of CHIR-090 (an LpxC inhibitor) relative to PmB alone (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We also found that an inhibitor of the LPS transporter MsbA (multicopy suppressor of the HtrB temperature-sensitive phenotype) reduced killing by PmB and slowed protrusion appearance, while a strain with reduced LPS transport protein D (LptD) function was also killed more slowly than the wild type (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 8e). For all inhibitors, PmB binding to the OM was not affected, as determined via NPN uptake, whereas reduction of LPS synthesis and transport significantly reduced PmB-induced IM permeation as measured by SYTOX ingress into the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Further evidence for the importance of LPS transport came from experiments with novobiocin, which promotes LPS trafficking from the IM to the OM42 and was found to promote PmB-mediated LPS loss (Extended Data Fig. 9). This finding also provides a molecular explanation for the potentiating effect of novobiocin on polymyxin susceptibility42,43.

Combined, these experiments revealed that the magnitude of PmB-mediated LPS loss correlated with metabolic activity, which in turn correlated with bacterial killing. The role of metabolic activity in LPS loss was due, at least in part, to a requirement for LPS synthesis and transport.

To differentiate between PmB action on the OM and on the IM, we examined whether PmB could kill metabolically active cells by LPS loss alone, without the need for permeabilization of the IM. For this purpose, we first exposed E. coli to PmB for 15 min in MM + G, long enough for LPS loss to reach its maximum but before IM disruption occurred and before colony-forming unit (c.f.u.) counts started to decrease relative to the inoculum (Fig. 1a,e and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). We then washed the bacteria to remove unbound antibiotic, which also removed released LPS, followed by incubation in MM ± PmB and ±glucose. In the absence of PmB, bacteria survived at the same level over 2 h in the presence or absence of glucose (Fig. 4a). By contrast, bacteria that were re-exposed to PmB were efficiently killed, regardless of the presence of glucose (Fig. 4a). Therefore, PmB-mediated LPS loss alone is not sufficient to kill bacteria. Moreover, the requirement for metabolic activity for PmB-mediated killing appeared to only apply to LPS loss from the OM and is not required for subsequent IM disruption and killing.

To further test the impact of LPS loss on bacterial killing, we exposed stationary-phase E. coli to the nonlethal PmB nonapeptide (PmBN)18, which also caused significant LPS loss within 15 min in the presence of glucose, and to EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), which caused LPS loss both in presence and absence of glucose (Fig. 4b,c). At the doses tested, neither EDTA nor PmBN had any effect on bacterial viability and did not trigger membrane protrusions (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that polymyxin-triggered LPS release, while not bactericidal on its own, facilitates antibiotic entry into the periplasm, enabling PmB to access and permeate the IM and thereby kill the cell. To test this, we exposed stationary-phase E. coli to PmB, PmBN or EDTA for 15 min in MM + G to trigger LPS loss, as above, before removing these OM-disrupting agents (and released LPS) by washing, and finally measured bacterial survival in the presence of freshly added PmB. Each of the three pre-treatments enabled killing by PmB at concentrations below those required to kill untreated control cells, indicating that LPS loss sensitizes bacteria to PmB-mediated killing (Fig. 4d).

It is worth noting that we saw a greater level of bacterial killing for experiments where bacteria were pretreated with a membrane-disrupting agent before washing and subsequent exposure to PmB (for example, Fig. 4a,d), compared with experiments without a pre-treatment step (for example, Fig. 3c,d,f). A possible explanation for this difference is that released LPS sequesters PmB, reducing its activity44. As this is washed away in the pre-treatment experiments, it cannot reduce the activity of the subsequent PmB dose. Furthermore, once the OM is compromised by the membrane-disrupting pre-treatment, subsequent PmB treatment can efficiently access the IM. Combined, this explains the higher levels of bacterial killing in the pre-treatment experiments relative to other assays.

To demonstrate that PmB-triggered LPS loss causes the OM to become permeable to molecules of the size of PmB, we showed periplasmic ingress of a bodipy-conjugated analogue of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (Mw = 1723.35 g mol−1 versus 1301.56 g mol−1 for PmB) (Fig. 4e)45. However, minor permeabilization of the OM, as occurs with PmB in the absence of glucose, did not permit entry of vancomycin into the periplasm (Fig. 4e).

As EDTA caused LPS loss from stationary-phase E. coli in the absence of glucose (Fig. 4c), we hypothesized that EDTA would enable PmB to access the IM and thereby kill E. coli in the absence of energy. First, in MM + G, there was a significant loss of viability of E. coli exposed to PmB alone and to PmB combined with EDTA, but not EDTA alone (Fig. 4f). However, levels of bacterial viability were the same for cells exposed to PmB alone and PmB–EDTA, indicating this combination was not synergistic at the concentrations used (Fig. 4f). We then repeated this experiment in MM without glucose. In keeping with our earlier findings, metabolically inactive cells were not killed by PmB alone (Fig. 4g). However, there was a significant loss of viability of metabolically inactive cells exposed to PmB and EDTA together (Fig. 4). In addition, analysis of EDTA/PmB co-treatment of metabolically inactive cells by AFM revealed a roughening of the bacterial surface, with numerous protrusions that resembled the effects observed of PmB alone in the presence of glucose (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 8).

Together, these experiments show that metabolic activity is required for PmB lethality because it supports LPS release, which provides the antibiotic with access to the IM, the disruption of which leads to bacterial killing. However, if LPS loss occurs via a PmB-independent mechanism, such as EDTA, then there is no need for metabolic activity, showing that IM disruption occurs via an energy-independent process.

Mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, which encode phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferases, are globally disseminated in the Enterobacterales46,47,48. MCR-1, which is the most common variant, selectively modifies the 4′ phosphate of lipid A targeted by PmB, reducing susceptibility to polymyxin antibiotics47. Previous work showed that MCR-1 protected the IM of both whole cells and spheroplasts from colistin28,39. However, previous studies have shown that polymyxin antibiotics can disrupt the OM of polymyxin-resistant E. coli as evidenced by ingress of NPN or hydrophobic antibiotics such as rifampicin14,28,39. As such, the impact of MCR-1 on OM integrity during PmB exposure is unclear. Based on the work above, we hypothesized that pEtN modification would contribute to polymyxin resistance by inhibiting PmB-triggered LPS release, which would block access of the antibiotic to the IM.

To test this, we used E. coli transformed with an inducible mcr-1 construct but allowed expression to occur at basal levels (that is, no inducer) so that we had minimal production of MCR-1 and thus only a 4-fold increase in PmB minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) above the wild-type strain (Supplementary Table 1). Despite this modest change in susceptibility, MCR-1 fully protected E. coli from PmB at 4 µg ml−1 in MM + G, whereas there was a >4-log10 reduction in c.f.u. counts of the wild type (Fig. 5a). There was also a substantial reduction in the viability of E. coli that produced a catalytically inactive version of MCR-1 (MCR-1*) (Fig. 5a)49. As expected, MCR-1 reduced but did not prevent OM disruption as indicated by NPN uptake relative to the wild-type strain, whereas the IM was fully protected from PmB (Fig. 5b,c)27,28,39,49.

In support of our hypothesis, we next showed that MCR-1 prevented PmB-triggered LPS loss, as well as surface protrusions, both of which occurred in the wild type and the strain expressing the catalytically inactive MCR-1 variant (Fig. 5d–f).

Therefore, MCR-1 mediated pEtN modification of lipid A prevents LPS loss from E. coli exposed to PmB, which contributes to resistance by blocking access of the antibiotic to the IM. However, it is not clear whether the lack of LPS release is due to reduced PmB binding or greater membrane integrity due to the pEtN modification or a combination of both factors.

The mechanism(s) by which polymyxin antibiotics kill bacteria has been the focus of multiple studies, with various conclusions reached and models proposed14,15,18,21,22,50. In this work, we established that metabolic activity is required for bactericidal activity of a clinically relevant concentration of PmB and used this as a starting point to build a refined model for the mechanism by which polymyxin antibiotics kill bacteria (Fig. 6). We found that the initial interaction of PmB with the OM was unaffected by the metabolic state of the bacteria, explaining how polymyxins can sensitize metabolically dormant persister bacteria to antibiotics32,51,52 (Fig. 6a). In metabolically inactive bacteria, there is no further disruption to the bacterial surface and no loss of viability. However, in metabolically active E. coli, PmB causes rapid, large-scale LPS loss, which required ATP-dependent LPS synthesis and transport (Fig. 6b). With the loss of OM integrity, PmB gains access to LPS in the IM, and surface protrusions appear, although it is not yet clear whether these processes are directly linked (Fig. 6c). Finally, the interaction of PmB with LPS in the IM results in IM disruption and bacterial killing via an energy-independent process, and OM disruption increases, sufficient to allow the egress of proteins from the periplasm (Fig. 6d).

a, PmB binds to the OM, causing minor permeabilization, regardless of bacterial metabolic activity (insufficient damage to provide PmB with access to the periplasm). b, In metabolically active bacteria, PmB triggers LPS release via a process that requires ATP-dependent synthesis (Raetz pathway) and transport of LPS (further boosted by novobiocin (Nov)). c, The shedding of LPS compromises the integrity of the OM, resulting in surface protrusions, and enables ingress of the antibiotic into the periplasm where it targets LPS in the IM, leading to permeabilization. d, The loss of integrity of both the OM and IM results in bacterial killing.

The full mechanism of PmB-triggered LPS loss remains to be elucidated. While EDTA and PmB both disrupt the cation bridges that stabilize LPS molecules in the OM, only EDTA causes LPS release in the absence of metabolic activity. This likely reflects the fact that EDTA chelates cations, whereas PmB displaces cations from LPS by binding lipid A phosphates. While cation displacement by PmB weakens inter-LPS interactions, it appears that this is only sufficient to cause minor permeabilization. We speculate that the insertion of PmB into the LPS monolayer causes slipping between molecules, and as more LPS is transported into the OM, this leads to loss of PmB-bound LPS from the OM. Such slipping could be consistent with the complex interplay between PmB and OM fluidity53,54.

Several antibiotic classes require bacterial metabolic activity for lethality2,3,4,5. However, our finding that this requirement also applies to PmB goes against the common assumption that the efficacy of membrane-targeting antibacterials is independent of metabolic activity. It also provides an explanation for polymyxin tolerance observed in stationary-phase cells and persisters4,5,9,10,31,32,55,56. An important distinction, though, is that while many bactericidal antibiotics kill via metabolism-dependent production of reactive metabolites5,8,57, the key energy-dependent step required for polymyxin activity is disruption of the OM, which enables the antibiotic to permeabilize the IM and kill the bacterium.

We have previously shown that sub-inhibitory concentrations of the LptD inhibitor murepavadin promoted polymyxin susceptibility of P. aeruginosa, via LPS accumulation in the IM, without reducing LPS transport to the OM27. Based on the work presented here, we would predict that growth inhibitory concentrations of inhibitors of the Lpt system would reduce killing by polymyxins. However, we could not test this because the available inhibitors (murepavadin and thanatin) are cationic peptides that cause OM disruption, including membrane blebbing, which would compromise the findings58,59,60. Instead, we capitalized on the observation that novobiocin promoted LPS transport by enhancing ATPase activity, which in turn increased bacterial susceptibility to polymyxin antibiotics, although it was not known why at the time42,43.

Although our conclusions agree with some previous reports, they may appear inconsistent with others. For example, there is evidence that PmB is active against metabolically inactive bacteria. However, those studies used either exponential-phase cells that may retain a degree of metabolic activity or used assay conditions with low concentrations of nutrients or supra-physiological concentrations of polymyxins where specificity for LPS is lost due to the amphipathic nature of these antibiotics13,15,32,33,34,35,61. There have also been conflicting studies on the contribution of reactive oxygen species to bactericidal activity of PmB62,63,64,65. Our finding that energy is required for severe OM disruption does not rule out a role for reactive oxygen species, which could arise via LPS synthesis, for example. Finally, while we show surface protrusions, it is unclear whether these are released as vesicles, which has been reported to occur at sub-inhibitory PmB concentrations20,66,67,68,69,70,71. More work is also needed to determine whether PmB-induced vesicles are driven exclusively by antibiotic action on the membrane or part of bacterial stress response. For example, previous work indicated that a trigger of the Sigma E (RpoE) membrane stress response system resulted in increased vesicle production72, and there is evidence that the conjugative plasmid expression (Cpx) and reactive chlorine species (Rcs) systems, which respond to IM and OM stress, respectively, are activated by polymyxin exposure and contribute to bacterial survival73,74,75,76,77. As such, there remains much to understand about how bacteria respond to polymyxin antibiotics and how this influences survival.

Despite the loss of LPS that occurred during PmB exposure, cells remained viable until IM disruption occurred, in agreement with our and others' previous work showing that IM damage is required for lethality25,27,52. Although the OM is an important load-bearing structure, much of the mechanical strength is provided by the porin network, which forms tight associations with LPS78,79,80,81 and which remained largely intact during PmB exposure (Fig. 3a). The mechanical integrity of the porin network may therefore explain how E. coli can tolerate major LPS loss without a reduction in viability38,78.

Intrinsic and some acquired polymyxin resistance is associated with very high levels of lipid A modification with cationic pEtN and/or 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (L-ara4N) moieties, which prevents PmB binding to the OM14,18,20,48. However, MCR-mediated resistance often involves modification of only some of the lipid A in the OM, which likely explains how PmB can bind and sufficiently permeabilize the OM for the ingress of hydrophobic antibiotics such as rifampicin28,39. We found that some OM permeabilization occurred for E. coli mcr-1 but also showed that the MCR-1-mediated lipid A modification prevented PmB-triggered LPS release, which in turn prevented access of the antibiotic to the IM. This, coupled with the protection of the IM via LPS modification27,28, provides distinct layers of protection against PmB.

Minimal media, including M9 used in these studies, have been found to better predict antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria at infection sites than rich laboratory media, which likely reflects the reduced metabolic activity of organisms in vivo1,2,82,83. That said, as M9 does not fully replicate the host environment, further work will be needed to comprehensively understand the relationship between host environment, bacterial metabolism and polymyxin treatment outcomes. For example, one aspect of infection absent in these studies is host immunity. Previous work has shown that polymyxins synergize with complement and the antibacterial histone H2A84,85. PmB has been shown to reduce the pro-inflammatory activity of LPS, which likely modulates the host immune response86.

In summary, this work advances our understanding of the mechanism of action of polymyxin antibiotics by showing that the nature and magnitude of PmB-mediated OM damage is dependent upon the metabolic activity of the cell, which in turns modulates access of the antibiotic to the IM, disruption of which is required for lethality but is not energy dependent (Fig. 6). This work also provides an explanation for how polymyxin tolerance occurs in persister and stationary-phase cells, despite the membrane-disrupting activity of these antibiotics (Fig. 6).

The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (refs. 87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94). E. coli strains expressing mcr-1 or mcr-1* under the control of the arabinose-inducible araBAD (pBAD) promoter were based on those described previously and were transformed with plasmids synthesized by Thermo Fisher48. Unless stated otherwise, all strains were grown in MHB (Millipore) for 18 h at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.) to stationary phase. Where indicated, exponential-phase bacteria were generated by inoculating fresh MHB with 1:1,000 dilution of stationary-phase cells followed by a second growth period of 3 h at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.) For all experimentation, bacteria were washed three times with 1× M9 minimal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4 and 0.1 mM CaCl237 (referred to here as minimal medium, MM). Washed cells were then resuspended in MM ± 0.36% glucose (MM + G) to 108 c.f.u. ml−1. To enumerate bacterial c.f.u., 10-fold serial dilutions were made in PBS and plated onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHB supplemented with 1.5% bacteriological agar). Inoculated agar plates were incubated statically for 18 h in air at 37 °C.

The MIC of PmB, the LpxC inhibitors CHIR-090 and ACHN-975, tetracycline, the MsbA inhibitor G907, novobiocin and murepavadin against indicated bacterial strains was determined according to the well-established broth microdilution method95. In brief, a 96-well microtitre plate was used to prepare a range of antibiotic concentrations in 100 µl of MM + G or cation-adjusted MHB via a series of 2-fold serial dilutions. For antibiotic synergy determination, checkerboard analyses were performed by preparing 2-fold serial dilutions of two antibiotics, with each one across a different axis, generating an 8 × 8 matrix to assess the MICs of each antibiotic when used in combination96. Stationary-phase bacteria were diluted to 1 × 106 c.f.u. ml−1 in MM + G or cation-adjusted MHB and 100 µl used to seed each well of the microtitre plate to give a final inoculation density of 5 × 105 c.f.u. ml−1. Plates were then incubated statically at 37 °C for 18 h in air, at which point the MIC was defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration at which there was no visible growth of bacteria. In some cases, the extent of bacterial growth after incubation was also determined by obtaining measurements of optical density at 595 nm (OD595nm) using a Bio-Rad iMark microplate absorbance reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Following three washes in MM, stationary-phase or exponential-phase bacteria were added at a final concentration of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 to 3 ml of MM, MM + G or MM without cations and supplemented with 10 mM EDTA, containing PmB (4 µg ml−1) when required. This assay was also repeated in the presence of PmB and 1× MIC of a range of different antibiotics (CHIR-090, ACHN-975, tetracycline, G907), as well as in MM supplemented with a selection of equimolar concentrations of either glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, acetate, succinate or glycerol. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.). At each time point (0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min), aliquots were taken, serially diluted 10-fold in PBS and plated to determine bacterial viability by determination of c.f.u. counts.

Bacterial imaging by AFM followed protocols described previously37,38. Briefly, for sample preparation, round glass coverslips of 13 mm diameter were used. They were washed by sonication in 1% w/v SDS for 10 min at 37 kHz and 100% power, then rinsed with MilliQ water and ethanol and dried with a nitrogen gun. Then they were plasma cleaned for 2 min at 70% power. These two procedures were repeated once more. Then coverslips were coated with Vectabond: they were placed in a beaker with a 1:50 ratio of Vectabond solution to acetone (40 ml of acetone and 800 µl Vectabond solution) for 5 min, then rinsed with MilliQ water and dried with a nitrogen gun97. The coverslips were glued to microscope slides with water-soluble glue purchased from Bruker (Reprorubber thin pour, Flexbar). Subsequently, E. coli was cultured to stationary phase (18 h) in MHB, then diluted 1:100 into fresh MHB and incubated to mid-exponential phase. Bacteria were then prepared by centrifuging 3 times at 17,000 × g for 90 s and resuspended in MM or MM + G at an OD600 of 0.5. (MM: 1× M9 salts (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2; MM + G: MM with 0.36% glucose). They were resuspended the fourth time in 100 µl 20 mM HEPES and incubated onto the Vectabond-coated glass coverslips for 5 min. They were then washed off with imaging media (MM or MM + G) to remove unadhered bacteria. SYTOX green nucleic acid stain (at a final concentration of 5 µM) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. We first imaged untreated bacteria in MM or MM + G, then with a pipette this was removed as much as possible and replaced with either PmB, EDTA, PmBN, CHIR-090 or combinations, added in the same way. Scans were subsequently taken after the introduction of the drug.

All experiments were performed in dynamic mode with a Nanowizard III AFM with UltraSpeed head (Bruker AXS), with an Andor Zyla 5.5 USB3 fluorescence camera on an Olympus IX 73 inverted optical microscope. FastScanD cantilevers were used, with a resonant frequency around 110 kHz and a spring constant of 0.25 N m−1. The drive frequency used ranged from 95 to 120 kHz, depending on the cantilever resonance measured by calibration. The setpoint was between 10 and 15 nm (approximately 50% to 70% relative to free amplitude). The whole-cell images were acquired at 2 to 2.5 Hz line frequencies, 2 × 2 µm2, and 512 × 512 or 512 × 256 pixels. Higher-magnification images were acquired over 500 × 500 nm2 and 512 × 512 pixels, recorded at 4 to 5 Hz line frequencies. Images in Fig. 2a were acquired over 200 × 200 nm2 and 512 × 512 pixels recorded at 8 to 10 Hz line frequency. To process the images obtained from AFM the software Gwyddion 2.65 was used (https://gwyddion.net/)98.

The following steps were taken to obtain a post-processed image: (1) level data by mean plane subtraction; (2) level by flattening base; (3) if there were strongly protruding features, apply a mask by selecting features above a 50% threshold, to prevent these from biasing the background correction and row alignment; (3) align rows by second polynomial line-by-line background subtraction (and exclude the masked region if applicable); (4) apply a 1–2 pixel Gaussian filter to the whole image to remove high-frequency noise (remove mask if applicable); and (5) define zero reference and adjust the colour scale to highlight key features.

The E. coli cells were cultured in MHB to stationary phase before bacteria were collected using centrifugation, and the cell pellet was washed three times with M9 medium without glucose. The cells were then diluted to 108 c.f.u. ml−1 in M9 ± glucose with 4 µg ml−1 PmB, and samples were collected at various time points through centrifugation for further analysis. The samples obtained were treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH = 7.3) and were allowed to fix overnight at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were suspended in the 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and subjected to dehydration using ethanol concentrations of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 80% and 100%, with a 10 min incubation at each step. The drying procedure was performed via critical point drying, and a platinum coating of 10 nm thickness was applied after the samples were completely dried. The prepared samples were examined under a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Crossbeam 550 FIB-SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV, and all images were analysed after conversion for differences in magnification. The ImageJ/Fiji software (version 1.53) was used in scanning electron microscope image processing and analysis.

To detect OM damage by PmB, the well-established NPN uptake assay was performed39. The fluorescent probe NPN (Acros Organics), at a final concentration of 10 μM, was added to 100 µl of 2 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 stationary-phase or exponential-phase bacteria in MM, MM + G or MM without cations and supplemented with 10 mM EDTA in a black microtitre plate with clear-bottomed wells (Greiner Bio-One). Relevant concentrations of PmB or PmB in combination with 1× MIC of various antibiotics were added to the wells of the microtitre plate to give a total volume of 200 µl. Fluorescence, at 37 °C with shaking, was measured immediately using a Tecan Infinite 200 pro plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm. Fluorescence measurements were obtained every min for 20 min, and the degree of OM permeabilization, referred to as the NPN uptake factor, was calculated using the following formula:

The resulting NPN uptake factor values were normalized according to OD600nm.

To further assess OM damage by PmB, PerimCherry E. coli was prepared by transforming the pPerimCh plasmid40 into E. coli MG1655. This plasmid encodes a constitutively expressed mCherry construct that accumulates in the periplasm. Stationary-phase bacteria (2 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1) were incubated with PmB in MM or MM + G. At each time point, 200 µl of the culture was centrifuged to separate bacteria and culture medium, and the supernatant was removed and placed in the wells of a black clear-bottomed 96-well plate (Greiner Bio). The fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of 587 nm and an emission wavelength of 610 nm.

To measure IM permeabilization by PmB, the well-established SYTOX green assay was used99. Following washes in MM, stationary-phase bacteria at an inoculum density of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 was added to 3 ml of MM or MM + G containing the relevant antibiotics. The fluorescent probe SYTOX green (Invitrogen) was added to these cultures at a final concentration of 1 µM. Aliquots (200 μl) were transferred to a black microtitre plate with clear-bottomed wells (Greiner Bio-One). Fluorescence and OD600nm were measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (excitation at 535 nm, emission at 617 nm) every 15 min for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking. Raw fluorescence readings were normalized according to OD600nm.

Lipid A was prepared and analysed for modifications by mass spectroscopy as described previously27,28. Briefly, lipid A was detached from carbohydrates via mild acid hydrolysis (2% acetic acid, 100 °C 30 min), washed in H2O, loaded on the target and overlaid with 9H-Pyridol[3,4-B]indole (Norharmane, Sigma-Aldrich) used at 10 mg ml−1 in chloroform to methanol 9:1 and mixed before air drying and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis using a MALDI Biotyper Sirius system (Bruker Daltonics).

The experimental conditions for LPS quantification were the same as those used for the antibiotic time-kill assay. Briefly, 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 of stationary-phase bacteria was added to 3 ml cultures of MM or MM + G in the presence of either PmB, PmB with 1× MIC of various antibiotics, PmBN or EDTA. LPS quantification was also performed in the presence of PmB in MM supplemented with a selection of equimolar concentrations of either glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, acetate, succinate or glycerol. Following 15 min incubation at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.), samples were pelleted at 16,000 × g and washed twice with PBS. Pellets were incubated with 2% SDS and DNAse1 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of 1× sample buffer (4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris, 2% SDS at pH 6.8). The volume of sample buffer was adjusted according to the fold change in OD600nm compared to time point zero to give equal biomass between samples. Next, samples were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. They were then checked to contain equal biomass by separation on a 12% Tris–glycine gel, followed by Coomassie staining. The samples were then incubated with 100 µg ml−1 proteinase K overnight at 55 °C to remove protein and again separated on a 12% Tris–glycine gel. The gel was fixed overnight in a solution of 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid. LPS was then quantified using the Pro-Q Emerald 300 Lipopolysaccharide Gel Stain Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Densitometric analysis was performed using Fiji ImageJ with the resulting values used to interpolate the standard curve performed in Supplementary Fig. 8c, to calculate relative LPS abundance. Undigested total protein samples served as loading controls.

GroEL and OmpF were detected by western blotting of total bacterial protein samples, obtained as described above for detection of LPS by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), using the following primary antibodies: Monoclonal anti-GroEL antibodies were obtained from Abcam (clone, EPR28718-8; catalogue number AB318970, lot number 1096886-3) and used at 1:2,000 dilution; polyclonal Anti-OmpF antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen (catalogue number PAS-121442, lot number 2K4557550) and used at 1:5,000 dilution. Bound primary antibodies were detected using polyclonal Goat Anti-Rabbit HRP conjugated (catalogue number AB6721, lot number GR342221), used at a 1:2,000 dilution, and ECL western blotting detection reagent (Amersham, RPN, 2106).

This protocol was provided by R. Hancock (https://cmdr.ubc.ca/bobh/method/kdo-assay/). Briefly, 50 µl of supernatant (generated from 15 min incubation of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 of stationary-phase bacteria in MM ± glucose, and ±4 µg ml−1) was boiled in 50 µl 0.5 N H2SO4 for 15 min, followed by the sequential addition of 200 µl arsenite reagent (0.3 µM NaAsO2 dissolved in 0.5 N HCl) and 800 µl 42 mM 2-thiobarbituric acid. The solution was boiled for a further 10 min before the addition of 1.5 ml butanol reagent (5.0 ml of concentrated HCl added to 95 ml n-butanol). The butanol layer was separated from the solution by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,500 × g. The Kdo (3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid) extinction coefficient (OD552nm − OD509nm) was calculated by measuring 200 µl for absorbance at OD552nm and OD509nm in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader. The difference in OD was used to interpolate a standard curve generated by performing Kdo analysis on a 1/10 serial dilution of 5 mg ml−1 of purified rough LPS (Supplementary Fig. 8a).

To quantify ATP levels of stationary-phase bacteria in different carbon sources conditions, an ATP standard curve was first generated using the BacTiter-Glo (Promega) kit. A 10-fold serial dilution series of ATP was performed in MM over a concentration range of 1,000 to 0.01 nM in a white microtitre plate (Greiner Bio-One). The BacTiter-Glo buffer was added to the substrate to make the BacTiter-Glo substrate. This substrate was combined with the dilution series, and luminescence was measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader using a 100 ms integration time. Following this, stationary-phase bacteria at an inoculum density of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 was added to MM or MM containing a range of equimolar concentrations of different carbon sources. At each time point (0, 15 and 30 min), 100 µl of the culture was combined with 100 µl of the substrate in a white microtitre plate, and luminescence was measured. ATP concentrations under these different conditions were interpolated from the standard curve.

Following three washes in MM, stationary-phase bacteria were added at a final concentration of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 to 3 ml of MM ± glucose and ±4 µg ml−1 PmB, in the presence of 10 µg ml−1 BODIPY FL Vancomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by three washes in PBS to remove unbound BODIPY FL Vancomycin. Cultures were resuspended in 3 ml PBS and 200 µl added to a black clear-bottomed 96-well plate (Greiner Bio). Fluorescence and OD600nm were measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (excitation at 480 nm, emission at 520 nm). Raw fluorescence readings were normalized according to OD600nm.

Experiments were performed on at least three independent occasions, and the resulting data are presented as the arithmetic mean of these biological repeats unless stated otherwise. Error bars, where shown, represent the standard deviation of the mean unless otherwise stated. For single comparisons, a two-tailed Student's t-test was used to analyse the data. For multiple comparisons at a single time point or concentration, data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal–Wallis test. Where data were obtained at several different time points or concentrations, two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. Appropriate post hoc tests (Dunnett's, Tukey's, Sidak's, Dunn's) were carried out to correct for multiple comparisons, with details provided in the figure legends. Asterisks on graphs indicate significant differences between data. Precise P values for all comparisons are provided in the source data files. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software).

Where images are shown for example gels, blots or AFM, these are representative examples of at least three replicates, unless otherwise stated.

a, Visual representation of the set-up for all microbiological assays. E. coli MG1655 was grown in 3 ml of MHB for 16 h at 37oC 180 r.p.m. to stationary phase. The culture was washed three times in MM and resuspended at an inoculum density of 1×108 in 3 ml of MM or MM + G. To test exponential phase E. coli, the overnight culture was diluted 1/1000 in fresh MHB and grown for a further 3 h. b, Survival of stationary phase E. coli exposed to 4 µg ml−1 PmB from t = 0 in the presence of a 1/10 dilution series of 0.36% glucose. A 1/100 dilution of 0.36% glucose supported PmB killing, however, a 1/1000 dilution substantially reduced the rate and degree of PmB killing. c, Survival of stationary phase E. coli exposed to 4 µg ml−1 PmB from t = 0 in MM + G or MM with an equimolar concentration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, as determined by CFU counts. All experiments were replicated in n = 3 independent assays. Error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Significant differences were determined by two-way repeated measures ANOVA. P= *<0.05, ***<0.001.

Source data

Exponential (Exp) or – (Stat) E. coli cells were exposed to PmB (4 µg ml−1) in MM ± glucose and samples taken at the indicated time points. In keeping with the data from AFM studies, stationary phase cells exposed to PmB in the presence of glucose began to show surface protrusions from ~30 min, which increased over time. Conversely, stationary phase cells exposed to the polymyxin without glucose showed minimal to no surface protrusions. PmB triggered surface protrusions in exponential phase cells whether glucose was present or not. Images for stationary phase cells at 120 min are shown again in an enlarged image to highlight differences in surface appearance. Scale bar represents 400 nm (N = 1).

The peak at ~1800 m/z corresponds to native hexa-acyl diphosphoryl lipid A containing four C14:0 3-OH, one C14:0 and one C12:0100. The peaks at ~1710 and ~1800 m/z correspond to the subtraction or addition of phosphate to the native form of lipid A. b, Overlaid mass spectra of stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM + G (black) and stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM + G exposed to 4 µg mL−1 PmB (red), indicating a substantial reduction in native lipid A.

a, Combined brightfield and fluorescence (SYTOX) images of the AFM scan region for the experiments in Fig. 1b with exponential (Exp) and stationary (Stat) phase E. coli at 90 min post PmB treatment (the circled cells are those chosen for the image sequences shown here and were all SYTOX-positive by 90 mins, except for stationary phase E. coli in MM). b, Higher-magnification AFM height and phase scans of stationary phase E. coli. The surface of untreated cells is covered in a network of pores, here best visible in the phase images. The resolution of pores (trimeric OMPs) is ultimately compromised by the progressive roughening of the OM after PmB is added in the presence of glucose (MM + G). In MM + G, PmB caused disruption to the OM in the form of protrusions. Without glucose the appearance of the OM at the nanoscale did not change. Scalebars: a, 4 µm, b, 100 nm; height scales (scale inset in first row of image at t = 90 min): 20 nm; phase scale: 2 deg (row 2) and 1 deg (row 4). c, Quantification of protrusion height (left) and OM mean roughness (right). Protrusion height data are presented as the mean ± SD of median values of the height of features above 50% of the maximum height of each image. Mean roughness values were computed by Gwyddion and data are presented as the mean ± SD. Measurements were taken from 3 different 500 nm scans of 3 different E. coli MG1655 cells imaged in separate experiments.

Previous work has shown that the antibiotic novobiocin promotes the rate of LPS transport from IM to OM via an interaction with LptB41. In turn, this leads to increased susceptibility to polymyxin B, although the mechanism was not established42. Based on the findings described in this manuscript, we hypothesised that increased LPS transport to the OM would promote PmB-mediated LPS loss, which correlates with bacterial killing by the antibiotic. a, b, Checkerboard broth microdilution assay showing the synergistic growth-inhibitory interaction between novobiocin and PmB (a), or PmBN (b) against E. coli, as determined OD595nm after 18 hr incubation and in line with previous findings42. Note: PmBN is an inactive polymyxin analogue that served as a useful control for increased entry of novobiocin caused by OM disruption. (c, d) Survival of E. coli exposed, or not, to 1 µg ml−1 PmB (c) or 1 µg ml−1 PmBN (d) with or without 32 µg ml−1 novobiocin. These concentrations were chosen because they showed maximal synergy in the PmBN checkerboard assay. For (c), there was no killing of E. coli by the polymyxin or novobiocin alone, but a significant reduction in the viability of E. coli in the presence of both antibiotics. By contrast, there was no reduction in bacterial viability in the presence of PmBN with novobiocin. Therefore, bacterial killing in these assays appears to be PmB-mediated, rather than increased ingress of novobiocin into cells caused by OM disruption. e, f, Combined OM and IM disruption of stationary phase E. coli exposed to 1 µg ml−1 PmB (e) or 1 µg ml−1 PmBN (f) in MHB with and without 32 µg ml−1 novobiocin, as determined by uptake of the fluorescent dye SYTOX green. Crucially, in the presence of PmBN, novobiocin did not cause membrane disruption, even at concentrations well above those required to inhibit growth in the checkerboard assay. However, novobiocin promoted PmB-mediated membrane disruption in a dose-responsive manner, confirming that novobiocin promotes the activity of PmB by increasing IM disruption, which is the key step for lethality27,42. Next, we wanted to examine the impact of novobiocin on PmB-mediated LPS loss. (g) Representative SDS-PAGE image of LPS band intensity of stationary phase E. coli exposed, or not, to 1 µg ml−1 PmB with and without 32 µg/ml novobiocin for 15 min in MHB. (h) Densitometric analysis of the LPS gel in (g), showing that PmB or novobiocin exposure alone at 1 µg ml−1 or 32 µg ml−1 respectively, had minimal impact on LPS abundance after 15 mins incubation (N = 4). However, there was a significant drop in LPS levels when PmB and novobiocin were used in combination at these concentrations. Therefore, we concluded that novobiocin enhances PmB activity by promoting LPS loss, most likely via its reported effect on increasing LPS transport from the IM to OM41,42. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were replicated in n = 3 independent assays. Error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Significant differences were determined by one- (h) or two-way repeated measures ANOVA (c, d, e, f). P= *<0.05, **<0.01, ***<0.001, ****<0.0001, ns=not significant.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects over half a billion people worldwide. Current pharmacologic treatments offer limited efficacy and carry substantial risks, warranting the development of safe and effective alternatives. This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of VER-01 in CLBP. It enrolled 820 adults with CLBP (VER-01, n = 394; placebo, n = 426) and included a double-blind 12-week treatment phase (phase A), a 6-month open-label extension (phase B), followed by either a 6-month continuation (phase C) or randomized withdrawal (phase D). The primary endpoint of phase A was a change in mean numeric rating scale (NRS) pain intensity, with a change in total neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI) score as a key secondary endpoint in participants with a neuropathic pain component (PainDETECT > 18). The primary endpoint for phase D was time to treatment failure. The study met its primary endpoint in phase A, with a mean pain reduction of −1.9 NRS points in the VER-01 group (mean difference (MD) versus placebo = −0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.9 to −0.3; P < 0.001). Pain further decreased to −2.9 NRS points in phase B, with effects sustained through phase C. The study also met its key secondary endpoint of phase A, with a mean NPSI decrease of −14.4 (standard error, 3.3) points from baseline in the VER-01 arm (MD versus placebo = −7.3, 95% CI = −13.2 to −1.3; P = 0.017). Although phase D did not meet its primary endpoint (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.44–1.27; P = 0.288), pain increased significantly more with placebo upon withdrawal (MD = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.0–1.0; P = 0.034). In phase A, the incidence of adverse events—mostly mild to moderate and transient—was higher with VER-01 than with placebo (83.3% versus 67.3%; P < 0.001). VER-01 was well-tolerated, with no signs of dependence or withdrawal. VER-01 shows potential as a new, safe and effective treatment for CLBP. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04940741.

With over half a billion prevalent cases in 2020, low back pain is globally the leading cause for work loss, disability and reduced quality of life across all ages and in both sexes1,2. Low back pain is a mixed pain condition with nociceptive, nociplastic and neuropathic pain characteristics3. When pain persists for more than 3 months, it is defined as chronic low back pain (CLBP). CLBP is often associated with severe impairments in sleep quality and physical function, which further contribute to the overall disease burden4,5. The treatment of CLBP involves a multimodal treatment approach combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, the latter including physical activity, exercise and physiotherapy6,7,8,9,10.

Pharmacological treatment options include the short-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, NSAIDs are not suitable for long-term treatment due to severe side effects, including gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding and an increased risk for cardiovascular events11,12. For patients requiring long-term analgesic treatment, opioids are frequently used, despite severe side effects and safety concerns. Approximately 20% of patients on long-term therapy experience opioid abuse, dependence, tolerance development and withdrawal symptoms13. The widespread use of opioids for CLBP combined with their high risk for dependence, misuse and fatal overdoses has substantially contributed to the global opioid epidemic, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide14,15. Accordingly, several clinical practice guidelines now advise against the use of opioids6,7, and there is widespread consensus among healthcare professionals, patient organizations and regulators on the urgent need to develop new nonaddictive analgesics for the short- and long-term treatment of CLBP with a superior safety profile. The limitations of existing treatments and the stagnation in the development of new analgesics have fueled growing public and scientific interest in the use of cannabis-based medicines for the management of chronic pain. However, the quality of evidence supporting the clinical use of cannabis-based products remains low, primarily due to small sample sizes, short treatment durations, inconsistent dosing regimens, heterogeneous outcome measures and variability across cannabis-based preparations16,17,18,19.

As naturally occurring botanical substances, cannabis plants exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Variability in the botanical raw material and manufacturing processes contributes to a substantial variety of product compositions, including levels of bioactive constituents20,21. Consequently, findings obtained with one cannabis extract cannot be extrapolated to others without appropriate comparative data. To ensure reproducible results, it is therefore essential to adequately characterize the investigational product and establish consistency across batches.

The investigational product VER-01 was comprehensively characterized using chromatographic and spectrometric methods to quantify cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, carotenes, phytosterols, vitamins and fats, and chromatographic fingerprinting confirmed batch-to-batch consistency across multiple lots of VER-01. By providing a large-scale, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of adequate duration using a chemically well-defined, full-spectrum cannabis extract in CLBP, this study addresses a critical gap in the clinical research of cannabis-based pharmacotherapy in chronic pain.

Between 7 July 2021 and 30 June 2023, 1,157 patients were assessed for eligibility and 820 participants were randomly assigned to VER-01 (n = 394) or placebo (n = 426; Fig. 1). A total of 525 participants continued to phase B, 155 continued to phase C and 116 participants were randomly assigned to VER-01 (n = 52) or placebo (n = 64) in phase D (Figs. 1 and 2). A total of 815 participants were included in the efficacy analysis of phase A, whereas 116 participants were included in that of phase D. The last visit of the study was on 26 March 2024.

The efficacy, safety and tolerability analyses included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study medication during the respective study phase.

Overall, the two groups in phase A were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics (Table 1). A total of 180 participants (22.0%) had a neuropathic pain component, and 193 (23.5%) were suffering from severe pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) ≥ 7) at baseline. A total of 461 participants (56.6%) were female, with a mean age of 52 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 29 kg m−2, showing no notable differences between the two groups. Baseline characteristics of participants with a neuropathic pain component were consistent across both treatment groups and matched those of all participants. Additionally, the demographics and baseline characteristics of participants in phases B, C and D were similar to those in phase A (Extended Data Tables 1–3). The most frequent concurrent diseases were hypertension (35.3%) and obesity (32.0%). In total, 99% of patients reported prior use of analgesics, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs being the most frequently reported medication (96.7%). The proportion of participants with at least two prior optimized analgesic therapies was balanced between arms, with 95.4% in the VER-01 arm and 94.8% in the placebo arm.

Pain intensity at baseline was moderate to severe in both groups, with a mean NRS pain intensity of 6.1 (s.d. = 1.2) for VER-01 and 6.0 (s.d. = 1.2) for placebo.

The study met its primary endpoint in phase A. Mean pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline by −1.9 (s.e. = 0.2) NRS points in the VER-01 arm compared to −1.4 (s.e. = 0.2) in the placebo arm. VER-01 demonstrated a greater pain reduction compared to placebo with a mean difference (MD) of −0.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.9 to −0.3; P < 0.001). The difference between VER-01 and placebo was significantly in favor of VER-01 in every single study week of the 12-week treatment phase, showing consistent improvement over time (Fig. 3a). Sensitivity analyses using both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) imputation yielded similar results to the primary analysis and remained statistically significant (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Post hoc analysis revealed no statistical interaction between treatment and sex (Supplementary Table 4).

The difference between VER-01 and placebo was even more pronounced in participants with a neuropathic pain component (MD = −1.5, 95% CI = −2.2 to −0.9; P < 0.001). Moreover, post hoc analyses revealed particularly pronounced effects of VER-01 in participants with severe pain (MD = −1.0, 95% CI = −1.8 to −0.1; P = 0.011).

The study also met its key secondary endpoint in phase A, with significant improvements in neuropathic symptoms (as measured by the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)) among participants with a PainDETECT score >18 at baseline. The mean NPSI total scores at baseline were comparable between groups, with 47.1 (s.d. = 17.2) for VER-01 and 48.7 (s.d. = 16.4) for placebo. The mean NPSI total score decreased by −14.4 (s.e. = 3.3) points from baseline in the VER-01 arm compared to −7.2 (s.e. = 2.8) in the placebo arm, with an MD of −7.3 (95% CI = −13.2 to −1.3; P = 0.017). The difference between VER-01 and placebo was significantly in favor of VER-01 for every single visit of the treatment phase, showing consistent improvement over time (Fig. 3b). Compared to placebo, VER-01 reduced superficial spontaneous pain (MD = −1.3, 95% CI = −2.4 to −0.3; P = 0.015), deep spontaneous pain (MD = −1.2, 95% CI = −2.2 to −0.3; P = 0.001), evoked pain (MD = −1.14, 95% CI = −1.9 to −0.4; P = 0.003) and abnormal sensations (MD = −1.29, 95% CI = −2.2 to −0.4; P = 0.006).

The results of the primary and key secondary endpoints were further supported by all secondary efficacy endpoints (Table 2). The rate of participants with a ≥30% pain reduction was significantly higher for VER-01 compared to placebo (54.1% versus 39.5%), resulting in a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 6.8 (95% CI = 4.42–15.05; P < 0.001). Similarly, the rate of participants with a ≥50% pain reduction (32.2% versus 22.8%; P = 0.010) and a ≥2-point pain reduction (46.9% versus 35.6%; P = 0.001) was significantly higher in the VER-01 arm. Moreover, participants in the VER-01 arm took only about half the amount of rescue medication compared to participants in the placebo arm (mean (s.d.) = 10.5 (14.2) versus 18.3 (53.8) ibuprofen tablets; P < 0.001).

Additionally, participants in the VER-01 group reported significant improvements in both sleep quality and physical function. Sleep quality improved by −2.2 NRS points in the VER-01 arm compared to −1.5 in the placebo arm, with an MD of −0.7 NRS points (95% CI, −1.0 to −0.3; P < 0.001). Change from baseline (CFB) in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) total score was also significantly in favor of VER-01, with −3.1 (4.0) versus −2.0 (4.1) points (MD = −1.1, 95% CI = −1.8 to −1.1; P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that 51.7% of participants in the VER-01 arm achieved an improvement of the RMDQ score by at least 30% from baseline compared to 42.2% in the placebo arm (P = 0.019).

Improvements in pain intensity, sleep quality and physical function were associated with elevated quality of life and a positive global impression of change. The physical health component summary (PCS) score of the short-form 36 (SF-36) improved by 5.9 points in the VER-01 arm compared to 3.7 in the placebo arm, with an MD of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.0–3.2; P < 0.001). In total, 45.1% of participants in the VER-01 group reported an improvement in symptoms on the patient global impression of change (PGIC) scale compared to 23.4% in the placebo group, resulting in an NNTB of 4.6 (95% CI = 3.43–6.99; P < 0.001).

Participants experienced further reductions in NRS pain intensity during the 6-month treatment period of phase B, with a decrease of 3 points compared to the phase A baseline (s.d. = 2.1; Fig. 3a). The percentage of participants experiencing a ≥30% reduction in pain further increased to 73.9%, while the percentage for those achieving a ≥50% pain reduction increased to 51.8%. In addition, participants reported further improvements in physical function, sleep quality and quality of life (Extended Data Table 4). Participants who completed phase B and participated in phase C were able to maintain their pain reduction over an additional 6-month period (Supplementary Fig. 1). There were no signs of diminishing efficacy or dose escalation over time (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Tables 5–8).

Time to treatment failure did not differ significantly between VER-01 and placebo in phase D (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.44–1.27; P = 0.288), with median times of 22 days for VER-01 and 11 days for placebo. However, following withdrawal, participants receiving placebo experienced a significant pain increase from the phase D baseline compared to VER-01 (MD = 0.5, s.d. = 0.24; P = 0.034; Fig. 3d).

In phase A, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 83.3% of participants in the VER-01 group, compared to 67.3% in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) was comparable between VER-01 and placebo (6.2% versus 6.8%; P = 0.699; Table 3). The most common TEAEs (≥10% of participants in the VER-01 arm) were dizziness, headache, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, nausea, COVID-19, dry mouth and somnolence (Table 3). Rates of headache (VER-01 = 15.9% versus placebo = 12.5%; P = 0.160), nasopharyngitis (11.0% versus 14.8%; P = 0.107) and COVID-19 (11.0% versus 8.5%; P = 0.218) were similar between the groups, whereas dizziness (42.8% versus 5.2%), fatigue (15.1% versus 5.2%), nausea (16.4% versus 3.8%), dry mouth (13.1% versus 3.8%) and somnolence (11.8% versus 0.7%) were more frequent with VER-01 (P < 0.001 for all). Most TEAEs for VER-01 were of mild-to-moderate intensity (94%). The incidence of drug-related TEAEs decreased over the course of the treatment period of phase A, converging toward a weekly incidence below 3% (Supplementary Table 8). Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 17.3% of participants receiving VER-01, compared to 3.5% in the placebo (P < 0.001), most commonly due to dizziness, somnolence and nausea. Statistical comparisons of adverse event (AE) incidences were conducted post hoc.

No deaths occurred during the study, and no clinically important treatment-related changes were observed for VER-01 in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs or electrocardiograms (ECGs) when compared to placebo or throughout the study.

At the end of phase A, 68% of participants were satisfied with the tolerability of the treatment in the VER-01 arm compared to 79% in the placebo arm. Satisfaction with tolerability further increased during open-label, long-term treatment, reaching 83% at the end of phase B and 84% at the end of phase C.

No AEs indicative of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal, as classified under the respective standardized MedDRA queries, were reported (Supplementary Tables 5 and 9). Furthermore, there were no signs of drug abuse based on urine drug tests and the addiction behavior checklist (ABC), and no participant fulfilled the classification criteria for substance dependence according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). There were no withdrawal symptoms as measured with the cannabis withdrawal scale (CWS) after abrupt treatment discontinuation in phase D. The daily total intensity score and daily total functional impairment score of the CWS were comparable between VER-01 and placebo) Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). A pooled analysis of TEAEs for all study phases is provided in Supplementary Tables 5–7.

The results of the VER-CLBP-001 trial demonstrate that VER-01 provides meaningful pain reduction compared to the placebo, accompanied by distinct improvements in physical function and sleep quality, two key factors that contribute to participants perceiving the effects of VER-01 as clinically meaningful. Additionally, participants in the VER-01 arm required substantially lower rescue medication use less rescue medication. These results are of high clinical relevance, as substantiated by a significantly higher proportion of participants randomized to VER-01 achieving well-recognized thresholds of meaningful pain relief, including a ≥30% and ≥50% pain reduction, as well as a ≥2-point decrease on the 11-point NRS22,23.

Notably, the NNTB for achieving a ≥30% pain response was 6.8, substantially below the widely accepted clinical relevance threshold of NNTB ≤10 in pain research and below the NNTB = 9 achieved with opioids in CLBP24,25,26. Moreover, significantly more participants in the VER-01 group reported a meaningful improvement in symptoms on the PGIC scale compared to the placebo group, an important indicator of the clinical relevance of treatment effects as recognized by the European Medicines Agency guideline on pain27.

Importantly, prolonged treatment with VER-01 was associated with further reductions in pain intensity, as well as continued improvements in physical function, sleep quality and health-related quality of life. Notably, the treatment effect was even more pronounced in participants with a neuropathic pain component and those with severe pain at baseline.

VER-01 was generally well-tolerated, particularly during long-term use. AEs, including those leading to early discontinuation in the VER-01 arm, were predominantly mild to moderate, with an overall intensity comparable to placebo. Most AEs associated with VER-01 were observed during the initial titration phase, were self-limiting and declined markedly within the first few days of treatment, suggesting a rapid onset of sustained tolerability. With 17%, the rate of AE-related discontinuations was higher than with placebo but below those reported for opioids in comparable study designs, with early discontinuations mainly seen in the titration phase28,29,30. Nature and timing of AE-related discontinuations suggest that physicians should advise patients that transient sensations of dizziness, somnolence and nausea may occur in the early titration phase to support treatment adherence. The overall rate of SAEs was comparable to placebo, and there were no signs of dose escalation, abuse, dependence or withdrawal.

These results are particularly relevant given the substantial unmet medical need in CLBP, where many patients remain inadequately treated due to the inherent limitations of current pharmacological options, primarily NSAIDs and opioids. NSAIDs are unsuitable for long-term use due to severe gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks11,12, while opioids are associated with a high risk of addiction, tolerance development, withdrawal symptoms and have a major role in the global opioid crisis13,14,15,31. Against this background, VER-01 presents a promising new nonaddictive, safe and effective treatment option, particularly for long-term use.

Another important advantage of VER-01 over existing pharmacotherapies is its ability to significantly improve sleep quality and physical function. Chronic pain, particularly CLBP, is often associated with severe impairments in these domains, which not only diminish quality of life but also contribute to persistent pain and disease progression. Physical disability in CLBP is perpetuated by a vicious cycle of pain, stiffness and fear of movement, leading to progressive functional decline and reduced mobility32. Without effective intervention, this cycle reinforces long-term disability and further limits treatment success. Likewise, sleep disturbances are not merely a secondary symptom of pain but a key contributor to disease progression. Poor sleep exacerbates inflammation, reduces pain tolerance and leads to greater pain severity and prolonged pain duration. As a result, patients with disrupted sleep often experience greater disability, more persistent pain and a higher prevalence of comorbid depression33,34. Given these interdependent factors, addressing not only pain but also improving physical function and sleep quality is essential for the effective management of CLBP. Recent meta-analyses have shown that existing pharmacotherapies, including NSAIDs and opioids, have only a small and unlikely clinically relevant effect in these domains, highlighting a major gap in current treatment options35,36. By demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements not only in pain but also in physical function and sleep quality, VER-01 represents a promising therapeutic advance that directly targets the multifaceted burden of CLBP.

Notably, there remains a lack of rigorously designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of standardized cannabis-based products in well-defined pain conditions, with well-defined dosing regimens and sufficiently long treatment durations. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial addresses these gaps and contributes valuable evidence to the field, underscoring the importance of advancing the clinical understanding and therapeutic potential of full-spectrum cannabis extracts.

Some limitations of this study merit consideration. First, VER-01 was not directly compared with opioids; however, a dedicated follow-up study, evaluating VER-01 against standard opioid therapy, has already been conducted and will be published separately37. Second, a formal blinding questionnaire was not administered and prior cannabis experience was not recorded, but multiple indicators support successful blinding—the magnitude of the placebo response closely mirrors that observed in other blinded, randomized, controlled CLBP trials28,29, and both treatment arms exhibited a similar, rapid NRS pain decline during the titration period. Furthermore, the nature of AEs was similar between groups, and no instances of unintentional unblinding were reported. Another limitation is that cognitive function was not formally assessed. Although there were no patient reports indicative of impairment, future studies involving cannabinoids might consider incorporating specific cognitive assessments.

Finally, while the difference in time to treatment failure in phase D did not reach statistical significance, the observed trend strongly favors VER-01 with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (P = 0.288). The use of time to treatment failure as the primary endpoint to assess maintenance of efficacy represented a novel approach in CLBP, which led to uncertainty in estimating an appropriate sample size. However, the magnitude and direction of the effect, as well as the significantly larger pain increase among patients receiving placebo following withdrawal (MD = 0.5; P = 0.034), suggest that the lack of statistical significance in phase D reflects insufficient power rather than waning efficacy.

In conclusion, this phase 3 study provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of VER-01 in the treatment of CLBP. These findings highlight the importance of further research with VER-01 in other chronic pain conditions and suggest that VER-01 could play an important role in modern pain management.

This trial investigated the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of VER-01, following the recommendations of the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration pain guidelines27,38. The trial was divided into four phases (Fig. 2). Phase A had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with 1 week of run-in to assess baseline pain intensity, followed by 3 weeks of titration and 12 weeks of treatment. Phase B followed phase A and had a single-arm, open-label design with a 3-week titration period and a 6-month treatment period. All participants entering phase B underwent retitration, as blinding was maintained for phase A throughout the entire study. Participants completing phase B entered either phase C or D. Phase C had a single-arm, open-label design with a 6-month treatment period. Phase D had a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design with 4 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks of washout. The trial was conducted at 66 outpatient sites and university-based hospitals in Germany and Austria in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization and applicable regulatory requirements. The trial was approved by ethics committees in each country (Supplementary Table 15), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. No compensation was offered for participation in the study, except for reimbursement of meals and travel expenses. The trial was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04940741) and EudraCT (2020-000107-36).

Patients were primarily recruited via notices in doctors' offices, adverts in magazines and online advertising. Additionally, investigators participating in the study recruited patients from their existing databases. This study enrolled individuals who were at least 18 years of age and diagnosed with CLBP (low back pain for at least 3 months), with or without a neuropathic pain component. Individuals were only included if no treatable specific somatic cause for their CLBP was identified (for example, herniated vertebral disk) based on a detailed medical history assessment and a clinical examination. The presence of a neuropathic pain component at baseline was confirmed using the painDETECT questionnaire with a cut-off score >18 (ref. 39). Eligible individuals must have had, on average, a pain score of at least 4 points on an 11-point NRS 1 month before enrollment and during the run-in period. Individuals were eligible if drug treatment was indicated and previous optimized treatments with nonopioid analgesics (for example, ibuprofen, diclofenac and metamizol) did not lead to sufficient pain relief or were unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance. Treatment was considered optimized when further dose escalation was medically inadvisable due to potential adverse effects or when it was unlikely that a higher dose would offer additional therapeutic benefit.

Participants were allowed to continue nondrug therapies for CLBP if these were maintained unchanged for at least 8 weeks before enrollment and if patients were willing to continue their therapy during phase A.

Participants were eligible for inclusion into phase B if they had successfully completed phase A. Participants completing phase B were eligible for inclusion in phase D if they had a clinically meaningful reduction in NRS pain scores (≥30%) at the end of phase B compared to baseline of phase A. Participants not meeting inclusion criteria for phase D were eligible for enrollment in phase C.

Participants were excluded if they had other painful comorbidities potentially interfering with their low back pain rating, a severe mental illness (for example, psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), or a history of alcohol, drug or medication abuse. Moreover, participants who had used cannabis-based medicinal products within 30 days before screening were excluded. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Note—Eligibility criteria.

The investigational product VER-01 is a standardized full-spectrum extract derived from the patented Cannabis sativa L. strain DKJ127. The botanical raw material of VER-01 consists of the unfragmented, dried C. sativa DKJ127 L. flowers. The full-spectrum extract of the botanical raw material is manufactured in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified facility and standardized to 5% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

Each dose unit (119 µl) of the finished product VER-01 contains 50 µl of the full-spectrum extract, delivering 2.5 mg THC, 0.1 mg cannabigerol and 0.02 mg cannabidiol, with sesame oil as excipient.

Moreover, VER-01 contains a complex, well-characterized mixture of terpenes, flavonoids, carotenes, phytosterols and other bioactive compounds.

The placebo contained sesame oil, cannabis aroma and colorants to mimic the appearance and sensory characteristics of VER-01.

The study products were provided in 30 ml amber glass bottles and taken orally with a dosing syringe, following the European Pain Federation recommendations, which advocate for oral preparations in the management of chronic pain40.

The study included two randomizations, conducted at the beginning of phases A and D. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to VER-01 or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a neuropathic pain component. Participants, investigators and study site personnel were masked to treatment assignment. VER-01 and the matching placebo were dispensed in identical amber glass bottles.

Randomization took place in blocks of four, using a computer-generated randomization list. The size of the randomization blocks was not disclosed to the investigators.

At the screening visit, participants were provided with an eDiary and instructed on its use. Most assessments were recorded daily in the eDiary, while others were recorded on paper at the trial site and subsequently transferred to the electronic data capture system by site personnel. At visit A2, eligible participants were randomized. Participants were advised to take the study drug either consistently with or without food. The participants' individual optimal dose (both VER-01 and placebo) was determined during a 3-week titration period, following a written titration scheme. Provided that the study product was well-tolerated, the dose was increased every 3 days by one dose unit in the morning and one dose unit in the evening until the participant either experienced sufficient symptom relief or reached the maximum daily dose of 13 dose units. The morning and evening doses were adjusted independently.

Intake of analgesics other than rescue medication was prohibited during phase A, the last 3 weeks of phase B and phase D. The use of rescue medication (ibuprofen) was restricted to a maximum of 3 days per week and a daily dose of 2,400 mg. In case ibuprofen was contraindicated, paracetamol was offered at a maximum daily dose of 4,000 mg. Participants were not allowed to initiate a nondrug therapy during phase A, nor during the last 9 weeks preceding inclusion into phase D. If an ongoing nondrug therapy was already in place, it had to be continued unchanged throughout participation in phases A and D.

Participants used the eDiary to record their dosage, pain intensity (11-point NRS), sleep quality (11-point NRS) and use of rescue medication throughout all study phases. Additionally, participants used the eDiary to record potential withdrawal symptoms during phase D, using the CWS.

Phase A included six visits (Fig. 2)—screening (A1), randomization (A2), end of titration (A3) and three visits at 4-week intervals during the treatment phase (A4–A6). Phase B comprised four visits—one at the end of titration (B7) and three visits at 2-month intervals during the treatment phase (B8—B10). Phase C consisted of three visits at 2-month intervals during the treatment phase (C11–C13) and a follow-up visit (C14). Phase D involved two visits—one at the end of treatment (D11) and a follow-up visit (D12).

Safety assessments included AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, urine drug screens, pregnancy testing, 24-h ECG assessments (for a subset of 120 participants) and evaluation of substance dependence according to ICD-10 (F12.2) criteria. Investigators assessed the severity and causality of AEs, documenting onset, duration, seriousness and any actions or treatments taken.

A full schedule of assessments is provided in the attached protocol.

The primary endpoint in phase A was the CFB (week −1) to week 15 in the mean weekly pain intensity in the morning, measured on an 11-point NRS (0 = ‘no pain' and 10 = ‘worst pain imaginable'). The key secondary endpoint in phase A was the CFB in the NPSI total score at the end of phase A (visit A6) for participants with a neuropathic pain component. The NPSI includes ten items measuring the severity of spontaneous pain (four items), painful attacks (three items), provoked pain (two items) and abnormal sensations (one item)41. Each item was scored on an 11-point NRS. The total score ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (worst imaginable symptoms).

No primary endpoint was defined for the open-label study phases B and C. The primary endpoint of phase D was the time to treatment failure, defined as an increase in the 7-day mean of NRS morning pain intensity by ≥20% and ≥1 point compared to the phase D baseline week 44.

Across all study phases, the proportion of participants achieving ≥30% and ≥50% pain reduction was evaluated, reflecting outcomes widely considered clinically meaningful22,23,42.

Additional diary-based secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in all study phases included change in mean pain intensity (11-point NRS), intake of rescue medication, sleep quality on an 11-point NRS (0 = ‘not impacted'; 10 = ‘completely impacted') and the proportion of participants with ≥30% and ≥50% sleep quality improvement.

Visit-based secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in all study phases included CFB in NPSI total scores, PGIC on a seven-point Likert scale using the question ‘How is your low back pain in comparison to before participation in the study?' (0 = ‘very much better' to 6 = ‘very much worse') and quality of life evaluated with the short-form health survey 36v2 (SF-36)43,44. The SF-36 contains 36 questions about physical and mental well-being and was evaluated based on eight domain scores (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health), which were summarized to form two higher-ordered component summary measures (PCS and the mental health component summary). The scores ranged from 0 (maximum disability) to 100 (no disability).

The following visit-based secondary efficacy endpoints were additionally assessed in study phase A: the degree of disability was evaluated with the RMDQ at baseline and end of treatment45. The RMDQ is a 24-item questionnaire that assesses the impact of low back pain on functional activities, with scores ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicate greater disability. In addition, sleep quality was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), which consists of 12 items that assess perceived initiation and maintenance of sleep, respiratory problems during sleep, sleep duration, perceived adequacy of sleep and daytime somnolence46. The evaluation of the MOS-SS was based on two sleep problem indices. Higher sleep scores indicate a clinically favorable outcome.

Safety was assessed based on the incidence of AEs, including their seriousness, severity and relationship to the study drug. Additionally, patients' satisfaction with tolerability was evaluated on a visit-by-visit basis using a five-point Likert scale. Substance dependence and abuse potential were measured visit-based with the ABC, a 20-item checklist used to monitor signs of addiction47. An ABC sum score of 3 or more indicates inappropriate drug use. Withdrawal symptoms were recorded daily in the eDiary with the CWS during treatment in phase D and during washout in phases C and D. The CWS consists of 19 items representing potential withdrawal symptoms associated with cannabis withdrawal. Each item is rated on a 0–10 scale, where 0 indicates ‘not at all' and 10 indicates ‘extremely'48.

To demonstrate the superiority of VER-01 over placebo for the primary endpoint in phase A, a total of 732 participants had to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed treatment difference of 0.6 NRS points, an s.d. of 2.5 points, a two-sided significance level of 5% and 90% statistical power. For the key secondary endpoint of phase A, 180 participants with a neuropathic pain component had to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to show superiority of VER-01 versus placebo. This calculation was based on an assumed treatment difference of 10.5 NPSI points, an s.d. of 25.0, a two-sided significance level of 5% and 80% statistical power. Based on a proportion of 22% of participants with a neuropathic pain component, these assumptions resulted in a total sample size of 808 participants for phase A. The enrollment was stopped after 808 participants were randomized. Eligible participants who were already in the run-in phase were still allowed to be randomized.

Demographic data and other phase A baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group and overall, separately for each study phase, based on the defined analysis sets.

The primary endpoint of phase A was tested by an analysis of covariance model, with treatment as the main effect and with baseline characteristics (presence of a neuropathic pain component; NRS morning pain intensity, age, sex and country) as covariates. The analysis was based on imputed data if intercurrent events prevented the collection of data or if data collected after the occurrence of intercurrent events would have distorted the interpretation of the results. Depending on the type of intercurrent event, data were imputed assuming missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). If data were MAR, these were imputed using a multiple imputation (MI) model based on available data from similar participants in the same treatment group. If data were MNAR (for example, early discontinuation due to AEs or loss of efficacy), data were imputed under the conservative approach of ‘jump to reference'.

This approach was considered conservative because it assumes that participants discontinuing VER-01 would experience outcomes similar to those in the placebo arm, regardless of any prior treatment benefit. Evidence from enriched-enrollment trials49,50,51 suggests that analgesic effects achieved before treatment discontinuation typically persist for several weeks, making a pain rebound above placebo unlikely. Additionally, participants discontinuing active treatment likely continue to benefit from nonspecific trial effects—such as positive expectations, enhanced clinical monitoring and behavioral adjustments—that are equally present in the control group. Finally, the nature of AEs prompting discontinuation was presumed to be mild to moderate and transient, making a lasting pain outcome worse than placebo unlikely.

MI based on the MNAR assumption was performed using the suggested placebo MI algorithm in ref. 52. In general, a two-step MI approach was followed. In the first step, an MCMC imputation model was calculated on 100 imputations to transform an arbitrary missing data pattern into a monotone missing pattern. In a second MI step, a monotone regression model was calculated on these 100 imputations. Parameter estimates were combined according to Rubin's rule. BOCF as well as LOCF imputations were performed as a supportive analysis.

The key secondary endpoint was evaluated similarly to the primary endpoint of phase A using an analysis of covariance model, with treatment as the main effect and baseline characteristics (NPSI total score, age, sex and country) as covariates. The same imputation strategies were applied as for the primary endpoint. Safety was assessed based on AE incidence with post hoc comparisons performed using a two-sided chi-squared test.

To collect efficacy and safety data for at least 300 participants over 6 months, 500 participants were planned to be included in phase B. In addition, 150 participants were planned to be included in phase C to collect long-term efficacy and safety data for at least 100 participants over 12 months.

For the sample size calculation of phase D, a treatment failure rate of 25% was assumed for VER-01 and 55% for placebo, building on ref. 53. For the log-rank test comparing the two survival curves with regard to time to treatment failure, a sample size of 78 (39 per treatment group) was required to achieve 80% statistical power under a two-sided significance level of 5%.

The primary endpoint of phase D was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the main effect and baseline characteristics (presence of a neuropathic pain component, NRS pain intensity at week 43, age and sex) as covariates. Events indicating treatment failure (such as overdosage of rescue medication or study discontinuation due to intolerability, lack of efficacy or noncompliance) were classified as treatment failure events. Data from participants with intercurrent events not indicating treatment failure were considered missing and imputed under the MAR assumption. Discontinuation of the study for reasons not indicating treatment failure led to censoring in time-to-event analyses.

The analysis sets for phases A and D included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication in the respective phase, with participants assigned to treatment groups as randomized (full analysis sets) or as treated (safety analysis sets). The safety analysis sets for phases B and C included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication in the respective phase. No independent data monitoring committee was used. All statistical analyses were conducted by an independent clinical research organization with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Despite recent advancements demonstrating the potential of tumor-agnostic biomarkers to guide effective therapies, randomized evidence supporting the clinical superiority of precision oncology approaches compared to standard therapies remains limited. The ROME trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 2 study comparing tailored treatment (TT) to standard of care (SoC) in patients with advanced solid tumors progressing after one or two lines of therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling on tissue and blood was performed to identify actionable alterations. Overall response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), time to next treatment (TTNT) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Between November 2020 and August 2023, 1,794 patients were screened, 897 were evaluated by the molecular tumor board (MTB) and 400 were randomized to TT or SoC. TT achieved a significantly higher ORR (17.5% versus 10%; P = 0.0294) and improved median PFS (3.5 months versus 2.8 months; hazard ratio = 0.66 (0.53–0.82), P = 0.0002). TT also showed superior 12-month PFS rates (22.0% versus 8.3%). Median OS was similar, with a 52% crossover rate. Grade 3/4 adverse events were also similar (40% TT versus 52% SoC). These results highlight the potential of TT to improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations. These results also provide relevant evidence supporting a tumor-agnostic precision oncology strategy and highlight the potential of TTs, guided by genomic profiling and MTB recommendations, to significantly improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04591431.

Precision oncology aims to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring cancer treatments to individual patients, focusing on specific vulnerabilities identified through the analysis of cancer characteristics and the patient's clinical history1. However, implementing these strategies presents major challenges, such as detecting actionable biomarkers, interpreting their clinical significance within the context of an individual patient's history and systematically utilizing available tailored treatments (TTs). This complexity is further compounded by the variability in the frequency of actionable molecular alterations across different tumor types, making histology a less reliable factor for determining treatment options2. Additionally, standard therapeutic options vary considerably across different tumor types. As a result, the clinical significance of an actionable genetic alteration can differ substantially across various cancer types3.

Among the different approaches for detailed molecular characterization of tumor samples, genomic tests are the most widely used in clinical trials to identify patients with actionable alterations.

Recent advancements have uncovered that treatments targeting some tumor-agnostic biomarkers induce considerable clinical benefits regardless of histology. Notable examples include pembrolizumab4 and dostarlimab5 for tumors exhibiting high microsatellite instability (MSI-H); pembrolizumab for high tumor mutational burden (hTMB)6; larotrectinib7, entrectinib8 and repotrectinib9 for tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions; dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors10; selpercatinib for RET fusions11; and trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-overexpressing (3+) solid tumors12.

However, definitive evidence demonstrating the superiority of these approaches over standard therapies is lacking, with inconsistent outcomes reported across randomized agnostic precision oncology clinical trials. For instance, although the SHIVA trial did not show progression-free survival (PFS) benefits for off-label TT compared to standard treatments13, the MOSCATO-01 trial achieved its endpoint, underscoring the value of broad genomic testing and targeted drug treatments14.

Large, prospective, non-randomized trials are being conducted to identify molecularly defined subpopulations of patients deriving benefit from TTs. The results of multiple cohorts of the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) study were published15,16,17,18. Similarly, the MyPathway and the NCI-MATCH trials provided valuable insights into the actionability of molecular findings in multiple tumor types19,20,21.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) sought to address these challenges by developing tools such as ETAC-S, which contains minimum requirements for identifying TTs with tumor-agnostic potential based on mechanistic evidence paired with prospective clinical insights22. Another widely implemented framework is the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT)23, which ranks genomic aberrations to guide therapeutic decisions. The SAFIR02-BREAST trial demonstrated the utility of ESCAT, indicating that only patients harboring genomic alterations ranked as tier I and tier II benefit from maintenance TT, whereas those harboring alterations with lower actionability levels do not24.

Moreover, molecular tumor boards (MTBs) provide essential multidisciplinary expertise for implementing precision medicine25. However, the impact of MTBs on patient outcomes requires further validation, as current evidence is limited and varies based on factors such as drug availability and tumor types treated26,27,28,29. Despite these advancements, important hurdles remain in effectively implementing precision oncology in Italy30. Although regulatory approvals for targeted therapies have increased recently, many MTB-recommended treatments continue to face narrow or delayed approvals, limiting patient access to TTs even when actionable alterations are detected. Consequently, referral to clinical trials often becomes a viable option for patients to access TTs. Challenges such as limited enrollment availability and strict inclusion criteria further hinder the efficiency of this approach. Therefore, collaborative policies are essential to overcome these issues and facilitate the implementation of precision oncology in clinical practice25.

The nationwide ROME trial was designed to provide comprehensive genomic profiling and TT for patients with solid tumors across multiple medical oncology units in Italy. This trial aims to evaluate the outcomes of a TT established after discussions in the MTB compared to the standard of care (SoC). Additionally, this approach seeks to generate high-quality data to identify potentially effective treatments that deserve further clinical validation in specific biomarker-defined subsets of patients.

From 13 October 2020 to 19 July 2023, 1,794 patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 and metastatic solid tumors, who had received up to two lines of therapy, were accrued across 40 oncological centers in Italy. These patients were screened for genomic alteration on tissue and peripheral blood with FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx centralized next-generation sequencing (NGS). A total of 897 patients with potentially actionable molecular alterations were identified and discussed during 127 weekly MTB meetings. Patients with mutations deemed actionable by at least one of the drugs available in the trial were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to received TT versus SoC. In total, 497 patients were excluded from randomization based on MTB directives outlined in Methods.

Actionable genomic alterations and MTB-selected treatment options for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population are reported in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Following the MTB recommendations, 221 (55%) patients were referred to a targeted therapy, 153 (38%) to immunotherapy and 26 (7%) to a combination of both (Extended Data Fig. 2). Thus, 400 patients were ultimately randomized into the TT and SoC arms. Patients were allowed to crossover at the locally confirmed progression of the disease. The CONSORT diagram is presented in Fig. 1.

CONSORT diagram for the ROME trial.

Patient characteristics and lines of prior therapy are detailed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1, respectively. The median age, baseline ECOG PS and number of previous lines of treatment were similar between arms. The TT arm had a higher proportion of women. The primary tumor origins were well balanced, with only glioblastomas and biliary tract tumors showing a slight overrepresentation in the SoC and TT arms, respectively, with no statistical differences observed. The TT arm also had a higher percentage of patients who received prior targeted therapy or hormonal therapy or a combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In contrast, the SoC arm had more patients with prior immunotherapy.

The overall response rate (ORR) in the ITT population of 400 patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the TT arm compared to the SoC arm. Among the 200 patients receiving TT, the ORR was 17.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.5–23.5), which included 3% (six patients) achieving a complete response and 14.5% (29 patients) achieving a partial response. In contrast, the SoC arm achieved an ORR of 10% (95% CI: 6.2–15.0), with no complete responses and a 10% partial response rate (20 patients). Stable disease was observed in 19.5% (39 patients) in the TT arm and in 17.5% (35 patients) in the SoC arm, and progressive disease was reported in 63.0% and 72.5% of patients in the TT and SoC arms, respectively. The primary endpoint analysis conducted using the stratified analysis by Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test demonstrated a significant difference in ORR between groups (P = 0.0285; Extended Data Table 1). ORR varied across prespecified strata: in the breast cancer subgroup (Stratum A), ORR was 20.0% for TT versus 35.0% for SoC; in the non-colorectal gastrointestinal cohort (Stratum B), rates were 14.8% versus 9.1%; in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Stratum C), 12.5% versus 6.7%; and in ‘Other malignancies' (Stratum D), 19.1% versus 6.4%. The unique discrepancy with general results was observed in the breast cancer subgroup, probably as a consequence of the small breast cancer cohort and its inherent heterogeneity. The P value from the chi-square test (P = 0.0294; Extended Data Table 2) is nearly identical to the stratified CMH result, supporting the robustness of the main conclusion of the study. Furthermore, the Breslow–Day test for homogeneity of odds ratios across strata was not significant (P = 0.1231), failing to provide evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effect across cancer types. PFS was significantly improved in the TT arm (median 3.5 months, 95% CI: 3.0–4.8) compared to the SoC arm (2.8 months, 95% CI: 2.5–3.2), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53–0.82, P = 0.0002; Fig. 2a). This benefit extended to key timepoints, showing substantial higher 9-month and 12-month PFS rates in the TT arm: 27.8% (95% CI: 21.4–34.2) at 9 months and 22.0% (95% CI: 16.0–28.0) at 12 months compared to 13.4% (95% CI: 8.4–18.5) and 8.3% (95% CI: 4.2–12.5), respectively, in the SoC arm. No significant difference in median overall survival (mOS) was observed between the TT and SoC arms (mOS: 9.1 months (TT) and 7.9 months (SoC); HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.72–1.19, P = 0.5322; Fig. 2b). A high crossover rate (59%) from SoC to TT occurred after disease progression. Among non-crossover patients in the SoC arm (n = 74), key reasons included rapid clinical deterioration (n = 33) and death before crossover eligibility (n = 25). Full details are reported in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Approximately half of the enrolled patients in both arms had already received two prior lines of systemic therapy, which may have influenced both treatment responsiveness and overall clinical outcome. Analyses of the key secondary endpoints—time to treatment failure (TTF) and time to next treatment (TTNT)—showed superior outcomes in the TT arm compared to the SoC arm. Median TTF was 3.5 months (95% CI: 3.1–4.9) in the TT arm versus 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.5–3.1) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51–0.79, P < 0.0001). At 12 months, TTF was 22.0% (95% CI: 16.0–28.0) in the TT arm and 8.6% (95% CI: 4.4–12.7) in the SoC arm (Fig. 2c). Patients receiving TT had a significantly longer TTNT than those in the SoC arm (median TTNT: 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.9–6.3) versus 3.5 months (95% CI: 3.0–3.8); HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47–0.75). The TT arm also demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of patients remaining on treatment at 12 months (24.6%, 95% CI: 18.1–31.1) than the SoC arm (8.7%, 95% CI: 4.4–13.0) (Fig. 2d).

The overall incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) was similar in the TT and SoC arms (40.0% (80/200) and 52.5% (105/200), respectively). However, the specific AEs differed between the arms. In the TT arm, diarrhea was the most common AE (11 patients, 5.5%), whereas neutropenia was the most common AE in the SoC arm (16 patients, 8.0%) (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Figure 3 presents a tornado plot illustrating these AEs, categorized by System Organ Class categories of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5. Extended data provide a comprehensive list of grade ≥3 AEs (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and all grade 5 AEs (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

This figure shows the system or organ grade ≥3 AEs that occurred during the study for patients receiving SoC or TT.

Further exploratory analyses in specific subgroups provided additional insights. To assess the efficacy of TT against SoC, we analyzed subgroups defined by clinically relevant molecular alterations: MSI-H, hTMB, BRAF mutations and ERBB2 (HER2) alterations (including amplifications and mutations). Within the ITT population, these alterations were detected with the following frequencies: hTMB/microsatellite stable (MSS) (≥10 mutations per megabase, 33.7%), MSI-H (4.5%), BRAF mutations (4.3%) and ERBB2 alterations (14.3%). Treatment allocation was as follows: patients with hTMB, irrespective of microsatellite status, in the TT arm received immunotherapy (ipilimumab plus nivolumab or nivolumab monotherapy); patients with BRAF mutations received vemurafenib plus cobimetinib; and patients with ERBB2 alterations received one of several anti-HER2 regimens (pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, TDM1, trastuzumab plus lapatinib, pertuzumab plus TDM1, TDM1 plus atezolizumab or trastuzumab plus everolimus). The results of these exploratory subgroup analyses of the ORR are presented in Extended Data Table 3; the swimmer plots for duration of response are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5; and PFS and OS are reported in Fig. 4.

a, PFS in hTMB (P = 0.0211). b, OS in hTMB (P = 0.8549). c, MSI-H PFS (P = 0.0062). d, MSI-H OS (P = 0.1737). e, BRAF alterations PFS (P = 0.0033). f, BRAF alterations OS (P = 0.1046). g, HER2 alterations PFS (P = 0.0022). h, HER2 alterations OS (P = 0.1261). Statistical test used to calculate P values: log-rank test. P values derived from exploratory analyses should be interpreted with caution, as these analyses are hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory. Due to the non-predefined nature of exploratory endpoints and the potential for an inflated α level, the statistical significance observed in these analyses serves primarily to generate hypotheses for future confirmatory studies rather than providing definitive evidence NE, not evaluable; NR, not reached.

Of the 135 patients with hTMB and MSS status (65 in the SoC arm and 70 in the TT arm), all patients in the TT arm received immunotherapy (ipilimumab plus nivolumab or, in a few cases, nivolumab monotherapy). The ORR was higher in the TT arm (25.7%, 95% CI: 16–37.6) than in the SoC arm (15.4%, 95% CI: 7.6–26.5) (Extended Data Table 3). PFS was significantly longer in the TT arm (3.2 months, 95% CI: 2.5–5.6) compared to the SoC arm (2.8 months, 95% CI: 2.2–4.0) (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43–0.94; Fig. 4a). At 12 months, the PFS rate was 32.6% (95% CI: 21.3–43.9) in the TT arm versus 8.1% (95% CI: 0.9–15.3) in the SoC arm, representing a 25% absolute improvement in patients alive and progression free at 1 year. OS was 10.6 months (95% CI: 4.2–16.8) in the TT arm and 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.9–14.1) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.62–1.49; Fig. 4b).

Among 18 patients with MSI-H, the ORR was 57.1% (95% CI: 18.4–90.1) in the TT arm and 0% in the SoC arm (Extended Data Table 3). PFS had not been reached in the TT arm at the time of analysis, whereas it was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.4–3.7) in the SoC arm. Furthermore, at 1 year, 57.1% (95% CI: 20.5–93.8) of patients in the TT arm remained on treatment compared to none in the SoC arm (HR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03–0.73; Fig. 4c). The mOS was not reached in the TT arm. However, at 12 months, the OS rate was 71.4% in the TT arm compared to 33.3% and an mOS of 3.7 months in the SoC arm (HR = 0.38; Fig. 4d).

Of the 14 randomized patients with BRAF alterations, five received SoC and nine received TT, consisting of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination. A notable difference in PFS was observed: PFS was not reached in the TT arm, whereas it was 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.6–not evaluable) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01–0.67; Fig. 4e). The ORR was 22.2% (95% CI: 2.8–60.0) in the TT arm compared to 0% in the SoC arm (Extended Data Table 3). Despite the small sample size, the 12-month PFS rate was substantially higher in the TT arm (64.8%, 95% CI: 32.4–97.2) compared to the SoC arm (0%). The TT arm also demonstrated superior OS compared to the SoC arm; mOS was not reached in the TT arm, whereas it was 8.1 months (95% CI: 1.9–not evaluable) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.04–1.57; Fig. 4f).

In the subgroup of 58 patients with HER2 alterations, various anti-HER2 agents were administered. One patient in this group had an ERBB3 mutation, was also HER2 positive and received an indication for anti-HER2 treatment. The ORR was 13.8% (95% CI: 3.9–31.7) in the TT arm versus 6.9% (95% CI: 0.9–22.8) in the SoC arm (Extended Data Table 3). PFS was significantly longer in the TT arm (4.6 months, 95% CI: 3.0–5.7) compared to the SoC arm (2.6 months, 95% CI: 1.7–3.0) (HR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.24–0.74; Fig. 4g). Furthermore, at 12 months, 14.4% (95% CI: 1.40–27.50) of patients in the TT arm remained progression free compared to no patients in the SoC arm. Patients with HER2-altered tumors receiving TT showed a trend toward higher OS compared to the SoC arm, with an mOS of 10.2 months (95% CI: 6.5–not evaluable) versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.8–13.7) (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.32–1.16; Fig. 4h).

The ROME trial provides evidence that TT, guided by comprehensive genomic profiling and expert MTB decision-making, significantly improves outcomes in pretreated patients with metastatic disease. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the ORR and prolonged PFS compared to SoC, underscoring the clinical value of molecularly driven precision oncology. The improvement in ORR, the primary endpoint of the study, observed in the TT arm compared to the SoC arm within the ITT population (17.5% versus 10%), is clinically relevant and methodologically robust, although modest in magnitude. Notably, the TT arm achieved complete responses in a patient population with advanced metastatic disease treated in later lines, whereas no complete responses were observed in the SoC arm, underlining the potential efficacy of TTs in achieving deeper and potentially more durable clinical responses. The improvement in ORR was consistent despite variations across predefined cancer type strata. Subgroup analyses revealed pronounced benefit in the ‘Other malignancies' stratum (19.1% versus 6.4%), positive trends in non-colorectal gastrointestinal (14.8% versus 9.1%) and NSCLC (12.5% versus 6.7%) subgroups and a lower ORR in the TT arm for breast cancer (20.0% versus 35.0%). However, the analyses of the differences in the odds ratios of response across subgroups have merely exploratory importance due to the limited size of most subgroups and, more importantly, because the primary aim of the trial was to assess the feasibility and potential global impact of a tailored therapeutic strategy based on comprehensive genomic profiling. The observed numerical imbalance across the four predefined cohorts resulted from a combination of protocol-driven and real-world factors. Although the initial design anticipated competitive enrollment with balanced strata, the trial's biomarker-driven framework inherently favored variability in recruitment. A key factor contributing to this disparity was the differential prevalence of actionable genomic alterations across tumor types. Stratum D, which included diverse malignancies, exhibited higher rates of potentially actionable targets compared to other strata. Molecular profiling success rates further influenced recruitment dynamics. Tumors with lower shed DNA or suboptimal sample quality, common in certain histologies, reduced liquid biopsy utility, whereas tissue availability varied by cancer type. Additionally, site-specific expertise and patient populations probably played an important role, with centers specializing in rare cancers contributing more to Stratum D, whereas those focused on common tumors faced stricter exclusion thresholds. Temporal factors, including profiling turnaround times and drug availability after protocol amendments, also contributed to uneven accrual. Despite these imbalances, the trial's statistical integrity remained robust, as previously discussed. The observed disparities reflect real-world heterogeneity in the distribution of actionable targets rather than methodological shortcomings. The ROME trial's agnostic design, prioritizing molecular over histologic stratification, inherently accommodates such variability, validating its approach in capturing the complexity of precision oncology (Fig. 5). The recruitment pattern underscores a critical challenge in biomarker-driven trials: molecular prevalence and clinical exclusion criteria inevitably influence enrollment dynamics. The trial's outcomes, however, demonstrate that robust statistical methods can mitigate imbalances, ensuring meaningful conclusions even in heterogeneous populations. These insights support the feasibility of tumor-agnostic frameworks while emphasizing the need for adaptive designs in future precision oncology studies. A major methodological departure from prior precision oncology trials is the timing of molecular profiling. In contrast to most studies that also use archival tissue samples from primary tumors, the ROME trial specifically employed metastatic tissue collected upon disease progression after the last therapy (with few exceptions; see supplementary materials). This strategy provided a more precise evaluation of the tumor's mutational landscape at study entry. The addition of liquid biopsy analysis, comprehensive MTB assessment and early randomization (within the first two lines of therapy) further enhanced the accuracy of TT recommendations while mitigating the confounding effects of clonal heterogeneity frequently observed in later-stage disease.

A key finding from this study is the significant long-term benefit of PFS associated with TT. At the 12-month mark, patients receiving TT demonstrated improved disease control, indicating that it can extend PFS beyond 1 year for certain patients. This benefit, observed even in pretreated metastatic cases, highlights the clinical importance of personalized treatment strategies based on individual molecular alterations.

The observed significant improvements in ORR and PFS within the TT arm were not accompanied by a similar improvement in OS. The substantial crossover rate (58.8%) from the SoC arm to the TT arm after disease progression, although ethically appropriate, likely contributed to this lack of OS benefit. The high rate of non-crossover (41.2%) underscores the challenges of implementing precision therapies in late-line settings, where declining performance status and emergent complications often preclude treatment changes. This reality suggests that TTs may require earlier deployment to maximize clinical impact. This highlights the need for future studies to incorporate stratified crossover analyses to better understand the long-term effects of TTs on survival outcomes.

Subgroup analyses focused on specific molecular alterations (hTMB, BRAF mutations and ERBB2 alterations) revealed considerable benefits. The hTMB subgroup demonstrated a particularly strong PFS benefit with immunotherapy (nivolumab with or without ipilimumab), showing efficacy across both MSI-H and MSS tumor types. This finding supports hTMB as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response, even within a biomarker-agnostic approach, particularly when using the TMB calculation algorithm employed by the Foundation One platform. Despite this promising conclusion, literature reports on TMB have been inconsistent, likely due to several factors. Key contributing elements include methodological variations, site-specific influences and a lack of standardization across the field. The complexity is further compounded by the use of different platforms and proprietary algorithms as well as variability in panel size, gene coverage, bioinformatics pipelines, sequencing depths and tumor purity. Additionally, cancer-type-specific variations play an important role in the assessment of TMB. Despite these challenges, the potential of hTMB as a predictive tool for immunotherapy response remains promising, highlighting the need for continued exploration and standardization efforts. Similarly, TTs showed efficacy against tumors harboring BRAF and HER2 alterations. Although the smaller sample sizes in some subgroups may have limited the statistical power of certain observations, the overall findings emphasize the potential of precision oncology.

The similar incidence of grade 3/4 AEs in the TT and SoC arms, albeit with different AE profiles (diarrhea and fatigue in TT versus neutropenia in SoC), underscores the importance of proactive, personalized management of toxicities to optimize the therapeutic benefit–risk ratio.

The pivotal role of the MTB in shaping clinical decision-making was evident throughout the trial. Composed of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, the MTB enabled a mutation-agnostic and tumor-agnostic approach, tailoring treatment plans based on comprehensive molecular profiles rather than histology alone, avoiding the passive acceptance of the mutation/drug axiom. This approach, combined with the clinical data provided by referring clinicians, facilitated a patient-specific therapeutic strategy. In scenarios where multiple targeted treatment options were available for a single molecular pathway (such as PI3K/AKT or ERBB2 alterations), the MTB prioritized agents based on each patient's unique molecular profile and clinical characteristics. Factors driving these decisions included the specific type of alteration (for example, ERBB2 mutation versus amplification), published evidence on drug efficacy in specific contexts, prior therapeutic exposures and drug safety profiles. Notably, several agents (alpelisib, tepotinib, talazoparib, selpercatinib and pralsetinib) were introduced via protocol amendment in 2024. These updates, documented in Extended Data Table 4, preserved trial integrity through predefined statistical analysis plan (SAP) stratification while enhancing real-world relevance.

The MTB's ability to address each patient's biological complexity and clinical heterogeneity optimized therapy selection, contributing substantially to the positive outcomes of this trial. In case of detection of multiple actionable alterations, the MTB evaluated the potential clinical benefit of each therapeutic option, considering evidence from published literature, drug mechanism of action, patient-specific clinical factors, prior therapeutic responses and toxicity risks. The presence of multiple actionable biomarkers considerably complicates therapeutic decision-making due to pathway interactions, conflicting clinical evidence and diverse drug toxicities. Managing this complexity often exceeds individual clinician capacity and simple biomarker–drug algorithms. In the era of precision oncology, the MTB model is proving essential for interpreting complex genomic data and guiding personalized treatment plans that extend beyond traditional histopathological and direct target–drug association models, as seen in the prescription of TTs based on demonstrated efficacy in controlled clinical studies. The ROME trial provides, to our knowledge, the strongest evidence supporting MTB implementation in clinical practice, thanks to its agnostic and randomized design. Previous evidence suggested a potential improvement in survival outcomes when MTBs were implemented, as published by Miller et al.31 in a prospective, non-randomized phase 2 study. MTB utility is also being assessed in other prospective clinical trials, such as the Danish phase 2, non-randomized ProTarget study, implementing a Drug Rediscovery Protocol (DRUP)-like design32. Another example is the TARGET study (NCT04723316), a large nationwide prospective trial based in the United Kingdom designed for this purpose, aiming to enroll 6,000 patients with advanced cancers33. Our findings underscore the critical need to further develop MTBs and implement advanced decision support tools to effectively integrate and interpret complex multiomic data, ultimately enhancing the precision of clinical recommendations. The management of dual biomarkers (that is, hTMB and HER2 alteration) posed unique challenges reflecting real-world precision oncology dilemmas, where pathway crosstalk (for example, MAPK activation dampening immunotherapy efficacy) and heterogeneous evidence bases complicate decisions. Our MTB addressed these scenarios by carefully evaluating multiple dimensions, including the biological relevance and actionability of each target (assessed using validated tools), variant allele frequency (VAF) of the detected alterations, quantitative thresholds for biomarkers such as TMB, strength of existing clinical evidence, potential interactions between targeted pathways, patient-specific clinical factors (including prior treatments, clinical status and comorbidities) and safety and toxicity profiles of candidate therapies, thus enabling structured and patient-centered decision-making. AI platforms can enhance MTB decisions in multitarget scenarios by structuring complex genomic/clinical data (for example, prioritizing therapies for HER2+/hTMB cases) and reducing cognitive overload through evidence-based recommendations. In Italy, the Alliance Against Cancer (ACC) consortium is advancing AI tools under initiatives such as CraNE/EUNetCCC to support MTBs in analyzing mutational profiles, aligning with European Union goals for precision oncology. These systems cross-reference real-world outcomes, biomarker–drug evidence and toxicity profiles, offering clinicians actionable hierarchies while maintaining human oversight. The work of the ACC exemplifies how AI augments, rather than replaces, expert deliberation, improving efficiency and consistency in biomarker-driven care.

The complexities of precision oncology necessitate adaptive platform trials to expedite patient access to effective TTs and keep pace with rapidly advancing genomic knowledge34,35. Platform trials, often referred to as multiarm, multistage studies, are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate multiple treatments within different arms of a single trial, all compared to a shared control arm. This design incorporates adaptive features, allowing for the removal of ineffective treatment arms and the inclusion of new arms tailored to specific drug–target interactions. Additionally, patients may be reassigned to different treatment arms based on their response to prior therapies or changes in biomarker profiles. By replacing the traditional sequential trial model, this approach accelerates the process of drug discovery and development36. Furthermore, it will be beneficial to complement RCTs with observational studies to assess the generalizability and real-world applicability of their results. Future precision oncology will strongly benefit from dynamic national and international clinical trial databases, comprehensively annotated with gene-specific and variant-specific targets, directly linked to advanced decision support platforms to facilitate patient stratification into molecularly driven trials. Although the ROME trial provides robust evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of molecularly guided therapies in a controlled environment, the complexities of real-world practice—including patient heterogeneity, varied access to genomic testing and differences in healthcare infrastructure—may influence the outcomes observed. Observational studies using robust real-world data sources, such as population-based cancer registries, electronic health records and multicenter collaborative networks, combined with advanced AI analysis, would be instrumental in addressing these aspects. Future research priorities include optimizing biomarker-driven patient selection and MTB processes, developing innovative trial designs, investigating specific strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms and exploring combination approaches with immunotherapy and other tailored agents to propel the field of precision oncology further and realize its potential.

The competent authority, Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA), authorized the trial on 8 July 2020 (AIFA/SC/P/76132). The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier NCT04591431 and in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) with number 2018-002190-21. The trial adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki regarding research involving human subjects. Forty-one centers received ethics approval and participated in the study enrollment. All patients signed the specifically conceived informed consent form (ICF).

This randomized, prospective, multicenter, proof-of-concept phase 2 clinical trial enrolled patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic solid tumors, regardless of histology. Eligible patients had failed at least one, but no more than two, prior lines of systemic therapy. An ECOG PS of 0 or 1 was required as well as being at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF. All patients had to have measurable or evaluable disease defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)37 or immune-related response criteria (irRC)38. If clinically indicated, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans could have been performed. PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST)39 were applied in cases where a baseline PET scan was available. Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow functions were required at baseline. Patients who were candidates for potentially curative surgery or other locoregional therapies were excluded. Those with well-established actionable molecular targets, not detected in previous molecular profiling, for which approved and marketed targeted therapies were available—such as EGFR mutations or ALK translocations in lung cancer, BRAF mutations in melanoma, KIT mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer or tumor-agnostic biomarker-driven treatments already available in clinical practice—were also excluded. Furthermore, patients with only bone and/or brain metastases, uncontrolled brain disease (untreated and/or symptomatic) or those whose brain metastases had not been monitored for over 2 months were excluded. Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that could compromise their participation in the study (for example, uncontrolled diabetes, clinically relevant cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the last year, chronic liver or renal disease, active gastrointestinal ulceration or severely impaired lung function) were also excluded (see supplementary materials for all inclusion/exclusion criteria).

For genomic testing, a tissue sample obtained during the screening phase or within 6 months before enrollment was required. The biopsy should be performed during the screening period, after the completion of conventional therapy for recurrent/metastatic cancer. Samples collected within 3 months before the patient's ICF signature were acceptable, as were samples collected within 6 months, with prior acceptance by the MTB. Archived tissue samples were accepted for patients with glioblastomas and high-grade malignant gliomas. Patients with only one available biopsy, either liquid or solid, due to a failure of one method during the screening phase remained eligible for inclusion and discussion in the MTB. Conversely, if both tissue and liquid biopsy characterizations failed, patients were classified as screening failures.

Molecular profiling was performed using FoundationOne CDX and FoundationOne Liquid CDX tests on tissue and liquid biopsies. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples was isolated using the DNA extraction method and analyzed with the FoundationOne CDx panel to assess alterations across 324 genes, including substitutions, insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations (CNAs) and gene rearrangements. Genomic signatures of MSI and TMB were also evaluated. For FoundationOne Liquid CDx, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from plasma collected from anticoagulated peripheral whole blood samples using FoundationOne Liquid CDx cfDNA blood collection tubes. The cfDNA was analyzed for substitutions, indels in 311 genes, rearrangements in four genes and CNAs in three genes. Additionally, the test evaluated tumor fraction and genomic signatures such as blood-based tumor mutational burden (bTMB) and MSI-H status.

Upon identification of actionable alterations in either tumor tissue or liquid biopsy, and after MTB discussion, selected patients were assigned to receive immunotherapy, targeted therapy or both based on MTB recommendations. A crossover between the two treatment arms was planned upon progressive disease. The study design is reported in Fig. 5.

An MTB convened weekly to review each eligible patient. The MTB consisted of medical oncologists, pathologists, geneticists, immunologists, bioinformaticians and other relevant specialists. Before the MTB discussion, the steering committee identified patients with potentially actionable genomic alterations. The MTB then reviewed each case, considering comprehensive molecular profiling data alongside the patient's clinical features, such as performance status, comorbidities and concurrent treatments. The treating clinician presented each case selected by the steering committee, highlighting potential actionable therapeutic targets.

Molecular alterations were evaluated using databases such as ClinVAR, OncoKB and COSMIC and the ESMO ESCAT scale. The board employed VAF thresholds of 1% for tissue biopsies and 2% for liquid biopsies. It systematically reviewed potential intrinsic resistance mechanisms, such as KRAS mutations in patients considered for PIK3CA or AKT inhibitors. For patients with multiple actionable alterations (for example, hTMB alongside HER2 amplification or BRAF mutation), the MTB prioritized therapies using a hierarchical framework prioritizing clinical urgency (for example, immunotherapy for MSI-H tumors regardless of co-alterations), followed by biomarker–drug evidence strength (for example, HER2-targeted agents over exploratory TMB-directed therapies when both were present) and, finally, considering toxicity overlap avoidance (for example, excluding PI3K inhibitors if preexisting hyperglycemia).

Patients discussed at the MTB who were not randomized were excluded for various reasons, including the absence of target alterations, the presence of resistance mutations, known negative studies related to a specific alteration, rare mutations without literature data, low VAF, unavailability of drugs for specific alterations, clinical considerations, high levels of uncertainty regarding potentially targetable alterations and the presence of established targetable alterations with available standard treatments. In cases suggesting a germline origin, germline testing was recommended.

MTB recommendations included randomizing patients to receive TT, referring them to a geneticist in the presence of somatic alterations with potential germline significance, modifying SoC only when necessary and suggesting enrollment in clinical trials or early drug access programs, when available in Italy. MTB activities are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 6.

Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and received a recommendation for a specific targeted agent or combination therapy from the MTB were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SoC or TT, according to their molecular profiles. In the SoC arm, patients were treated with standard chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy based on primary tumor histology according to national guidelines and at the investigators' discretion. The MTB also proposed possible modifications based on molecular profiling and expert opinion in the control group.

In the TT arm, patients received targeted therapy, immunotherapy or a combination that was selected according to their genomic profiles, as determined by the MTB. Combination therapies were proposed in cases where efficacy data for the combination were well established in different malignancies (for example, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab for HER2+ breast cancer and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib for BRAF-mutant melanoma) or when there was a biological rationale due to the presence of multiple actionable mutations. Such proposals were contingent upon the availability of published phase 1b/2 data supporting the combination in other tumor types. In cases involving immunotherapy, the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab was usually preferred unless a patient's clinical condition or comorbidities suggested otherwise. The decision was made collaboratively between the MTB and the patient's treating clinician.

Patients were allowed to crossover to the TT arm upon disease progression. A substantial amendment to the protocol was implemented in October 2022, introducing additional treatments to the existing options, including entrectinib, alpelisib, pralsetinib and selpercatinib. Investigational therapies included erlotinib, pertuzumab, vemurafenib, trastuzumab emtansine, alectinib, vismodegib, cobimetinib, atezolizumab, trastuzumab, ipatasertib, entrectinib, everolimus, palbociclib, lapatinib, ipilimumab, nivolumab, brigatinib, ponatinib, itacitinib, pemigatinib, alpelisib, tepotinib, pralsetinib, talazoparib and selpercatinib. In cases where hTMB coexisted with a targetable mutation, a combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy was generally preferred, provided that safety data were available. All treatments were administered according to the investigator's brochure or the relevant regulatory clinical protocol. Each targeted agent was associated with a specific pathway, signature or gene alteration (Extended Data Table 4).

The primary endpoint of the study was the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response or partial response, with respect to the total number of randomized patients. Secondary endpoints included PFS, defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurred first; TTF, defined as the time from randomization until patient withdrawal for any reason, including disease progression or death; TTNT, defined as the time from randomization to the start of the next line of therapy; and OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Additional planned secondary endpoints not reported in this paper include concordance between molecular profile on tumor tissue and ctDNA, quality of life measurements, immune fitness in the two treatment arms and the association between the molecular evaluation and gene expression profiling.

Tumor response was locally assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 and irRC. In patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or consent withdrawal, tumor assessments continued until documented progression. Survival was monitored until death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal or study termination. AEs were graded using CTCAE version 5.0, with the frequency and severity of AEs documented for each patient.

Data were collected at the clinical sites and inserted into a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF) by investigators or designated personnel. The trial was overseen by an independent external data monitoring committee, which conducted periodic safety evaluations and reviewed efficacy during prespecified interim analyses. Per the study protocol, the data monitoring committee (DMC) conducted a prespecified interim analysis after 20% of the randomized patients (n = 76) had reached the final efficacy evaluation (day 308 or early termination), irrespective of treatment group assignment. The DMC reviewed these data and recommended proceeding with patient accrual as planned. As predefined, the stopping threshold for conditional power (CPt) was set at 5%. Comparisons were made between the observed TT group response rate at interim analysis and the projected end-of-study SoC group response rate (5%). At interim analysis, the TT group exhibited a 7.1% response rate. The calculated CPt for the projected SoC outcome, derived from the sample size assumptions, was 88.7%, demonstrating strong evidence to continue the trial and prompting a unanimous DMC recommendation to proceed. The authors confirm that the trial was conducted in compliance with the protocol, its amendments and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. All authors had access to the data used for manuscript preparation and contributed to its drafting, critical review or editing. The healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (CrossRef Funder ID: 10.13039/100009945), reviewed this manuscript for medical accuracy only before journal submission. The authors are fully responsible for the content of this paper, and the views and opinions described in the publication reflect solely those of the authors.

We hypothesized that TT would yield higher ORR compared to SoC, specifically a 20% ORR for TT versus 5% for SoC. According to the site of primary tumor, four cohorts were defined as breast cancer (Stratum A), non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers (Stratum B), NSCLC (Stratum C) and ‘other malignancies' (Stratum D), with competitive enrollment across these strata. To detect a 15% difference between the two arms, assuming an α of 0.10 and a β of 0.20 (80% power) and employing a one-sided chi-square test, a total of 86 patients (43 in each arm of the four cohorts) were required. The four cohorts were evaluated as separate strata, resulting in a combined cohort size of 344 patients (86 patients per stratum). The overall ORR was assessed using a two-sided CMH test at a 5% significance level; an unstratified sensitivity analysis was also performed. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, 384 patients were required. Assuming actionable mutations in at least 30% of eligible patients, the planned screening sample size was 1,280. During the course of the study, the screening failure rate was higher than initially anticipated, leading to a total of 1,794 screened patients. Due to the extended screening periods required for genomic testing and the inherent unpredictability of patient eligibility based on mutational test results, 12 additional patients undergoing screening at the time the target of 384 randomized participants was reached were permitted by the steering committee to enroll, resulting in a final total of 400 patients.

All analyses were conducted using SAS software (v.9.4). The SAP, detailing the analyses to be executed, was finalized before database lock (SAP v.1.0). The randomization list was generated with a dedicated SAS program using the PROC PLAN procedure by an independent statistician. The randomization lists were incorporated into the eCRF system, which automatically managed the assignment of treatment arms. A soft lock of the database was performed on 31 July 2024. SAP v.2.0 was finalized on 30 January 2025, after the database freezing and data review meeting, and governs all analyses presented here. The full SAP is available upon reasonable request. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, with mean, s.d., quartiles for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables. Differences in clinical characteristics were evaluated with t-test, binomial test, chi-quadro and CMH. The Breslow–Day test was used to evaluate the homogeneity of odds ratios. Box plots and tornado plots assessed the overall incidence of grade 3/4 AEs. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, accompanied by the log-rank test, was employed to compare OS and PFS across arms and subgroups. To visualize clinical benefit duration (response and stable disease) across molecular subgroups—including high TMB and PI3K/AKT-altered and ERBB2-positive cohorts—swimmer plots were generated. HRs and 95% CIs were also calculated. Homogeneous subgroups of patients were evaluated in a prespecified exploratory analysis. Exploratory biomarker analyses, including assessments of hTMB (≥10 mutations per megabase), BRAF V600E mutations and HER2 amplifications, were predefined in the SAP to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity. These subgroups were selected based on emerging preclinical evidence during the trial's enrollment phase, with steering committee approval for post hoc stratification. All statistical analyses were conducted on the ITT population. R v.4.3.3 and RStudio were used to build toxicity and genomic alterations plots.

Art imitates life ... maybe.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There's something intriguing, even frightening, about the image of an ancient horned serpent roaming across the land. Thanks to some suggestive fossils and legends of old, talk of such a creature isn't a new concept. 

But the recent discovery of 200-year-old rock paintings found in South Africa now has scientists hypothesizing that this ancient creature may have been far more than just a legend.

The first formal scientific descriptions of this horned serpent—a supposed member of the dicynodont group—appeared in 1845. Considering the abundance of dicynodont fossils found in the Karoo Basin in South Africa, some have pondered whether this long-thought mythical horned serpent is rooted in reality. 

The discovery of rock art dated to between 1821 and 1835 adds even more credence to the legend, as the painting is older than the first formal reference to the dicynodont. If we're lucky, it could provide further clues as to just how intertwined this horned serpent was with South Africa's indigenous San culture. 

In a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, Julien Benoit from the University of the Witwatersrand confirmed that the rock art from the early 1800s depicts a tusked animal, and that it sits alongside tetrapod fossils in the immediate vicinity. “Altogether,” the Benoit wrote, “they suggest a case of indigenous paleontology.” 

Still, it will need to take more than a 200-year-old painting to match a smattering of unknown fossils to a long-extinct creature unlike anything seen in the area today. 

“The ethnographic, archaeological, and paleontological evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that the Horned Serpent panel could possibly depict a dicynodont,” Benoit wrote in the study. He added that the downward orientation of the tusks, which doesn't match any African animal (but does match dicynodonts), the abundance of fossils in the area, and the belief held by the San of the existence of this long-extinct large animal further support the theory. 

“Of course, at this point it is speculative,” said Benoit, according to IFL Science, “but the tusked animal on the Horned Serpent panel was likely painted as a rain-animal, which means it was probably involved [in] rain-making ceremonies.” These ceremonies often evoked known extinct animals to help the people encourage the gods to send rain. 

The San were known to have a robust mix of animals belonging to their ‘spirit world,' but Benoit said that these animals were generally inspired by reality—even if extinct. Coupled with the San's interest in fossils, Benoit believes a fossil discovery could have led the San to recreate the horned serpent, using a long-held legend in which their ancestors described the creatures as “great monstrous brutes, exceeding the elephant or hippopotamus in bulk” as the template. 

There's plenty of leaps from legend to scientific grounding that may be too large for a fabled horned serpent to make. But after further studies, the 200-year-old paintings could spin a different tale.

“Everything points to the catastrophic end of a military operation.” Yikes.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When construction workers started churning up skeletal remains, a project to renovate a soccer field outside Vienna, Austria, morphed into an archaeological dig, and it wasn't long before experts realized this field was actually a major discovery in Roman warfare history. 

They dug up the remains of potentially 150 males aged between 20 and 30 years, hinting that a “catastrophic event in a military context” happening at the site at the end of the first century A.D. 

The discovery of a Roman mass grave—noteworthy in and of itself because the Romans practiced cremation in Europe until the third century A.D.—could be “evidence from the immediate history of the founding of Vienna,” according to a translated statement from the Wien Museum, which announced the discovery. 

The archaeologists, brought in by the Federal Monuments Office after the soccer field renovation project started unearthing human bones, discovered that an oval pit roughly 16 feet in diameter and less than two feet deep contained the remains of around 150 peoples—the team discovered 129 individuals, but due to the damage done by the excavation, experts believe the total number could be over 150. 

“The individuals were buried without any recognizable order or orientation,” museum officials wrote in the statement. “Many lay on their stomachs or sides, some adapted to the shape of the pit. The limbs were intertwined with those of other individuals. This indicates a hasty covering of the dead with earth, i.e. not an orderly burial.” 

With every individual examined a male, most between the age of 20 and 30 years, and in good health combined with the causes of death due to injuries from blunt and sharp weapons, including spears, daggers, swords, and iron bolts, “the variety of injuries indicates a battle and not an execution site.” 

With cremation burial common in the European Roman Empire, finds of Roman skeletons from this period are considered rare, leading to this being one of the most significant Roman war discoveries in Central Europe. 

“The creation of a mass grave without cremation of the dead suggests a large number of casualties in combination with a lack of time and resources,” the museum wrote. “The battle wounds, on the other hand, rule out the possibility of executions, such as a punishment for military cowardice. Instead, everything points to the catastrophic end of a military operation.”

Experts dated both the bones and the grave goods to more precisely pinpoint the find to the end of the first century A.D. While most of the dead were robbed of their weapons and equipment, the team still discovered a Roman iron dagger with inlays of silver wire, several scales of armor that show distinct differences from known varieties, the metal cheek piece of a Roman helmet, two iron spearheads (one stuck in a hip bone, mind you), and hobnails from shoes that were made with leather and studded with nails, a type of footwear used by Roman soldiers. 

The museum wrote that the dagger was instrumental in the dating because its style was in use from the middle of the first century A.D. to the beginning of the second century A.D. 

According to the museum statement, historical sources indicate that Germanic tribes had repeated battles with the Roman Empire near the end of the first century A.D., and some of these skirmishes were extremely costly for the Romans. On the opposing side, the evident victory may have led to the founding of Austria's capital city.

“The mass grave in Simmering is the first physical evidence of fighting form this period and indicates this location of a battle in the area of present-day Vienna,” the museum wrote. “The defeat attested here could therefore have been the immediate reason for the expansion of the formerly small military base into the legionary camp of Vindobona—less than seven kilometers [4.3 miles] from the site of the find. Hasenleitengasse may therefore mark the beginning of Vienna's urban history.”

Clinical practice guidelines recommend defined weight loss goals for the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in those individuals with increased risk, such as prediabetes. However, achieving prediabetes remission, that is, reaching normal glucose regulation according to American Diabetes Association criteria, is more efficient in preventing T2D than solely reaching weight loss goals. Here we present a post hoc analysis of the large, multicenter, randomized, controlled Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS), demonstrating that prediabetes remission is achievable without weight loss or even weight gain, and that it also protects against incident T2D. The underlying mechanisms include improved insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and increments in β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Weight gain was similar in those achieving prediabetes remission (responders) compared with nonresponders; however, adipose tissue was differentially redistributed in responders and nonresponders when compared against each other—while nonresponders increased visceral adipose tissue mass, responders increased adipose tissue in subcutaneous depots. The findings were reproduced in the US Diabetes Prevention Program. These data uncover essential pathways for prediabetes remission without weight loss and emphasize the need to include glycemic targets in current clinical practice guidelines to improve T2D prevention.

Globally, more than 460 million people live with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and many go through comorbidities such as neuropathy, chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular (CV) disease, making T2D one of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide. Indeed, the increase in global mortality burden until 2050 is projected to be mostly due to neoplasms, T2D and kidney diseases1. Moreover, the current data suggest that T2D incidence will continue to rise, with most cases attributable to diet quality2. Additionally, the highest total number of affected people live in middle-income and low-income countries, where current guideline-based treatments are not as easily available as in high-income countries. Therefore, prevention must still be regarded as a major pillar in achieving the WHO's global noncommunicable disease goals and in equitably reducing the major burden of T2D3. Prediabetes is the most prominent risk factor of T2D with a yearly progression rate of 5–10% and a lifetime progression risk of 74%4,5, and an independent risk factor for vascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases4,6,7.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), prediabetes is diagnosed when glucose regulation is impaired and/or HbA1c elevated while criteria of T2D are not met8,9. The U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Outcome Study (DPPOS) has demonstrated that reversal of impaired glucose regulation to normal at least once during a lifestyle intervention (LI) was effective in reducing the risk of T2D and microvascular disease10,11. In the Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS)12, we extended these findings by establishing the concept of prediabetes remission13,14. Accordingly, weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes is reached, once the normal glucose regulation (NGR; that is, fasting glucose < 5.6 mmol l−1 (100 mg dl−1), 2 h glucose < 7.8 mmol l−1 (140 mg dl−1) and HbA1c < 39 mmol mol−1 (5.7%)) is re-established. Weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission (>5% of initial body weight) was explained by improved insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume. At long-term follow-up, participants reaching weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission had a 73% reduced risk of developing T2D compared to those who only met the weight loss goal (but not prediabetes remission) and also had reduced signs of kidney and small vessel damage13, which may be due to reduced glycemic exposure over time as has previously been indicated10. A comparable concept to prediabetes remission has successfully been established in people with T2D in the DIRECT trial, where substantial weight loss led to a return to nondiabetic glucose levels in up to 85% of participants, although the risk of redeveloping T2D was high15,16. In general, part of weight loss targeted LIs is physical exercise, which has been linked with reduced inflammation17,18 and has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity independently of body weight change19. In individuals with T2D, it has also been demonstrated that physical exercise can improve glycemia without a substantial weight loss effect20. However, neither DIRECT nor DPP reported on the preventive outcomes of patients who did not reduce body weight but achieved remission.

Here, we provide evidence that non-weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes protects from T2D development for up to 10 years after the LI started, and that it is characterized by increased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) compared to nonremission, where VAT increases. Moreover, we show that non-weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes is mediated by an improvement in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

Our data provide new support for the importance of implementing glycemic targets into current treatment guidelines to improve T2D prevention14, and show that the sole assessment of weight trajectories without body fat distribution is not adequately informative for the pursuit of treatment success.

We analyzed data from the ongoing multicenter LI study PLIS that recruited individuals with prediabetes in study centers throughout Germany within the framework of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.), where participants received the intervention for 12 months and were followed up for up to 9 years with metabolic phenotyping including oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) for glucose metabolism and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of body fat distribution before and after the intervention and during follow-up (see Methods for details). Of the 1,105 individuals originally included in PLIS, 234 (21.2%) did not lose or even gained weight during the year of the intervention. Of these, 51 returned to NGR, that is, were designated ‘responders' (R; 21.8%), while 183 (78.2%) were ‘nonresponders' (NR). Baseline characteristics for both groups are given in Extended Data Table 1. Overall, there were more women in both groups and R tended to have more women than NR (60.1% in NR versus 74.5% in R, P = 0.085). As has previously been reported for prediabetes remission11,13, R were younger (median = 54.4 ± 17.6 years) than NR (59.4 ± 15.5 years, P = 0.013), had lower fasting and 2 h glucose and slightly higher insulin sensitivity. Intervention intensity was not different between groups (Extended Data Table 1).

At first, we investigated whether weight trajectories during the 1-year intervention period were different between R and NR. However, BMI increased similarly in both groups (29.6 ± 2.1 kg m−2 to 30.6 ± 2.1 kg m−2 in R versus 30.5 ± 0.8 kg m−2 to 31.3 ± 0.9 kg m−2 in NR, P group over time = 0.24; Extended Data Fig. 1a). This was similar for body weight (84.0 ± 6.2 kg to 86.8 ± 6.5 kg in R versus 88.4 ± 2.9 kg to 90.6 ± 2.9 kg in NR, P group over time = 0.45), lean mass (56.2 ± 4.4 kg to 56.2 ± 4.7 kg in R versus 59.6 ± 2.7 kg to 59.5 ± 2.3 kg in NR, P group over time = 0.93; Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) and fat mass (30.7 ± 4.1 kg to 32.5 ± 4.5 kg in R versus 31.7 ± 2.0 kg to 32.5 ± 1.9 kg in NR, P group over time = 0.34; Extended Data Fig. 1d). Maximal aerobic capacity did not differ between groups (18 ± 2.2 ml min kg−1 to 17.6 ± 2.5 ml min kg−1 in R versus 18.5 ± 1.6 ml min kg−1 to 18.4 ± 1.9 ml min kg−1 in NR, P group over time = 0.65; Extended Data Fig. 1e). Additionally, adherence to dietary advice based on the evaluation of food diaries was not different between groups, similarly neither habitual physical activity (HPA) score nor daily distance walked (in a subgroup) or lean body mass differed between groups during the intervention and during follow-up, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Taken together, these data show that prediabetes remission without weight loss compared to nonremission was independent of weight trajectories, overall body composition and physical fitness.

Next, we explored the underlying determinants of improved glucose regulation in R versus NR. Glucose concentrations during the OGTT were lower in R and per definition decreased over time in R only (Fig. 1a). Also, consecutive insulin concentrations during the OGTT were higher in NR than in R before, during and after the intervention, but increased in R between 30 and 60 min during the second half of the intervention (Fig. 1b).

Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals in all panels. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. The R (defined by NGR, that is, prediabetes remission, after 12 months of LI) group and the NR (that is, not reaching NGR) group are depicted in blue and orange, respectively. FDR-corrected group × time P values are 0.0008 for all comparisons. Dashed lines in a represent ADA criteria-based cutoff values for prediabetes for fasting glucose (5.6 mmol l−1) and 2 h OGTT glucose (7.8 mmol l−1). In b, the lower dashed line shows the insulin concentrations at 60 min during the OGTT at baseline and the upper dashed line shows the 60 min peak at 12 months to visualize the change in insulin peak concentrations during the intervention.

To better understand the increase of insulin concentrations in R, we calculated OGTT-derived indexes for insulin sensitivity, secretion and β-cell function. We found that throughout the LI, insulin sensitivity did not change in NR but increased in R. The oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) index increased from 336.45 ± 15.41 ml min−1 m−2 to 358.23 ± 18.88 ml min−1 m−2 in R, whereas it remained unchanged (299.42 ± 8.67 ml min−1 m−2 to 297.42 ± 9.09 ml min−1 m−2) in NR, P group over time: 0.0035 (Fig. 2a). Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity revealed the same development with a numeric increase from 8.94 ± 1.35 a.u. to 9.36 ± 1.47 a.u., P = 0.096 in R, but did not increase in NR (6.82 ± 0.55 a.u. to 6.39 ± 0.53 a.u. in NR, P group over time = 0.00041, Fig. 2b). An index of hepatic insulin resistance did not show differences between groups (Fig. 2c). Also, there was no indication of differences in muscle or adipose tissue insulin resistance (Fig. 2d,e). However, insulin secretion and β-cell function increased in R but not in NR. The C-peptide area under the curve (AUC)0–30 min/glucose AUC0–30 min, an index of insulin secretion, increased from 159.5 ± 17.13 pmol mmol−1 to 169.96 ± 19.3 pmol mmol−1 in R, but remained constant (157.89 ± 7.81 pmol mmol−1 to 161.81 ± 8.15 pmol mmol−1) in NR (P group over time = 0.043; Fig. 2f). The Adaptation Index, a marker of β-cell function, increased from 5.16 × 104 ± 3,833.80 a.u. to 5.78 × 104 ± 5,145.06 a.u. in R and remained unchanged (4.61 × 104 ± 2,192.89 a.u. to 4.74 × 104 ± 2,554.91 a.u.) in NR (P group over time = 0.025; Fig. 2g). An overview of the changes in the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion for the two groups is given in Fig. 2h. The hyperbola shows that while R were able to increase insulin sensitivity and secretion at the same time, NR did not improve insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. Change of hepatic insulin clearance was not different between groups (3.91 ± 0.36 a.u to 3.68 ± 0.4 a.u in R versus 3.39 ± 0.17 a.u to 3.31 ± 0.16 a.u in NR, P group over time = 0.49; Fig. 2i) and, thus, cannot explain the increase in insulin concentrations observed in R. With the increase in insulin secretion and β-cell function alongside improved insulin sensitivity, remission mechanisms without weight loss differ from weight-loss-associated prediabetes remission, where the increase in insulin secretion has not been observed previously13.

Error bars depict s.e.m. P values directly above the x axes in a–g and i indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. P values directly above the colored bars indicate the difference between baseline and 12 months for the R and the NR group as post hoc corrected comparisons derived from the respective mixed effects models. FDR-corrected group × time P = 0.013 (a), P = 0.002 (b), P = 0.89 (c), P = 0.47 (d), P = 0.47 (e), P = 0.10 (f), P = 0.081 (g) and P = 0.62 (i).

Because insulin sensitivity and secretion are linked with ectopic adipose tissue deposition21,22,23, we then determined lipid accumulation in SCAT, VAT and ectopic lipid depots based on the MRI and 1H-spectroscopy data. Intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) was slightly higher in NR versus R (Extended Data Table 1) but remained constant in both groups during the LI (5.08 ± 1.71% to 5.9 ± 1.74% in R versus 7.65 ± 1.14% to 8.13 ± 1.18% in NR, P group over time = 0.74; Fig. 3a), suggesting no critical contribution of changes in IHL for nonweight-loss remission. However, while VAT did not increase in R despite weight gain, it increased along with weight gain in NR (4.31 ± 0.69 l to 4.24 ± 0.69 l in R versus 4.99 ± 0.32 l to 5.41 ± 0.36 l in NR, P group over time = 0.031; Fig. 3b). In contrast, SCAT increased more in R versus NR (14.41 ± 2.39 l to 15.7 ± 2.06 l in R versus 14.97 ± 1.06 l to 14.66 ± 0.98 l in NR, P group over time = 0.035) showing that with weight gain, R predominantly stored additional energy in SCAT but NR in VAT (Fig. 3c). This is reflected in a substantial increase in SCAT/VAT ratio in R, whereas the ratio tended to decrease in NR (4.01 ± 0.67 to 4.94 ± 0.93 in R versus 3.42 ± 0.25 to 3.14 ± 0.26 in NR, P group over time < 0.0001; Fig. 3d). Change in intramuscular fat was not different between groups (5.85 ± 1.24% to 6.15 ± 1.49% in R versus 6.4 ± 1.45% to 6.76 ± 1.49% in NR, P group over time = 0.83; Fig. 3e). These data highlight that lipid deposition during weight gain is most likely a crucial factor for improvements in glucose regulation during non-weight-loss prediabetes remission.

P values directly above the x axes in a–e indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. P values directly above the colored bars indicate the difference between baseline and 12 months for the R and the NR group as post hoc corrected comparisons derived from the respective mixed effects models.

FDR-corrected group × time P = 0.83 (a), P = 0.090 (b), P = 0.092 (c), P = 0.0008 (d) and P = 0.89 (e). IQR, interquartile range.

To further investigate whether the genetic background is a key driver of ectopic lipid deposition during weight gain, we calculated a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a subset of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Methods) that have been described to be associated with VAT24. However, there were no differences in the PRS between R and NR with or without adjustments for covariates (Fig. 3f).

Similar to previously published data on weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission, there was no association between the change in IHL and the proportion of remission (Fig. 4a,b). However, lower VAT increase or even reductions in VAT were linked with higher remission success (P = 0.024; Fig. 4c,d). According to the changes in SCAT and VAT, a higher SCAT/VAT ratio after the LI was associated with higher frequency of remission, again suggesting that the distribution of adipose tissue gained may determine prediabetes remission (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4e). Finally, there was a trend toward higher remission rates with weight gain (Fig. 4f).

Top numbers inside the bars indicate stratum size (n). Large bottom numbers indicate BMI (a,c) or percent body weight change (b,d,e). Small bottom numbers indicate 95% CI, respectively.

VAT is associated with increased low-grade inflammation and weight-loss-associated prediabetes remission13. Thus, we measured biomarkers of inflammation suggested to contribute to insulin resistance. However, there were no substantial differences in individual trajectories of inflammatory markers between R and NR (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Thus, low-grade inflammation, at least at the circulation level, may not explain improved insulin sensitivity during prediabetes remission.

Because hormonal factors derived from adipose tissue are also linked with insulin sensitivity, we measured the adipokines leptin and adiponectin. Leptin levels were not different between groups and did not develop differently (37.25 ± 11.81 ng ml−1 to 43.63 ± 11.68 ng ml−1 in R versus 40.68 ± 6.24 ng ml−1 to 47.26 ± 6.49 ng ml−1 in NR). Adiponectin levels, however, were not different at baseline (3096.48 ± 535.75 ng ml−1 in R, 2412.30 ± 207.49 ng ml−1 in NR, P = 0.094), but were substantially higher after the intervention in R versus NR (3371.57 ± 596.55 ng ml−1 in R, 2337.20 ± 217.24 ng ml−1 in NR, P = 0.0040, P group over time = 0.088; Extended Data Fig. 2), suggesting that increases in SCAT may chaperone improved insulin sensitivity by increased adiponectin secretion, at least in part.

To further understand the improvement in insulin secretion and β-cell function in R, we assessed lipid content within triglyceride-containing VLDL particles, because a reduction in VLDL1 palmitate has been shown to be associated with improved β-cell secretory capacity during the remission of T2D25. Despite higher levels in total and specific lipid species-bound palmitate in NR as well as triglyceride levels, there was no difference in the trajectories during LI between R and NR (Extended Data Fig. 3a–l), suggesting that hepatic palmitate export may not have major impact on the insulin secretion phenotype during prediabetes remission.

We then assessed concentrations of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon to investigate whether incretin responses during the OGTT or sensitivity (see below) may explain improved insulin secretion in R. As expected, in both groups GLP-1 concentrations increased between 0 and 30 min, and then decreased at 120 min (Fig. 5a). While there was no substantial difference in the trajectories over time between groups (before, P = 0.13; after, P = 0.14), the GLP-1AUC substantially increased in NR (who maintained that their glucose levels in the prediabetic range or advanced to overt T2D) but remained stable in R despite reduction of glucose levels to normal (P = 0.78; Fig. 5a).

Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R (defined by NGR, that i,s prediabetes remission, after 12 months of LI) versus NR (that is, not reaching NGR) over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. Indicators above the time points indicate between-group difference at the respective time point derived from post hoc comparisons of the respective mixed effects models. ***P < 0.0001; FDR-corrected group × time P values: baseline—P = 0.29, 12 months—P = 0.29, AUC—P = 0.0008 (all to a); baseline—P = 0.63, 12 months—P = 0.38, AUC—P = 0.45 (all to b); baseline—P = 0.38, 12 months—P = 0.0079, AUC—P = 0.0012 (all to c). NS, nonsignificant.

GIP followed similar trajectories during the OGTT but remained elevated at 120 min in both groups (Fig. 5b). Neither group trajectories during the OGTT before or after nor GIPAUC differed between R and NR, rendering GIP unlikely to be involved in improved β-cell function during nonweight-loss prediabetes remission (Fig. 5b).

However, glucagon was lower in R and remained unchanged during the LI, whereas in NR glucagon showed an additional increase after the intervention (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, reduction in glucagon concentrations between 0 and 30 min during the OGTT remained stable in NR, but increased substantially in R (Fig. 5c), implying improved glucagonostatic and insulinotropic (considering improved insulin secretion) effects of GLP-1. Therefore, we then calculated the insulin secretion rate based on a previously published algorithm26,27,28 and plotted it against GLP-1 secretion as a measure of β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Indeed, these calculations display that β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity exhibited marked improvements in R, but not in NR (insulin secretion rate AUC—3,749 ± 401.1 to 4360 ± 382.5 in R and 4,381 ± 164.2 to 4,326 ± 170.1 in NR; GLP-1 AUC—122.1 ± 10.3 to 115.4 ± 13.3 in R and 142.5 ± 5.12 to 152.2 ± 5.96 in NR; P group over time = 0.0050; Extended Data Fig. 4).

Because of the recent data showing that prediabetes remission with weight loss reduces the risk for future T2D development13, we here investigated if remission of prediabetes despite the absence of weight loss or even with weight gain is also protective from future T2D development. Indeed, more NR than R developed T2D leading to a relative risk (RR) reduction of 71% in R over the period of up to 10 years (RR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09–0.91, P = 0.02; Fig. 6a,b) and thus prediabetes remission without weight loss was comparably protective for T2D development as prediabetes remission with weight loss (73%)13.

To exclude any potential effect that may be specific to our cohort and to enhance the generalizability of the results, we validated our findings in repository data from DPP. We also identified 494 individuals who did not lose or even gain body weight after 12 months of the intervention. Baseline characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 3. Similar to PLIS, R and NR increased BMI comparably, and NR increased VAT while R did not (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Additionally, R showed improved insulin sensitivity as well as insulin secretion (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c), even after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. Finally, individuals with prediabetes remission in DPP at 1 year without weight loss also had an RR reduction for future T2D of 73% (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.66, P < 0.0001) during a median follow-up time of 4.11 (IQR: 1.44, 13.48) years. These data reproduce the findings that prediabetes remission without weight loss is characterized by improved insulin sensitivity as well as improved insulin secretion and that excess lipid deposition into VAT may preclude persons from nonweight-loss prediabetes remission.

Moreover, recent data indicate that the 1 h glucose OGTT value may better predict the development of T2D than the 2 h OGTT value29. We, therefore, performed the same analysis by using the proposed 1 h cutoff of 155 mg dl−1 to identify participants as having prediabetes or NGR, but this change in criteria for prediabetes did not change our findings regarding glucose and insulin metabolism during prediabetes remission (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Our data show that remission of prediabetes without weight loss is a genuine and reproducible response to an LI in a substantial proportion of participants (up to 22%) and that the response is highly effective in preventing T2D. Individuals going into remission without losing body weight are characterized by increased SCAT/VAT ratio, indicating that the site of fat deposition during an LI determines the probability of prediabetes remission. Elegant studies have shown that physical exercise reduces glycemia with no or only marginal effects on body weight20,30. The studies in refs. 31,32 have shown that exercise without a weight loss effect can specifically reduce VAT. Additionally, diet composition has a role in VAT accumulation—diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to protect against VAT gain compared to those rich in saturated fats, even during overfeeding and weight gain33. Thus, physical exercise and dietary habits may have contributed to lower glycemia and to the observed SCAT and VAT distribution phenotype.

Moreover, non-weight-loss-associated prediabetes remission was characterized by a combination of higher insulin sensitivity and improved insulin secretion, which contrasts this response from weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission in PLIS and DPP where remission was characterized by improved insulin sensitivity but not secretion and T2D remission in DIRECT, which was accompanied by improved β-cell function but not insulin sensitivity13,21,34. Notably, prediabetes remission without weight loss was protective from T2D development with an RR reduction of >70%, and thus to a comparable degree as weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission in the previous study13. Taken together, these data show that distinct physiological mechanisms underlie non-weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes and that it is essential to differentiate between weight-loss and non-weight-loss strata, when investigating the mechanisms that can mediate prediabetes remission. Moreover, our data suggest that weight loss, as recommended in current guidelines, should be complemented by remission to NGR to prevent T2D in those people with prediabetes. This is in line with recent efforts delineating the clinical heterogeneity of obesity in projection for cardiometabolic diseases, specifically when cardiometabolic risk is discordant with the risk that is to be expected when obesity is classically defined solely by the BMI35. Furthermore, new statements and definitions of expert commissions for the diagnosis and management of obesity highlight the importance of body fat distribution and function beyond adiposity and underscore the clinical manifestation of organ dysfunction for the diagnosis of clinical obesity36,37.

While body weight trajectories were similar between groups, fat accumulation in SCAT was mainly observed in R and accumulation in VAT was observed in NR. The details in ref. 38 showed that large amounts of SCAT in combination with little visceral adiposity are associated with high insulin sensitivity during a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp. Exercise can favorably influence SCAT composition, even without weight loss39, and SCAT of regularly exercising individuals is more expandable than that of sedentary people with obesity40. The importance of exercise for improving insulin sensitivity has previously been demonstrated41; however, lean body mass and VO2 max, a marker of maximum aerobic capacity, were not different between R and NR. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that subtle differences in physical exercise (volume) may have impacted insulin sensitivity. Although we did not observe a difference in the PRS, the genetic basis of unfavorable body fat distribution and T2D risk has previously been reported42,43,44. Interestingly, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of oral glucose-lowering medications that activate the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, led to a redistribution of fat mass from VAT to SCAT depots. TZDs act as insulin sensitizers at least in part by this mechanism45,46. They have also been shown to increase body weight and to improve insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, similar to our observation with nonweight-loss prediabetes remission45,47.

This trend toward a favorable adipose tissue composition tracks closely with systemic adiponectin concentrations. Adiponectin is released by adipose tissue and is associated with increased systemic insulin sensitivity48. This finding is in line with recent findings of a gradual decrease of adiponectin levels from metabolically healthy lean to metabolically healthy obese to metabolically unhealthy obese persons49. Also, in the data presented here, adiponectin levels were higher in R after the intervention, which may contribute to their increased insulin sensitivity.

In R, but not NR, insulin secretion and β-cell function increased during LI. Palmitate, partly a product of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, has a particularly detrimental role in reducing β-cell function, most likely by inducing β-cell dedifferentiation50. Hepatic palmitate secretion has been shown to be modifiable by LI and reduced VLDL1 palmitate export from the liver has been shown to be linked with T2D remission in the DIRECT trial as well as remission maintenance after weight-loss-dependent remission25. In our study, in the setting of non-weight-loss prediabetes remission, VLDL1 palmitate export did not change between R and NR, implying that hepatic VLDL1 palmitate export may not be responsible for the lack of increase in β-cell function in the NR. However, we did not assess VLDL-production rates, previously demonstrated to be important for T2D remission25.

We then assessed the incretin system to explain the improvement in insulin secretion observed in R, but not in NR. Both GLP-1 and GIP enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion51. GLP-1 secretion after glucose ingestion is only minimally reduced in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as well as in T2D52,53. Exogenous application of GLP-1 in pharmacologically relevant doses largely maintains its effectiveness in IGT as well as in T2D54. GIP levels after glucose ingestion are in the normal range in IGT and may be elevated in T2D53,55. However, its effectiveness in augmenting insulin secretion is reduced56. In our cohort, GLP-1 and GIP time courses during OGTT were not different between groups. GLP-1AUC remained stable in R despite reduced glucose levels and increased insulin levels (Fig. 2). This may reflect improved GLP-1 sensitivity in R, potentially contributing to improved β-cell function by its improved insulinotropic effect that has been shown to be more pronounced during normoglycemic conditions57. Indeed, an index of β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity showed increased sensitivity in R, but not in NR. Because GLP-1 has a glucagonostatic effect58, improved GLP-1 sensitivity may be supported by the finding that R showed improved glucagon suppression during the OGTT. However, we cannot exclude that this could also be a consequence of the improvements in glucose regulation restoring the glucosuppressive effect on glucagon that may also be influenced by diet59.

Prediabetes remission without weight loss reduced the risk of subsequent T2D by 71% in our study. Previous studies of people with weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission showed similar risk reductions (73%)13,60, which is comparable to T2D risk reduction induced by pharmacological interventions61. In a post hoc analysis from the PROactive trial, weight gain with pioglitazone, a TZD, which leads to weight gain with a redistribution from VAT to SCAT and improvements in insulin sensitivity62,63, was associated with improved CV outcomes (excluding heart failure)64. Interestingly, recent data from our group show that prediabetes remission, in contrast to multimodal LIs targeting mainly weight loss, is also associated with reduced CV outcomes65,66.

Together, these data indicate that there is a weight-independent component of the glycemic status, which is related to body fat distribution. Indeed, individuals reaching both prediabetes remission and the guideline-recommended weight loss target of 7% are 76% less likely to develop T2D8, compared to the group that only met the weight loss target60. These data highlight the importance of incorporating glycemic targets into practice guidelines in addition to weight loss targets. Remission of prediabetes is the most effective way to prevent future T2D cases, and our current data indicate that this is partially independent of weight loss. In fact, sustainable weight loss is rarely achievable with >90% of weight loss recidivism and the probability of obtaining normal body weight is very low with less than 1 per 1,000 for men and less than 1 per 600 for women in individuals with severe obesity67,68. Therefore, from a clinical perspective, primary treatment goals should focus on achieving metabolic health rather than weight loss alone. Bringing prediabetic hyperglycemia back to normoglycemia seems to be an important contribution and indicator for metabolic health69.

This study is limited by the surrogate parameters derived from the OGTT for estimation of insulin sensitivity and secretion/β-cell function. Additionally, we cannot rule out confounders that were not assessed, such as genetic predisposition (beyond the investigated SNPs) and environmental factors. This study is additionally limited by the lack of a priori powering due to the post hoc nature of this analysis. To strengthen the validity of the data, we have therefore included data from the DPPOS cohort that replicate and support our current findings and interpretations. Additionally, the post hoc group stratification may lead to residual confounding effects, that is, the stratification into remission and nonremission leads to baseline differences, for example, in glucose levels, as has also been observed in studies investigating T2D remission mechanisms70 and in previous analyses from DPPOS10,11, which may affect the likelihood of remission at the individual level. Nonetheless, we show that for individuals who do achieve remission, the risk of future T2D development is substantially reduced—even in the absence of weight loss. This finding underscores the importance of incorporating remission as a core element of modern T2D prevention strategies, regardless of baseline. To minimize confounding of our results by baseline misclassification, we included fasting as well as postchallenge glucose and HbA1c into our definition of remission, whereby test–retest reliability has been shown to be up to 98.6%71. While spontaneous remission from prediabetes to normoglycemia might be observable even without LI72, our findings are not likely to be influenced by an erroneous classification.

We conclude that the protective effect of LI in individuals with prediabetes is not solely dependent on weight loss, as none of the participants included in the present analysis lost weight. Non-weight-loss prediabetes remission is characterized by a ‘TZD-like' body fat distribution. Current guideline recommendations involve multimodal LI with a focus on weight loss targets of 5–10%. In light of the current data, we recommend achieving metabolic health by incorporating glycemic targets to reach NGR (prediabetes remission) in addition to weight loss, thereby optimizing T2D risk reduction through a precision prevention approach. Specifically, LI needs to be tailored to the goal of prediabetes remission73.

Participants of the risk-stratified, randomized, controlled and multicenter PLIS were recruited between 1 March 2012 and 31 August 2016 to assess potential superiority of an intensified LI compared to conventional DPP-based LI in improving glucose tolerance in people with prediabetes at high risk for T2D development. Sex was determined through self-report. People with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose, IGT or both according to criteria from the ADA) between the ages of 18 and 75 years were included8. Participants with high IHL in addition to either high insulin resistance or low insulin secretion were stratified as high risk. After stratification, randomization of high-risk participants to receive either intensified LI or conventional LI and of low-risk participants to receive either conventional LI or a control intervention was performed. For this analysis, individuals from PLIS who did not experience weight loss over the 12-month period of those of the intensified LI, the conventional LI or the control intervention were included. Participants were classified as either R or NR. R were defined by return to normal fasting plasma glucose (that is, <5.6 mmol l−1), normal glucose tolerance (that is, 2 ­h post­load glucose <7.8 mmol l−1) and HbA1c less than 39 mmol mol−1 after 12 months of all three interventions. NR were defined by fasting plasma glucose, 2 h glucose or HbA1c higher than these thresholds after 12 months of all three interventions. Glucose regulation was assessed in the morning at 8 a.m. during an overnight fast through OGTT with blood sampling at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min using a 75 g glucose load (Accu-Check Dextro O.G.T.; Roche). Glucose concentrations were assessed using the glucose oxidase method in certified laboratories at each clinical study site. All insulin and C-peptide measurements were done at the Tübingen study site on an ADVIA Centaur XP system (Siemens Healthineers). Clinical chemistry parameters, including HbA1c, were assessed at the local routine diagnostic laboratories of the participating centers, and all of these were certified by the German accreditation council (DAkkS).

Volunteers participated in this study for a mean of 5.2 ± 2.8 years (max = 9.9 years). Adherence to the dietary intervention was assessed by evaluation of food diaries through the study counselors during the counseling sessions, where food diaries of 4 consecutive days were evaluated. The dietary goals were reduction of fat intake to <30% of total energy intake, reduction of saturated fat intake to <10% of total energy intake and increase of fiber intake to >15 g per 1,000 kcal total energy intake. Markers of physical activity and fitness were assessed by the VO2 max during ergometry, quantification of lean body mass and the HPA. The VO2 max was assessed as the maximal oxygen uptake during incremental physical exertion on an ergometer, lean body mass was estimated through bioelectric impedance analysis and the HPA based on the self-report that addressed the following main components: physical activity during work, physical activity during leisure time and sports during leisure time74. In a small subgroup of individuals, step counts were extracted to document daily distance walked (R/NR, n = 6/17). Further details of the intervention are provided elsewhere12. Of these measures, lean body mass and the HPA were continuously assessed. Follow-up is ongoing. Written informed consent was provided by each participant at inclusion. The study protocol is available online (https://www.dzdev.de/fileadmin/DZD/PDF/Papers/Forschung_KlinStud_Ethik_Studienprotokoll_PLIS_1.4.pdf) and approved by the ethics committee of the University Clinic of Tübingen (Tübingen, 55/2012; ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT01947595). Further details have been published previously12. Financial compensation for participants was granted exceptionally upon request, only if participants lived far away from the study center.

Repository data from the U.S. DPP study were analyzed to verify results from PLIS in a different population75,76. Participants were recruited from 23 clinical study centers in the United States between 31 July 1996 and 18 May 1999, and randomized to either LI or metformin or placebo groups. For the present analysis, data from LI and placebo group participants were used, who did not lose body weight during the first 12 ­months and had complete data on measurements of BMI, fasting and 30­-min insulin, and fasting, 30 ­min and 120-­min glucose during an OGTT.

Ethics approval for the study was provided by the institutional review board of each participating clinical center. Written informed consent was obtained from all DPP participants. The DPP study protocol is available online at https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/study/38.

This is a post hoc analysis of a prespecified endpoint in PLIS. Main outcomes are indexes of insulin secretion and sensitivity and distribution of body fat as main determinants of response or nonresponse to an LI.

The specifics of sampling and processing have been published elsewhere12. All measurements were taken from distinct participants. The following OGTT-based indexes for insulin sensitivity were calculated: OGIS index77, insulin sensitivity index78, the adipose tissue insulin resistance index79, muscle insulin sensitivity index80 and hepatic insulin resistance index81. To evaluate insulin secretion, we used C­-peptide AUC divided by glucose AUC during the first 30 min of the OGTT82. The Adaptation Index was calculated as (AUCc­pep0–30 divided by AUCgluc0–30) × OGIS to provide an integrated measure for insulin secretion adapted to underlying insulin resistance83. AUCc­pep0–120 divided by AUCins0–120 was calculated as a marker of hepatic insulin clearance84.

Insulin secretion rate was calculated by fitting C-peptide concentrations at each time point during the OGTT to an established model of C-peptide deconvolution26,27,28. An incremental area under the first 30 min of the curve resulting from this modeling was calculated using the trapezoidal rule85. An incremental AUC was obtained from GLP-1 measurements during the OGTT in a similar fashion. These values were plotted against each other to depict β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity, as previously described86. Insulin secretion and sensitivity were assessed from OGTT-based indexes in DPP in a similar fashion. Details have been previously published75,76.

The MRI was performed to measure muscle fat, subcutaneous and visceral fat compartments in PLIS. The applied methods are described in detail elsewhere12,87. VAT volume was determined from T1-weighted fast spin echo images that were assessed with a slice thickness of 10 mm (ref. 88). Segmentation of VAT was done between hip and thoracic diaphragm using an automatic fuzzy c-means algorithm and orthonormal snakes89. IHL was quantified in PLIS only. Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H­MRS) applying a single­voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode localization technique with short echo time in the posterior part of segment VII was applied for IHL assessment. The ratio of signal integrals of fat (methylene + methyl signal) and total signal (water + fat) was used to determine IHL content, which is expressed in percent. In one center, 1H-MRS was not available and IHL content was determined by a chemical-shift selective imaging technique that generates fat and water selective images as described elsewhere90. From these, manually determined regions of interest in liver segment 7 performed in fat and water selective images, respectively, were used for IHL-content assessment. To ensure comparability with MRS-guided assessments, IHL content was calculated by fat/(water + fat) × 100, including corrections for relaxation effects. Both techniques have been shown to yield comparable assessments of IHL content91. More details have been described previously92.

In DPP, VAT measurements were obtained by lumbar spine CT scans at L2, L3, L4 and L5. IHL and SCAT were not quantified in DPP. Only in PLIS, fat-selective MRI sequences were used to measure intramuscular fat fraction of musculus erector spinae and musculus spinalis thoracis. A region of interest avoiding macroscopic fat septae was manually drawn at the Th10/Th11 intervertebral level in a single axial slice90,92. Close proximity SCAT was used for reference (that is, 100%) and fat fractions were calculated12,87.

VLDL were isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation applying an NaCl density gradient (ρ = 1.006 g ml−1) at 541,000g for 60 min at 4 °C on an Optima Max-XP ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Subsequently, 60 µl of the VLDL-containing fraction were used for lipid extraction and shotgun analysis as previously described93,94. Lipid extracts were resuspended in IPA/MeOH/CHCl3 (4:2:1; vol/vol/vol) with 7.5 mM ammonium acetate and then infused through the TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advion Biosciences) into an Exploris 240 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer. All spectra were imported by LipidXplorer (1.2.8.1) into a MasterScan database. Lipid identification was carried out as described95.

Multianalyte profiling on the Luminex-100 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories), with a combination of Bio-Plex Pro Human Immunotherapy Panel 20-Plex, Bio-Plex Pro Huma Inflammation Panel, Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Panel and the 2-Plex Panel for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, was used to assess concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers in serum. Bio-Plex Multiplex Immunoassays (Bio-Rad Laboratories) are based on the xMAP Technology licensed from Luminex; all measurements were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocols. A detailed description of the methods is given elsewhere96. Serum concentrations of leptin (11-LEPHU-E01; Alpco) and high molecular weight adiponectin (80-ADPHU-E01; ALPCO) were determined using ELISA, following the manufacturer's instructions.

Plasma levels of total GIP, total GLP-1 and glucagon were measured as previously described using validated immunoassays97.

Individuals from PLIS were genotyped onto two different versions of the Illumina Global Screening Array chip (280 on GSA-MD-24v1 and 549 on GSA-MD-24v2). A previously described set of 205 SNPs for predicted VAT, including only genome-wide substantial variants described in ref. 24 were selected and subsequently restricted to 186 SNPs. Quality control was performed on all participants using the PLINK 1.9 software. SNPs exclusion criteria included missingness threshold of >5%, minor allele frequency <1% and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with P < 0.05. The summary statistics were downloaded from the NHGRI–EBI GWAS on 8 October 2024 for study GCST008744 (refs. 24,98).

Linear mixed effects models with group (that is, R and NR), time point and the interaction group × time point as model terms adjusted for age, sex, BMI, risk stratification and intervention intensity as fixed effects and each individual as random effect were fitted to analyze longitudinal data. Additionally, the model evaluating insulin secretion included insulin sensitivity as fixed effect. All group × time P values were corrected for multiplicity using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. To avoid overreliance on significance testing and dichotomization, we report β coefficients for all models, including 95% confidence intervals in Extended Data Fig. 9. Diagnostic plots were plotted for each model to ensure normal distribution of residuals by visual inspection. For group-wise, cross-sectional comparisons, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed. Resulting P values were also corrected for multiplicity of comparisons (Benjamini–Hochberg). T2D incidence up to almost 9 years after intervention end was compared through risk ratios and Fisher's exact test using the epitools package, version 0.5-10.1. A Kaplan–Meier curve with log-rank test is also reported.

Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio (version 2024.12.0 + 467) with R (version 4.4.1). In the PLIS dataset, missing values for liver, subcutaneous, and visceral fat were imputed using the mouse package (version 3.16.0). In the DPP dataset, no imputation was performed.

Ferroelectric topological textures have sparked intensive interest, due to their exciting applications in a new era of non-volatile and ultrahigh-density information storage. However, these textures remain largely dependent on the given heterostructures with engineered neighbouring layers to balance the competing energies. Here we report high-density polarization bubbles in van der Waals ferroelectric crystals CuInP2S6, without the need for a spatially confined heterostructure. From piezoresponse force microscopy, it is observed that the formation and distribution of bubble domains exist in the inherent coexistence of polar phases. Crucially, the phase ratio can be facilely tailored by external stimuli such as mechanical force, enabling the labyrinth domains to be manipulated into high-density isolated bubbles through a mechanism involving polar phase competition and flexoelectricity, as revealed through density functional theory and phase-field modelling. Our findings not only provide insights into the creation of topological structures in a controlled manner but also demonstrate potential memory applications based on bubble domains in van der Waals ferroelectrics.

There exists a polar phase with weak amplitude surrounding the polarization bubbles in the VPFM image.

a, The diagram of PFM scans across ferroelectric domain with Ising type wall and Néel type wall. b, The amplitude response for the typical case. A clear domain wall can be clearly visible in the amplitude image for Ising domain. The Néel-type bubble domain (region 2) typically exhibit weaker amplitude compared to the surrounding regions (region 1 and 3), making domain wall less visible in the amplitude image. c, The amplitude response for our case in the CuInP2S6 ferroelectrics. The Néel-type bubble domains are surrounded by weak-amplitude region. The comparable amplitude intensity between the bubble domain (region 2) and surrounding regions (regions 1 and 3) makes the domain walls more easily observable.

a, High-density elongated labyrinth domains. In some local region indicated by square boxes, the elongated labyrinth domains have evolved into isolated bubbles. b, High-density bubble domains. The elongated labyrinth domains are the precursor of bubbles as revealed by the weak phase signal (yellow) surrounding bubbles with labyrinth pattern. c, The zoomed-in image corresponding to the local area marked in panel a. d, The schematic evolution of elongated labyrinth domains disrupted into isolated bubbles.

The phase and amplitude images for vertical PFM (VPFM) and lateral PFM (LPFM) measured at four sample rotation angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90°. The LPFM results of the bubble domains clearly reveal tilted domain walls. For instance, the bubble marked by white circle exhibits an S-shaped form in its LPFM domain walls, as labeled by the white dashed circles. The scale bar is 200 nm.

a, The schematic of angle-resolved LPFM. The in-plane (IP) PFM was measured as a function of tip angle φ, with amplitude (A) and phase delay (θ) determined by fitting Acos(φ-θ-π/2). A and θ represent the polarization vector's length and angle relative to the defined direction, respectively. Numbers 1-4 denote sample rotation angles (0°, 30°, 60°, 90°). The piezoresponse vector field is constructed from IP components (Acosθ, Asinθ) as a function of position. b, Top view of reconstructed IP polarization field P, superimposed with color maps of IP piezoresponse vector map (θ). The distribution of polarization field demonstrates the center-divergence of IP polarization component. c, The trigonometric curve fittings for four representative points denoted as purple spots in panel b. d, The IP polarization field. e, Top view of 3D polarization field P, superimposed with color maps of the IP-phase (0°, 90° rotation) from the LPFM and out-of-plane (OP) phase (VPFM).

Source data

a, VPFM phase images. b, VPFM amplitude images. c, The schematic diagram for the distribution characteristics of bubble domains. Bubble domains tend to be densely distributed in the weak-amplitude region (HP phase) or near the boundaries of strong/weak amplitude region (LP/HP phase boundary). Notably, it can be observed that the weak-amplitude region with varied patterns significantly influences the bubble distribution.

a-b, PFM phase and amplitude images before (a) and after (b) the force scanning of ~2.8 μN using an AFM tip. The tip force leads to the formation of HP phase with weak piezo-amplitude and bubbles also tend to densely form in the weak-amplitude HP region, or near the boundaries of strong/weak-amplitude region (LP/HP phase boundary).

a, 3D PFM phase and amplitude image overlaid with topography for the region with the high-density elongated labyrinth domains. b, The corresponding 3D PFM phase and amplitude image after applying a force scanning of 2.8 μN. After the force scanning, weak-amplitude LP and strong-amplitude HP phases become spatially separated, with high-density bubbles formed in HP regions. The scanning area is 3 μm×3 μm.

a, The simulated high-density polarization bubbles. A bubble is circled in red for analyzing the charge concentration (ρₑ), internal field (Ez), and polarization configuration. The simulation dimensions are 2040 nm×2040 nm×120 nm. b, The OP electric field of the top surface for the red-circled bubble in panel a. c, Bound charge density of selected bubble domain in panel a. d, Cross-sectional polarization view for the circled bubble along the A-B line in panel a. The blue (red) center depicts counter-clockwise (clockwise) vortex domain wall center. e, OP polarization component obtained along the blue line marked in panel d.

Source data

a-b, The phase and amplitude after applying different pulse tip voltages (+60 V, +90 V and -90 V) at the central point of the scanning region (indicated by the white arrow) using the conductive tip, respectively. The bubble domains with net upward polarization (net Pup) and downward polarization (Pdown) are circled in white and yellow, respectively. c, The schematic polarization configuration and amplitude response of bubble before and after applying pulse voltage, respectively. d, The distinct conductive differences between the bubble domains with net Pup and Pdown. e, Large areas of conductive bubble domains.

Accurately solving the Schrödinger equation for intricate systems remains a prominent challenge in physical sciences. Here we present QiankunNet, a neural network quantum state (NNQS) framework that combines Transformer architectures with efficient autoregressive sampling to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation. At its core is a Transformer-based wave function ansatz that captures complex quantum correlations through attention mechanisms, effectively learning the structure of many-body states. The quantum state sampling employs layer-wise Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that naturally enforces electron number conservation while exploring orbital configurations. The framework incorporates physics-informed initialization using truncated configuration interaction solutions, providing principled starting points for variational optimization. Our systematic benchmarks demonstrate QiankunNet's versatility across different chemical systems. For molecular systems up to 30 spin orbitals, we achieved correlation energies reaching 99.9% of the full configuration interaction (FCI) benchmark, setting a new standard for neural network quantum states. Most notably, in treating the Fenton reaction mechanism, a fundamental process in biological oxidative stress, QiankunNet successfully handled a large CAS(46e,26o) active space, enabling accurate description of the complex electronic structure evolution during Fe(II) to Fe(III) oxidation.

Recently, the Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), giving rise to large language models (LLMs) with unprecedented capabilities1,2,3,4,5. Intrinsic versatility and adaptability of the Transformer architecture serve as the backbone of these LLMs, making it a powerful tool for addressing complex challenges, and its applications are extending far beyond language processing, permeating various domains and revolutionizing numerous fields. Particularly, deploying this architecture within the scientific field harbors the potential to propel us towards untapped frontiers of innovation and discovery. While the Transformer has demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks like image recognition6,7, protein representation and protein design8,9,10, and global weather forecasting11, and has shown promise in various quantum physics applications12,13,14, its potential for solving molecular Schrödinger equations through efficient autoregressive sampling and systematic application to complex chemical systems remains underexplored. Therefore, it is both fundamentally intriguing and practically important to explore the design of efficient Transformer-based architectures specifically tailored for solving the Schrödinger equation. Such architectures are expected to unlock new levels of understanding and advancements in quantum chemistry.

In principle, the electronic structure and properties of all materials can be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation to obtain the wave function. However, in practice, it is a significant challenge to find a general approach to reduce the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function and extract its essential features. Various methods have been developed to solve the Schrödinger equation for realistic systems. Considering the fermionic nature of electrons, Slater determinants are used to represent the electron systems, ensuring that the wave function obeys exchange antisymmetric symmetries. While the full configuration interaction (FCI) method provides a comprehensive approach to obtain the exact wavefunction, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space limits the size of feasible FCI simulations. To approximate the exact energy, several strategies have been devised, including perturbation theories15,16, the truncated configuration interaction which takes into account arbitrary linear combinations of excitations up to a certain order17, the coupled-cluster (CC) method which takes into account certain nonlinear combinations of excitations up to a certain order (e.g., CCSD, CCSD(T))18, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm19,20 which uses the one-dimensional matrix product state wave function ansatz, or the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method21,22,23 which works for any wave function ansatz. However, these methods can fail in numerous cases, mostly due to the limited expressive power of the wave function ansatz.

In 2017, Carleo and Troyer proposed their seminal work on the neural network quantum state (NNQS) algorithm, which introduced a groundbreaking approach for tackling many-spin systems within the exponentially large Hilbert space24. The main idea behind NNQS is to parameterize the quantum wave function with a neural network and optimize its parameters stochastically using the VMC algorithm. They also demonstrated that the neural network ansatz, when dealing with many-body quantum states, is more expressive than the tensor network states25,26,27,28,29, and its computational cost typically scales polynomially30. Moreover, as a general feature of Monte Carlo methods, large-scale parallelization can provide notable performance advantages. The NNQS framework has evolved along two distinct paths: first quantization14,30,31, which works directly in continuous space, and second quantization12,13,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42, which operates in a discrete basis. While first quantization methods naturally incorporate the complete basis set limit, they face challenges in sampling efficiency, particularly for larger systems where Markov chain sampling can become ineffective. Second quantization methods, though better at enforcing symmetries and boundary conditions, encounter scalability limitations due to the rapid growth of computational costs with system size. Current implementations face two major challenges: the computational burden of energy evaluation, which scales as the fourth power of the number of spin orbitals, and the increasing complexity of neural network architectures required for larger systems32,33. Molecular systems present additional challenges due to their complex electronic correlation patterns. This complexity demands highly expressive models that can be efficiently scaled to capture intricate quantum effects while remaining computationally tractable. The development of such models, capable of balancing expressiveness with computational efficiency, remains a central challenge in the field.

In this work, we present QiankunNet (Qiankun meaning “heaven and earth” in Chinese), a NNQS framework that combines the expressivity of Transformer architectures with efficient autoregressive sampling. At the heart of our approach lies a Transformer-based wave function ansatz that captures complex quantum correlations through its attention mechanism, effectively learning the structure of many-body states while maintaining parameter efficiency independent of system size, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Building upon the autoregressive sampling approach introduced in the Neural Autoregressive Quantum States (NAQS) method by Barrett et al.33, we develop an efficient batched implementation that reformulates quantum state sampling as a tree-structured generation process. While NAQS demonstrated autoregressive sampling for quantum states, our implementation specifically leverages the Transformer architecture's parallel processing capabilities and introduces several key innovations: we adopt a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based autoregressive sampling approach that introduces a hybrid breadth-first/depth-first search (BFS/DFS) strategy. This provides more sophisticated control over the sampling process through a tunable parameter that allows adjustment of the balance between exploration breadth and depth. Specifically, our approach first uses BFS to accumulate a certain number of samples, then performs batch-wise DFS sampling. This strategy significantly reduces memory usage while enabling computation of larger and deeper quantum systems by managing the exponential growth of the sampling tree more efficiently. We also implement explicit multi-process parallelization for distributed sampling, going beyond the single-process GPU parallelization used in NAQS. This enables our method to partition unique sample generation across multiple processes, significantly improving scalability for large quantum systems. Moreover, our implementation incorporates key-value (KV) caching specifically designed for Transformer-based architectures. While NAQS uses MLP-based models that don't benefit from such caching, our Transformer-based approach achieves substantial speedups by avoiding redundant computations of attention keys and values during the autoregressive generation process. This approach eliminates the need for Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, allowing direct generation of uncorrelated electron configurations. The framework is further enhanced by our physics-informed initialization scheme that incorporates truncated configuration interaction solutions, providing a principled starting point for variational optimization and significantly accelerates convergence. The framework's efficiency stems from our parallel implementation of local energy evaluation, utilizing a compressed Hamiltonian representation that significantly reduces memory requirements and computational cost. The sampling implementation employs an efficient pruning mechanism based on electron number conservation, substantially reducing the sampling space while maintaining physical validity. This combination of architectural innovations and computational optimizations enables QiankunNet to achieve both high accuracy and robust convergence. Our systematic benchmarks demonstrate unprecedented accuracy across diverse chemical systems: for molecular systems up to 30 spin orbitals, we achieve correlation energies reaching 99.9% of the FCI benchmark; most notably, in treating the Fenton reaction mechanism, QiankunNet successfully handles a large CAS(46e,26o) active space, enabling accurate description of complex transition metal electronic structure. These advances, from weak intermolecular forces to strongly correlated transition metal systems, demonstrate QiankunNet's broad applicability and pave the way for accurate quantum chemical calculations of previously intractable large-scale molecular systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we first present the theoretical framework of QiankunNet, followed by detailed benchmarks on various molecular systems, and conclude with discussions on future applications and potential improvements.

a The decoder-only Transformer architecture for the electron wave function ansatz, where the Transformer generates the amplitude ∣ψ(x)∣ and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) generates the phase ϕ(x). The wave function is expressed as ψ(x) = ∣ψ(x)∣eiϕ(x). b Training workflow of the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization. Starting from physics-informed initialization, the model parameters are updated through gradient descent to minimize the energy expectation value. The process involves autoregressive sampling of electron configurations, local energy calculation, and parameter updates via backpropagation.

To validate the effectiveness of QiankunNet, we compute the ground state energies of several molecules with an atomic basis set and compare them to results of other methods, such as Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster with up to double excitations (CCSD). Using a finite basis set, we can express the molecular Hamiltonian in the second quantized form:

Through the Jordan-Wigner transformation, this electronic Hamiltonian can be mapped to a spin Hamiltonian:

where σi are Pauli string operators and wi are real coefficients.

We also report results from NNQS methods using other neural-network ansatz (NAQS and MADE). As demonstrated in Table 1, QiankunNet achieves chemical accuracy in correlation energies, recovering 99.9% of the FCI ground-truth values across a benchmark set of 16 molecules. The method demonstrates encouraging performance when computing full potential energy surfaces, as evidenced by the C2 and N2 calculations with STO-3G basis set (Fig. 2). Notably, QiankunNet captures the correct qualitative behavior in regions where standard CCSD and CCSD(T) methods show limitations, particularly at dissociation distances where multi-reference character becomes significant. While more advanced methods like DMRG would provide more rigorous benchmarks for strongly correlated systems, our comparison with CCSD and CCSD(T) illustrates QiankunNet's potential for handling challenging electronic structures. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance with respect to its hyperparameters and pre-training strategies is provided in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S2).

Comparison of the energies obtained using QiankunNet and other traditional quantum chemistry approaches for a C2 and b N2, as a function of the nuclear separation with STO-3G basis set. QiankunNet outperforms all other approximation techniques. It agrees with full configuration interaction (FCI) results well even at structures where both coupled-cluster approaches (CCSD,CCSD(T)) failed due to the presence of strong correlations. FCI represents the exact solution within a given basis set. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

When comparing with other second-quantized NNQS approaches, the Transformer-based neural network adopted in QiankunNet can exhibit heightened accuracy. For example, the second quantized approaches, such as MADE method, cannot achieve the chemical accuracy for N2 system, while QiankunNet can achieve an accuracy two orders of magnitude higher. Another advanced second quantized method, NAQS, employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) augmented with hard-coded pre- and post-processing steps to maintain the autoregressive property. However, the complexity of NAQS's neural network scales with the number of spin orbitals, leading to a dramatic increase in computational demands and memory usage as the system size grows. For instance, for a C2H4O molecule with 38 spin orbitals, the GPU VRAM requirement soars to an unsustainable 454 GB, far surpassing the 80GB memory capacity of an A100 GPU. Conversely, QiankunNet incorporates a decoder-only Transformer, making the number of network parameters independent of the number of spin orbitals (our model can potentially be simultaneously used for systems with different numbers of spin orbitals), as a result, QiankunNet demonstrates a more favorable time scaling compared to NAQS, for systems with fewer than 24 spin orbitals, NAQS calculation is faster. However, when assessing a system with 30 spin orbitals, like Li2O, QiankunNet boasts a computational speed 10 times faster than NAQS, and the calculations with QiankunNet can be extended to chemical systems up to 92 spin-orbitals, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Beyond speed, our QiankunNet also exhibits higher accuracy. For instance, in the Li2O case, while NAQS captures 98.1% of the electron correlation energy, QiankunNet recovers an impressive 99.9% of the electron correlation energy. We also perform the calculation for the C2H4O molecule comprising 38 spin orbitals, and our method yields an energy of −151.1228 Ha, which is 2.32 mHa lower than the MADE approach (−151.12048 Ha)34. A detailed analysis of QiankunNet against other state-of-the-art Neural NNQS methods is presented in the Supplementary Information (Sec. S5, Tab. S2 and Fig. S1). We have also included results for the N2 molecule with bond length 2.118 Bohr in the cc-pVDZ basis set, which represents a significant computational challenge beyond the reach of conventional FCI methods. The N2/cc-pVDZ system (56 qubits, 14 electrons) contains 1.402 × 1012 configurations, making it intractable for FCI calculations. To our knowledge, no existing NNQS approaches have successfully tackled molecular systems of this scale in the full cc-pVDZ basis without approximations. Our method achieves a ground-state energy of −109.2788 Ha, which differs from the best DMRG result (−109.2821 Ha)43 by only 3.3 mHa. This represents the first demonstration of an NNQS method successfully handling a molecular system with over 1012 configurations, showcasing the method's capability beyond small, trivially-solvable systems. It is worth noting that our current calculation employs RHF orbitals as the single-particle basis. As demonstrated in quantum Monte Carlo studies44, using UHF orbitals typically leads to lower variational energies than using RHF orbitals. We expect that adopting UHF orbitals would further improve our energy and bring it even closer to the DMRG benchmark. However, even with RHF orbitals, our method achieves an accuracy within chemical precision (3.3 mHa), demonstrating the robustness of our approach across different orbital choices.

The measurements here refer to the wall-clock time during which these two methods perform calculations until convergence is achieved. All runtime measurements were obtained with exclusive access to computational resources to ensure accurate benchmarking. Experiments were conducted on one NVIDIA A100 GPU. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

Building upon these promising results, we now turn our attention to more complex reactions. The Fenton reaction, a fundamental process involving Fe(II) oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, plays a crucial role in biological oxidative stress and has significant implications in cellular damage mechanisms. Since its discovery in 189445, this reaction has been the subject of intense mechanistic debate46,47,48. While the mechanistic details remain controversial, here we focus on examining the electronic structure of its key step using our NNQS approach. Specifically, we study the homolytic dissociation of H2O2 catalyzed by aqueous Fe(II) at low pH, which generates OH• radicals and Fe(III) species:

We focus on the electronic structure of the reaction's key step: the homolytic bond dissociation in [Fe(H2O)5H2O2]2+. This octahedral complex, formed by substituting one water molecule in [Fe(H2O)6]2+ with hydrogen peroxide, serves as a model system for studying the aqueous ferrous ion's reactivity. The transition state geometry was optimized at the UB3LYP/def2-TZVP level of theory49. Our quantum simulation employs a CAS(46e,26o) active space with cc-pVTZ basis sets, where the active orbitals are selected using the automated AVAS (Automated Virtual Active Space) method49 (computational details are provided in Supplementary Information, Sec. S6, Tab. S3). This represents a significant expansion compared to previous studies 49 that employed a CAS(20e,13o) active space targeting only O2s+2p and Fe 3d electron shells. As shown in Fig. 4, our calculations reveal a higher transition state barrier (83 kcal/mol compared with 65 kcal/mol in previous work). The combination of a large basis set (cc-pVTZ) and extensive active space (46e,26o) enables us to accurately capture the electronic structure evolution during Fe-O bond cleavage. This success is particularly significant for transition metal chemistry, where the multi-reference character of electronic structures often challenges traditional methods. However, for a more complete description of this system, several additional factors need to be considered. While we use the relatively large cc-pVTZ basis set, even larger basis sets might be necessary for achieving higher accuracy in transition metal systems. Additionally, relativistic effects can significantly influence the electronic structure of transition metal complexes. Furthermore, given that this reaction occurs in solution, the inclusion of solvation effects is particularly important for obtaining quantitatively accurate energetics. These factors, while beyond the scope of our current study focusing on the electronic structure of the gas phase reaction, are crucial considerations for future investigations aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the Fenton reaction mechanism.

The blue curve represents our work using an expanded (46e,26o) active space, while the green dashed curve shows previous results from ref. 49 using a (20e, 13o) active space. The reaction pathway exhibits three distinct stages: initial formation of [Fe(H2O)5(H2O2)]2+ through H2O2 coordination to the octahedral [Fe(H2O)6]2+ complex (left molecular structure); transition state featuring O-O bond elongation (middle); and product state comprising an OH• radical and [Fe(OH)(H2O)5]2+ complex (right). Our larger active space calculations reveal a higher energy barrier (83 kcal/mol, compared with 65 kcal/mol) and more pronounced energy differences along the reaction pathway, particularly in the transition and product regions. Electronic structure calculations were performed incorporating Fe 3d and O 2s+2p shells with cc-pVTZ basis sets. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

In this study, we introduce QiankunNet, which adapts the Transformer architecture to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation. This marks a significant advancement in applying language model architectures to understand quantum electronic structures—the fundamental language of microscopic nature. Just as Transformer models have revolutionized NLP and protein structure prediction, we demonstrate their potential in capturing the intricate patterns of electron wave functions.

We acknowledge the pioneering work of Psiformer14 in applying attention mechanisms to electron–electron interactions. Through first-quantization approaches and complete variational treatment of basis sets, Psiformer achieved impressive absolute energies. Our approach complements this development by incorporating active space methods, allowing us to focus on chemically relevant orbitals and directly apply physical and chemical insights. This proves particularly advantageous when dealing with complex electronic structures and weak interactions. QiankunNet's distinctive feature lies in its decoder-only Transformer architecture combined with MCTS autoregressive sampling. Unlike traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods that require sample rejection and suffer from correlation issues, our autoregressive approach generates independent samples directly. The network learns during both sampling and inference phases, enhancing efficiency through parallel batch processing. This design makes QiankunNet particularly well-suited for GPU acceleration and large-scale applications.

This study establishes a fundamental connection between language modeling architectures and quantum electronic structure calculations. By adapting Transformer models to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation, we demonstrate their capability in capturing complex quantum mechanical phenomena. The success of neural network wavefunctions in ab initio calculations, exemplified by approaches like Psiformer and QiankunNet, suggests a promising direction for quantum chemistry. These methods combine high accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency, offering new possibilities for electronic structure calculations of complex molecular systems. The integration of physical insights through active space methods and direct sampling techniques further enhances their practical utility. We anticipate that such neural network-based approaches will become increasingly important tools in quantum chemistry, complementing existing methods in tackling challenging molecular systems.

In the study of quantum systems, we encounter complex structures characterized by N interacting components, each represented by discrete quantum variables \(\left\vert {{{\bf{x}}}}\right\rangle=\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},...{x}_{N}\}\). These variables might represent various physical quantities such as spin state or particle occupation numbers. The challenge lies in describing the many-body wave function, which establishes a sophisticated mapping between the configuration space and a vast landscape of complex numbers.

where each configuration is represented by an occupation number vector \(\left\vert {{{\bf{x}}}}\right\rangle=\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},...,{x}_{N}\}\), with xi ∈ {0, 1} indicating whether the i-th spin orbital is occupied or not. This mapping encodes both magnitude and phase information of the quantum state, essentially serving as a transformation engine that converts a given many-body configuration x into its corresponding quantum mechanical description Ψ(x). By leveraging artificial neural networks, we aim to construct an efficient approximation of the wave function's behavior. This neural network approach effectively creates a trainable computational framework that learns to replicate the wave function's response to different input configurations. Among the various neural architectures available in modern machine learning, we focus our investigation on the Transformer framework, particularly in its application to quantum many-body systems. The Transformer architecture implements a sophisticated attention-based structure: an embedding layer that maps the physical configurations into a high-dimensional representation space, followed by multiple self-attention layers that capture the intricate correlations between quantum variables. The architecture is particularly well-suited for quantum systems due to its ability to model long-range interactions and complex quantum correlations through its multi-head attention mechanism. The connection between NLP and quantum chemistry represents a substantive interdisciplinary bridge rather than a superficial analogy. By establishing a formal mathematical isomorphism between configuration strings in quantum systems and sentences in language models, we address the shared challenge of exponential complexity that has long hindered progress in both fields. Specifically, the Hilbert space dimension of 2N for N spin orbitals parallels the exponential growth of possible sentences in natural language, creating a compelling theoretical foundation for methodological transfer. In our implementation, Transformer architectures represent quantum wave functions with quantum bitstrings serving as inputs to predict the wave function. Particularly noteworthy is how the autoregressive property of Transformers enables efficient modeling of conditional probabilities in quantum states, mirroring their function in language prediction.

Our QiankunNet consists of two complementary sub-networks: the amplitude sub-network and the phase sub-network. This dual-network architecture effectively captures both the magnitude and phase information necessary to fully describe a quantum state:

where the amplitude sub-network is constructed using a Transformer decoder to represent the probability ∣Ψ(x)∣2, while the phase sub-network ϕ(x) employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as shown in Fig. 1a. The Transformer architecture1,5 is built from layers, each containing a self-attention component composed of multiple independent attention heads. These heads operate in parallel, each with its own set of parameters, allowing the network to simultaneously learn different types of correlations. Within each head, the attention mechanism works by computing how relevant each input position is to every other position, creating a rich network of relationships within the quantum state configuration. The processing of quantum states through our Transformer network follows a carefully designed sequence of steps. The initial state of the decoder is calculated using the input token vector and the position embedding matrix. We prepare the input by adding a special marker (a zero bit) at the beginning of the binary configuration. This augmented input then undergoes an embedding process, where each binary value is transformed into a rich, high-dimensional representation that captures the quantum mechanical properties of the system. The network takes as input a token/qubit vector x = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} of length n, which is transformed into embeddings:

where e(xi) represents the dmodel-dimensional learnable embedding of token xi, P is the matrix of learnable position embeddings, and PE(0) contains the combined embeddings for the input sequence at the initial layer. Position information plays a crucial role in quantum states, so we incorporate learned positional encodings for each site in the configuration. These encodings help the network understand the spatial relationships between different components of the quantum system. The embedded and position-encoded information then flows through multiple identical Transformer layers. Each layer in our architecture processes the quantum state information through several stages. The masked multi-head attention mechanism allows the network to learn complex correlations while maintaining the autoregressive property—ensuring that each position only influences those that come after it. For each decoder layer l = 1, 2, …, L, the following operations are performed: The masked multi-head self-attention mechanism computes:

where \(Q=P{E}^{(l-1)}{W}_{Q}^{(l)}\), \(K=P{E}^{(l-1)}{W}_{K}^{(l)}\), and \(V=P{E}^{(l-1)}{W}_{V}^{(l)}\) are the queries, keys, and values linearly transformed from the positionally encoded embeddings PE(l−1), M is the mask ensuring autoregressive property, and dk is the dimension of the keys. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied:

where Sublayer(l)(PE(l−1)) represents the output of the masked multi-head self-attention sublayer for layer l. Position-wise feed-forward networks with GeLU activation function process the information:

where \({W}_{1}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}\times {d}_{{{{\rm{ff}}}}}}\) and \({W}_{2}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{ff}}}}}\times {d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}}\) are weight matrices, \({b}_{1}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{ff}}}}}}\) and \({b}_{2}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}}\) are bias vectors, and GeLU is the Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function. The output for the next layer is set as:

which serves as input to the next layer or as the final output if l = L. After processing through L layers, the Transformer decoder's final output undergoes linear transformation and softmax activation to produce the conditional probability distribution:

where \({W}_{{{{\rm{out}}}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}\times {d}_{{{{\rm{out}}}}}}\) is the projection weight matrix for the output layer, and dout is the dimension of the output space. The probability of a sequence x = (x1, x2, …, xn) can be factorized as a product of conditional probabilities:

expressing the joint probability P(x) of the sequence as the product of conditional probabilities of each element xi given its preceding elements. The complex probability amplitude Ψ(x) for sequence x is defined as:

Here, Ψ(x) combines the square root of probability P(x) with a complex phase factor eiϕ(x). The phase ϕ(x) is represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron network that processes the input sequence x and outputs a real-valued phase, effectively encoding the complex quantum correlations present in the electronic wavefunction.

Monte Carlo sampling is used to generate samples {x1, x2, …, xN} for quantum states. A common choice is a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) black-box sampler. MCMC is a class of algorithms based on Markov chains for random sample generation, where the production of each state depends only on the previous state. A classic example of MCMC is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which uses an acceptance-rejection mechanism to decide whether to move to a new state.

It can be seen that a Markov chain that gradually approximates the target distribution \({p}_{\overrightarrow{\theta }}({{{\bf{x}}}})\) is constructed, so that the distribution of states on the chain eventually matches the target distribution. However, MCMC involves the sequential assessment of proposed configurations, while the computational cost increases in relation to both the desired quality of the sample collection and the overall quantity of samples. With a Metropolis sampling scheme, Choo et al.32 observed that the performance was highly dependent on the number of samples used, but this was constrained to a maximum batch size of Ns = 106. For VMC-based quantum chemistry, a more efficient scheme called autoregressive sampling can be introduced, which generates independent, uncorrelated samples directly from the target distribution. Rather than trying to model the distribution over every possible configuration of these discrete variables simultaneously, autoregressive sampling builds the distribution sequentially. It takes advantage of the fact that the probability of a specific configuration can be decomposed into the product of conditional probabilities. This approach allows for sampling one variable at a time, given the values of the previously sampled variables, thus reducing the complexity and computational burden significantly. Autoregressive sampling algorithm generates probability distributions p(x) of the special form

The autoregressive sampling scheme allows for the generation of exact samples without the need for a pre-thermalization step or the discarding of intermediate samples (which is necessary in Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to avoid autocorrelations). This makes autoregressive neural networks generally more efficient than MC sampling. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the generation of a single quantum state configuration uses QiankunNet's sequential autoregressive sampling scheme. The architecture shows how each orbital's occupation probability is computed conditionally based on previously sampled orbitals through the Transformer decoder layers. The probability distribution of the quantum states can be efficiently sampled by leveraging the factorization property ∣Ψ(x)∣2 = ∣Ψ(x1)∣2∣Ψ(x2∣x1)∣2∣Ψ(x3∣x1, x2)∣2 ⋯ ∣Ψ(xN∣x1, …, xN−1)∣2 and the masked attention mechanism that ensures the network output at position n only depends on positions m<n. We implement the sampling procedure by generating one bit at a time: we first compute ∣Ψ(x1)∣2 and sample the first bit x1, then using the sampled x1, we compute ∣Ψ(x2∣x1)∣2 and sample x2, followed by computing ∣Ψ(x3∣x1, x2)∣2 and sampling x3 using all previous bits, and so on until all N bits have been sampled. This sequential sampling strategy is essential for the VMC optimization of our neural quantum states, as it enables simultaneous sampling and network training: while generating configurations for energy estimation, the network parameters can be updated through gradient computation, effectively integrating the sampling and optimization processes into a unified workflow.

This approach consists of decoder layers that process sequential conditional probabilities, where each step computes the conditional probability of a quantum variable vk given its previous variables. The network includes a phase subnetwork that computes the phase ϕk, and all components contribute to the final wave function ∣ψk∣. The dashed arrows indicate the autoregressive sampling process, where each variable is sampled conditionally on previously generated variables. Green boxes represent input tokens \({v}_{k}^{i}\) at different positions in the sequence. Blue boxes denote the Transformer decoder layers and phase subnetwork components. Orange boxes show the sampling operations at each step. Red dashed boxes highlight the newly sampled variables at each step, while green solid boxes indicate previously sampled variables that serve as context for subsequent sampling. The summation symbol (∑) represents the aggregation of all contributions to compute the final wave function amplitude.

Moreover, our training employs a dynamic sample adjustment mechanism that monitors the number of unique quantum states generated during sampling and automatically adjusts the total sample size accordingly. Through this adaptive approach, the sampling process naturally adjusts to the complexity of different molecular systems and the convergence state of the model, ensuring efficient training without manual tuning of sampling parameters for each specific case. The sampling process naturally forms a Monte Carlo quaternary tree structure, where each layer corresponds to a spatial orbital. While our model represents each spin–orbital as a binary token (0 or 1), the MCTS algorithm groups spin-orbitals by spatial orbital for efficiency. Since each spatial orbital contains two spin-orbitals (spin-up and spin-down), this yields four possible combined states at each tree node: “00”, “01”, “10”, or “11”. This grouping reduces the tree depth from 2N to N levels for a system with N spatial orbitals, effectively building up the complete electronic configuration through a hierarchical sampling process. Figure 6 illustrates our batched autoregressive sampling implementation. Fig. 6a presents the algorithm for generating a single configuration, showing how orbital occupations are sampled sequentially with electron number constraints. Fig. 6b depicts the tree structure used for batch generation, where multiple samples are generated simultaneously using a combination of breadth-first search (BFS) for the first few orbitals followed by depth-first search (DFS) for the remaining orbitals. This hybrid approach balances exploration diversity with memory efficiency. In the initial phase, the system explores the first few orbital positions using BFS, assigning probability weights to possible orbital configurations. This ensures reasonable coverage of the sampling space, avoiding premature convergence to local optima. Subsequently, the system shifts to a DFS strategy for processing the remaining orbital positions, a key design primarily aimed at optimizing computational resources, especially memory usage. Through this depth-first approach, the system only needs to retain state information of the current sampling path in memory, rather than simultaneously storing complete states of all possible paths, significantly reducing memory requirements, as shown in Algorithm 2 within Supplementary Information. This memory-efficient design enables the model to handle larger-scale quantum systems without being strictly limited by hardware resources. This hybrid sampling strategy is not only more efficient in computational resource utilization but also maintains sampling diversity while guiding the sample distribution to converge to the minimum energy quantum state configuration, accurately characterizing the ground state properties of quantum many-body systems. A key feature of our MCTS sampling implementation is the incorporation of physical constraints through efficient pruning strategies. Since the total number of electrons Ne is conserved in quantum chemical systems, we can significantly reduce the sampling space by eliminating invalid branches of the sampling tree. This pruning mechanism ensures that we only sample physically meaningful configurations while significantly reducing the computational cost. This tree-like structure of our sampling procedure bears resemblance to the MCTS used in AlphaGo50, but with a crucial distinction: while AlphaGo's MCTS relies on extensive backtracking to explore the game tree and evaluate different strategies, our method employs pure forward autoregressive sampling without any backtracking. This fundamental difference arises from the distinct nature of quantum state sampling, where our goal is to efficiently generate physically valid electronic configurations that follow the wave function probability distribution, rather than exploring multiple strategic paths as in game-playing scenarios. The absence of backtracking in our approach not only simplifies the sampling process but also significantly enhances its computational efficiency while maintaining the ability to capture the quantum state's probability distribution accurately. This sampling strategy enables the simultaneous generation of multiple configuration samples, dramatically improving the efficiency of quantum Monte Carlo calculations. By generating independent samples directly, we eliminate both the correlation issues inherent in MCMC methods and the computational overhead of backtracking processes, while also enabling more accurate estimation of physical observables through larger sample batches. In Fig. 7, we showcase a comparison between the performance of MCMC sampling and the MCTS method for H2O system. From this comparison, it becomes evident that the computational time of the MCMC method increases as the number of samples grows, and the low acceptance probability associated with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm renders it inefficient for larger sample sizes. In contrast, the computational time of the MCTS method exhibits a nearly constant behavior, since it is primarily dependent on the number of unique samples. A computational efficiency improvement of several orders of magnitude is achieved compared to the MCMC method. Figure 7b illustrates that, with the same number of samples (e.g., 105), the MCTS method achieves chemical accuracy within 1500 steps, whereas the MCMC method fails to attain chemical accuracy even after an extensive number of steps.

a The autoregressive sampling (AS) algorithm generates one sample per run. Each node in (b) corresponds to a particular local sampling outcome, and the number on the edge pointing to each circle indicates the weight. Ns can be chosen to be any number (Ns = 1000 is used as an example). Each node has four possible states (unoccupied, spin-up, spin-down, or doubly occupied). The sampling proceeds layer by layer, with each layer corresponding to one orbital's occupation state. This sampling strategy combines Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) approaches. The tree is naturally pruned based on electron number conservation: branches that would lead to configurations with incorrect total electron numbers are eliminated (shown in gray dashed lines). This pruning significantly reduces the sampling space and ensures that only physically valid configurations are generated.

a The time comparison of H2O system for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) autoregressive sampling methods. In both cases, the QiankunNet is used for the wave function ansatz. b The convergence comparison of H2O between MCMC and MCTS sampling methods. Ns  = 105 is used as an example, where Ns denotes the number of samples used in the variational Monte Carlo calculation for estimating the energy expectation value.

The VMC algorithm then proceeds iteratively to optimize QiankunNet using energy as the loss function, as illustrated in Fig. 1b: at each step, we sample configurations from the current wave function ∣Ψ(x)∣2, compute the energy gradient using these samples, and update the network parameters using the AdamW optimizer, for more details, see Supplementary Information, Sec. S3 (Tab. S1). This process continues until we reach convergence, yielding a neural network representation of the ground state that minimizes the energy expectation value.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Spend an afternoon reading about quantum computing, and it won't take long until you stumble across the term “quantum supremacy.” While this is quite a lofty-sounding boast, the idea is relatively simple: If a a quantum computer—with its useful qubits in superposition—can do calculations that would be impossible (or hugely impractical) for a classical supercomputer to do, it has achieved quantum supremacy. 

Google first tried to claim the supremacy crown back in 2019, and researchers in China argued the same a year later. But in both cases, experts weren't so sure if true supremacy had been achieved. In Google's case, its Sycamore quantum computer completed a task in three minutes and 20 seconds that the company said would take a classical computer 10,000 years to complete. 

However, in 2024, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in China completed the task in 14 seconds using an impressively-powerful-but-undeniably-classical supercomputer. 

As New Scientist notes, proving supremacy is notoriously difficult because you need to be sure that classical algorithms could never solve the task placed upon the quantum computer in question—and it seems that scientists at the University of Texas at Austin have finally pulled it off. 

In a study published on the preprint server arXiv, the U.S.-based research team led by scientists at UT Austin report that they've successfully demonstrated “unconditional separation” between quantum and classical computers. 

“A longstanding goal in quantum information science is to demonstrate quantum computations that cannot be feasibly reproduced on a classical computer,” the authors wrote. “We construct a task for which the most space-efficient classical algorithm provably requires between 62 and 382 bits of memory, and solve it using only 12 qubits[…]. This form of quantum advantage—which we call quantum information supremacy—represents a new benchmark in quantum computing, one that does not rely on unproven conjectures.”

In the experiment, the quantum computer used qubits made from ions and controlled by lasers. Instead of creating some immensely complex calculation, the researchers focused on something a bit smaller. The aim was to show that a quantum device could solve a task using significantly fewer qubits than a classical computer would use classical bits.

Assigning ends of the system the standard experimental nicknames of Alice and Bob, the task required Alice to create a quantum state and Bob measure that state to understand its properties. The quantum computer then optimized this procedure until Bob's output could be predicted before Alice revealed its state, reports to New Scientist state. 

While a quantum computer required only 12 qubits to complete this task, the authors noted that a classical computer would need somewhere between 62 and 382 bits to perform the same task—undeniable evidence of quantum information supremacy. 

“Unlike prior demonstrations of quantum advantage that rely on unproven complexity assumptions, our result is provable and permanent: no future development in classical algorithms can close this gap.” the authors wrote. 

Although this is good to know, scientists already had a sneaking suspicion that quantum computing would eventually outshine its classical counterpart due to the superposition properties of qubits. The real work moving forward will be building fault-tolerant quantum computers with more than 1,000 qubits—and, excitingly, things are progressing. 

In a paper published this week in the journal Nature, Harvard scientists successfully demonstrated a coherent 3,000 qubit computer with new methods of error correction.

With quantum supremacy verifiably achieved, the work continues to make the promise of these futuristic computers a reality.

The ship, which sunk off the coast of Greece after striking a German mine during World War I, sits about 400 feet below the ocean's surface. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Diving nearly 400 feet into the ocean off the coast of the Greek island of Kea, a team of 11 navigated the sunken Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. In doing so, they retrieved a trove of artifacts, despite the strong current and poor visibility. 

The team wasn't able to grab every item they were after, due to the state of decay of the vessel and artifacts it houses. But the ship's lookout bell and port navigation lamp came to the surface in secure lift bags, along with ceramic tiles from the onboard Turkish bath, silver-plated first-class trays and a pair of items from the second-class cabins: a passenger's binoculars and a porcelain sink, according to a report from the Greek-language Kathimerini. 

Britannic, a slightly larger and newer sister ship of the Titanic, launched in 1914 as a White Star Line's Olympic-class luxury cruise liner, and was converted into a hospital ship for the British Royal Navy during World War I. While traveling to a hospital on the Greek island of Lemnos in November 1916, the ship hit a German mine off the coast of Kea. Less than an hour later, the Britannic had fully sunk. Tragically, thirty of the 1,065 people on board died when two lifeboats were sucked into the ship's still-moving propellers. 

The location of the wreck—about 45 miles southeast of Athens in the Aegean Sea—in deep and tumultuous waters have made the site's exploration tricky, open only to specialist divers. Under approval from Greece's Ministry of Culture, the 11-member multinational team used closed-circuit rebreathers to reach the Britannic, aiming for specific items during a weeklong effort this past spring.

But reaching the sunken ship was just the beginning of the difficulties. The divers had navigate tight quarters, in some cases with extremely fragile conditions. This, in addition to the aforementioned strong currents and poor visibility due to the depths to which they dove, made it impossible to retrieve all of the items they had hoped to resurface. 

Each item they did recover was placed in a lift bag, and then a protective container, and immediately cleaned of grime from over 100 years underwater. Once brought to shore, the Kea Police Department provided secure storage, and the items were then taken to the conservation laboratories at the Department of Underwater Antiquities in Athens as teams prepare them for display at the under-construction National Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Piraeus. A planned World War I exhibit will feature the Britannic's recovered items at the center.

Scientists found that climate change has been increasing the size of larger trees in the Amazon by about 3 percent per decade over the past three decades.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When the words “Amazon rainforest” and “climate change” appear in the same sentence, the news is rarely good.

Known as the “lungs of the planet” due to its immense concentration of vegetation, the Amazon is central to humanity's fight against climate change, acting as a vital carbon sink for humanity's greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the sprawling rainforest captures up to one-fourth of the CO2 absorbed by all of the land on Earth. That's why it's immensely bad news that in the past 40 years, the Amazon has lost roughly 121 million acres of rainforest—roughly the same size as the nation of Spain.

While the Amazon is helpless against the ecological wrecking ball known as humanity, a new study shows that it still retains a remarkable ability to adapt. Published in the journal Nature Plants, this study—completed by an international team of scientists and led by University of Cambridge ecologist Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert—details how climate change (specifically, the rise in carbon dioxide levels) is having a surprisingly positive effect on average tree size in the Amazon. 

“Large trees are hugely beneficial for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and this study confirms that,” Esquivel-Muelbert said in a press statement. “Despite concerns that climate change may negatively impact trees in the Amazon and undermine the carbon sink effect, the effect of CO2 in stimulating growth is still there. This shows the remarkable resilience of these forests, at least for now."

In the study, Esquivel-Muelbert and her team analyzed 188 permanent plots in the Amazon and found that the trees consistently grew larger than expected over the course of three decades. While this fertilization benefit from increased carbon dioxide impacts trees both small and large, the most profound impacts were witnessed in the latter category. Measurements of these larger trees' basal area—the cross-section of the tree when measured at roughly chest height—increased by 3.3 percent per decade. 

The authors note that this finding runs counter to the “large-trees-lose hypothesis,” which states that larger trees should be more susceptible to increased drought or windthrow (being uprooted by strong winds). 

The Amazon also isn't the only forest that's experiencing shifts due to climate change. A 2023 study from the University of New Brunswick in Canada found that boreal forests (northern high latitude forests) will grow 20 percent faster in 2050 due to warmer temperatures and the longer growing seasons they bring. 

But in both of these cases, the good news of chunkier or faster-growing trees may not necessarily outpace the climate change-induced disruptions these forests face—whether by humans, insect outbreaks, wildfires, or other extreme climate calamities. Reuters reports that 2024 was one of the worst years for tropical rainforest loss in history.

“What happens to big trees—including how they deal with increasing climate threats and manage to disperse their seeds—is now mission-critical,” Oliver Phillips, a co-author of the study and ecologist from the University of Leeds, said in a press release. “The only way the giants will stay healthy is if the Amazon ecosystem stays connected. Deforestation is a huge threat-multiplier and will kill them if we let it.”

Rainforests around the world will help us heal the planet as we transition away from fossil fuels to a green energy future. We just need to stop destroying them and let them get on with the job.

Too many papers, too little time.Credit: Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty

The challenge of staying up to date with the scientific literature has become a burden for everyone from students to senior investigators. In fields such as public health, annual publication counts now exceed half a million articles — more than 1,300 papers every day. Experienced researchers and early-career scientists alike report anxiety about falling behind and emphasize the importance of building efficient reading habits. Some have noted that the pressure to keep up has left many scientists increasingly reliant on social media and recommendation systems to find papers, rather than systematic reading. 

What's clear is that the difficulty of keeping up with the literature is no longer a niche problem, but one that cuts across disciplines, methodologies and seniority levels. As researchers at different stages of our scientific journeys — a PhD student, a mid-career investigator and a senior group leader — we, too, have faced this challenge. Collectively, we have spent decades navigating the scientific literature, testing different ways to filter information and adapting to the accelerating pace of publication. 

Here, we offer five complementary strategies to help you filter the literature and stay up to date on your research field. These are the strategies that we have found to be the most effective, and we hope that they will help others, too, whatever their field or career stage.

One of the simplest and most reliable ways to stay current is through journal table of contents (ToC) alerts. This conventional method might seem outdated in the age of personalized algorithms, but subscribing to a carefully curated selection of journals remains a sound strategy. Often, ToC alerts highlight key articles and provide direct links to abstracts or full texts. Some can even filter by article type and have specific alerts for reviews, editorials, research articles or methods papers.

Receiving a curated list of new papers from a handful of reputable journals provides a structured and predictable way to remain grounded in the core literature of your field. It's particularly helpful for recognizing recurring themes, spotting important reviews and following long-term shifts in editorial priorities — all without needing to actively search. We recommend subscribing to a blend of landmark and niche journals to capture both broad and field-specific research. 

You might miss important articles published in journals that fall outside your alert list. When browsing long tables of contents, especially under time pressure, it's easy to skim over titles that later prove relevant. Still, for many researchers, ToC alerts remain a first line of defence against information overload. 

Moving beyond broad overviews, use platforms such as PubMed and Google Scholar to create a personalized surveillance system that monitors the literature for the topics, authors or keywords that matter to you. Users can set up saved searches and automated alerts, which can be configured to arrive weekly or monthly by e-mail. 

Queries can incorporate Boolean operators (such as ‘AND', ‘OR' and ‘NOT') and be polished to reduce the number of irrelevant hits. This method is particularly useful for capturing articles that appear in lesser-known journals or are outside your usual reading scope. 

The same can be done for preprint servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, which allow users to set up RSS (really simple syndication) feeds or e-mail alerts on the basis of keywords, authors or subject areas. Including preprints in your alerts can give you early insight into emerging findings, methods and controversies because they frequently appear weeks or even months before peer-reviewed publication. 

That said, custom alerts require maintenance. Poorly constructed queries can return overwhelming — and often irrelevant — results. And even well-designed alerts can pile up in your inbox, adding to the very overload they're meant to reduce. Still, when used properly, search alerts across both peer-reviewed databases and preprint repositories can surface important literature with remarkable precision. 

Although many tools focus on topics or journals, an increasingly effective way to filter literature is to follow the researchers themselves. Professional networks such as ResearchGate and LinkedIn allow scientists to receive updates directly from the people and labs they care about. This person-centred approach can be particularly powerful for those who already know the key players in their field and want to monitor their scientific output in a more digestible, progressive format. For instance, ResearchGate can notify you when someone you follow uploads a new publication, preprint or data set. It also generates curated suggestions on the basis of your reading habits, recommendations and profile interests. These help to surface work that might otherwise be missed. Unlike static e-mail alerts, these feeds evolve as your network grows, offering a dynamic way to stay informed. 

This approach also has the advantage of reinforcing professional awareness. Associating papers with specific individuals or groups can help to contextualize findings, track thematic trajectories in laboratories and even identify potential collaborators or competitors. Some authors also post supplementary materials or tutorials that aren't always accessible through conventional journals, adding important context. 

Of course, not all researchers upload their work promptly, and some don't use these platforms at all. As with social media, the quality of your feed is only as strong as the network you build. Still, for those willing to invest the time, following the people behind the papers offers a valuable, filtered window into the scientific landscape. A good tip for getting started is to identify active users in your field and screen their followers and followings for inspiration. 

Researchers increasingly use social-media platforms such as X and Bluesky to share their latest publications, discuss preprints, highlight interesting studies and comment on scientific developments. Following the right accounts can provide a curated stream of relevant papers and ideas, often before they appear in journals or search alerts. These platforms also allow you to interact with researchers you might otherwise meet only at conferences — or perhaps be too shy to approach in person.

In an opinion piece published in The New York Times in March, two leading virologists argued that experiments on a coronavirus found in bats and similar to those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had been conducted without sufficient safety measures. The experiments involved infecting human cells with the live bat virus to see how the virus behaved1.

Regulatory authorities in many countries where research on potentially dangerous viruses is conducted, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, would require such studies to be conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities. (There are four biosafety levels, with BSL-4 being the most stringent.) But for these experiments — which were approved by the equivalent authorities in China — the 25 researchers across 7 institutes and universities in China (including the Guangzhou National Laboratory and the Wuhan Institute of Virology) used BSL-2 procedures. They also used a negative pressure ventilation system designed to prevent microorganisms from spreading outside the laboratory.

In our view, this work and the discussion it has provoked highlights a broader and growing problem that the entire virology community needs to address. On the one hand, the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases is growing2,3 (see ‘A growing threat'), making investigations of potentially dangerous viruses more important. On the other hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in virology and science more broadly has declined and work on viruses has become more politicized.

To improve trust in science — and to ensure that essential work on viruses can continue — international, standardized and transparent biosafety guidance is urgently needed. Here, we lay out how such guidance might be developed.

Source: Ref. 6

Over the past 30–40 years, various protocols and procedures have been introduced to reduce the risk of viruses escaping from labs, or of people being infected by viruses used in research.

Today, researchers in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States, can work on certain ‘dangerous' viruses only if they use biosafety cabinets, personal protective equipment and strict standardized procedures for BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities. The use of negative pressure, which ensures that the air in a facility leaves through a filter that captures pathogens, and strict controls over access to the facility are also required.

Which viruses qualify as dangerous is decided by the government of each country, and is usually listed as an appendix to the regulations governing the work. In the United States, federal funding for research involving the enhancement of viruses that cause influenza, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — whether through the use of genetic manipulation or by harnessing natural evolutionary processes — was banned in 2014. The ban was lifted in 2017, but research is only permitted after a stringent review process and with the use of BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities4. These rules are likely to change again under the current US administration.

In China, national biosafety laws were updated in 2004 and 2020. These require investigators undertaking studies on potentially pathogenic living organisms to use BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities, among other strict precautions5. It is unclear exactly how these rules are enforced, however. They don't seem to have been applied to the experiments on the MERS-like coronavirus found in bats, which were approved by the Wuhan Institute of Virology institutional biosafety committee.

The level of detail included in regulations also varies. For example, Canada uses the Canadian Biosafety Standard, which lays out exactly how containment is to be achieved. The United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have similar standards. Many other countries, however, do not provide such detailed information, although they might provide details of the containment levels necessary for certain pathogens.

This patchwork regulation has led to confusion in the field. And the lack of transparency has probably made it easier for people to spread misinformation and fake news around the handling of live viruses in research.

More than five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the controversy about its origins shows no sign of abating. According to the lab-leak theory (now promoted by the administration of US President Donald Trump), research on bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the accidental infection of lab personnel, which in turn sparked the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the institute is known to have been doing research on coronaviruses before the pandemic, there is no firm evidence that it possessed or conducted work on a SARS-CoV-2 precursor virus. Meanwhile, findings indicating that the pandemic resulted from a natural ‘spillover' event, the epicentre of which was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, continue to accumulate. (A spillover event is the transmission of what is called a zoonotic virus from other animals to humans.)

In our experience, virologists are often reluctant to engage in discussions about work that involves the enhancement of live viruses — either genetically or through natural evolutionary processes — for fear of being caught in the crosshairs or of their own work being shut down, even if it is low risk. But now is not the time to lie low.

The number of outbreaks and deaths caused by viruses such as those that cause SARS, Ebola and mpox has been increasing. Data scientists predict that, if current trends continue, Nipah virus, Machupo virus, coronaviruses and filoviruses will, compared with 2020, cause 4 times as many spillover events and 12 times as many deaths by 2050 because of global travel, climate change, tropical deforestation, and wild-animal hunting and trade6,7.

And although virologists now have various ways of studying viruses that can spread between animals and humans, besides growing fully functional zoonotic viruses in the lab, experiments involving live viruses are key to testing antiviral drugs and vaccines. It's hard to imagine how it would have been possible for researchers to develop COVID-19 vaccines, for instance — estimated to have saved millions of lives since 2021 — without studies on live SARS-CoV-2 (and earlier work on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in animal models.

Given the crisis of mistrust in science and institutions, and an increasingly fractured geopolitical world, unified international guidelines are crucial for protecting essential research involving dangerous viruses.

Centralized, standardized guidelines would be analogous to the guidelines for research on human embryos produced by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) — an organization that includes investigators in more than 80 countries. They would be similar to national regulations for research on dangerous viruses, but on a global level. They could lay out what factors might make the use of a particular virus or approach high risk or what benefit-to-cost ratio might justify a research project being pursued or blocked, for example.

Some scenarios should not be allowed to happen. If an investigator is working on the H5N1 bird flu virus in a BSL-3 facility, for instance, they should take strict precautions to prevent viral strains that cause human seasonal flu from entering the facility, even though seasonal flu is not considered a dangerous virus. This is because strains of flu virus can exchange RNA fragments. Such exchange could make H5N1 more transmissible in humans.

After the formation of the Solar System, it took a maximum of three million years for the chemical composition of the Earth's precursor to be completed. This is shown by a new study by the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern. At this time, however, there were hardly any elements necessary for life such as water or carbon compounds on the young planet. Only a later planetary collision probably brought water to Earth, paving the way for life.

Earth is so far the only known planet on which life exists -- with liquid water and a stable atmosphere. However, the conditions were not conducive to life when it formed. The gas-dust cloud from which all the planets in the Solar System formed was rich in volatile elements essential for life, such as hydrogen, carbon and sulphur. However, in the inner Solar System -- the part closest to the Sun, where the four rocky planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars and the asteroid belt are located today -- these volatile elements could hardly exist: Due to the high temperature of the Sun, they did not condense and initially remained largely in the gas phase. As these gaseous substances were not incorporated into the solid rocky materials from which the planets were formed, the early precursor of the Earth, the so-called proto-Earth, also contained very little of these vital substances. Only celestial bodies that formed further away from the Sun in cooler regions were able to incorporate these components. When and how the Earth became a life-friendly planet is still not fully understood.

In a new study, researchers from the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern have now been able to show for the first time that the chemical composition of the early Earth was complete no later than three million years after the formation of the Solar System -- and in a way that initially made the emergence of life impossible. Their results, recently published in the journal Science Advances, suggest that life on Earth was only made possible by a later event. Dr. Pascal Kruttasch is first author of the study, which was part of his dissertation at the Institute of Geological Sciences and was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Kruttasch is now an SNSF Postdoc Mobility Fellow at Imperial College London.

Using a precise clock to measure the history of the Earth's formation

The research team used a combination of isotope and element data from meteorites and terrestrial rocks to reconstruct the process of the Earth's formation. Using model calculations, the researchers were able to narrow down in time how the chemical composition of the Earth developed in comparison to other planetary building blocks.

Kruttasch explains: "A high-precision time measurement system based on the radioactive decay of manganese-53 was used to determine the precise age. This isotope was present in the early Solar System and decayed to chromium-53 with a half-life of around 3.8 million years." This method allowed ages to be determined with an accuracy of less than one million years for materials that are several billion years old. "These measurements were only possible because the University of Bern has internationally recognized expertise and infrastructure for the analysis of extraterrestrial materials and is a leader in the field of isotope geochemistry," says co-author Klaus Mezger, Professor Emeritus of Geochemistry at the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern.

Life on Earth thanks to a cosmic coincidence?

Using model calculations, the research team was able to show that the chemical signature of the proto-Earth, i.e. the unique pattern of chemical substances of which it is composed, was already complete less than three million years after the formation of the Solar System. Their study thus provides empirical data on the time of formation of the original material of the young Earth. "Our Solar System formed around 4,568 million years ago. Considering that it only took up to 3 million years to determine the chemical properties of the Earth, this is surprisingly fast," says first author Kruttasch.

The results of the study thus support the assumption that a later collision with another planet -- Theia -- brought the decisive turning point and made the Earth a life-friendly planet. Theia probably formed further out in the Solar System, where volatile substances such as water accumulated. "Thanks to our results, we know that the proto-Earth was initially a dry rocky planet. It can therefore be assumed that it was only the collision with Theia that brought volatile elements to Earth and ultimately made life possible there," says Kruttasch.

Life-friendliness in the universe cannot be taken for granted

The new study contributes significantly to our understanding of the processes in the early phase of the Solar System and provides clues as to when and how planets on which life is possible can form. "The Earth does not owe its current life-friendliness to a continuous development, but probably to a chance event -- the late impact of a foreign, water-rich body. This makes it clear that life-friendliness in the universe is anything but a matter of course," says Mezger.

The next step would be to investigate the collision event between proto-Earth and Theia in more detail. "So far, this collision event is insufficiently understood. Models are needed that can fully explain not only the physical properties of the Earth and Moon, but also their chemical composition and isotope signatures," concludes Kruttasch.

When a woman becomes pregnant, the outcome of that pregnancy depends on many things -- including a crucial event that happened while she was still growing inside her own mother's womb. It depends on the quality of the egg cells that were already forming inside her fetal ovaries. The DNA-containing chromosomes in those cells must be cut, spliced and sorted perfectly. In males, the same process produces sperm in the testes but occurs only after puberty.

"If that goes wrong, then you end up with the wrong number of chromosomes in the eggs or sperm," said Neil Hunter, a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of California, Davis. "This can result in infertility, miscarriage or the birth of children with genetic diseases."

In a paper published Sept. 24 in the journal Nature, Hunter's team reports a major new discovery about a process that helps safeguard against these mistakes. He has pieced together the choreography of proteins that connect matching chromosome pairs -- ensuring that they are sorted correctly as egg and sperm cells develop and divide.

Hunter's discoveries required methods to watch the molecular events of chromosome recombination unfold with unprecedented detail. This involved genetic engineering in budding yeast -- a model organism that has been used for decades to discover how fundamental cellular processes work.

"The chromosome structures that we studied have changed very little across evolution," Hunter said. "Every protein that we looked at in yeast has a direct counterpart in humans." His findings could improve our understanding of fertility problems and how they are diagnosed and treated in humans.

Forming chromosome crossovers for strong connections

Humans have 46 chromosomes in each of our cells, made up of 23 pairs of matching, "homologous" chromosomes, with one of each pair inherited from each parent. Early in the process of making sperm or eggs, those chromosome pairs line up, and the parental chromosomes break and rejoin to each other. These chromosome exchanges, called "crossovers," serve two important functions.

First, they help ensure that each chromosome that is passed on to the offspring contains a unique mixture of genes from both parents. Crossovers also keep the chromosomes connected in matching pairs. These connections guide the distribution of chromosomes when cells divide to produce eggs and sperm. Maintaining crossover connections is especially crucial in females, Hunter said.

As chromosomes pair up in developing egg or sperm cells, matching DNA strands are exchanged and twined together over a short distance to form a structure called a "double Holliday junction." DNA strands of this structure are then cut to join the chromosomes forming a crossover.

In males, developing immature sperm cells then immediately divide and distribute chromosomes to the sperm. In contrast, egg cells developing in the fetal ovary arrest their development after crossovers have formed. The immature egg cells can remain in suspended animation for decades after birth, until they are activated to undergo ovulation.

Only then does the process lurch back into motion: The egg cell finally divides, and the chromosome pairs that were connected by crossovers are finally separated to deliver a single set of chromosomes to the mature egg. "Maintaining the crossover connections over many years is a major challenge for immature egg cells," Hunter said.

If chromosome pairs aren't connected by at least one crossover, they can lose contact with each other, like two people separated in a jostling crowd. This causes them to segregate incorrectly when the cell finally divides, producing egg cells with extra or missing chromosomes. This can cause infertility, miscarriage or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome, in which a child is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to cognitive impairment, heart defects, hearing loss and other problems.

From yeast to humans

Hunter has spent years trying to understand how crossovers form and how this process can fail and cause reproductive problems. By studying this process in yeast, researchers can directly visualize molecular events of double-Holliday junction resolution in synchronized populations of cells.

Researchers have identified dozens of proteins that bind and process these junctions. Hunter and then-postdoctoral fellow Shangming Tang (now an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Virginia) used a technique called "real-time genetics" to investigate the function of those proteins. With this method, they made cells degrade one or more specific proteins within the junction-associated structures. They could then analyze the DNA from these cells, to see whether the junctions were resolved and if they formed crossovers. In this way, they built up a picture in which a network of proteins function together to ensure that crossovers are formed.

"This strategy allowed us to answer a question that previously wasn't possible," Hunter said.

They identified key proteins such as cohesin that prevent an enzyme called the STR complex (or Bloom complex in humans) from inappropriately dismantling the junctions before they can form crossovers.

"They protect the double Holliday junction," Hunter said. "That is a key discovery."

This years-long research project in yeast is broadly relevant for human reproduction because the process has changed very little during evolution. Failure to protect double-Holliday junctions may be linked to fertility problems in humans.

In addition to Tang, the postdoc, seven undergraduates in the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences contributed to this work, including Jennifer Koo, Mohammad Pourhosseinzadeh, Emerald Nguyen, Natalie Liu, Christopher Ma, Hanyu Lu and Monica Lee.

Additional authors on the paper include Sara Hariri, Regina Bohn and John E. McCarthy, all members of the Hunter lab.

Hunter's research is funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His work has also received funding from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, the American Cancer Society, the Concern Foundation for Cancer Research, and the Damon Runyon Cancer Foundation.

Hunter's research on crossover and homologous recombination uses advanced scientific facilities at the university's Proteomics Core Facility, MCB Light Microscopy Imaging Facility, Genome Center, Mouse Biology Program, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Physicists in Australia and Britain have reshaped quantum uncertainty to sidestep the restriction imposed by the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle - a result that could underpin future ultra-precise sensor technology used in navigation, medicine and astronomy.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, introduced in 1927, says that you can't know certain pairs of properties - such as a particle's position and momentum - with unlimited precision at the same time. In other words, there is always a trade-off in uncertainty: the more closely one property is pinned down, the less certainty there is about the other.

In research published Sept. 24 in Science Advances, a team led by Dr Tingrei Tan from the University of Sydney Nano Institute and School of Physics has shown how to engineer a different trade-off to precisely measure position and momentum at the same time.

"Think of uncertainty like air in a balloon," said Dr Tan, a Sydney Horizon Fellow in the Faculty of Science. "You can't remove it without popping the balloon, but you can squeeze it around to shift it. That's effectively what we've done. We push the unavoidable quantum uncertainty to places we don't care about (big, coarse jumps in position and momentum) so the fine details we do care about can be measured more precisely."

The researchers also use the analogy of a clock to explain their findings (see image). Think of a normal clock with two hands: the hour hand and the minute hand. Now imagine the clock only has one hand. If it's the hour hand, you can tell what hour it is and roughly what minute, but the minute reading will be very imprecise. If the clock only has the minute hand, you can read the minutes very precisely, but you lose track of the larger context - specifically, which hour you're in. This 'modular' measurement sacrifices some global information in exchange for much finer detail.

"By applying this strategy in quantum systems, we can measure the changes in both position and momentum of a particle far more precisely," said first author Dr Christophe Valahu from the Quantum Control Laboratory team at the University of Sydney. "We give up global information but gain the ability to detect tiny changes with unprecedented sensitivity."

Quantum computing tools for a new sensing protocol

This strategy was outlined theoretically in 2017. Here, Dr Tan's team performed the first experimental demonstration by using a technological approach they had previously developed for error-corrected quantum computers, a result recently published in Nature Physics.

"It's a neat crossover from quantum computing to sensing," said co-author Professor Nicolas Menicucci, a theorist from RMIT University. "Ideas first designed for robust quantum computers can be repurposed so that sensors pick up weaker signals without being drowned out by quantum noise.

The Sydney team implemented the sensing protocol using the tiny vibrational motion of a trapped ion - the quantum equivalent of a pendulum. They prepared the ion in "grid states," a kind of quantum state originally developed for error-corrected quantum computing. With this, they showed that both position and momentum can be measured together with precision beyond the 'standard quantum limit' - the best achievable using only classical sensors.

"We haven't broken Heisenberg's principle. Our protocol works entirely within quantum mechanics," said Dr Ben Baragiola, co-author from RMIT. "The scheme is optimised for small signals, where fine details matter more than coarse ones.

Why it matters

The ability to detect extremely small changes is important across science and technology. Ultra-precise quantum sensors could sharpen navigation in environments where GPS doesn't work (such as submarines, underground or spaceflight); enhance biological and medical imaging; monitor materials and gravitational systems; or probe fundamental physics.

While still at the laboratory stage, the experiment demonstrates a new framework for future sensing technologies targeted towards measuring tiny signals. Rather than replacing existing approaches, it adds a complementary tool to the quantum-sensing toolbox.

"Just as atomic clocks transformed navigation and telecommunications, quantum-enhanced sensors with extreme sensitivity could enable whole new industries," said Dr Valahu.

A collaborative effort

This project united experimentalists at the University of Sydney with theorists at RMIT, the University of Melbourne, Macquarie University and the University of Bristol in Britain. It shows how collaboration across institutions and borders can accelerate progress and strengthen Australia's quantum research community.

"This work highlights the power of collaboration and the international connections that drive discovery," Dr Tan said.

Long in the Bluetooth.

Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have identified several design flaws in Tile's location trackers that could be exploited to stalk the device's owner.

Wired reported that Georgia Tech's Akshaya Kumar, Anna Raymaker, and Michael Specter discovered problems affecting both individual Tile devices and the methods those devices use to communicate with infrastructure managed by Tile owner Life360.

The trio "found that each tag broadcasts an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that can be picked up by other Bluetooth devices or radio-frequency antennas in a tag's vicinity to track the movements of the tag and its owner," Wired reported.

Gathering that information is trivial and common. The New York Times reported in 2019 that retailers were using Bluetooth beacons to track people's movement through their stores, for example, and so-called "sniffers" are readily available to individuals. Such devices are even somewhat common in smart-home setups.

Those methods of collecting data about location trackers would also circumvent the safeguards Tile added to its devices in 2023. Those protections, which the company introduced after several high-profile incidents of location trackers being used by thieves, stalkers, and other criminals, apply only to the misuse of its products.

But that isn't what's happening here. Those safeguards are supposed to make it more difficult for a Tile owner to stalk someone by slipping a tracker into their bag, for example. However, those same safeguards cannot determine if the Tile is communicating with a seemingly innocuous Bluetooth device while it's still in the owner's possession.

That wasn't the only issue. Wired reported "the location of a tag, its MAC address, and unique ID also get sent unencrypted to Tile's servers, where the researchers believe this information is stored in cleartext, giving Tile the ability to track the location of tags and their owners, even though the company claims it does not have this capability."

The problem, of course, is the difference between claiming not to currently have this capability and ensuring that this capability won't be developed later. Encrypting this data wouldn't just protect it now; it would also ensure that historical data can't be misused by Life360, cybercriminals, or even government agencies in the future.

Assuming this is true, which it may not be given that the deficit (not debt…) continues to rise despite the tariff revenues, it basically points to the fact that the US is cutting taxes on the richest and funding it with a federal sales tax on all.

What happens to rating agencies that dare cut US ratings? Surely nothing good. So they will keep saying things are good - either because they are, or because they aren't, but they cannot say.But then of course ratings, especially of sovereign debt, are kind of meaningless anyway. The ratings agencies don't have any extra information or deeper analysis available. They know as much as a basic investor, but have no upside in being smarter. The ratings revisions are always reactive, and only really matter because plenty of investors have to avoid bonds below a certain grade.So it's a demeaning of a meaningless number perhaps.

When Elon Musk gave two Nazi-style salutes the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) came to the billionaire's defense, saying it was just an “awkward gesture.” But Musk clearly doesn't have the same kind of affection for the ADL.

“The ADL hates Christians, therefore it is is a hate group,” Musk wrote in a tweet Sunday.

The ADL hates Christians, therefore it is is a hate group

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 28, 2025



The billionaire Tesla CEO was responding to a tweet from an account called @iamyesyouareno, which has about half a million followers. The pseudonymous account wrote, “The ADL considers Christianity a hateful terrorist extremist belief. You don't hate the ADL enough.” 

Christian Identity (notice the capitalization of the I in Identity) is an extremist ideology that believes Jews are the Satanic offspring of the biblical Eve and the Serpent from the Garden of Eden. All of that is explained in the ADL's page for Christian Identity.

It's not clear if Musk understands the difference between Christian Identity as a specific extremist ideology and small-i Christian identity. The far-right billionaire often operates in bad faith while discussing politics on X, the platform he owns, but he also simply isn't that smart when it comes to many topics.

Reached for comment over email, the ADL pointed Gizmodo to a statement from the ADL on the organization's X account explaining the Christian Identity ideology. Replies for that tweet have been turned off, perhaps because X has itself become an extremist platform filled with anti-semitic hate since Musk bought the site in late 2022.

The ADL also sent Gizmodo a link to a tweet from CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who wrote that the idea ADL is anti-Christian is “offensive and wrong.”

“Many of our staff members are Christian. Many of our supporters are Christian,” Greenblatt tweeted. “We are blessed to work with many Christian brothers and sisters in the shared fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate. In contrast, the Christian Identity movement is an antisemitic, racist, and unambiguously poisonous ideology. Its values bear no resemblance to those of any mainstream Christian denomination.”

Replies to Greenblatt's tweets have also been turned off, and the ADL didn't specifically address Elon Musk in its tweets.

Other high-profile accounts also commented on the ADL's page about Christian Identity recently, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida. Luna accused the ADL of “intentionally creating a targeted hate campaign against Christians.” 

Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who has taken credit for getting several people fired from the Trump administration for supposedly being disloyal, replied to Musk that the ADL should be “designated as a domestic terror org.”

Musk made several changes after he bought Twitter and changed the name to X, including a big shift in what kind of content gets moderated. The CEO has welcomed back white supremacists who had previously been banned from Twitter, including Nick Fuentes, who's been able to get a lot more attention ever since he was allowed to again have a mainstream platform. Fuentes has a long history of praising Adolf Hitler and spreading anti-semitic hate.

The group X Out the Hate has previously called out Musk's extremism, calling on Apple and Google to drop X from its services after the CEO's two Nazi-style salutes.

“From the Nazi salute to his Holocaust ‘jokes' to his support of the extremist AfD party in Germany, Musk's antisemitism has moved to the international stage,” X Out the Hate wrote in February. “Almost daily, he spreads heinous conspiracy theories like the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, promotes neo-Nazis, and agrees with tweets claiming Jews push hate against white people.”

Musk has previously defended his salutes as something he did to express the idea that he was sending out love to the audience. And the ADL defended Musk, insisting that the world didn't just witness what seemed obvious to millions of people.

“It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,” the ADL tweeted on Jan. 20. “In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath. This is a new beginning. Let's hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.”

Musk replied at the time with a crying-laughing emoji while thanking the organization.

Thanks guys 😂

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 21, 2025



Musk also stirred controversy in 2023 when he endorsed a tweet that said Jewish communities had been pushing “hatred against whites.” Musk also attacked the ADL during that tirade, writing, “The ADL unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel,” Musk wrote at the time.

The billionaire has also threatened to sue the ADL for scaring advertisers away from X. And more recently, he became upset that Turning Point USA, the organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, is listed on the ADL website as an extremist group. “The ADL needs to change this now,” Musk tweeted on Sept. 27.

X didn't respond to an email on Monday seeking comment about Musk's tweet calling the ADL a hate group. Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back.

On Monday, Anthropic launched a new frontier model called Claude Sonnet 4.5, which it claims to offer state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks. The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be available via the Claude API and in the Claude chatbot. The pricing for developers is the same as Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, or more than the entire Lord of The Rings series) and $15 per million output tokens.

In the last year, Anthropic's AI models have emerged as a favorite among developers and enterprises, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Apple and Meta reportedly use Claude AI models internally, and Anthropic has made a significant business selling API access to AI coding applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit. Recently, OpenAI's GPT-5 has challenged Anthropic's dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks.

Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance on benchmarks alone.

Hershey says he's seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure.

In a statement shared with TechCrunch Cursor CEO Micheal Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said in a statement that Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a “new generation of coding models.”

Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models. The company says it has also improved Claude's susceptibility to prompt injection attacks.

Alongside the launch of Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic is also launching the Claude Agent SDK. The company says this is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, and can be used to help developers build their own agents.

Anthropic is also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude” for Max subscribers, which shows the AI model generating software on the fly. The company says the model will respond to user requests in real time, with no predetermined functionality or prewritten code.

The tense competition in the AI world has made it common for companies to ship flagship models every few months. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is launching less than two months after Anthropic's last AI model, Claude Opus 4.1. These rapid production cycles make it difficult for any company to hold a meaningful lead for very long.

Granite Rapids-WS has the chance to outdo Threadripper 9000WX in core count, similar to what the architecture has done for Intel on the server side.

It looks like Intel is getting ready to launch a new branch of Granite Rapids processors designed to compete directly with AMD's Ryzen 9000WX series parts based on Zen 5. Resident X poster Momomo_us found an openbenchmark.org listing featuring an 86-core CPU codenamed Granite Rapid-WS.

The only specs we have are the cores, threads, and clock speed, featuring the aforementioned 86 cores and 172 threads operating at up to 4.8GHz. But being based on the Granite Rapids architecture, it is very likely that this chip is a much higher clocking offshoot of the Xeon 6787P, which also boasts 86 cores across two compute tiles, but peaks at a 3.8GHz peak turbo clock speed.

At 86 cores, this new chip is approaching the core count of AMD's current Threadripper flagship, the 9995WX with 96 Zen 5 cores. This SKU might not even be the flagship part since Granite Rapids can scale up to 128 cores. Only time will tell if this is the case — to reach 128 cores, Intel has to use three compute dies, whereas with its 86-core Granite Rapid SKUs, it only needs to use two. Limiting Granite Rapids-WS to 86 cores has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs for Intel.

Rumors have been circulating about a workstation-offshoot of Granite Rapids for months. In February, we covered a Granite Rapids-W leak, allegedly stating these new workstation parts will come with up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, feature eight-channel DDR5 memory support, and support Intel's outgoing W890 chipset.

Granite Rapids is Intel's latest generation server architecture, and one of its most competitive yet, featuring core count parity with AMD EYPC processors for the first time since 2017, when it launched in the Xeon 6900P series late last year. Similar to Arrow Lake-S, Granite Rapids is based on a tile-based architecture, featuring several I/O and compute tiles to reach previously untouchable core counts.

Intel hasn't had a serious CPU lineup that has been able to compete with AMD's Threadripper WX-series parts over the past two generations. Its outgoing W-3500 Sapphire Rapids Refresh chips only scale up to 60 cores, while AMD has had 96-core trims since the Threadripper 7000WX series and 64-core chips dating all the way back to the Threadripper 3000 series. With Granite Rapids-WS, Intel has its first opportunity in years to approach or outpace AMD on core count in the HEDT/workstation segment, similar to the server market.

In a somewhat surprising team up, Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund are joining together to buy video game giant Electronic Arts for a staggering $55 billion.

EA announced today that it has agreed to be taken private by a group of investors that includes Kushner's private-equity firm Affinity Partners, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and investment firm Silver Lake. The group plans to pay stockholders $210 a share in cash.

The deal comes as the gaming industry has seen younger gamers gravitate more toward mobile and free-to-play hits like Fortnite and Roblox, rather than the pricey, franchise-driven blockbusters EA is known for. Founded in 1982 by ex-Apple exec Trip Hawkins, EA has built mega-series like sports franchises FIFA and Madden NFL, as well as the iconic life simulator The Sims. Battlefield 6, the next installment in the company's military first-person shooter series, drops next month.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who will stay on after the sale, tried to calm nerves about the coming shake-up.

In a memo to staff, Wilson called the agreement one of the largest investments ever made in the entertainment industry.

“Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment. They are committed with conviction to EA – they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together,” Wilson wrote.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund already owns nearly 10% of EA, a stake it's rolling into the new deal. The fund has been on a gaming buying spree in recent years. In 2021, it launched Savvy Games Group to manage a planned $38 billion push into the industry. Savvy has since acquired companies like Scopely, the studio behind Monopoly Go. And then earlier this year, Scopely itself bought the gaming division of Niantic, the makers of Pokemon Go.

These moves could hint at where the new owners want to steer EA. By taking the company private, they can make big changes without considering quarterly market reactions.

The deal is slated to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027, at which point EA would be removed from public trading.

Shareholders and regulators still need to sign off, though regulatory approval may be easier in a business-friendly Trump administration—especially with the president's son-in-law among the investors.

“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead,” Kushner said in a press release.

AI coding tools are redefining software development and speeding up code generation. They are also creating new management hurdles.

Actual AI wants to help. 

The Seattle startup announced a $3.2 million seed round led by AlleyCorp to help build out its autonomous agent product designed to help engineering managers adapt to the AI era of development.

While AI coding tools can streamline some software tasks, they are also adding new ones — such as more manual review, coordination tasks, and maintenance challenges, according to Actual AI. Some studies show how AI tools are actually slowing down developers and creating more vulnerabilities.

The company's agent can automate recurring management duties: triaging issues, generating sprint summaries, routing code reviews, and enforcing architectural consistency. 

It's also designed to help reduce reliance on senior engineers and up-skill junior developers. 

“We're building an engineering manager agent that actually brings guardrails to AI-powered software development,” said CEO John Kennedy.

Actual AI is targeting organizations with 50 to 500 developers. It has 32 active pilots and some early revenue. 

“Every engineering manager now manages teams comprised of dozens of developers along with just as many AI agents,” Kenneth Auchenberg, partner at AlleyCorp, said in a statement. “Managers are outnumbered, and it's created bottlenecks that are killing productivity.”

The six-person company is led by Kennedy, a tech industry vet who worked at Amazon Web Services and Acquia. Co-founder and CTO Ethan Byrd is a former engineer at AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

Actual AI competes with a number of developer productivity tools from startups and large corporations. Atlassian this month announced plans to acquire developer productivity insight platform DX for $1 billion.

Kennedy said his startup goes beyond traditional dashboards that provide metrics and instead acts on behalf of managers — automating the work itself rather than just reporting on it.

“A lot of engineering managers want to be player-coaches,” Kennedy said. “They want to be spending time with their engineers, up-leveling. They want to be helping with big, hard technical decisions. They want to be doing cool, fun stuff. They don't want to be doing mechanical admin work.”

Other backers include Irregular Expressions, G2C Ventures, and angel investors such as former Freshworks Americas president Bobby Jaffari and former Shelf Engine CTO Bede Jordan.

Actual AI was previously spotlighted in GeekWire's Startup Radar series.

The quiet deference to Nvidia's CEO reveals how much power the company still holds over AI's most ambitious companies.

A new report claims that before Amazon or Google reveals anything about their latest artificial intelligence chips, they first notify Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The practice, touted by sources in The Information's recent report on Nvidia's internal dealmaking, reflects the quiet reality of the AI hardware market: Nvidia is still the dominant supplier of training compute, and its customers are trying not to get cut off.

According to the report, Amazon and Google each provide advance notice to Huang before unveiling updates to their custom silicon. The reason, sources say, is that Nvidia is still deeply embedded in their cloud operations and neither wants to surprise the person who effectively controls their AI infrastructure supply. Nvidia accounts for the overwhelming majority of the accelerators used to train large language models, and its GPUs also handle a growing share of inference tasks in the public cloud.

This deference comes as Nvidia is pouring billions into customers, suppliers, and competitors alike in a bid to tighten its grip on the market. In September alone, Nvidia signed a deal to buy up to $6.3 billion worth of unused GPU capacity from CoreWeave over the next seven years. It also invested $700 million in British data center startup Nscale and spent more than $900 million to acquire the CEO and key engineers of networking startup Enfabrica while licensing its chip technology. That followed news of a $5 billion investment in Intel to support joint chip development and a letter of intent with OpenAI to back a 10-gigawatt GPU data center buildout that could cost up to $100 billion.

The scale and timing of those investments show how aggressively Nvidia is trying to preempt the rise of non-GPU accelerators. Companies like Amazon, Google, and OpenAI are all pursuing in-house silicon efforts designed to reduce dependency on Nvidia hardware and improve performance or cost at scale. But even with years of effort and tens of billions of dollars behind them, their platforms are still heavily reliant on Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem, software tooling, and manufacturing pipeline.

According to The Information, Nvidia's dominance has created a dynamic where it acts like a financial backstop to the entire AI supply chain. The company can now fund suppliers, rent out capacity, and underwrite long-term purchases to support continued demand for its hardware. That makes it harder for any individual customer to walk away, even as they build competing products.

For now, the biggest names in cloud computing are still briefing Jensen Huang before revealing their next chips. That sort of dynamic may not last forever, but it says a lot about where the power still sits today.

President Donald Trump seems to have gone off the QAnon deep end. In a post on his Truth Social account published over the weekend, Trump shared an AI-generated video of himself announcing the arrival of “medbeds,” a speculative technology that can supposedly heal all injuries.

Trump's post, since deleted, was published Friday. The video featured a fictionalized Fox News segment that included the fake Trump proclaiming that every American would soon receive their own medbed card, providing them access to newly opened hospitals with the technology (though the post was deleted, other people preserved the video itself). Some people, particularly QAnon adherents, believe that medbeds exist but have been kept away from the public at the behest of the rich and powerful.

Trump tonight appears to have pushed the false "medbed" conspiracy theory, which has spread in the far-right internet over the years. https://t.co/L1MBPIU4ON pic.twitter.com/wWBQPDFbnb

— Alex Kaplan (@AlKapDC) September 28, 2025



“These facilities are safe, modern, and designed to restore every citizen to full health,” AI Trump stated.

The medbed conspiracy theory dates back several years, though it's an extension of similar beliefs that have long circulated among some alternative medicine and New Age proponents. The premise is simple enough: there are beds or devices outfitted with technology that can effectively cure every ailment known to humans. The world's elite, however, have purportedly buried this technology, which may or may not have been made with the help of aliens, or are only using it for themselves.

Gizmodo reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response prior to publication.

Some people and businesses even claim to sell medbeds, though these appear to be nothing more than gussied-up motel rooms or grossly expensive at-home “generators.” At least one medbed-related company, Tesla BioHealing, has since changed its advertising to avoid the explicit mention of medbeds; the company had previously received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration in 2023 over how it falsely marketed its products as medical treatments. Its “quantum healing” generator currently sells for $11,000. Other scammers will instead sell medbed cards that will supposedly grant people future access to these beds once available.

Trump is hardly one to shy away from conspiratorial trends.

In recent days on his Truth Social account, for instance, he continued to push for several policy changes advocated by the anti-vaccination movement, such as breaking apart the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; he also shared a video supportive of the “great replacement theory” (the far-right, white nationalist belief that the world's elites are planning to eradicate white people). Those posts, incidentally, remain up. Trump also infamously popularized the conspiracy belief that former President Barack Obama was secretly born in Kenya.

Still, it's not clear why Trump would even want to share the medbed post, especially since it promised his followers something he couldn't possibly deliver on.

Browser maker and Google Search alternative Brave announced on Monday that it's adding a new feature to its AI-powered search suite, Ask Brave, to provide detailed answers on a topic based on the query.

The search company said that this new feature will co-exist next to its AI Answers feature, which was introduced last year to give summarized responses to search queries. The company said that people are getting more than 15 million answers every day.

You don't need to switch to a special mode to use Ask Brave. The search engine will automatically recognize what kind of query you are asking and give a response accordingly.

You can use the ask button next to the Brave search box to begin a search. You can also turn your normal search query into an AI search query by tapping into the ask tab on the search page result. If you have the Brave search as your default search engine, you can append a double question mark “??” to a query to begin an ask Brave search query.

“While AI Answers give our users quick summaries, Ask Brave provides longer answers, follow-ups, and a chat mode enhanced with Deep Research, and most importantly, contextually relevant enrichments such as videos, news articles, products, businesses, shopping, and more – in the right place, at the right time,” said Chief of Search at Brave, Josep M. Pujol, in a statement. “Search makes it possible, LLMs glue it together. We anticipate that Ask Brave will generate millions more daily AI-powered answers with this powerful combination of search and chat, and look forward to deploying more useful AI-powered search tools for our users.” 

The format of the answer you get out of Ask Brave is more akin to a report format that you get out of ChatGPT or Perplexity, which includes links, videos, and image carousels. Once you get the answer, you can ask the AI chatbot to convert the answer into a different format or ask follow-up questions.

Brave said that it is using the company's own API to ground search results for accuracy, along with deep research for certain queries.  

AI-powered Q&A is now creeping into various search experiences. Google has expanded its AI mode to multiple languages, including a global rollout for Spanish last week. Brave's feature is similar but comes with a privacy claim that the company encrypts users' chats and deletes them after 24 hours of inactivity.

Two powerful Atlantic storms are threatening the East Coast with dangerous surf conditions this week, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Category 4 Hurricane Humberto is swirling over the central Atlantic and hammering the beaches of the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda with high surf and life-threatening rip currents, the NHC reported early Monday morning. Forecasters expect these conditions to begin affecting much of the East Coast today.

As Humberto tracks northwest toward the U.S., Tropical Storm Imelda is gaining strength roughly 300 miles (483 kilometers) off the coast of South Florida. This system will likely reach hurricane status by 2:00 p.m. ET Tuesday, the NHC reports. Forecasters expect Imelda to bring tropical storm conditions to the Bahamas and Cuba through Tuesday, creating a risk of flash flooding and mudslides. Large swaths of the Southeast Coast are also at risk of flash flooding as heavy rainfall reaches the U.S.

The NHC doesn't expect either of these storms to make landfall, but their combined impact could produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the east coasts of Florida and Georgia today. The National Weather Service has issued gale-force wind, hurricane, and tropical storm warnings from Florida to Massachusetts, as these conditions are likely to rapidly spread northward.

That said, Humberto will play a key role in preventing Imelda from directly hitting the East Coast. Imelda's northward track is currently being steered by a subtropical ridge, but by Tuesday, forecasters expect Humberto to weaken that ridge and cause the tropical storm to veer east away from the U.S.

The NHC expects Imelda to dump 1 to 2 inches of rain—with local maximum totals up to 4 inches—through Tuesday across northeast Florida, coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North Carolina. This could result in isolated flash and urban flooding.

“This storm is deadly serious. Not just serious. Deadly serious,” South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a news conference, according to NBC News. McMaster said authorities were prepositioning search and rescue crews over the weekend. In North Carolina, Governor Josh Stein declared a state of emergency before Imelda even formed.

This storm is likely to produce another 2 to 4 inches of rain in eastern Cuba and 4 to 8 inches in the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, raising the risk of flash flooding and mudslides, according to the NHC. As Imelda approaches Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches of rain could fall between Wednesday and Thursday.

So far this season, every Atlantic hurricane—Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto—has reached “major” strength, but none of them have made landfall in the U.S. Whether Imelda continues this trend remains to be seen, but it's clear that it will be impactful for the Southeast.

You might have heard of “vibe coding.” Microsoft hopes “vibe working” will catch on next.

Much as non-developers can describe what types of programs to build, and let AI do the coding, Microsoft is bringing the concept to documents, spreadsheets and presentations with new features for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

The company describes “vibe working” as collaboration between people and AI agents inside its productivity apps. Instead of giving a one-time response, the updated Copilot AI tools generate, test, and refine content while users steer the direction, more like a dialogue.

Here's what the company announced Monday morning:

Microsoft says Office Agent in Copilot runs on AI models from Anthropic, maker of the Claude AI chatbot. That's part of a broader move by Microsoft to expand beyond models from OpenAI.

The company is racing to add AI features against Google, which is steadily adding generative AI to its Workspace apps, along with Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic, Canva, Notion, and many others developing agent-style AI systems for business, productivity, and design applications.

Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, which include the Office apps and Copilot for businesses, generated $87.8 billion in revenue in the 2025 fiscal year, ending in June, up 14% and second only to the company's server products and cloud services business.

The new features are rolling out in preview. Agent Mode is in Word and Excel on the web Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Personal or Family users, through Microsoft's Frontier program. Desktop versions and PowerPoint support will be released later. Office Agent is initially limited to Personal and Family users in the U.S., also through the Frontier program.

Starbucks CTO Deb Hall Lefevre has resigned, according to a report from Reuters, as the Seattle-based company navigates layoffs and various tech-related changes. 

Hall Lefevre resigned without a permanent replacement, according to a memo sent to staff last week that was seen by Reuters. 

Ningyu Chen, who was senior vice president of global experience technology, is now interim chief technology officer. Chen is based in Atlanta, according to his LinkedIn profile. 

Starbucks last week announced plans to lay off around 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores mainly in the U.S. and Canada. Starbucks previously cut 1,100 corporate workers in February.

Under the leadership of CEO Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who joined the company last year, Starbucks is making a bevy of technology tweaks as it tries to curb slumping sales. 

That includes a new algorithm for order sequencing; an overhaul of mobile ordering; sunsetting its pickup-only stores; a new AI assistant and point-of-sale system for baristas; and a new AI-powered inventory tracking system.

Hall Lefevre, who was also an executive vice president, joined Starbucks in 2022. She previously spent more than 16 years at McDonald's, where she was a corporate vice president and CIO, leading the fast food giant's technology and digital commerce strategy. She was also EVP and CTO at Circle K Stores.

Reuters reported that Starbucks' IT division is increasingly relying on an outside contractor based in India.

The various recent partnerships involving OpenAI and Nvidia have been discussed at length by the entire internet as well as the stock market. Besides enhancing shareholder value, though, it's hard to say what the endgame of these large corporations is. The answer is a bit clearer after a CNBC interview, where OpenAI's President Greg Brockman talked up a future with agentic AI that works in your sleep — pointing out we'll need 10 billion GPUs or the equivalent thereof for the future he envisions.

The interview in question includes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Brockman. The discussion goes back and forth, but Altman offers some perspective on pointing out that the scale of its partnership with Nvidia is larger than even the Apollo program that put mankind on the moon. He thinks of the future AI proverbial collective as a "superbrain", embedded in our daily lives.

The most interesting remarks, though, come from Brockman, whose vision for the future is that of "an agent that's going to do work proactively for you while you're asleep", with every person on Earth having their dedicated GPU on the job. "You really want every person to have their own dedicated GPU," he told CNBC. That's definitely a hot take, one that might elicit some eye-rolls given how many folks are weary of AI features being shoehorned into every product.

However, keep in mind that in the early nineties, Microsoft's ex-CEO Bill Gates envisioned not just one computer in every home, but on every desk, a notion that seemed even more far-fetched and met with excitement and derision in equal measure. And yet here we are today, with one in every pocket.

Brockman continues on to state that the industry is still "three orders of magnitude off" where it needs to be in terms of AI computing power, and posits that to fulfill the always-on, always-working AI vision, about 10 billion GPUs would be necessary — a figure above the 8.2 billion people currently inhabiting the planet. He minces no words, saying that the world is heading to a state where "economy is powered by compute."

Reinforcing the notion, he went on to say he world is heading towards "compute scarcity," and in a direction where "the economy is powered by compute," implying that AI datacenter service could become de facto currency. While some could call that remark dystopian in nature, it's also hard to deny at this point in time, given that Nvidia's GPUs have become flashpoints in Sino-American diplomatic relationships — and that situation is bound to repeat itself in the future quite frequently.

The Department of Energy has instituted a long list of banned words at the direction of a Trump appointee, including some that many would consider politically neutral.

The “words to avoid” were sent in an email to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) on Friday, according to Politico, which saw the memo. “Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid,” EERE special advisor Rachael Overbey wrote.

The terms staffers are forbidden from using include: climate change, green, decarbonization, energy transition, sustainability, sustainable, subsidies, tax breaks, tax credits, and carbon footprint. 

Also on the banned word list is the term “emissions.” According to the report, the term apparently implies some level of negativity, despite the neutrally worded dictionary definition. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases aren't simply emissions, though, but instead can be regulated as air pollutants.

The EERE was established in the late 1970s after several government agencies were rolled into one. The office was a response to the 1973 energy crisis, which had sent oil prices skyrocketing. The intent of the EERE was to foster renewable energy and energy efficiency in an effort to stabilize the American economy from price shocks that can roil commodity markets, like oil and gas.

President Trump and his appointees have decided to bet the American economy on expanded use of those commodities. 

In speeches and official communications, the Trump administration has continually referred to anything related to the energy transition as the “green energy scam.” Last week in a speech at the United Nations, Trump took aim at countries around the world for investing in technologies like solar, wind, and batteries. 

“Your country is going to fail,” said Trump.

Despite the rhetoric, global investment in renewable energy reached a new record in the first half of 2025. Offshore wind and small-scale solar helped push investment up 10% from the previous year to $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

OpenAI began testing a new safety routing system in ChatGPT over the weekend, and on Monday introduced parental controls to the chatbot — drawing mixed reactions from users.

The safety features come in response to numerous incidents of certain ChatGPT models validating users' delusional thinking instead of redirecting harmful conversations. OpenAI is facing a wrongful death lawsuit tied to one such incident, after a teenage boy died by suicide after months of interactions with ChatGPT. 

The routing system is designed to detect emotionally sensitive conversations and automatically switch mid-chat to GPT-5-thinking, which the company sees as the best equipped model for high-stakes safety work. In particular, the GPT-5 models were trained with a new safety feature that OpenAI calls “safe completions,” which allows them to answer sensitive questions in a safe way, rather than simply refusing to engage.

It's a contrast from the company's previous chat models, which are designed to be agreeable and answer questions quickly. GPT-4o has come under particular scrutiny because of its overly sycophantic, agreeable nature, which has both fueled incidents of AI-induced delusions and drawn a large base of devoted users. When OpenAI rolled out GPT-5 as the default in August, many users pushed back and demanded access to GPT-4o. 

While many experts and users have welcomed the safety features, others have criticized what they see as an overly cautious implementation, with some users accusing OpenAI of treating adults like children in a way that degrades the quality of the service. OpenAI has suggested that getting it right will take time and has given itself a 120-day period of iteration and improvement.  

Nick Turley, VP and head of the ChatGPT app, acknowledged some of the “strong reactions to 4o responses” due to the implementation of the router with explanations.  

“Routing happens on a per-message basis; switching from the default model happens on a temporary basis,” Turley posted on X. “ChatGPT will tell you which model is active when asked. This is part of a broader effort to strengthen safeguards and learn from real-world use before a wider rollout.” 

The implementation of parental controls in ChatGPT received similar levels of praise and scorn, with some commending giving parents a way to keep tabs on their children's AI use, and others fearful that it opens the door to OpenAI treating adults like children.

The controls let parents customize their teen's experience by setting quiet hours, turning off voice mode and memory, removing image generation, and opting out of model training. Teen accounts will also get additional content protections — like reduced graphic content and extreme beauty ideals — and a detection system that recognizes potential signs that a teen might be thinking about self-harm.  

“If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,” per OpenAI's blog. “If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.” 

OpenAI acknowledged that the system won't be perfect and may sometimes raise alarms when there isn't real danger, “but we think it's better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent.” The AI firm said it is also working on ways to reach law enforcement or emergency services if it detects an imminent threat to life and cannot reach a parent.

We'll be waiting until next year for the first round of PCs sporting Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip, plus whatever Intel and AMD have in store for lightweight laptops. As a hint of what to expect, in stepped a company nobody had ever heard of, offering a laptop few people wanted. Humain (no, not that AI wearable company that bricked its wonky AI Pin and sold itself to HP for peanuts), a Saudi Arabian company, debuted a laptop at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), that looks like every other clamshell notebook, save for one small detail. Instead of the Copilot key that's become standardized on Windows machines, it features an “Humain” AI key.

Humain's laptop is a Windows machine at its heart, powered by the Snapdragon X2 Elite chip. But the AI key brings up an extra layer of UI called Humain One. Through the interface, you can call up an AI chatbot, an AI image generator, and a few more semi-interesting capabilities. There's a special chatbot for homework help, document summaries, or a “Story Generator.” The AI will create a narrative using the average third-grade reading level.

It's nothing we haven't seen before, most obviously from Microsoft's own Copilot AI, which is built into the company's 365 apps and desktop. Humain usurped Copilot's new laptop with the promise that at least some of the AI processes are being handled on-device. The notebook is otherwise packing solid-sounding specs, from an OLED display designed by Samsung, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. No, the company didn't have any word about how much the machine will cost, or when, or where it will be available. There's no word if it will come to the U.S., either. The only question remaining is, would you want it to?

I spent all of Snapdragon Summit barely able to take in the epic sights of Maui through the haze of big tech AI hype. Qualcomm's new slogan, “AI is the new UI,” ran like a river through every new announcement and demo. Qualcomm wanted to imply that on-device AI will be able to look into your fridge and suggest meals (Samsung's fridges already do that). You can use an AI app called Collov AI to remodel rooms in your house with new furniture, though it currently doesn't have any hookup to major furniture retailers to see how products you can actually buy might look in your abode. It's nothing I haven't seen before; only now these features are supposedly running on the device, versus in the cloud.

Qualcomm's explanation for how this works suggests that the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chip for PCs has such strong AI processing capabilities, but if a laptop or mini-PC using it ever gets overwhelmed, it can bring in the big guns—the major datacenters with such massive cloud compute they could suck the power grid dry. On-device AI should be the goal for every company. AI models are getting better at being contained. The Snapdragon X2 Elite's redesigned NPU—or neural processing engine built for low-key or background AI tasks—now sports 80 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) versus the 45 TOPS on the original Snapdragon X platform.

What that translates to is still vague. Collov AI, the home decoration app, was tasking the NPU at just 10%. The GPU, or graphics processing unit, was taking the brunt of the rest of the AI image generation. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, though I have yet to see a demo that can truly tax the NPU.

I ran multiple benchmark tests on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme platform, all done on non-commercial test machines with 48GB of RAM and 1TB SSD under the hood. I was standing in front of many Qualcomm reps ready to slap my hand if I tried jumping for any non-synthetic benchmark. From what I could see, the chip does have more power behind it than previous Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm chips. The problem is that when you try and benchmark for AI performance, even if the chip does well, it's too difficult to determine what that translates to when you're using the device as a daily driver.

The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme's GPU was especially impressive. The laptops managed to hit a score of 5,648 and an average of 41 fps in 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light test and 23,586 in the Solar Bay benchmark. It all suggests that laptops with the Snapdragon X2 Extreme chip will be great for graphics tasks, but the issue will be the number of apps and drivers that are compatible with Qualcomm's ARM-based chip. Apps like Maxon's ZBrush should have an ARM version by early 2026, but good luck trying to get any gaming done on these machines.

These tests can only offer a perspective of what users could potentially expect from actual products. I couldn't possibly say how much the X2 Elite Extreme laptops will cost in this age of tariffs. Recent rumors suggested TSMC, which manufactures these chips, is going to pass tariff costs for 3nm process CPUs onto Qualcomm and fellow chipmaker MediaTek.

“It's [TSMC's] choice to try to figure out what to do with the pricing structure,” said Alex Katouzian, Qualcomm's head of compute and mobile. “What we constantly think about is, ‘How do I get the most efficient design, meaning performance per millimeter square?'”

The Pacific Northwest — a hub for the fusion energy sector — has kicked off its annual Seattle Fusion Week. 

Three years ago Scott Hsu, then the fusion lead for the U.S. Department of Energy, told the event's attendees “the Seattle area has all the right ingredients to lead fusion into the future.”

The future hasn't yet arrived as local physicists and engineers are still laboring to recreate the atom-smashing reactions that power the sun. If any companies succeed in doing this in a cost-effective manner, it would unlock an abundant source of safe, clean energy — the so-called “Holy Grail” of renewable power.

While serious technical and financial hurdles remain, efforts keep nudging the sector closer toward its goals.  

Helion Energy this summer started construction in Central Washington on what it hopes will be the world's first commercial fusion power plant. Zap Energy has hit new milestones with its fusion reactors and energy-capturing technologies. Avalanche Energy is exploring neutron production and building a test facility for the sector. General Fusion had layoffs earlier this year, but is making progress with its demo device. 

Here's a round up of Pacific Northwest companies working to harness fusion power, startups that aim to support the sector, and notable research institutions — most of whom are participating in Seattle Fusion Week, which is hosted by CleanTech Alliance.

Helion's initial 50 megawatt facility, dubbed Orion, will be located near the Columbia River. If all goes to plan — and much remains uncertain — the reactor's electricity is earmarked for Microsoft data centers, and Helion has a separate deal to power Nucor steel. 

The company recently signed a lease for 166,500 square feet of new space in Everett, the Puget Sound Business Journal reports. The city is home to Helion's HQ and its seventh fusion prototype, a reactor called Polaris. 

Zap has built and is doing experiments with two fusion reactors (FuZE-Q and FuZE-3) and built its Century system, which includes key technologies for making and capturing power, namely liquid metal walls that absorb and transfer the heat produced by fusion, electrodes and energy-releasing capacitors.

In February, Zap hit a milestone for its DOE funding by operating the Century platform continuously for three hours, producing a series of 1,080 plasma shots without failure.

Avalanche is taking a different track with its desktop-sized energy fusion device and working multiple angles for revenue generation. 

That includes using its fusion machine for producing neutrons for commercial sale, and it has a Pentagon contract from the Defense Innovation Unit to develop technology for space propulsion and power generation. This summer, Avalanche landed a $10 million grant from the state to launch FusionWERX, a commercial-scale testing facility for fusion technologies in Eastern Washington.

In May, General Fusion's CEO made a public plea for more funding and shared news of layoffs (The Globe and Mail put the number at a quarter of the company's workforce). The company is building a prototype reactor in B.C. that will be half the size of its intended commercial device.

General Fusion has made multiple pivots over the years, including significant technology changes and a canceled demonstration project in the United Kingdom. 

In addition to the four Pacific Northwest companies working to build energy-producing fusion devices, three other ventures are offering supporting technologies and services.

The Federal Trade Commission took Amazon to court early last week. Only two days after the trial started, Amazon caved in to sign a $2.5 billion settlement.

At the heart of the lawsuit was the Amazon Prime subscription program. The FTC claimed that Amazon tricked millions of customers into signing up for a Prime membership using deceptive design techniques and then made the cancellation process onerously difficult.

The $2.5 billion settlement is made up of a $1 billion civil penalty paid to the government, the largest ever involving an FTC rule violation, and $1.5 billion in refunds to affected consumers, the second-highest restitution award ever obtained by the FTC.

“Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a press release.

“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin told Gizmodo.

The FTC estimates that roughly 35 million consumers were impacted by this scheme. Chances are, you could be one of the 35 million, and you could be eligible to benefit from the refunds totaling a record-breaking $1.5 billion.

For starters, you have to be a customer in the United States who signed up for an Amazon Prime membership or unsuccessfully tried to cancel an existing Prime subscription some time between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025.

But even then, you had to have signed up via what the FTC calls a “challenged enrollment flow,” aka a misleading enrollment page. According to the FTC, you are eligible for a claims payout if you signed up for a Prime membership via the shipping option selection page (that is, if you clicked to have free shipping without realizing that meant registering for a Prime membership), Prime Video, or any versions of the Universal Prime Decision Page or Amazon's single page checkout.

The first set of payouts will be made automatically within 90 days of the FTC order. If you signed up for an Amazon Prime membership using the challenged enrollment flow and used no more than three Prime benefits within any 12-month period of your enrollment, then you will be automatically qualified for a payout. Prime benefits do include free, expedited shipping unless the transaction at hand would have already included that speed of shipping for free without a Prime membership.

Once the first round of automatic claims payouts is done, Amazon will send out a claims form within 30 days to other eligible customers. This second wave will include people who tried to cancel Prime unsuccessfully and those who signed up via a challenged enrollment flow but used up to 10 Prime benefits over any 12-month period. Once you receive the form, you will have up to 180 days to submit it back to Amazon via email, pre-paid mail, or a settlement website, which Amazon has yet to establish. Once you submit your claim, Amazon will have only 30 days to review and issue your refund.

Amazon is required to refund affected customers the total amount of Amazon Prime membership fees paid during their entire subscription period, but the refunds will be capped at $51 per customer. A standard Prime membership currently costs $14.99 a month or $139 annually.

If by the end of the two waves of claims payouts, Amazon has paid less than $1 billion in funds, then the tech giant is required to send more automatic payouts until the threshold is reached. For example, if necessary, Amazon will start issuing automatic refunds to customers who fit all other automatic payout requirements but used up to four Prime benefits in a 12-month period and failed to submit a claim in time.

CMF is finally done teasing its first pair of over-ear headphones. The company—which is, for now, a subbrand of Nothing—is launching the $99 Headphone Pro, an affordable pair of active noise cancellation headphones (ANC) with lots of buttons and a really sturdy battery life.

Like I suspected, the 100-hour battery that CMF already teased doesn't apply to playback with ANC like I had hoped, but if you're listening sans ANC, the company says they're rated for that length of listening. If you are listening with ANC on, though (like most people), you'll get 50 hours, which is still pretty good to be fair. For reference, Nothing's Headphone 1, which also came out this year, get 35 hours with ANC on and 80 hours with ANC off. That's a big difference, especially in the ANC department, and even more so when you consider the Headphone 1 cost $299.

See CMF by Nothing Headphone Pro at Amazon

One thing that carries over between Nothing's Headphone 1 and CMF's Headphone Pro is an emphasis on buttons. Just like the Headphone 1, which comes with a pill-shaped rolling button for volume and play/pause or turning ANC on/off and a paddle for track selection and audio scrubbing, the CMF Headphone Pro have its own array of tactile controls. Probably the most interesting button is what CMF is calling the “Energy Slider,” which is meant for adjusting the bass levels without having to use the Nothing X app. As someone who's pretty specific about having too much bass, I'm actually excited about this one. That fact is, sometimes you want a bass boost and sometimes you don't, and using a button to toggle features like that on or off lacks granularity.

There's also an action button built in that's programmable via the Nothing X app and a power button for, well, turning the headphones on and off. That's not all; there's a roller, which, like the Headphone 1, serves many purposes. In addition to adjusting volume, it also controls play/pause and can control ANC to allow for more or less ambient sound. I, for one, love the tactile controls on the Headphone 1, even if they aren't always the smoothest to use. There's still something about reaching for your headphones that feels so much easier for quick controls when you're riding the subway or just running around with your phone tucked away.

Just as CMF had teased, the Headphone Pro will also have swappable earcups, though that concludes the modularity aspect of its headphones. I was hoping CMF would do more with customization. The $99 Headphone Pro come in dark gray, light green, and light gray, while the additional earcups come in either orange or light green, and will cost $25 each. They're available in the U.K. and EU starting today, Sept. 29; in the U.S. on Oct. 7. My biggest question is how they sound compared to the Headphone 1, but I'll have an answer to that soon enough. And even if they sound notably inferior, they're also one-third of the price, so you can't expect them to be one-to-one.

Making democracy work isn't easy, as recent events have made clear. Some critics would argue that technology is making it worse. But one startup is hoping that AI could help bridge some differences instead of widen them.

“I had an a-ha moment one day when I realized people are asking AI to explain something like they're five years old,” Tomy Lorsch, co-founder and CEO of ComplexChaos, told TechCrunch. “What if we use it as a facilitator to help people understand each other and find common ground?”

He and co-founder Maya Ben Dror are developing tools to help people arrive at a consensus. One of their first test cases involved climate negotiations, but it really doesn't matter what the issue is. Their goal is to foster cooperation and shorten the time it takes for groups to come to agreement.

“Everyone is building software for collaboration like Slack, Google Docs, whatever,” Lorsch said. “Cooperation is a different piece.”

Facilitating cooperation isn't something that scales well, he said. Typically, trained facilitators will spend time with groups to help them arrive at a consensus, but that process can slow down when negotiations or preparations happen across time zones or even in different rooms.

Lorsch was buoyed by a recent LLM developed by Google called the Habermas Machine, which was developed explicitly with that goal in mind. “This is basically an AI that generates group consensus statements where people feel represented both by majority and minority point of view,” he said.

Lorsch and Ben Dror recently trialed their startup's tool to help young delegates from nine African nations prepare for climate-related negotiations at a United Nations campus in Bonn, Germany. The tool incorporates both Google's Habermas Machine and OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate questions, come up with goals for conversations, and help summarize long documents.

The goal, Ben Dror said, is to help the delegates arrive at consensus as a bloc before they begin negotiations with others. 

Ideally, the tool would help speed things during negotiations, too. When blocs, or delegates from groups of aligned countries, encounter new information in the process of a large negotiating session, they often need to regroup to process the new information. “Blocs are usually the reason why negotiations have to stop. The bloc has to come out, renegotiate, reposition, and then go back in. And that creates a lot of friction,” Ben Dror said. ComplexChaos hopes that its tool can help shorten that time.

In the trial with the delegates from African countries, ComplexChaos said that participants reported up to a 60% reduction in the time it took to coordinate, and that 91% of participants said that the AI tool helped them see perspectives they would have otherwise missed.

ComplexChaos is also pitching its cooperation tool to companies, including tech companies and large consultancies. “Strategic planning by AI is basically the same problem,” Lorsch said. “The annual strategic planning process of most companies takes about three months of the year with back and forth negotiations, multi-layer, across time zones, across teams, and so on and so forth.”

But Lorsch and Ben Dror are most enthusiastic when talking about climate negotiations. 

“If AI can shorten these processes, simplify them, then we'd be so much better off. Not just for climate, for anything sustainability, for any big challenge that we're facing,” Ben Dror said.

Corvus Robotics' innovative storage tracking system uses fully autonomous drones to take warehouse inventory control to new heights.

The Corvus One Autonomous Inventory Management System provides warehouse managers with a bird's-eye view, enabling them to oversee up-to-the-minute reports on product locations and resolve discrepancies in real time. The deployments follow four years of challenging development.

Jackie Wu, co-founder and CEO of Corvus Robotics, developed his autonomous drone idea by observing warehousing operations in 10 countries. He found inventory scattered on massive pallets and sky-high metal shelves. Some of these facilities approached the size of five football fields, with storage bins stretching four stories high.

Wu noticed that they all have one thing in common: people with barcode scanners or paper and pencils climb around product stockpiles, updating printouts from previous inventory logs. It is a very slow process fraught with inaccuracies.

In 2017, Wu applied his graduate school training in robotics to address the pain points in warehouse management, making them more efficient and less costly to operate. He teamed up with co-founder Mohammed Kabir to develop the Boston-based company that currently has 20 employees. Research and development took several years for the company to reach its first real deployments in 2022.

Corvus' fully autonomous micro aerial vehicles need no human operators to fly them. The technology Corvus created enables the robotic drones to fly unattended within huge warehouses day or night, even in total darkness.

AI-based programming controls their ability to follow prescribed flight paths, adapt to navigational barriers, and respond to changes in the layout. They silently zip around corridors, vertically scale elevated storage shelves, record barcoded data, and deliver all surveillance results to the computer system.

Corvus uses computer vision, AI, and aerial robotics, which it designed from scratch to deploy a solution that tracks inventory. Wu claims it is 10 times faster and much cheaper than other warehousing management platforms.

“The platform is an AI model for autonomy that sits on site, in a computer, and on each of the drones,” Wu told TechNewsWorld. “The drones create a new digital model of the warehouse world, akin to a digital twin, every time they fly. They're also trained to recognize the differences in inventory and barcode labels for every single site on the next flight.”

Using drones commercially indoors is a relatively recent development. For many years, the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for business applications struggled to gain traction. Only recently has the technology for autonomous indoor navigation matured enough to support practical commercial use.

Early UAV deployments primarily focused on outdoor applications, including filmmaking, agriculture, and infrastructure inspection. Around 2010, innovative companies started combining logistics expertise with industrial drone technology to overcome the challenges of autonomous indoor flight. Stumbling points included unreliable GPS signals indoors, poor computer vision due to inadequate interior lighting, and the nascent state of AI sensor technology.

Success came as developers replaced GPS navigation with a combination of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, visual sensors, and complex algorithms to map and navigate warehouses. Industry reports show a steep upward trajectory for the adoption of inventory drones.

One report valued the drone-based warehouse inventory market at over $1.2 billion in 2024, with projections to reach nearly $10 billion by 2033. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%.

“I like the Corvus Robotics drones because they are out of sight and out of mind. They're doing things that there's really not a lot of value to an individual, but to the business it's priceless,” said Bill Monk, vice president of distribution for GNC.

Using the Corvus One System means GNC does not have to pull material handling equipment and laborers from other tasks to perform audits. Drones count pallets and cases, batch scan multiple SKUs in the same location, and provide a volumetric analysis of the slot's storage capacity, he explained.

According to Wu, “robotics” and “autonomous drones” are not terms for the same technology. Robotics is considered a discipline. Drones or micro vehicles are a sub-discipline.

Drones operate in 3D space, whereas robots move on the ground. Flying an autonomous drone in 3D requires more complexity, but many of the sensors and computer vision functionality are broadly interchangeable, he clarified.

Despite differences in the size and scope of warehouse deployments, Corvus uses the same system platform for every site. Wu noted that installation processes are not as complex as those for other inside surveillance and computerized inventory solutions.

“It depends on the size of the facility, but installation takes only one or two weeks. This is not like a nine-month setup where you have to install all this infrastructure, fix it to the ceiling, and put up racking and other support items. It's pretty quick,” Wu explained. “In smaller business locations, we send one or two deployment engineers who set it up in a day.”

The computer software, which can reside in on-site or remote offices, processes data from drone flights to provide visual data and detailed textual reports. Corvus provides software and drone maintenance as needed, offering warehouse personnel a hands-off solution.

Wu noted that anyone in the warehouse — authorized workers, supervisors, and the floor manager — can access the warehouse management system's (WMS) dashboard to search for an item or view the warehouse inventory in its entirety. Warehouse operators can compare data from previous drone flights to track discrepancies, confirm updated inventory reports, and track misplaced product storage.

“Instead of walking the floor and looking for every location, they can directly click into the software and look at the pictures,” said Wu.

Made-to-order programming puts all the decisions in the warehouse company's hands, he added. Different customers have different shifts and different comfort levels. So customers can have us program inventory flyovers within a single or multiple time frames.

“Being able to run inventory checks 24/7 without operator assistance has been a game changer,” said Austin Feagins, senior director of transformation and solution design at Staci Americas. His company provides third-party logistics and warehousing services for businesses.

“The lights-out capability in the Corvus One system allows our inventory teams to correct discrepancies off-shift and pre-shift before production starts each day, limiting fulfillment delays and production impacts,” he explained.

Feagins wants the 24/7 inventory surveillance option installed in his company's five U.S. buildings this year.

Corvus' R&D stages evolved into a continuous cycle of refining the technology to make it work. Over the past few years, the company has overcome numerous technical challenges, learning that no single solution exists to address all of them.

“There's not been one magic unlock that just solved everything. It's been a lot of lead bullets overcoming issues again and again, more banal issues, more surprising issues, and just kind of trusting in the strength of our engineering team to resolve them,” Wu said.

His company relied on open-source software whenever possible. However, much of the platform evolved around in-house coding, particularly in how they integrate software and hardware to achieve their unique autonomy in drone flying.

According to Wu, Corvus' approach has developed a unique robot-as-a-service subscription-based model that is unmatched by competitors' solutions. The cost factor is a key part of that success.

Prices vary depending on the facility's size and the number of flights. He described other solutions as partially autonomous or lower-tech, where users push a drone around or put up expensive setups beyond what Corvus charges.

“The interesting thing is that the customer makes ROI in month one because it is cheaper than what they are currently paying to do this job,” he concluded.

EA has announced that the gaming giant has been acquired by a consortium that includes Saudi Arabia's PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners to the tune of $55 billion.

In a press release, the company stated it has entered a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium. The group, which includes Saudi Arabia's PIF, will acquire 100% of EA, with the PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company. Shareholders will receive $210 a share as a result of the sale. Notably, that's a 25% premium on the $168.32 the share price closed at on September 25, the stock's last fully unaffected trading day.

EA says the buyer's group brings "deep sector experience, committed capital, and global portfolios with networks across gaming, entertainment, and sports that offer unique possibilities for EA to blend physical and digital experiences, enhance fan engagement, and create new growth opportunities." EA also confirmed the deal is the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history.

Andrew Wilson, Chairman & CEO of Electronic Arts, said that EA "will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”

Turqi Alnowaiser, Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments at Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund said, "PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and esports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators."

EA was founded in 1982 and is the publishing and development behemoth behind some of the most popular franchises in video games. Notable hits include the Madden franchise, FIFA (now FC), The Sims, Battlefield, Mass Effect, Skate, Rock Band, Need for Speed, and more.

The company's next big title is Battlefield 6, set to hit consoles and PCs on October 10 after a summer of generally positive public beta testing. The company's iconic Skate franchise is also currently running an Early Access test across platforms.

Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer is closing the doors on her consumer software startup Sunshine, and is selling the company's assets to her new AI startup, Dazzle. The news was first reported by Wired, which cited an email sent to Sunshine's shareholders.

Dazzle is setting out to build an AI personal assistant, the report cited anonymous sources as saying, and added that all of Sunshine's employees will move to the new company.

Almost all of Sunshine's investors, who include Norwest Venture Partners, Felicis Partners, and SV Angel, have signed off on the deal, Wired cited the sources as saying. 

Originally founded in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management, dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” That product saw little adoption due to privacy concerns about privacy, and pretty much languished. In 2024, the service added event management and photo sharing — with a touch of AI, of course — but with little success. Both apps have been downloaded just over 1,000 times on the Google Play Store.

The company had raised about $20 million in 2020, and according to Meyer, was largely self-funded.

Can competing chip makers strike back before the X2's arrival in 2026?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Last week, Qualcomm announced its upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips for laptops and compact desktops at its yearly summit in Maui. Some specs were revealed (the top-end Extreme model will pack 18 cores and a top clock speed of 5 GHz on two cores), and the company made lofty promises of up to 31% better performance while sipping 43% less power than its first-gen Snapdragon X silicon. But it didn't showcase any benchmark numbers or back up those claims – until now.

We were at the event and able to run some tests ourselves on the company's slim reference design laptop. The conditions were controlled in the sense that the systems were set up by Qualcomm, with the benchmarks pre-installed, and we couldn't install any software ourselves.

Basically, we could click a benchmark and watch it run ourselves to retrieve numbers, and a couple of stations were set up showcasing typical results that were retrieved earlier. The results we saw were in the range of the results Qualcomm's slide deck results, below.

 




This is obviously far from an ideal way to judge performance. But numbers taken from reference systems should generally be taken with a few grains of salt anyway, because the performance of final retail devices will vary based on a system's cooling, as well as how the chip is configured to run for a given chassis or form factor.

So keep in mind that these are very early numbers that came from only the top-end chip tested in a reference design, and may be competing against chips that will no longer be the latest and greatest when Snapdragon X2 systems ship, which Qualcomm says will be in the first half of next year.

 




As for the reference system used for testing, it's a slim 16-inch laptop that Qualcomm says is equipped with 1TB of storage, and the chip packs 48GB of LPDDR5X-9523 RAM on a wide 192-bit bus. Doubtlessly, that helps boost the scores in several of the benchmarks below – especially graphics performance. But we'll likely have to wait quite a while to see how that impacts battery life over the more typical 128-bit bus of the non-extreme X2 Elite SoCs.

All that said, though, it's hard to argue that these numbers are anything but impressive.

For CPU testing, Qualcomm used Geekbench 6.5. In single-core, the X2 Elite Extreme achieved a single-core score of 4,080, beating the previous-gen Snapdragon X Elite (X1E-84-100, the top-end consumer chip) by 39%. Qualcomm also shows it beating the AMD Ryzen 9 HX 370 (2,881), Intel Core Ultra 9 288V (2,919), Intel Core Ultra 9 285H (3,026), and Apple M4 (3,872, tested in an actively cooled MacBook Pro).

In multi-core testing, the Extreme earned a score of 23,491, beating the old X Elite at 15,637 — a 50% increase. Qualcomm says this is up to twice as fast as the Core Ultra 9 288V (11,406). Here, the Core Ultra 9 285H took second place at 17,680.

Note that the new X2 Elite Extreme now supports Arm Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) instructions, which accelerate matrix operations commonly found in AI and HPC-class workloads. However, this extension isn't commonly used in standard desktop applications. The new Geekbench 6.5 features newly added support for SME, which contributes to some of these large performance gains in this benchmark.

Qualcomm measured the GPU with 3DMark Solar Bay ray tracing benchmark, which uses the Vulkan 1.1 graphics API (except on macOS, where it uses Apple's Metal). This is generally not a test we see run on integrated graphics. So, Qualcomm is likely either attempting to make a statement about its chip's gaming abilities or cherry-picking a test where it looks particularly impressive (my money is on a bit of both). Regardless, the X2 Elite Extreme earned a score of 90.06, 80% faster than last generation, and, per Qualcomm's testing, up to 61% faster than competitors (the AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370 scored 55.92). Intel's Core Ultra 9 288V was the closest competitor.

For NPU testing, Qualcomm used Procyon AI Computer Vision, where the Hexagon silicon earned a score of 4,151, 78% faster than the X1E-84-100. Qualcomm also says this score is as much as 5.7 times faster than the NPU in the Core Ultra 9 285H, and also beat the rest of the field.

Qualcomm ran a second AI test using Geekbench AI 1.5, with the Extreme earning a score of 88,615. While that's far faster than the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 did not run the test.

In short, the X2 Elite Extreme looks technically capable of beating pretty much every mobile chip currently on the market, often by a significant margin. But again, keep in mind that these benchmarks were chosen by Qualcomm, running in their own custom-designed chassis. So it's fair to assume that we are seeing best-case results.

Timing will also be important. Qualcomm has only stated that we should see X2 Extreme devices in the first half of 2026, which is a fairly wide window and as far as eight months in the future. Depending on when they arrive on shelves, they may be competing with improved next-gen designs from Apple, Intel, and AMD, which, at the very least, are likely to make these current comparisons look a little less impressive.

Price will also be a serious consideration, as Qualcomm representatives told us that we should expect X2 Elite Extreme should arrive at a price tier higher than the range we saw last year with the launch of its first-gen Snapdragon X chips. In short, X2 Extreme systems will probably sell for significantly more than $1,000. The lesser X2 Elite chips will almost certainly be more popular. But then again, if the company can maintain an impressive performance lead over its next-gen competition, there will always be those willing to pay extra for the best performance possible.

“[Yantar] is the tool Russia is using to somehow . . . keep us awake"

A new FT investigation has revealed how a Russian "military spy ship" has been tracked surveilling and mapping undersea cables along Europe's Atlantic coastline, possibly with nefarious purposes that could involve intercepting communications from NATO allies.

Undersea cables have become a hot-button topic of global infrastructure ever since a series of high-profile incidents that involved the cutting of cables relied upon by nations for global connectivity. Famously, a cable connecting Finland and Sweden to Europe was severed last year, an act of sabotage recently pinned on the crew of a Russian 'shadow fleet' tanker charged with the act.

FT's report claims that the Yantar sailed from Russia's Kola Peninsula in November of 2024, disguised as a civilian craft. The report claims the vessel is a "military spy ship" decked out with "a full armoury of surveillance equipment." Its purpose? "...a mission to map and potentially intercept the undersea cables on which NATO allies rely for internet access, energy, military communications, and financial transactions."

The report cites radar data from European Space Agency satellites, which purportedly show the ship lurking over undersea cables in the Irish Sea in November of last year, "at a point in the voyage when the ship was seeking to hide its activities." The report claims the ship was also spotted over cables between Norway and Svalbard, a strategically notable location in the Arctic.

FT alleges Russia held back the capabilities of Yantar following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, perhaps because of sanctions or fear of escalating tensions. The report says the Yantar's activities fall under the purview of Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodnikh Issledovanii (GUGI), which operates some 50 submarines, submersibles, and other crafts. According to the report, Yantar is just one of "several" vehicles that have spent months in UK waters conducting sustained surveillance around critical infrastructure like undersea cables, reflecting a broader heightened scene of activity in geopolitical affairs.

The report contains detailed maps documenting the Yantar's journey, including the aforementioned foray into the Irish Sea and stints in the English Channel as recently as this year. As the report notes, a country like the UK relies heavily on undersea conduits for data and raw materials like gas, with 99% of its digital communications and three-quarters of its gas supply funnelled along the sea floor. There are also more sensitive cables, like a US-UK network for tracking enemy submarines, the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System.

The report claims Yantar can drop "submersibles with manipulator arms" which can intercept information from them or even plant explosives. It's even possible Russia could interfere with timing signals sent along cables by interfering with the frequency of signals passing through, possibly disrupting high-frequency trading markets and other "time-sensitive industries."

The report details some of the history of the secretive GUGI outfit, and notes that Yantar has become a more conspicuous presence on the seas as its role has evolved. The report notes the Royal Navy is seeking funding for defensive sensors and underwater drones dubbed the "Atlantic Bastion" to protect undersea cables and its vital Trident nuclear submarines. Military experts cited in the report say that some countries have fallen behind the curve when it comes to deep-sea defense, citing "heightened concerns" that Russia may target cables to disrupt life in Western nations, notably in countries offering help and security to Ukraine.

It's September 29, the day that America celebrates its least guilty vice and addiction, known in the streets as “java” or “joe.” That's right, it's National Coffee Day—the day that thousands of people burn $2 worth of gas waiting in a drive-thru to get a free $2 cup of coffee from Dunkin'.

Or how about this instead? Get free or cheap coffee without leaving your house, like a civilized person in the age of the internet. Take advantage of online coffee subscription deals instead.

WIRED has long considered delivery coffee subscriptions to be the promise of technology fulfilled: The best coffee, from all over the country and world, gets scooted to your door without you lifting more than a finger. Anyway, three of WIRED's absolute favorite coffee subscriptions are offering big introductory deals for National Coffee Day 2025, so it's a good day to discover the joys of always having good coffee.

Here are National Coffee Day deals on Atlas Coffee Club, Trade Coffee, and Podium Coffee. Each is 50 percent off for the holiday.

Atlas Coffee Club

Atlas (12 Oz)

Atlas is WIRED's favorite overall coffee subscription for multiple very good reasons. It roasts very good coffee. It also offers reliable, friendly, and swift service—a simple necessity when conducting long-distance relationships over the web. But especially, it offers single-origin coffee from a different country each month, letting you try coffee with flavors you likely haven't tried before. Arabica coffee from Vietnam, or coffee grown in multiple regions of China or India. It's cool. It's kinda what you want showing up at your door, and you can choose your favorite roast level to suit the kind of person you are.

Anyway, Atlas Coffee Club deals are going big for National Coffee Day.

Between September 29 and October 1, 2025, enter the Atlas Coffee promo code FREECOFFEE to get the following discounts and freebies:

Trade

Trade (11 Oz Bag)

If Atlas is our favorite single-origin roaster subscription, Trade Coffee is your ticket to coffee from everywhere—the best and broadest selection of coffee from the best coffee roasters all over the country. I like Trade, especially, as a great way to find roasters I would have never tried, whether chocolatey roasts from Canton, Georgia, or big funky, fruity, light roasts from Portland, Oregon.

And so a Trade Coffee deal is always welcome. On National Coffee Day, Trade Coffee is offering half off a one-month trial subscription.

Podium Coffee Club

Podium (Platinum Subscription)

Podium (Gold Subscription)

Podium Coffee Club is yet another vision of coffee subscription, and also among my favorites. The name says it all: It's a coffee subscription devoted to only award-winning coffees that have been judged among the best in the country and world in large and credible competitions. Podium picks just one wonderful coffee to send you each month, depending on whether you asked for the Gold or the Platinum subscription.

The Podium Gold subscription is generally very balanced, classic, excellent coffee beans. The Podium Platinum subscription, in part, raises its standards for how prestigious an award a coffee might need to be included. But also, the Platinum picks are often rare, funky, interesting, or just different—coffee that changes your mind about what coffee's supposed to taste like. Either way, lucky you, it's cheap today with an exclusive code from WIRED.

Enter the Podium Coffee Club promo code WIREDNTNLCFF50 for half off your first month's subscription.

Coffee is a fast-ticking clock. And the end of this stopwatch is nothing you want. Fresh coffee is all about aroma and intensity—the delicate notes of toffee or nectarine that make each bean distinct. Old coffee loses all of this. It tastes instead acrid and flabby, like a cup of wet cardboard.

But freshness is a difficult target. I drink coffee about like a horse takes to water, but I buy it just as impulsively. I am also constantly testing out coffee to find the Best Coffee Subscriptions, and to give each brand a fair shake, I always drink those fresh in the optimal tasting window. Which means the rando special bag I bought for myself last Thursday often has to wait. And sometimes I can't manage to brew all my coffee within a few weeks of its roast date.

That's where freezing comes in.

So, should you freeze coffee beans? Or is freezing just a new way to mess up coffee beans—by introducing frosty moisture, or tainting it with the smell of the frozen chicken and peas in your icebox? The answer, according to coffee experts and chemists alike, is that you're probably better off freezing coffee than letting warm air do its slow work. But this is only true if you do it correctly.

What's more, frozen beans can in fact lead to better flavor on light-roast coffee in particular, according to at least one study—because it helps you get more consistent coffee grounds and therefore better flavor. More on that later.

Here's a quick rundown on how to keep your coffee fresh without also ruining it, and why frozen coffee sometimes trumps fresh.

Believe it or not, there's such a thing as coffee that's too fresh. You probably don't want to brew coffee the day after it's roasted. For light roasts in particular, most roasters tend to recommend you wait five to seven days after the roast date before brewing, in order to allow your coffee to off-gas a bit and become a little easier to extract. This is especially important when it comes to espresso, where extraction is a volatile and finicky process.

But, alas, if you just leave the coffee in its bag, on the counter, it may start to go stale beginning a couple weeks later. You know that nice smell of fresh coffee beans? Those lovely aromatic compounds are exiting the beans, and dispersing into the air: That's why you can smell them. Eventually, they'll diminish. At the same time, oxygen is sneaking in to do its grim work, turning your beans to stale rust.

Depending how it's stored, coffee can begin to degrade anywhere from two weeks to a month after roast date (i.e., the optimal window may just be a week or two for each bag).

You can extend this a bit by storing the coffee in an airtight container. One that I particularly like (and that we recommend in our Gifts for Coffee Lovers guide) is the vacuum-sealed Fellow Atmos. This can keep your beans fresher for longer on your counter and also keep them from taking on bad aromas in your freezer.

If you know you're not going to get through a bag of beans, the best time to freeze is not when your beans are already starting to go stale. Rather, do so just before the optimal flavor window.

The science on the staying power of frozen coffee is somewhat thin, notes Christopher Hendon, a materials chemist at University of Oregon, whose research into coffee extraction and flavor has earned him the nickname “Dr. Coffee.” But there's reason to believe freezing slows the staling process but doesn't halt it.

“My inclination is to think that if you freeze something, all the kinetic processes slow down a lot, and so you'd expect it to stale less quickly,” Hendon told WIRED in August. But those volatile compounds? Gases both exiting and entering the bean? Those processes will still continue, albeit more slowly. So this is why you might freeze coffee early, to give it a chance to get to optimal flavor even while frozen.

But if your coffee is already starting to go stale? It'll still get a little more stale in the freezer. Just a bit more slowly.

There are a few main principles to properly freezing your beans.

The key to avoiding moisture and bad aromas is to store it correctly, so that the coffee isn't ruined by volatile temperatures, frost, or terrible terrible aromas from whatever you've got stored in your fridge. People with sensitive palates, for example coffee expert James Hoffmann, tend to be quite sensitive to any freezer aroma contamination—and coffee does love to take on flavors.

So, don't just stick your coffee bag straight into the freezer and use it like a coffee bag. It'll frost over. It'll taste weird. To avoid all this, recommend Hoffmann and others, you'll want to use airtight or vacuum-sealed storage to keep your coffee safe from tasting like meat. Using vacuum sealer bags or even zipper bags can feel wasteful over time. And so an Atmos in the freezer is one good reusable solution.

Note that the back of the freezer is likely to have more stable temperatures than the front and thus be less likely to expose the coffee to the chance of freezing and unfreezing over and over.

Ideally, you also want to avoid opening and closing your cleverly vacuum-sealed bag, then putting it back in the freezer. The reason is simple: You'll let in moist air from the outside, then this will freeze in your freezer bag. You'll get ice and moisture. And too much moisture will change your coffee in some unknown way. (Note that Hendon is less worried about a small bit of moisture, since his research shows it reduces static and thus helps your coffee grind better.)

One option is to use ziplock bags inside a container, such as the Atmos. Another, less wasteful option is a reusable zipper bag, like silicone Stasher bags, which have the added benefit of not being made out of plastic. This will also let you seal up your coffee in small doses, so you can pull out smaller quantities at a time without adulterating them.

The clock didn't stop ticking. It's just ticking slower. Carbon dioxide and other volatile aromatic compounds will still leave your coffee beans over time, even if you've effectively sealed it up. Your coffee will degrade unless it's much, much colder than your home freezer will ever get—getting stale in a matter of three to six months but probably getting some other version of freezer burn long before that.

Here's a funny conundrum. Coffee from fresh beans is always better, of course. Except when it isn't. Sometimes it's possible for frozen coffee to taste better because of a quirk of physics called “glass transition.”

Under most circumstances, light-roast coffee beans are difficult to grind evenly. Unlike dark-roast beans, which crumble easily, lighter-roast beans are denser. They break up into bigger pieces. They resist a grinder. And so they often don't grind as evenly or easily, if you don't have an excellent grinder that's designed well for light roast. (See WIRED's guide to the best coffee grinders.)

But freezing light-roast beans can make them grind more evenly, according to a study by Dr. Hendon at the University of Oregon, published in Nature in 2016.

“Our current understanding is that coffee, solid coffee—as in, like, coffee beans—undergoes what's known as a glass transition, which is a solid-to-solid phase transition,” Hendon told me this August by way of explanation. “The mechanical properties of the coffee itself are affected in some meaningful way: In this case, coffee goes from being maybe sort of spongy to being more brittle.”

Which is to say, frozen light-roast coffee breaks easier, and it breaks more evenly. I encourage you to look at the pretty graphs in Hendon's article. But I also tested this myself using a device called the DiFluid Omni particle size analyzer and also WIRED's favorite coffee grinder, the Baratza Encore ESP.

Starting with a bag of fresh (and delicious) light-roast Ethiopian Halo beans from Portland's Heart Coffee, I froze one ziplock bag of beans and ground it with the Encore ESP—then put the coffee grounds through particle-size analysis, collating the results across a number of samples and tests. I then used the same grinder setting on unfrozen beans.

The results weren't dramatic, but they did back up Hendon's study: The frozen beans ground up a bit more consistently. The standard deviation on the frozen beans was about 8 percent smaller than with the unfrozen beans. In particular, freezing beans seemed to reduce the share of larger coffee grounds above 600 microns. This is fairly anecdotal confirmation, of course—but it did line up with Hendon's study.

It also amounts to a surprising argument for freezing beans, especially if you have a hard time brewing your beans within their optimal flavor window otherwise. Because in coffee, better grind is better flavor.

Starting today, OpenAI is rolling out ChatGPT safety tools intended for parents to use with their teenagers. This worldwide update includes the ability for parents, as well as law enforcement, to receive notifications if a child—in this case, users between the ages of 13 and 18—engages in chatbot conversations about self harm or suicide.

These changes arrive as OpenAI is being sued by parents who allege ChatGPT played a role in the death of their child. The chatbot allegedly encouraged the suicidal teen to hide a noose in their room out of sight from family members, according to reporting from The New York Times.

As a whole, the content experience for teens using ChatGPT is altered with this update. "Once parents and teens connect their accounts, the teen account will automatically get additional content protections,” reads OpenAI's blog post announcing the launch. “Including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate."

Under the new restrictions, if a teen using a ChatGPT account enters a prompt related to self-harm or suicidal ideation, the prompt is sent to a team of human reviewers who decide whether to trigger a potential parental notification.

"We will contact you as a parent in every way we can,” says Lauren Haber Jonas, OpenAI's head of youth well-being. Parents can opt to receive these alerts over text, email, and a notification from the ChatGPT app.

The warnings parents may receive in these situations are expected to arrive within hours of the conversation being flagged for review. In moments where every minute counts, this delay will likely be frustrating for parents who want more instant alerts about their child's safety. OpenAI is working to reduce the lag time for notifications.

The alert that could potentially be sent to parents by OpenAI will broadly state that the child may have written a prompt related to suicide or self harm. It may also include conversation strategies from mental health experts for the parents to use while talking with their child.

In a prelaunch demo, the example email's subject line shown to WIRED highlighted safety concerns but did not explicitly mention suicide. What the parental notifications also won't include are any direct quotes from the child's conversation—neither the prompts nor the outputs. Parents can follow up with the notification and request conversation time stamps.

"We want to give parents enough information to take action and have a conversation with their teens while still maintaining some amount of teen privacy,” says Jonas, “because the content can also include other sensitive information."

Both the parent's and the teen's accounts have to be opted-in for these safety features to be activated. This means parents will need to send their teen an invitation to have their account monitored, and the teen is required to accept it. The account linkage can also be initiated by the teen.

OpenAI may contact law enforcement in situations where human moderators determine that a teen may be in danger and the parents are unable to be reached via notification. It's unclear what this coordination with law enforcement will look like, especially on a global scale.

Another major ChatGPT update rolling out as part of these changes is the new ability for parents to set time restrictions for their teens in ChatGPT. Rather than a certain amount of usage hours, however, ChatGPT access can be blocked during specific time periods, like from 8 pm to 10 am.

Altogether, the parental controls include multiple granular choices for guardians to make about their child's ChatGPT experience. In addition to the restriction of sensitive content and quiet hours, parents can opt their kid's data out of model training, turn off the bot's saved memories, and disable voice mode as well as image generation.

“Guardrails help, but they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them,” reads OpenAI's blog. WIRED's past testing of OpenAI's GPT-5 model showed that certain aspects of potential guardrails could be circumvented with basic commands in the custom instructions.

All of these updates also come after the death of another teen who was using a chatbot from Character.ai, a role-playing platform popular with young users. Following the death, Character.ai implemented parental controls to allow more visibility into teenage usage patterns. The visibility only goes so far; Character.ai's parental notifications do not include content-specific alerts, like those for suicidal ideation.

Other AI companies are likely to mimic OpenAI's approach to these types of teen safety tools. “We want users to be able to use our tools in the way that they want, within very broad bounds of safety,” wrote CEO Sam Altman in a blog post originally announcing the tools two weeks ago. Even if these attempts to protect teens prove successful, it's highly unlikely the same protections around suicidal ideation will be rolled out for adults due to OpenAI's concerns about user privacy.

Tile trackers, used to locate everything from lost keys to stolen pets, are used by more than 88 million people worldwide, according to Tile's parent company, Life360. But researchers who examined the tracking technology have found design flaws that would let stalkers—or potentially the manufacturer itself—track the location of Tile users and their devices, contrary to claims the company has made about the security and privacy of its devices.

The researchers—Akshaya Kumar, Anna Raymaker, and Michael Specter of Georgia Institute of Technology—found that each tag broadcasts an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that can be picked up by other Bluetooth devices or radio-frequency antennas in a tag's vicinity to track the movements of the tag and its owner. The location of a tag, its MAC address, and unique ID also get sent unencrypted to Tile's servers, where the researchers believe this information is stored in cleartext, giving Tile the ability to track the location of tags and their owners, even though the company claims it does not have this capability.

The researchers say this would give Tile the ability to conduct “mass surveillance” on its users and potentially provide that information to law enforcement and others.

The researchers also found that Tile's anti-stalking protection can be easily undermined if a stalker enables an anti-theft feature that Tile offers with its tags. Additionally, someone could falsely frame a Tile owner for stalking by recording the unencrypted broadcasts their Tile device makes and replaying these broadcasts in the vicinity of another Tile user, making it seem like the former is stalking the latter.

The researchers reported their findings to Tile's parent company, Life360, last November, but they say the company stopped communicating with them in February. WIRED sent Life360 an email asking for a response to the issues raised by the researchers, but a spokesperson sent a reply that did not explicitly address the problems. The email said only that the company had “made a number of improvements” since receiving the researchers' report, without specifying what those were.

Tile sells stand-alone tags, but its tracking technology is also embedded in laptops, headphones, smartwatches, and other products made by companies like Dell, Bose, and Fitbit. The researchers reverse engineered Tile's protocol and Android mobile app used with the Tile Mate, the company's most popular tracker tag. They say their findings may not apply to other models of Tile tags or the Tile technology used in products made by third parties.

Tile trackers operate similarly to tracking tags made by Apple, Google, and Samsung. But Tile's system differs in important ways. Like the others, Tile tags are battery-powered and use Bluetooth to broadcast their location to a user's phone. Users can slip a tag into a briefcase, luggage, or vehicle, or attach it to keys, a phone, laptop, or even a pet collar to track the location of these items.

Each Tile tag broadcasts the tag's MAC address and a unique ID, which changes periodically. If an item paired with the tag goes missing the owner, using their Tile app, can instruct the tag to emit a sound to locate it. For items farther away, the system relies on the network of phones belonging to other Tile users. These also pick up the broadcast of any Tile device near them. And since 2021, Ring cameras, Echo devices, and Tile tags have been integrated into Amazon's Sidewalk network, meaning Ring and Echo devices can pick up the location of Tile tags as well.

Each time these devices pick up the broadcast from a Tile tag, the location, MAC address, and unique ID of that tag get sent to a Tile server where it's stored in a database, the researchers found. The owner of a lost tag and item can then use their Tile app to query the database for their latest location. The problem, according to the researchers, lies in how Tile has implemented this system.

Tile claims that user information transmitted across its network can't be seen by anyone. “You are the only one with the ability to see your Tile location and your device location,” the company states in its privacy policy. But the researchers found that the MAC address and unique ID that a Tile tag broadcasts is not encrypted, allowing someone in the vicinity of a tag with a Tile app on their phone or a radio frequency antenna to intercept this information as its transmitted and track the location of the tag and associated item or its owner.

Other tag makers replace the MAC address with a rotating unique ID and only transmit the ID. By changing the ID periodically, someone recording broadcasts from a tag cannot easily link multiple broadcasts to the same tag to track the movement of that tag and associated item or owner.

But because Tile's system transmits both the MAC address and the unique ID, and does not encrypt this transmission, someone can intercept this information. Tile's unique ID also rotates—it changes every 15 minutes if the tag is near the owner's phone or once in 24 hours if not—but because the MAC address is static and does not change, it can be used to track a tag regardless of the changing ID. Even if Tile chose to not transmit the MAC address, the researchers say, the way Tile generates the changing ID is not secure and can still be used to track a tag.

“An attacker only needs to record one message from the device … to fingerprint it for the rest of its lifetime,” says Kumar, who says this creates a risk of systemic surveillance for anyone whose tag is caught up in a scan.

Law enforcement could potentially use this to identify anyone in an area that has a Tile tag or Tile-enabled device. And because this location information seems likely to be stored unencrypted on Tile's server, researchers say, Tile could also track the location of tags or share this information with any third party.

“These issues transform Tile's infrastructure into a global tracking network,” the researchers claim in a paper they wrote about their findings.

When an Apple, Google, or Samsung tag gets detected in a scan, the report that gets sent to the company servers containing the tag's ID and location information is end-to-end encrypted so that no one can intercept the broadcasts as they're transmitted, and the companies themselves cannot see the location information to track the movement of the tags. Only a tag owner can see this information because a key on their phone decrypts the location data on the company's server that is associated with their tag ID.

“They have designed their system intentionally such that they aren't able to recover your location or the location of where your items are,” says Specter. “Because they don't want to be in the business of knowing where all people are at all times.”

In a study published last year, researchers measuring the misuse of Bluetooth location trackers—including devices from Apple, Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo—found that more than 40 percent of stalking victims had been tracked with Bluetooth tags hidden in their cars, purses, or backpacks.

To address this, makers of location-tracking technology have implemented solutions to alert users when a tracking device they don't own appears to be moving with them. But the researchers say that Tile's implementation is flawed in ways that both undermine its effectiveness and make it susceptible to being used to track the movement of other users.

Unlike other trackers—which conduct a continuous scan for trackers in a user's vicinity that they don't own and automatically alert the user to the presence of these trackers—Tile's so-called Scan and Secure system has to be manually initiated by a user through the Tile app. The scan lasts only 10 minutes, and the user has to be moving around an area while the scan is in progress to detect tags that are moving with them. Users have to also remember to re-initiate scans periodically to detect any rogue devices that might be traveling with them since their last scan.

Tile's app performs six Bluetooth scans during the 10 minutes and extracts the MAC address and unique ID from each broadcast it detects. The app then checks these addresses against a database to determine if they are paired with the phone of the person doing the scan. Any address or ID that is not paired with their phone is designated “unknown.” The app produces a report of these tags for the person to view. It also sends a message to the Tile server with all the MAC addresses and unique IDs detected during the six scans, and the number of times they appeared.

But the researchers found that the Scan and Secure feature is undermined by another feature Tile offers for preventing theft. The researchers say this anti-theft mode is unique to Tile, and the problems it presents for Tile users may be the reason.

The aim of anti-theft is to prevent would-be thieves from running a scan using a Tile mobile application to see if there is a Tile tag paired with an item they plan to steal. But when a tag owner enables anti-theft to make their tag invisible to would-be thieves, those tags also won't be visible to someone running a scan to determine if they are being stalked with a rogue tag. This means a stalker could hide their stalking tag by putting it in anti-theft mode. A scan will still detect the tag and send its MAC address, unique ID, and location to Tile's servers, but the tag won't be included in the scan results that are displayed to the user who initiated the scan, effectively making potential stalking victims blind to rogue devices that may be following them.

Kumar says other makers of location trackers avoid this by not even offering anti-theft mode for their products.

“They never say, ‘Here's a tag that can prevent your devices from being stolen.' They say it helps recover lost devices. Anti-theft is just not a feature,” she says. “That's a compromise that these companies are willing to make in order to have stronger anti-stalking properties.”

The researchers also say that the anti-theft mode isn't foolproof because a user with a modified Tile app can easily circumvent it to collect and display all MAC addresses and unique IDs recorded during a scan, regardless of whether any of those tags are using anti-theft mode.

Tile believes it solves the anti-theft abuse problem by requiring that anyone who enables anti-theft mode for their tag provide a government-issued ID and live photo of their face to Tile before anti-theft mode will be enabled. Users of this mode also have to consent to a $1 million fine if they are convicted of using Tile for stalking—though the researchers point out that it's unclear if this is enforceable.

Tile states in its terms that the identity information users provide will be shared with law enforcement if Tile believes someone has abused the feature for stalking. But the company is inconsistent about whether law enforcement needs a warrant to get this information. In a FAQ the company says it will “work with law enforcement through a properly issued court order to identify the owner of a suspicious Tile.” But in the terms for its anti-theft mode, users agree that their “personal information can and will be shared with law enforcement at our discretion, even without a subpoena” to aid investigations of suspected stalkers.

Lastly, the researchers say someone can abuse the Scan and Secure feature to frame someone else for stalking by executing a replay attack to impersonate their Tile tag. Using a radio-frequency antenna to collect the unencrypted broadcasts from another user's tag, an attacker can extract the MAC address and unique ID from these broadcasts, and transmit that in another location. If a user conducts an anti-stalking scan in that location, they would see this MAC address and unique ID in the scan, and this information and the location of where it was scanned would be sent to Tile's server, making it appear as if that tag was near the person who did the scan. There is no way to determine, the researchers say, if a MAC address and unique ID was emitted by a legitimate Tile device or someone maliciously replaying that information.

The researchers say many of the problems they found could be addressed simply by Tile encrypting the broadcasts from its tags, and they don't understand why the company apparently hasn't followed the example of its competitors.

Resuscitation Care Units (RCUs) provide intensive, comprehensive and immediate medical care for critically ill patients with life-threatening conditions, such as cardiac arrest, requiring specialized monitoring and rapid intervention from a multidisciplinary team. Many studies have shown that creating these special high-acuity areas in an emergency department, can save lives and improve patient outcomes. However, questions about financial sustainability have slowed adoption of these units.

A new study by researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and UMass Chan Medical School has found these dedicated units not only benefitted patients, but resulted in improved efficiency, documentation and reimbursement costs for the hospital.

"For patients, RCUs mean that the sickest people in the emergency department receive faster, more focused care from specially trained teams. For the health system, it means this approach can pay for itself, because the billing better matches the real work being done; which makes it more likely that hospitals will be willing to adopt these units, which in turn can improve emergency care for everyone," explains corresponding author Michael Sherman, MD, MA, FACEP, assistant professor of emergency medicine & critical care medicine at the school.

The researchers performed a retrospective review of approximately 75,000 emergency visits at

UMass Memorial Medical Center, a busy urban hospital. They compared the 35 weeks before and after the institution opened a nine-bed RCU in July 2019. They reviewed the billing codes (which reflect the intensity of care) and revenue from those visits and then compared the patterns with a nearby hospital in the same system that didn't have an RCU. This novel study showed a strong association with RCU's and improved ED efficiency and coding, representing more accurate reimbursement for these units and demonstrating the fiscal sustainability of the model.

According to the researchers, RCU's are known to decrease the need for ICU admission, shorten hospital and intensive care unit stays and cut direct costs by preventing illness from worsening. "By centralizing care for the sickest patients, RCUs help doctors and nurses deliver antibiotics, fluids and other lifesaving treatments faster, while freeing ICU beds for patients who need longer-term care," adds Sherman who also is an emergency & critical care physician at Boston Medical Center.

Beyond money and coding, the study suggests that changing how emergency departments are organized can improve care and efficiency. "It shows that small changes in workflow (like staffing ratios and dedicated space) can have a big impact without building a whole new department or building," says Sherman.

These finding appear online in the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine.

California nurses with doctorates do not have the right to call themselves doctors, a federal court ruled, upholding a state law that regulates what titles health professionals can use in advertisements.

In a September 19 decision, the US District Court for the Central District of California rejected claims by nurses with Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degrees that the state violated their free speech rights by banning them from using the title “Dr” in the healthcare setting.

The use of “Dr” by nonphysicians in clinical settings is “inherently misleading” commercial speech and is not protected by the First Amendment, District Judge Jesus G. Bernal wrote in his ruling.

Pacific Legal Fund attorney Donna Matias, who represented the nurses, said the plaintiffs were disappointed that the court “failed to grapple with relevant Supreme Court precedent that protects First Amendment rights.”

“Instead of reining in the state's power to censor professionals who accurately describe their credentials, the decision emboldens it,” Matias said in an email to Medscape Medical News. “The First Amendment does not allow the government to silence truthful speech simply because some listeners may be confused — especially when disclosure can address any concerns short of a total ban.”The defendants in the case, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and California Medical Board President Kristina Lawson, did not return messages seeking comment.

The California Medical Association (CMA), welcomed the decision, saying it upholds the state's “well-established prohibition against nonphysicians using the title ‘Dr' in healthcare settings.” The CMA filed a joint amicus brief with the American Medical Association (AMA) in the case in support of the defendants.

“This decision protects patients by providing clarity and transparency about the level of training and education of the person providing their care,” CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, MD, said in a statement. “Allowing patients to make informed decisions is foundational to our health care system.”

Under California's Business and Professions Code Section 2052, anyone who refers to themselves as a doctor in words or in advertisements without having a valid certificate as a physician is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to sanctions.

Three California DNPs sued the state over the law in June 2023. Two of the plaintiff nurses said they've used the title “Dr” in the past on embroidered clinician jackets, clinical documents, nameplates, and on social media.

Before learning about the law, plaintiff Jacqueline Palmer testified she introduced herself to patients as “Dr” but always added she was a nurse practitioner. A third plaintiff intended to use the title when he opened his esthetics clinic but put the opening and its website on hold after he learned about the law, according to court documents.

In their complaint, the nurses contended the state law unconstitutionally criminalizes the use of “Dr” and that the measure does not serve a compelling state interest. They argued their use of “Dr” is not misleading and that the state law “regulates more extensively than necessary.”

Attorneys for the state asked the court to throw out the suit, arguing the law is a legitimate regulation of commercial speech because the plaintiffs' use of “Dr” is “inherently misleading” and that the law advances a substantial governmental interest.

In his ruling, Bernal wrote the harms cited by the state over DNPs calling themselves doctors are “real” and that evidence shows such titles by DNPs can confuse patients. Bernal cited an AMA survey that found 39% of patients believe a DNP is a physician.

“The Court finds that it is reasonable to infer that some consumers will assume that plaintiffs are licensed physicians or surgeons if they use ‘Dr' or ‘doctor' in healthcare settings and in advertising materials promoting medical services, even if plaintiffs also identify themselves as DNPs,” Bernal wrote.

Bernal noted that while the use of “Dr” in the healthcare setting is not a traditional form of advertising, the “specific product” plaintiffs seek to advertise is the expertise, knowledge, and quality of services such professional titles convey to patients and colleagues. The nurses have an economic motive for engaging in this kind of speech, which is “to solicit and retain a patient base and improve their professional brand,” Bernal said.

The California Nurses Association declined to comment on the ruling. The American Nurses Association did not return messages seeking comment.

Lorie A. Brown, RN, JD, Indianapolis-based attorney who represents nurses and health providers, said she was surprised by the ruling. If a nurse obtains a DNP, it's reasonable that they should be able to refer to themselves as “Dr,” she said, adding that other professionals with doctorates do not face the same scrutiny.

“The person that gets the doctorate, the DNP or the EdD or the PhD, it's the degree,” she said. “So, I guess Dr Jill Biden can still use her [EdD] title, but yet nurses who have the same level of degree can't use the title, I think that's unfair. All of your hard work and education, you can't even use the title that you earn, at least in California.”Brown said the ruling could have broader implications outside of California, including other courts citing the ruling when title disagreements arise among nurses and physicians. The ruling could also lead to other states enacting similar statutes, she said, adding that California is often seen as a leader in legislation.

New research reveals that reducing air pollution not only improves children's eyesight but could also play a crucial role in tackling the soaring rates of myopia worldwide.

Study: Benefits of clean air for school children's vision health. Image credit: Wallenrock/Shutterstock.com

A recent PNAS Nexus study used a large sample of school-aged children to investigate the potential benefits of cleaner air for vision and to identify the primary factors influencing visual acuity.

Myopia or short-sightedness has become a significant global public health concern, with prevalence rates reaching 80-90% in school-leavers in East Asia. Well-known risk factors of myopia include intensive screen use, having myopic parents, and other behavioral habits that lower exposure to natural light.

Recent research has shown that children in regions with worse air quality are more likely to have poorer visual health. Air pollution may increase oxidative stress and exacerbate ocular surface inflammation. This suggests that myopia risk may be increased with chronic pollution exposure. However, the direct evidence linking cleaner air and better visual acuity is limited, and the problem is being able to satisfactorily account for confounding influences from other factors that also affect vision.

Traditional regression models like logistic or linear regression have difficulty making sense of the complex patterns in large health datasets. This problem is solved by automated machine learning (AutoML), which does not require any prior specification of the relationships between variables and can automatically model nonlinear influences and interactions.

This study used an explainable AutoML framework to identify the primary drivers of childhood myopia, evaluate age- and severity-specific variations in risk factor profiles, and quantify the benefits of cleaner air. The sample comprised approximately 30,000 primary, middle, and high school students from Tianjin, China, recruited from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, in Tianjin, China.

School nurses or trained healthcare professionals conducted myopia screening. Each eye's uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was measured at 5m, and noncycloplegic autorefractions were also used to determine spherical equivalent refraction, which was part of the myopia diagnosis. Several confounders were considered, and data were collected on academic pressure and schooling characteristics, familial myopia history, lifestyle factors, and environmental factors, including air quality.

The average age of the participants was 10.4 years, and 51.9% were male at birth. Most of the sample (84.7%) came from urban areas, with an average prevalence of myopia of 53.2%. Approximately 11.0% of all students slept with lights on, and there was heterogeneity in sleep duration by grade. For example, 4.0% of junior high-school students slept ≥9 hours, while 9.8% of primary school students slept ≥10.

Parental myopia prevalence was 64.5% with one myopic parent. About 79% of the students consumed 4–6 grams of salt per day, and about 82% consumed desserts ≤3 times per week. Median exposure values to 2-year average air pollutants were 33.6 μg m−3 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 38.6 μg m−3 for PM2.5.

Thirty machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict UCVA in the given sample, including parental myopia, school type, nighttime light, NO₂ levels, and PM₂.₅ levels, in order of importance. Attendance at primary school was generally associated with higher UCVA, whereas middle and high school attendance was associated with negative UCVA outcomes.

Similarly, coherent patterns were seen for environmental factors. Greener surroundings were linked to better UCVA; conversely, poorer UCVA was seen in areas with heavier pollution. A key point is that the factors influencing myopia often interact, sometimes offsetting and sometimes amplifying individual impacts. Studying a single factor in isolation can misrepresent its true weight. Other important contributors included sex, sleep duration, homework burden, and sports participation, highlighting that daily behaviors also shaped UCVA outcomes.

On average, primary school children exhibited better vision than senior students. Demographic/genetic influences explained about 81.0% of the total UCVA variation among children with high myopia. In children with less severe myopia, about 12% and 14% of UCVA variation were explained by environmental factors and behavioral habits, respectively. A trend was noted whereby high myopia prevalence increased with age. NO2 was a more influential predictor in less severe myopia. These findings suggest that demographic factors are most important in high myopia, while differences in pollution exposure have a stronger impact on less severe myopia.

Clean air scenarios were created to quantify the potential benefits of improving air quality on UCVA. A marked improvement was noted in UCVA outcomes, with reductions in both NO2 and PM2.5. The average UCVA of the whole population improved by approximately 0.04 units, relative to the current baseline condition. Primary school students benefited the most, with their average UCVA improving by about 0.09 units, roughly double the overall population average; hence, younger students would benefit more from cleaner air.

This study uses an explainable machine learning tool to demonstrate the significant association between air pollution and decreased UCVA, particularly among younger school-age participants. This implies that expanding green spaces, enhancing air quality around schools, and fostering healthy lifestyle practices may safeguard children's visual health.

The authors highlight practical intervention strategies to reduce daily exposure, such as air purifiers in classrooms and establishing clean-air zones near schools.

This study's findings were limited by using self-reported data on lifestyle habits, which can introduce bias. The reliance on a single city may also limit the generalizability of the findings. Ambient air quality was used as a proxy for individual exposure; however, indoor exposures can be very challenging to measure accurately. Future research could conduct more in-depth causal analysis to assess the effectiveness of targeted strategies in managing myopia risk.

New research reveals just how much greener plant-based kibble is compared to meat-based dog food, from saving football fields of farmland to the carbon cost of long-haul flights.

Study: Environmental impact of feeding plant-based vs. meat-based dry dog foods in the United Kingdom. Image credit: Nina Buday/Shutterstock.com 

Dry dog foods in the United Kingdom may be classified as plant-based or animal-based. Each has a different environmental impact. A recent paper in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems breaks down, for the first time, the environmental costs of each type of dog food.

Plant-based foods have multiple health and environmental benefits when used as a main or sole part of the diet. Compared with animal-based foods, they generate far fewer greenhouse gases, cause less deforestation, and put less strain on soil fertility and biodiversity. They also reduce pressure on freshwater supplies and contribute less to soil and air pollution.

In 2018, the global dog population was about 471 million. While dogs are natural omnivores, meat-heavy diets drive significant greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, making up an estimated 2.5% to 8% of China's total emissions. In Brazil, dog food was estimated to produce 3% to 25% of the country's carbon dioxide emissions. Commercial dog food production produces threefold higher emissions than feeding dogs on human leftover food.

Prior research suggests that pet food production uses up 41 to 58 million hectares of farmland, or twice as much land as the entire area of the UK. Most of this comes from animal-based pet food manufacturing. According to human food supply chain statistics, plant protein production requires much less resource than animal meat production, but direct comparisons for pet food in the UK are lacking.

In the current study, the researchers looked specifically at 31 complete dry dog foods for adult dogs. They focused on the following parameters:

In each case, lifecycle assessments were carried out, which are systematic assessments of the impact of each stage of the manufactured product's life on the environment, from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste disposal. 

Plant- and animal-based pet foods had similar proportions of protein, fat, and fiber, except for veterinary food, which had less protein but more fat, by design, as these were all renal diets. The top ingredients included grains like corn and white rice, poultry fat, sunflower oil, and wheat gluten. Other grains, raw chicken meat, meat and bone meal, pea, potato, and textured vegetable protein were relatively common.

Plant-based diets were the most environmentally friendly for all types of dog food. Poultry-based and veterinary diets ranked next in sustainability, while red meat, unsurprisingly, placed the heaviest burden on the environment.

For plant-based diets, land use was below 3 square meters per 1,000 kcal, similar to poultry. Veterinary diets were a little higher at ~13 square meters. In contrast, lamb- and beef-based dog food used over 100 square meters of land per 1,000 kcal.

Lamb meals required ~93 square meters per 1,000 kcal, meat and bone meal was 47 square meters, and beef liver approximately half of that. Plant-based foods included mainly soy, at 1.7-1.8 square meters per 1,000 kcal, depending on the formulation.

Similar trends were seen with greenhouse gas production, where plant-based, poultry-based, and veterinary foods had comparably low emissions. Lamb produced ~4.6 times and beef ~11 times higher emissions than plant-based foods at ~13 and 32 kg CO2eq, respectively, vs ~2.8 kg CO2eq for plant-based foods. Meat and bone meal and raw beef liver had the highest emissions.

The same picture was obtained with acidifying and eutrophying emissions. Beef-based foods produced up to ~14 times, and lamb-based foods ~3-5 times higher emissions than plant-based foods. Lamb-based dog food used the most freshwater (irrigation, livestock production, industrial use) at ~684 L/1,000 kcal, while beef used ~575 L/1,000 kcal. Conversely, plant-based food used ~250 L/1,000 kcal. Poultry (~383 L) and veterinary diets (~501 L) were intermediate but still considerably higher than plant-based.

Overall, a Labrador retriever, eating about 280g of food a day, would use up approximately 350,000 square meters of land (about 52-57 football fields) if fed on lamb- or beef-based food for the nine years of its adult life, vs 1.4 and 2.7 football fields with plant-based or veterinary foods, respectively.  The greenhouse gas emissions would correspond to those of a Boeing 747 passenger taking 2.8 round-trips between New York and London, for a plant-based diet. With a veterinary or poultry-based diet, it would be nearer about five round-trips, soaring to 31 with lamb-based foods.

For multiple reasons, feeding dogs on animal byproducts did not make animal-based pet foods more sustainable.

The environmental cost of plant-based dog food is only a fraction of that of animal-based pet food. “Higher inclusion of plant-based ingredients in pet feed provides a major opportunity for pet food companies to mitigate the environmental footprint of companion animal food.”

However, the study assessed only environmental metrics; the authors note that nutritional bioavailability was outside its scope. They also highlight that while poultry and veterinary foods had a lower impact than beef or lamb, in some measures, their impacts overlapped with plant-based diets, meaning they were not always significantly different. Nonetheless, they remain substantially less sustainable than plant-based alternatives.

Using animal by-products does not close the sustainability gap, and circular food system approaches may be needed to reduce the sector's overall impact.

Real-time monitoring of key biomarkers is a critical prerequisite for early disease diagnosis and personalized therapy. Early detection of liver function impairment particularly relies on the measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). However, conventional methods, including electrochemical, colorimetric, and fluorescence-based assays, often suffer from operational complexity, high cost, and limited sensitivity, making them inadequate for "rapid, real-time, and low-cost" detection needs in clinical intraoperative monitoring or home-based health management. Therefore, the development of a novel, convenient, and highly sensitive ALT detection strategy holds significant clinical value and application potential.

Recently, the research team led by Prof. Hanyang Li at Harbin Engineering University has integrated functionalized liquid crystal (LC) microcavities with whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) laser technology to establish a novel real-time biosensing platform (Figure 1), enabling highly sensitive detection of ALT.

The team introduced stearic acid as a functional molecule within the LC microcavities. Leveraging its pH-responsive properties, the system can generate a pronounced optical response to pH variations induced by the ALT-catalyzed enzymatic reaction. These pH changes alter interfacial anchoring conditions, driving reversible transitions of LC molecules between radial and bipolar configurations. The resulting molecular orientation changes directly modulate the effective refractive index of the microcavity, thereby inducing a measurable redshift in the WGM laser resonance wavelength. This mechanism allows for real-time, label-free optical sensing of ALT enzymatic activity.

The normal reference range for ALT is typically 0-40 U/L, with critical thresholds at 40, 80, and 200 U/L being particularly relevant for early liver injury diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrated a highly linear correlation between ALT concentration (0-240 U/L) and reaction completion time, achieving a sensitivity of 0.67 s/(U/L). Based on both the reaction completion time and spectral peak dynamics, the platform enables graded evaluation of mild (40-80 U/L), moderate (80-200 U/L), and severe (>200 U/L) liver injury, providing a quantitative framework for more refined liver function assessment.

To further validate the clinical applicability of the proposed ALT biosensing approach, in vivo tests were conducted using mouse serum. The results showed excellent agreement with commercial ALT assay kits, further demonstrating the platform's practicality and potential for clinical translation.

The first detailed analysis of unplanned births that occurred outside the hospital setting in Austria has shown that, although such deliveries are rare, they pose challenges for emergency teams that attend, especially if babies are born prematurely.

In a study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress today (Monday), the researchers found that between 2017 and 2024 there were 173 unplanned, out-of-hospital births in the Styria region of Austria, of which 16 (9%) were premature (less than 37 weeks' gestation). The most premature was born at 26 weeks' gestation, weighing 845g, and four babies (25%) died around the time of birth.

Now, the team plan to identify regional differences in the rest of Austria, evaluating the preparedness of emergency teams, and assessing outcomes for both mothers and newborns.

Ms Helena Leonhartsberger, a medical student and research team member in the neonatology department at the Medical University of Graz, Austria, who also volunteers as a paramedic with the Austrian Red Cross, told the congress: "Our study is the first to document the frequency of out-of-hospital, unplanned, premature deliveries and the associated complications. We concluded that standardised emergency protocols and early involvement of specialised neonatal transport teams are crucial for improving outcomes.

Most emergency physicians are not specialised in paediatrics or, more specifically, in neonatology. Although these scenarios are rare, emergency teams must be adequately trained and prepared to handle them. Furthermore, appropriate equipment for treating newborns, particularly premature or critically ill neonates, should be available on all emergency vehicles."

Ms. Helena Leonhartsberger, Medical University of Graz

"We also plan to use these findings to improve training for emergency personnel and to recommend what neonatal emergency equipment should be made available and standardised on all Austrian emergency vehicles, ensuring consistent care nationwide."

Ms Leonhartsberger decided to research this topic after she attended an out-of-hospital birth as a paramedic during her first year of training.

"I was unprepared for the situation, but fortunately, everything went well," she said. "This led me to study pre-hospital deliveries of premature infants, aiming to explore how emergency teams can be better prepared for such high-risk situations and improve outcomes for these vulnerable patients."

The study, which was led by Professor Bernhard Schwaberger, deputy head of the clinical department of neonatology at the Medical University of Graz, found that the median age of babies born prematurely out of hospital was 35 weeks' gestation, with a median birth weight of 2390g.

Among the four babies that died, no resuscitation was attempted in two. One premature baby underwent successful pre-hospital resuscitation and intubation. Of the 12 surviving preterm infants, one required initial bag-mask ventilation and subsequent nasotracheal intubation by a neonatal intensive care team, and another received oxygen via face mask. Ten babies were able to breathe spontaneously.

The researchers found that the temperatures of the babies were recorded in only six of the 13 babies that were admitted to hospital, and the median temperature was 34.8°C; the lowest recorded temperature was 31.5°C.

Ms Leonhartsberger said: "Admission temperature is a key prognostic factor, yet this was not documented for all the babies, and when it was, the babies were often found to be hypothermic.

"Our findings underscore the need for national preparedness, not only through standardised protocols but also through ongoing training and appropriate equipment on all emergency vehicles. They also highlight the importance of public awareness, reinforcing that, while planned home births may be safe under ideal conditions, complications can arise quickly and unpredictably. The research supports the broader goal of improving maternal and neonatal outcomes by ensuring that every birth, regardless of location, receives the highest standard of emergency care."

A strength of the study is the detailed analysis of premature births outside of hospitals. The main limitation is the small number of cases and the fact that it focuses on one region of Austria so the finding may not reflect the situation in other areas. This is why the researchers now plan to analyse data in other regions.

Dr Felix Lorang is a member of the EUSEM abstract selection committee. He is head of the emergency department at SRH Zentralklinikum Suhl, Thuringia, Germany, and was not involved with the research. He said: "Premature deliveries always require careful medical supervision in hospital and will be performed by a highly trained and diverse team of experienced professionals to reduce any serious risk to both mother and baby. When these premature births take place out of the hospital setting in the unprepared environment of a household or an ambulance with a smaller team they present an even more significant challenge. Even though they are rare, they require preparation and the training that is part of the so-called HALO procedures: High-Acuity Low Occurrence.

"Helena Leonhartsberger's study shows, for the first time, the incidence of such births in one region in Austria, and how there were variations in how these births were managed. For instance, temperature management is a very important factor for the efficacy of further treatments. In this highly stressful setting, unfortunately only six out of the 13 babies admitted to hospital had their temperatures recorded, despite the importance of this intervention. It is crucial to identify the incidence and management of premature, unplanned, out-of-hospital deliveries, not just in other areas of Austria but also in other countries. This will enable planning to ensure that all emergency medical services adhere to agreed protocols, and that they have swift access to specialist neonatal equipment for treating and transporting premature babies to hospital."

People who have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may suffer worse symptoms if they live in areas with higher levels of air pollution, according to a multi-national study presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Patients with OSA often snore loudly, their breathing starts and stops during the night, and they may wake up several times. Not only does this cause excessive sleepiness, but it can also increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. OSA is very common, but many people do not realize they have the condition.

The research was presented by Martino Pengo, Associate Professor from the University of Milano-Bicocca and clinician at Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS, Milan, Italy. He told the Congress: "We know that OSA is more common in people who are older or overweight, but there's growing concern that air pollution also might make the condition worse. However, previous studies, mostly focused on just one country, have produced mixed results. We wanted to look at this on a larger scale, across several European cities, to better understand if and how air pollution affects OSA."

The study included data on 19,325 patients with OSA from 25 different cities in 14 countries [2]. All patients are taking part in a larger research project called the European Sleep Apnoea Database. As well as providing data on their age, sex, BMI and whether they smoke, all patients took part in a sleep study to measure the quality of their sleep and confirm a diagnosis of OSA, including recording pauses in breathing and drops in the level of oxygen in the blood.

Researchers combined this patient data with records of PM10 concentration in the air where each patient lives, taken from the Europe-wide Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. PM10 concentration is the amount of tiny particles, 10 micrometers or smaller, released into the air by vehicle exhausts and industrial processes, for example.

The analysis revealed that, overall, for every one unit increase in PM10, there was a modest but measurable increase in the patients' apnea hypopnea index (AHI). AHI is the number of apneas (when breathing stops) and hypopneas (when breathing is reduced) per hour during sleep. For example, among patients with low AHI (less than five) the average PM10 in the area where they live was relatively low (around 16 micrograms per cubic meter of air). In contrast, in patients with high AHI (five or more) the average PM10 was also higher (around 19 micrograms per cubic meter of air).

Researchers also found differences between the strength of the link between air pollution and OSA in different cities around Europe: for instance, in cities like Lisbon (Portugal), Paris (France), and Athens (Greece) the association was particularly strong.

We confirmed a statistically significant positive association between average long-term exposure to air pollution, specifically fine particles known as PM10, and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Even after we took account for other factors that we know have an effect on OSA, we still found an average increase in the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep of 0.41 for every one unit increase in PM10. This effect may seem small for an individual, but across entire populations it can shift many people into higher-severity categories, making it meaningful from a public health perspective."

Martino Pengo, Associate Professor, University of Milano-Bicocca 

"One of the most interesting findings was that the link between air pollution and OSA severity wasn't the same in every European location. In some cities, the impact was stronger; in others, it was weaker or even absent. These regional differences might be due to things like local climate, the type of pollution or even how healthcare systems detect OSA."

The researchers say they want to understand why the effects vary between cities and whether some people are more affected by pollution than others. They also hope to explore whether reducing pollution can improve sleep apnea symptoms.

Professor Sophia Schiza is Head of the European Respiratory Society's expert group on sleep disordered breathing, based at the University of Crete, Greece, and was not involved in the research. She said: "Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition. People who have OSA may know that they snore or wake up often in the night, and they may also feel sleepy during the day. There are also serious health risks associated with this condition. For people with OSA, especially those living in cities with high levels of air pollution, this study is important as it suggests pollution could be making their condition worse.

"For doctors caring for people with OSA, this research highlights the need to consider environmental factors like air quality alongside other risk factors. This study strengthens the connection between environmental health and sleep medicine. It reminds us that tackling air pollution isn't just good for the planet, it's also vital for our lungs and our sleep quality too."

Hypnosis can significantly improve patients' tolerance of masks to help them breathe when they are suffering from acute respiratory failure, according to a pilot study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress today (Monday).

People who come to hospital with breathing problems are often given non-invasive ventilation (NIV) via a mask and tubes connected to a machine in order increase the amount of oxygen in their blood and lower carbon dioxide levels. However, some patients are unable to tolerate a tight-fitting mask over their mouth and nose and have to be sedated or given anti-anxiety medication.

Dr Tobi Hamza, a resident emergency medicine doctor at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital (HMIMV) in Rabat, Morocco, told the Congress: "We decided to conduct this study in response to the significant anxiety, discomfort, and poor tolerance often observed in patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation, particularly those with acute respiratory distress. Given the increasing interest in non-pharmacological techniques to improve patient comfort and compliance, we wanted to explore whether medical hypnosis could improve NIV tolerance and outcomes."

Acute respiratory failure is a medical emergency and occurs when the lungs are unable to take in enough oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. There are a number of causes, including heart failure, lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia, infections and injuries to the chest or ribs.

Between December 2023 and May 2024, Dr Hamza and colleagues recruited 20 patients who came into the HMIMV emergency department with acute respiratory distress to a prospective pilot study. They randomised them into two groups: ten patients received the standard care of NIV and anti-anxiety medication if needed – the control group; a further ten patients received a hypnosis session and NIV.

The hypnosis session consisted of a calming induction phase using voice guidance, breathing synchronisation and visual imagery; a deepening phase to reduce anxiety and enhance dissociation from physical discomfort; and a therapeutic suggestion phase, aiming to promote feelings of safety, trust in the treatment and cooperation with the mask. A doctor trained in medical hypnosis conducted all the sessions."

Dr. Tobi Hamza, Resident Emergency Medicine Doctor, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital (HMIMV) 

The researchers assessed how well the patients tolerated the masks using a comfort score with a scale from 0 to 10, by assessing changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide and acidity levels (pH) in the arterial blood after one and four hours, any requirement for sedation and anti-anxiety medication, and whether or not NIV had to be discontinued [2].

"Our most significant result was a substantial improvement in NIV tolerance in the hypnosis group," said Dr Hamza. "Eight out of ten patients, 80%, in the hypnosis group successfully completed non-invasive ventilation sessions without requiring sedation or switching to invasive ventilation, compared to only five out of ten, 50%, in the control group.

"We also observed a reduction in agitation and respiratory distress scores, shorter duration of emergency room stay, and reduced need for anti-anxiety medication. Clinical efficacy was improved too. After four hours, we saw greater reductions in carbon dioxide in the blood and the acidity levels returned to normal. We were positively surprised by the magnitude of the difference. It confirmed that hypnosis could be a powerful complementary tool in emergency respiratory care, improving NIV tolerance, reducing patient distress and potentially improving outcomes. For clinicians it offers a low-cost, non-invasive, drug-free adjunct to support respiratory care."

Patients in the hypnosis group gave a higher comfort score: 7.5 out of ten, compared to 4.3 in the control group.

"To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective studies evaluating hypnosis as a supportive technique during NIV in emergency settings. While hypnosis has been explored in pain, procedural anxiety and chronic disease management, its application in acute respiratory distress with NIV is still very novel. Although it was a small study, the findings suggest a substantial clinical benefit and we are conducting a larger, multi-centre study to validate our findings and explore the long-term impact of hypnosis on outcomes, such as hospital stay, intubation rate and mortality," he concluded.

A strength of the study is its prospective design in a real-world emergency department with an emergency doctor trained in hypnosis. Limitations include that it was a single-centre study, it was difficult to obtain consent for hypnosis, especially when it would jeopardise immediate vital prognoses or patients were confused, and patients were excluded from the study if they presented as an extreme emergency; a doctor trained in hypnosis administered it to patients, which might limit the generalisability of the findings until more staff are trained in the technique; and the doctors and patients were not 'blinded' to which patients received which treatment.

Dr Felix Lorang is a member of the EUSEM abstract selection committee. He is head of the emergency department at SRH Zentralklinikum Suhl, Thuringia, Germany, and was not involved with the research. He said: "We do know that in the setting of non-invasive ventilation, verbal guidance is of utmost importance to ensure therapy adherence, especially in emergency settings. Hypnosis is a step further in intensifying the interaction, and this study suggests that hypnosis not only can help patients to tolerate non-invasive ventilation more easily and make them comfortable, but also can improve the clinical efficacy of the ventilation. This deserves further investigation in larger groups of patients."

Serine serves as a metabolic nexus in tumors, coordinating one-carbon metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, and redox regulation. In recent years, targeting the serine metabolic pathway, particularly the rate-limiting enzyme PHGDH, has attracted considerable attention as a promising anticancer strategy. Nevertheless, tumor cells preserve serine homeostasis through the coordinated regulation of endogenous synthesis and exogenous uptake, which often limits the efficacy of single-enzyme inhibition approaches. Notably, the function of serine transporters (SerTs) is intimately linked to their nanoscale spatial organization on the plasma membrane. However, owing to the lack of highly specific probes and ultra-resolution imaging techniques, the mechanisms underlying their assembly and functional relevance remain largely unexplored.Researchers from Wuhan University of Science and Technology and the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences have jointly published a paper in Research entitled "Mechanistic Insight into Serine Flux Regulation through Nanoscale Organization of Glucose and Serine Transporters by Substrate Probe-based dSTORM Imaging." The study developed a small-molecule substrate-based fluorescent probe (Ser-probe) derived from the structure of serine. This chemical probe not only exhibits high binding specificity and a one-to-one binding ratio with serine transporters (SerTs), but also possesses an extremely small molecular size. Compared with traditional biological probes such as antibodies, it offers significant advantages in terms of compactness, enabling highly efficient labeling of densely distributed target proteins on the cell surface. Leveraging the superior labeling performance of this probe combined with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), the researchers achieved super-resolution imaging and quantitative analysis of multiple serine transporters (SerTs). The work systematically revealed the nanoscale clustering behavior and regulatory mechanisms of SerTs in breast cancer cells.

Through precise chemical modification of the serine molecule, the research team preserved its transporter-binding moiety and conjugated it with a fluorophore, thereby successfully synthesizing Ser-probe. This probe exhibits high affinity and specificity. Competitive experiment demonstrated that its binding can be completely inhibited by free serine, which confirms its ability to specifically label SerTs under physiological conditions. The development of this probe provides a novel tool for super-resolution imaging of membrane transporters.Using dSTORM imaging, it was observed that from normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) to low-malignant MCF7 cells and highly malignant MDA-MB-231 cells, the point density on the cell membrane, average cluster area, and cluster coverage of SerTs all increased significantly. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the average cluster area of SerTs reached twice that of MCF10A cells, and the cluster coverage increased by 4.6-fold. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that cells with stronger SerT clustering exhibited higher uptake capacity of fluorescently labeled serine, indicating a positive correlation between the clustering tendency of these transporters and their transport function.

By employing dual-color dSTORM imaging, the study revealed significant colocalization of SerTs with glucose transporters (GluTs) on the plasma membrane, which was particularly pronounced in MCF7 cells with high PHGDH expression. The colocalization coverage reached 4.23%, markedly higher than the 1.41% observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest that cells with strong endogenous serine synthesis capacity are more prefer to forming SerT/GluT functional microdomains, thereby coordinately regulating glucose uptake and serine metabolism.Cholesterol depletion (MβCD treatment) or glycosidase digestion (PNGase F treatment) significantly disrupted the clustered assembly and colocalization of SerTs and GluTs, indicating that lipid raft microdomains and glycoprotein cross-linking networks constitute the physical basis for maintaining the stability of these transporter nanoclusters. This finding provides potential targets for the intervention of membrane protein assembly.Glucose deprivation markedly weakened the clustering capacity of GluTs, reducing the SerT/GluT colocalization coverage from 4.23% to 0.71%. The PHGDH inhibitor CBR-5884 induced enhanced clustering at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations its cytotoxic effects led to cluster disassembly. Combined interventions (inhibitor in combination with low glucose or free sialic acid) synergistically disrupted the protein cluster structures and significantly enhanced the anticancer effect. Cell viability decreased from 92.55% under single-drug treatment to 87.71% with inhibitor in combination with low glucose, or 78.84% with inhibitor in combination with free sialic acid.

This study is the first to reveal a direct connection between the spatial organization of SerTs and their function at the nanoscale. It breaks the conventional paradigm of metabolic research, which has been largely limited to enzyme activity and expression levels of key proteins, and offers a new perspective for investigating the role of nutrient transporters in the regulation of tumor metabolism.Developed the substrate probe applicable to super-resolution imaging of SerTs;Revealed the regulatory axis of "transporter nanocluster distribution-metabolic function-drug response";Established a model of the synergistic role of lipid raft and glycosylation in membrane protein assembly.The clustering pattern of SerTs may serve as a biomarker of tumor metabolic state;Combined targeting of metabolic enzymes and transporter assembly (e.g., PHGDH inhibitors with sialic acid) can enhance therapeutic efficacy;Provides a new strategy for developing therapies aimed at regulating the spatial organization of membrane proteins.

People whose fathers smoked during puberty seem to age faster than expected, according to research presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The researchers found signs of faster biological aging, compared to chronological age, in people whose fathers began smoking at age 15 or younger. They say smoking during puberty may create damage in boys' developing sperm cells that can be passed on to their children.

The researchers call for stronger efforts to prevent tobacco use in teenagers, not only to benefit the current generation but also future generations.

The study was presented by Dr Juan Pablo López-Cervantes from the University of Bergen, Norway. He said: "Our research group has previously shown that smoking during puberty may harm not only the person who smokes, but also their future children. In this new study, we wanted to explore whether parental smoking in puberty may also influence the biological ageing of their future children."

The researchers did this using a well-established measure of biological aging known as epigenetic clocks. As we age, extra molecules accumulate on the DNA in our cells. This does not alter the DNA code, but it does influence how our genes behave. These so-called epigenetic changes are not only a sign of ageing, they are also linked to diseases of older age such as cancer and dementia.

The research included a group of 892 people, ranging in chronological age from 7 to 50 years and with an average age of 28, who were taking part in the RHINESSA study and provided blood samples for testing. Their blood samples were analysed for epigenetic changes, then researchers applied three different scores of biological aging. They were also asked a series of questions, including whether they or their parents had ever smoked and at what age.

The researchers found that people whose fathers began smoking during puberty were around nine months to a year older than their chronological age on average. When researchers took into account whether the people themselves had ever smoked, this gap between biological and chronological age was greater (14 to 15 months).

In people whose fathers began smoking later in life, researchers found only a small increase in biological age. They found no clear pattern in biological ageing in people whose mothers smoked before pregnancy.

This accelerated biological ageing is important as it has been linked to a higher risk of diseases such as cancer, arthritis and dementia in previous research. Our results suggest that boys who smoke during puberty may be unknowingly creating harm for the children they go on to have."

Dr. Juan Pablo López-Cervantes, University of Bergen

"This research does not fully explain why smoking in puberty is linked to faster aging, but we think that when fathers start smoking during puberty, it may alter the epigenetic material of their sperm cells, and that these changes may be passed on to the next generation.

"Although this research is still in its early days, we believe our findings are important for young boys who smoke or consume other types of nicotine products. Stronger efforts to prevent tobacco use in adolescence should be a priority for policy makers. Such efforts could benefit not only the current generations but also those in the future."

Dr Stamatoula Tsikrika is Chair of the European Respiratory Society's expert group on tobacco, smoking control and health education, based at Sotiria Hospital in Athens, Greece, and was not involved in the research. She said: "We all know that smoking causes diseases such as asthma, COPD and cancer. What we're starting to learn is that the damage caused by smoking can persist across generations. This study suggests that boys who start smoking at 15 or younger can pass the damage on to any children they have many years later.

"Although rates of smoking in teenagers seem to be declining, rates of vaping are generally increasing, and we don't yet know the long-term impact of vaping on children and teenagers. This research is another reminder that we need to protect children and teenagers from nicotine addiction, smoking and vaping."

Real-world data confirm that nirsevimab provides powerful protection for infants, reducing RSV hospital stays and easing the strain on families and healthcare systems.



Research letter: Nirsevimab Administration and RSV Hospitalization in the 2024-2025 Season. Image Credit: Bonn_A  / Shutterstock

In a recent Research Letter published in the JAMA Network Open, a group of researchers estimated whether nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, lowers respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalization among United States (US) infants during the 2024-2025 season using an extensive electronic health record (EHR) cohort.

One virus fills winter pediatric wards: RSV is among the leading reasons infants land in the hospital, especially those born prematurely, with complex conditions, or from communities facing socioeconomic disadvantage. Public health agencies in the US recommend passive immunization of most infants with nirsevimab, but families still ask: does it truly translate to fewer hospital stays where we live? Real-world data matter because drug supply, maternal vaccination, and clinic access vary by place and season. Clinicians need precise numbers to guide counseling, and parents need confidence when choosing prevention before the first cough. Further research is required in order to examine outcomes across diverse health systems and subgroups.

The investigators performed a retrospective cohort analysis using the Epic Systems Cosmos dataset, an EHR aggregation platform that spans more than 300 million patients across over 1,700 hospitals and 40,000 clinics in all 50 states, as well as in Canada, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. The study included babies born between February 1, 2024, and January 31, 2025, ensuring at least two months of exposure to the 2024-2025 RSV season, which typically occurs from October 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. Infants aged 8 to 19 months were excluded due to data granularity issues. The exposure was receipt of nirsevimab, the primary outcome was RSV-associated hospitalization, identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) algorithms.

The analysis excluded infants with missing maternal linkage, maternal RSV vaccination 14-280 days pre-delivery, with this exclusion consistent with CDC recommendations, prior nirsevimab before April 1, 2024, RSV hospitalization before April 1, 2024, death without hospitalization, or no well-child visits after September 30, 2025, to limit loss to follow-up. Group comparisons used two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and Pearson χ² tests for categorical variables. Daily hospitalization rates were modeled with generalized additive models (GAMs). Time-to-event analyses employed multistate Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) models to transition infants from untreated to treated on the nirsevimab date, with adjustments for chronologic age, gestational age, Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and complex chronic conditions (CCC: cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic). Analyses were performed in R (R Project for Statistical Computing) version 4.5.0.

Among 798,470 eligible births, 409,723 infants met inclusion criteria after exclusions for missing maternal information (n=256,494), maternal RSV vaccination (n=75,107), death (n=472), prior nirsevimab (n=11,946), prior RSV hospitalization (n=73), and lack of well-child follow-up after September 30, 2025 (n=44,655). The median (interquartile range) age at analysis was 8 (5-10) months, and 51.1% of the participants were male. Overall, 194,422 infants (47.5%) received nirsevimab, while 215,301 did not. Baseline table comparisons revealed small but statistically significant differences in several characteristics, including a slightly younger age among treated infants and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular and neurologic complex chronic conditions in the treated group. The median gestational age was similar at 39 weeks across groups. The median SVI was 67 (IQR, 38–87), with some missing values.

Nirsevimab receipt was associated with a markedly lower crude rate of RSV-associated hospitalization. Specifically, 850 of 194,422 treated infants (0.4%) were hospitalized compared with 2,535 of 215,301 untreated infants (1.2%), P<.001. Modeled daily hospitalization rates peaked at an estimated 2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.42-3.38) per 100,000 among treated infants versus 13.84 (95% CI, 13.16-14.53) per 100,000 among untreated infants during the season.

Time-to-event analyses yielded consistent effect estimates. In unadjusted Cox PH models, the hazard ratio (HR) for RSV-associated hospitalization after nirsevimab treatment was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.26-0.32). After adjusting for chronologic age, gestational age, SVI, and CCC categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic), the HR was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.21-0.26), indicating an approximately 77% lower instantaneous risk of hospitalization following treatment. Multistate modeling that transitioned infants from untreated to treated on the administration date supported the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome.

Secondary utilization outcomes followed the same direction. Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions attributed to RSV occurred in 324 treated infants (0.2%) versus 765 untreated infants (0.4%), P<.001. Intubation was rare but less frequent among treated infants (49 vs. 90, both <0.1%, P = 0.004). The seasonal figure further illustrates the rising cumulative coverage of nirsevimab across autumn and winter, alongside consistently lower modeled hospitalization rates in the treated cohort.

The researchers noted potential biases that could attenuate the observed effectiveness, including the incomplete capture of maternal RSV vaccination status and the possible receipt of nirsevimab outside contributing health systems, which would misclassify exposure and bias the results toward the null. Restricting to infants with documented well-child care during the season aimed to reduce loss to follow-up. Overall, the large sample and consistency with prior season estimates strengthen confidence in generalizability.

In a large, multi-system EHR cohort from the 2024-2025 RSV season, nirsevimab was associated with substantially fewer RSV-related hospitalizations in US infants, with adjusted HRs near 0.23 and lower ICU use. For families, this translates to fewer frightening hospital stays and less disruption to work and caregiving. For clinicians and health systems, it supports ongoing efforts to offer nirsevimab early in the season and equitably across communities, including infants with complex chronic conditions.

A comprehensive review reveals how roselle's bioactive compounds may combat inflammation across multiple diseases, but scientists caution that rigorous human trials are still essential.



Applicability of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. Extract With Anti-Inflammatory Potential in Human Health: A Review. Image Credit: Background Photo / Shutterstock

In a recent review in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers synthesized evidence from recent studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of the e plant, focusing on its bioactive compounds and therapeutic potential.

They concluded that roselle shows anti-inflammatory potential relevant to atherosclerosis, intestinal dysfunction, and degenerative diseases, based largely on preclinical and limited clinical evidence, demonstrating promising but preliminary potential across these indications.

Gut microbes actively reshape hibiscus compounds: During digestion, intestinal bacteria transform roselle's polyphenols into smaller metabolites like hydroxyphenylpropionic acids – these newly formed molecules are likely the real drivers behind its gut health benefits.

Research on medicinal plants has gained global momentum due to their potential to provide natural therapeutic agents. Among these, Hibiscus sabdariffa L., commonly known as roselle, has been widely cultivated in tropical regions and is valued both as a delicacy and as a medicinal resource.

Roselle calyxes are rich in anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and organic acids (including hibiscus acid), contributing to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihyperlipidemic, and neuroprotective effects.

Leaves also provide proteins, minerals, vitamins, and polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol, that support antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.

These compounds act through multiple mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a key mediator of inflammation. Growing evidence associates roselle with benefits for conditions ranging from cardiovascular health to neurodegenerative diseases, but its mechanisms remain complex and multifaceted.

To better understand these therapeutic properties, researchers compiled research from 2019 to 2024. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 articles were retrieved, forming the basis for analysis of roselle's anti-inflammatory and broader health-promoting activities.

Most of the evidence summarized is preclinical, with a small number of human studies; therefore, efficacy claims should be considered preliminary.

The calyx offers more than vibrant color: While leaves provide useful nutrients, the deep red calyxes are the powerhouse for anthocyanins like delphinidin-3-glucoside, directly linked to fighting vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis models.

Across the reviewed studies, roselle demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Protocatechuic acid, a key bioactive compound, has been shown to protect against septic lung injury in mice by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, suggesting its potential in preclinical sepsis models.

Other studies highlighted the role of hibiscus in modulating gut health, as supplementation in mice increased butyrate synthesis, reduced inflammatory cells, and prevented the formation of aberrant crypt foci, indicating its potential to counter intestinal inflammation and early precancerous changes. The gut microbiota have been shown to biotransform roselle compounds into active metabolites, thereby further enhancing these protective effects.

Roselle extracts also influenced metabolic health. In obese rats, hibiscus calyx extract suppressed fat cell formation by downregulating adipogenic genes, helping prevent obesity-related insulin resistance in rodent models.

Similar protective effects were reported in studies exploring hibiscus-based nutraceutical blends, which enhanced antioxidant defenses and improved nutrient quality. For instance, turmeric-fortified hibiscus drinks provided higher iron, zinc, and vitamin C content, as well as enhanced antioxidant capacity, thereby strengthening both their nutritional and antioxidant potential.

Research further supported hibiscus's role in combating oxidative stress in skin cells, where hibiscus acid reduced cellular aging markers in skin cell assays. Additionally, delphinidin-3-glucoside from hibiscus calyxes has been shown to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation in rabbit models of atherosclerosis, providing experimental support for its cardiovascular protective effects.

Wound healing needed the right recipe: The study testing roselle on wounds used a gel containing 15% leaf extract – this specific concentration hinted at possible benefits, even though the overall results weren't statistically clear-cut.

Several studies emphasized roselle's neuroprotective and anticancer properties. Preparations combining hibiscus with olive leaf extract protected brain cells from oxidative stress, suggesting potential applications in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, hibiscus administration improved memory and reduced neuroinflammation and amyloid plaque buildup, supporting its potential as a plant-based neuroprotective agent in experimental contexts.

Anticancer effects were also reported in both breast and oral cancer models. Hibiscus extracts inhibited proliferation and triggered apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines, with evidence suggesting estrogen receptor pathways played a role.

Gossypetin, another hibiscus compound, has been shown to suppress tumor growth in oral squamous cell carcinoma by blocking migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression, while inducing apoptosis.

On the other hand, the evidence for hibiscus in wound healing was less conclusive. Although roselle leaf extract gel (15% concentration) showed some potential at higher concentrations, no statistically significant differences were found in healing outcomes compared with controls, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

Combining plants boosted brain protection: Research found a preparation mixing hibiscus flower extracts with olive leaf extracts offered significant defense for brain cells against oxidative damage, suggesting potential for blended natural therapies.

Research on roselle highlights its therapeutic potential, largely attributed to its rich content of organic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and other polyphenols, which possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.

Clinical and experimental evidence shows that hibiscus extracts can reduce inflammatory markers (such as TNF-α and hs-CRP), protect against oxidative stress, and improve metabolic outcomes. Key compounds, including protocatechuic acid and delphinidin-3-glucoside, have been shown to have protective roles in conditions such as septic lung injury, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration.

Additional benefits were observed in oncology research, where hibiscus-derived compounds inhibited tumor growth, and in gastrointestinal studies, where extracts improved gut health by enhancing butyrate production and modulating microbiota-derived metabolites.

The review's strengths lie in its synthesis of recent evidence across diverse health domains, reinforcing hibiscus's broad pharmacological relevance. However, limitations include the small number of high-quality clinical studies, reliance on preclinical models, and gaps in specific areas such as wound healing, where evidence remains inconclusive.

In conclusion, roselle exhibits strong anti-inflammatory and disease-modulating potential; however, further well-designed randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm its effectiveness, refine dosages, and explore under-researched therapeutic applications.

The U.S. Women's National Team player pool had some big moments from the NWSL to abroad. 

Stateside, Trinity Rodman and the Washington Spirit clinched a playoff berth. Meanwhile, overseas Korbin Shrader came up huge for her new club OL Lyonnes against her old squad PSG. 

Let's rewind through the biggest USWNT moments over the last week:

The Washington Spirit became the second team in the NWSL to clinch a playoff spot in a 4-0 victory over the Houston Dash. Trinity Rodman contributed two assists to Gift Monday's hat trick. 

The Kansas City Current was the first squad to punch a postseason ticket, having already claimed the NWSL Shield with the best overall record. The Spirit ranks second, 16 points behind the Current and four points above the third-ranked Gotham FC. The Spirit made it to the title game in 2024 but fell to the Orlando Pride. 

Korbin Shrader shined in OL Lyonnes 6-1 win over PSG. Shader recorded a hat trick along with an assist to fellow USWNT player Lindsey Heaps. Heaps got on the scoreboard in the 58th minute with a header off a curling pass from Shrader. 

Then, Shrader scored three goals in 15 minutes in the 70th, 74th and 85th minutes. It marked the first hat trick of the 21-year-old's career. Shrader transferred from PSG in the summer, and in her second match and first start with her new club, she came up big. 

Two USWNT talents created magic in Gotham FC's 3-0 victory over the Portland Thorns. Rose Lavelle scored in the 43rd minute. It was her third goal of the season after she returned from injury in late June. USWNT midfielder Jaedyn Shaw flipped a one-touch pass to a Lavelle cutting up field, and the Cincinnati native netted a left-footed shot past the Thorns goalkeeper's outstretched reach.

The World Cup champion Lavelle and the young talent Shaw became NWSL teammates when Shaw transferred from the North Carolina Courage earlier this month. In four matches, Shaw has contributed a goal and an assist. Now, the two stars continue to gear up for a playoff run as Gotham holds onto the No. 3 spot in the league. 

Alyssa Thompson transferred to Chelsea FC in the Women's Super League from Angel City FC earlier this month. After recovering from an arm injury, the winger made her debut off the bench on Sept. 14. Thompson made her first start in the 4-0 win over West Ham on Sunday. She played 60 minutes after two 45-minute appearances as a substitute.

It was another standout week for U.S. Men's National Team players on their club sides. 

From Christian Pulisic staying red hot with a goal and assist to keep AC Milan near the top of Serie A to Alex Zendejas powering Club América with three goals in two matches in Liga MX, the USMNT player pool continued to deliver strong performances across the globe. 

Let's take a closer look at the top USMNT highlights from the week:

The USMNT's leading scorer amongst active players, Christian Pulisic has been on a brilliant scoring streak for his club AC Milan. Pulisic has recorded six goals — two of which he scored in Coppa Italia — and two assists in seven total appearances early this season across all competitions. He leads Serie A in goal contributions with six. 

Most recently in the 2-1 win over Napoli, Pulisic racked up a goal and an assist. First, he assisted Alexis Saelemaekers in the third minute of the match after creating space with a great run to get past a defender. He escaped a tackle before finding Saelemaekers in stride on the right side. His score came in the 31st minute with a strike off a short pass from teammate Youssouf Fofana. 

Since returning from USMNT September camp, Alex Zendejas has put up productive performances for Club América. He has scored four goals, three of which he netted in the last week. Zendejas bagged a brace Sunday in a 4-1 victory over Pumas and recorded another a few days prior on Sept. 25 in the Liga MX Apertura Round 10 when he scored the game-winning goal in the 89th minute. 

Zendejas recorded the two goals Sunday in a 10-minute span, scoring the first goal in the 73rd minute with a high-arching golazo from the top of the box far above legendary Pumas goalkeeper Keylor Navas' reach. He capped off the brace with a penalty kick from the spot. Overall, this season he's tallied six goals and three assists in 19 matches across all competitions.

Tanner Tessmann netted his first goal of the early Ligue 1 season last week with Lyon, and he followed it up by scoring another in the Europa League in a 1-0 win against the Eredivisie side, FC Utrecht.

Tessmann launched a right-footed shot from outside the box in the 75th minute to call the game. Teammate Rachid Ghezzal kept alive a loose cross and teed up Tessmann with the short pass, which he slammed home. It marked Tessmann's tenth goal in the UEFA competition.

Alex Freeman delivered in a dramatic 1-1 finish in the Orlando City vs. FC Cincinnati matchup on Sunday Night Soccer. With Orlando down a goal past the 90-minute mark, the referees added seven minutes of stoppage time on the clock. It was just enough time for Freeman, who headed home a score off a cross from teammate Tyrese Spicer in the 90+6th minute.

The goal marked Freeman's sixth of the MLS season, underscoring a breakout campaign where the defender also added five assists and was selected for his first MLS All-Star game. Freeman earned his side a valuable point against No. 2-ranked Cincinnati as City clinched a playoff spot.

The complaint, filed by current president Joan Laporta, accuses Bartomeu's board of disloyal administration, misappropriation, and accounting fraud potentially deepening the shadow over his tenure.

The United States Men's U-20 National Team have arrived in Chile for the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup, and they arrive with expectations to try and make a breakthrough. In the past 4 U-20 World Cups, the United States has advanced to the quarterfinals, but that has been where their road ends. This time around, they hope to take the next step and get to the semifinals, where they would have a chance to get to the final game.

They are in Group E alongside New Caledonia, France, and South Africa, and they begin the group stage tonight against New Caledonia. The United States will not take the team from Oceania for granted, but they also want to start out on the right foot and put some points on the board. They have some good players on the roster and head coach Marko Mitrović will have to utilize that talent to get them going. It's a nice look at the future as the United States gets their U-20 World Cup started.

Ban would take in Nations League and Europa League

World Cup, co-hosted in 2026 by US, is a Fifa competition

Uefa is expected to avoid trying to block Israel from World Cup qualifying as the European governing body considers measures against the country's football association.

Under plans being worked out by Uefa that are expected to be voted on by its executive committee (exco) this week, the Guardian understands Israel would be banned only from competitions that Uefa directly controls. That means the Israel men's and women's national teams would be excluded from the Nations League and Maccabi Tel Aviv would be removed from the Europa League this season.

The World Cup, however, is a Fifa competition, for which Uefa organises the qualifying format and fixtures within Europe. This is done “in collaboration” with Fifa but only subject to the global governing body's approval. Acting unilaterally to remove Israel would be a politically complicated decision, and one that appears to have been avoided. In the absence of a wider ban, however, Uefa would be in the unusual position of staging World Cup qualifiers for a country otherwise excluded.

If Israel were blocked from Uefa's competitions, the spotlight would spring back to Fifa. Last week a US state department spokesperson warned that it would “absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup”. Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, has formed a close relationship with Donald Trump in the buildup to the World Cup next year, which the US is co-hosting.

Norway and Italy are due to face Israel in qualifying during the upcoming international break, which begins next Monday. Amnesty International in Norway last weekend called on the national football association to increase its pressure on Uefa, and a 24 hour general strike was held in Italy last week in protest at the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.

Asked last week about the prospect of Italy boycotting their fixture, Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said it “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. Israel are third in their qualifying group, level on points with second-placed Italy, having played a game more, with the runners-up granted a place in the World Cup playoffs.

Gravina's point was echoed by Norway's FA president, Lise Klaveness, who feels Israel should be banned. “I work on the issue from a principled standpoint, but we will not boycott on our own,” Klaveness, a Uefa exco member, said on the Norwegian podcast Pop and Politics. “A boycott would only result in Israel going to the World Cup instead of us. In general, we are now working for Israel to be sanctioned.”

Norway are believed to be among the nations calling on Uefa to convene an extraordinary meeting of its exco this week to take a decision on the matter. It is understood the growing impetus behind a resolution is in part being driven by the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin. Any meeting is expected be held remotely and could be convened at short notice.

Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote. Insiders suggest that if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with very few members of Uefa's 19-strong exco expected to object.

Uefa, even if it imposed a ban, would continue to be responsible for organising Israel's World Cup qualifiers, including providing match officials, security and other staff for their “home” games in Hungary.

Maccabi Tel Aviv are due to play Dinamo Zagreb in their second Europa League tie on Thursday, and that game is expected to go ahead. It could, though, be Maccabi's final involvement in the competition. A replacement team would be sought, with the most likely possibility being Dynamo Kyiv, who lost in qualifying against Maccabi, though that would have a knock-on effect on the Conference League.

Uefa declined to comment. Fifa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Verizon wants to help you score tickets to the FIFA World Cup.

Demand is expected to be high for the soccer competition to be held in the United States, Mexico and Canada – more than 4.5 million people have already signed up through the FIFA World Cup Visa Presale Draw. The 2026 World Cup begins in Mexico City on June 11 and ends at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 19.

Some lucky Verizon customers have the chance to win freebies because the telecom giant is giving away "thousands of free tickets to the games" starting Thursday, Oct. 2, the company announced in a news release on Monday, Sept. 29.

The tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis in the My Verizon app in the Verizon Access section, where the cellular and broadband provider gives away tickets to concerts and other events – and has even handed out NFL tickets in the past. One note: you must be a Verizon customer.

"Our customers are very passionate about soccer and we're passionate about giving our customers the most incredible access to the things they love," Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland told USA TODAY.

Coming in November: A sweepstakes giving hundreds of customers the chance to win "Golden Tickets" granting them on-field pitchside viewing access during the tournament. "So there are about 200 people who get (Golden Tickets with) free tickets to the match ... (and) we bring them down to the pitch to watch part of the game," Berland said.

Winners will also get to experience meet and greet sessions with stars such as David Beckham, former USMNT goalkeeper and NBC Sports analyst Tim Howard, current USWNT players (and sisters) Alyssa and Gisele Thompson (Alyssa plays for Chelsea in the Women's Super League; Gisele for Angel City FC of the NWSL), Hirving "Chucky" Lozano (San Diego FC), and former Argentine and Manchester City star Sergio "Kun" Agüero.

“For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that's on or off the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament," said Beckham in the news release. The soccer legend will be featured in Verizon's World Cup marketing campaign proclaiming that "no one gets you closer" to the action than Verizon. 

Verizon customers will want to begin checking the Verizon myAccess section of the My Verizon app starting Thursday, Oct. 2, at 9 a.m. ET. Between now and the tournament, additional free World Cup ticket drops will announced in the app and at Verizon.com/Access and on Verizon's social handles, the company says. Hint: follow the company's accounts on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X and Facebook.

More information about the Golden Tickets giveaway will be forthcoming, but chances to win will come through social media, retail and other mediums, according to Berland.

One note: you must be a Verizon customer.

"Our customers are very passionate about soccer and we're passionate about giving our customers the most incredible access to the things they love," Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland told USA TODAY.

Coming in November: A sweepstakes giving hundreds of customers the chance to win "Golden Tickets" granting them on-field pitchside viewing access during the tournament. "So there are about 200 people who get (Golden Tickets with) free tickets to the match ... (and) we bring them down to the pitch to watch part of the game," Berland said.

Winners will also get to experience meet and greet sessions with stars such as David Beckham, former USMNT goalkeeper and NBC Sports analyst Tim Howard, current USWNT players (and sisters) Alyssa and Gisele Thompson (Alyssa plays for Chelsea in the Women's Super League; Gisele for Angel City FC of the NWSL), Hirving "Chucky" Lozano (San Diego FC), and former Argentine and Manchester City star Sergio "Kun" Agüero.

“For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that's on or off the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament," said Beckham in the news release. The soccer legend will be featured in Verizon's World Cup marketing campaign proclaiming that "no one gets you closer" to the action than Verizon. 

Verizon customers will want to begin checking the Verizon myAccess section of the My Verizon app starting Thursday, Oct. 2, at 9 a.m. ET. Between now and the tournament, additional free World Cup ticket drops will announced in the app and at Verizon.com/Access and on Verizon's social handles, the company says. Hint: follow the company's accounts on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X and Facebook.

More information about the Golden Tickets giveaway will be forthcoming, but chances to win will come through social media, retail and other mediums, according to Berland.

Winning the Champions League secures a place among Europe's elite. But reaching the summit of the World Cup requires a different kind of genius, one that balances tactics, character, and the weight of national expectation.

Only a select group of coaches have managed to lift both trophies. Their journeys reveal contrasting challenges—navigating club soccer's marathon of matches and thriving in the short, high-stakes burst of a global tournament.

From legendary tacticians to unexpected innovators, these managers bridged two demanding worlds. Their success offers a rare glimpse into how adaptability and vision can shape the most enduring legacies.

Only two managers in history have achieved the spectacular feat of winning both the UEFA Champions League (or the European Cup) at the club level and the FIFA World Cup with a national team. These two legendary figures are the Italian Marcello Lippi and the Spaniard Vicente del Bosque.

Marcello Lippi was the first manager to complete this prestigious double, accomplishing the wins a decade apart. His European triumph came during a dominant period for Italian soccer in the mid-1990s. He led Juventus to victory in the 1996 Champions League final, defeating Ajax in a penalty shootout in Rome. 

His Juventus team was a powerhouse, though he also suffered three subsequent consecutive final defeats (1997, 1998, 2003). His greatest moment, however, arrived when he took charge of the national team. 

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, he guided the Italy national team through a tournament defined by resilience and unity, culminating in a dramatic final victory over France, again decided by penalties. This victory secured his place as a national hero and the first coach to claim both major trophies.

Vicente del Bosque joined Lippi in this exclusive club four years later, achieving a remarkable run of success for both club and country. His initial European glory came during his tenure at Real Madrid at the beginning of the Galácticos era. 

He won the Champions League twice with the club, first in 2000 against Valencia and again in 2002 against Bayer Leverkusen, a final famously decided by Zinedine Zidane's spectacular volley. 

His second major title came when he managed the Spain national team. Inheriting a talented squad from Luis Aragones, he led Spain to victory in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, defeating the Netherlands in the final. 

This win cemented Spain's “Golden Generation” and helped him achieve a unique status: he is currently the only coach in history to have won the World Cup, the European Championship (2012), the Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup/Club World Cup.

The fact that only two men have successfully managed to win both the Champions League and the World Cup highlights the extreme difficulty of mastering two fundamentally different managerial disciplines in soccer.

This exclusivity stems from the inherent contradiction between the demands of the club game and the international tournament format. The Champions League demands a manager to be a master long-term project leader. 

Success requires sustained high performance across a grueling nine-month schedule, the ability to command a squad built from players across the globe, and the constant tactical evolution needed to outsmart the world's richest and best-organized club teams. 

A club coach has continuous access to his players, facilitating the implementation of complex systems, but must also manage massive transfer budgets and player turnover. Lippi's success with Juventus and Del Bosque's wins with Real Madrid were achieved through multi-year projects of dominance.

The FIFA World Cup, conversely, requires a manager to be a brilliant short-term specialist and motivational leader. The competition is a ruthless, single-elimination sprint over four weeks. 

The coach has minimal preparation time—gathering players who spend most of the year as rivals—and must simplify tactics for immediate effectiveness. There is no transfer market to fix weaknesses, and one bad match is often terminal.

The challenge here is less about sustained technical complexity and more about generating intense emotional unity and momentum. Del Bosque excelled at this, stepping in to manage the existing talent and philosophy of the Spanish team's “Golden Generation” to win in 2010.

Furthermore, the opportunity itself is incredibly scarce. To win the UCL, a coach needs to be at one of a dozen mega-rich European clubs, a job that is annual. To win the World Cup, a coach must be appointed to one of the eight nations historically capable of lifting the trophy—a job that only comes around every four years. 

Lippi (Italy) and Del Bosque (Spain) had the perfect, yet highly rare, career trajectory: they achieved continental club dominance, which then earned them the opportunity to lead their respective elite national teams at precisely the moment a world-class generation of players peaked. This convergence of elite timing, tactical duality and managerial stature is why the list of winners remains so short.

GOAL reviews the major takeaways from Americans playing in Europe, including Pulisic's continued dominance

There's no slowing Christian Pulisic right now, and we're running out of superlatives for the American star. Simply put, he's a man in form.

Pulisic was once again the headliner in this weekend's slate of Americans Abroad, as the AC Milan star added a goal and an assist to his recent tally. With that, he's up to four goals and two assists in just four Serie A matches. Make no mistake about it: the U.S. men's national team star has been the league's best player to start this 2025-26 season.

He wasn't the only one with an assist this weekend, which turned out to be a fairly productive one for the USMNT stars in Europe. Gladbach's Joe Scally put on a show in the weekend's most chaotic game. Patrick Agyemang added another helper to his tally, too. And then there was Brenden Aaronson, who set up a goal, too, to silence some of the critics over in Leeds.

With USMNT camp looming, several Americans stepped up as the European season really gets into full swing heading into October.

GOAL looks at the major takeaways from this weekend's Americans Abroad.

Many supporters of the U.S. Men's National Team would like nothing more than to place Christian Pulisic in bubble wrap until June 12, 2026.

That's when the Americans will kick off their latest World Cup adventure, against an opponent to be determined in Los Angeles, at the tournament's draw in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5.

Of course, keeping Pulisic in bubble wrap can't and won't happen.

Until then, the 27-year-old forward needs to excel for club and country, fill the net with goals, hone his talent and write another chapter in his incredible career.

Which he certainly has done for A.C. Milan, lately.

Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you should know Pulisic has started the Serie A season red hot, hot, hot.

Since the Italian Serie A season kicked off last month, the Hershey, Pa. native has scored six goals and added two assists across seven matches.

Heck, he also has recorded four goals and two assists in three appearances over nine days.

It started with two goals and an assist in a virtuoso performance in a 3-0 away victory over Udinese on Sept. 20 and was given a 10-for-10 rating by Soccerway.com. He followed that up with a goal against Lecce in another 3-0 home win in a Coppa Italia encounter on Sept. 23.

And then came Sunday, Sept. 28, when the 5-foot-10, 161-lb. Pulisic tallied a goal and an assist in Milan's 2-1 home triumph over Napoli.

Milan (4-1-0, 12 points) won its fourth successive Serie A match, taking over first place via goal differential past the defending champions (4-1-0, 12), plus six to plus five, respectively.

“We feel incredible, honestly, just the spirit of the team, and the way we fought also after the red card, we really gave everything, and it's a special feeling now for us,” Pulisic said on CBS SportsGolazo.

“It sends a message for sure. We're a good team, we're a strong team, we can score goals, but we can also defend like this, and we have a good spirit. I think it shows a lot for sure.”

In fact, he has taken over the early Golden Boot lead with his four goals. Four players are tied for second place with three apiece - Nico Paz (Como), Riccardo Orsolini (Bologna), Kevin De Bruyne (Napoli) and Marcus Thuram (Inter).

Yes, it's early, but still, not too shabby for any player, let alone an American.

There is no argument that Pulisic is a generational player.

Let's put it into perspective.

In life, a generation usually is measured by 20 or 25 years.

In soccer, it is more like seven to 12 years because international careers don't always last longer than that.

For example, Landon Donovan (2002-2014) and Clint Dempsey (2004-2017) were attacking dynamos during their prime years. Having two lethal offensive weapons on the same pitch made the Americans a lethal and respected force in the world.

They lead all USMNT players with 57 goals apiece. Pulisic is fifth with 31, behind Jozy Altidore (42) and Eric Wynalda (34). Donovan also is the all-time assist leader (58) With a couple of stellar performance, Pulisic could tie or even pass Wynalda, assuming he is called in for the USA's next two friendlies, against Ecuador in Austin, Texas (Oct. 10) and Australia in Commerce City, Colo (Oct. 14). There are also friendlies scheduled against Paraguay in Chester, Pa. (Nov. 15) and Uruguay in Tampa, Fla. (Nov. 18).

Speaking of prime years, Pulisic is in his prime at the age of 27. According to statistics, most strikers and attacking midfielders excel between the ages of 25 and 30. The average age of a World Cup scoring champion is a little more than 25. Of course, there are exceptions.

This is his time.

If the USMNT is to be successful at next year's World Cup, the Americans will need superior performances by several players. At the top of the list is one Christian Pulisic.

Of course, in a competition such as the World Cup, no team can be a one-man show, except for such super-talented players as Pele, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.

These players showed that they can bend steel with their bare feet.

Pulisic isn't in their class, but few Americans should be complaining. There is no one else on the team in his class.

Never have the USMNT players been put under the microscope prior to a World Cup, because this competition is at home, co-host by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Soccer officials in this country - U.S. Soccer, Major League Soccer, and even the lower divisions - hope that the USMNT will impress and go deep in the tournament and boost the sport's influence in this country. Failing to get out of the group stage would be embarrassing; South Africa (2010) is the only country to pull off that rare, abysmal feat. A Round of 32 appearance is a must; a quarterfinal match would be acceptable.

As for Pulisic not playing during the summer friendlies and Concacaf Gold Cup and the kerfuffle that started in a he-said, he-said situation with U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino, and a soap opera ensued in which former USMNT stars voiced their opinion, should be in the past.

This is a time to look ahead and enjoy what feats Christian Pulisic can perform with his feet (and sometimes with his head) for club and country.

Let's face it, Pulisic has become an indispensable player not on just one team, but two.

If he keeps a decent pace and remains healthy, U.S. soccer supporters could be in line for a memorable time come next summer.

The U. S. Men's National Team is just one week away from regrouping for a crucial series of international friendlies against Ecuador in Austin, Texas (Oct. 10) and against Australia in Commerce City, Colo. (Oct. 14). It's the second-to-last USMNT camp of 2025, and one in which coach Mauricio Pochettino will aim to stop experimenting and start narrowing down his roster for next summer's World Cup jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Many Americans are performing well for their club teams around the world, but four stand out:

It's been a wild few weeks for Pulisic in Italy. The attacker followed up a two-goal performance against Udinese with a stellar showing Sunday against league leader (and defending champion) Napoli. Pulisic assisted Alexis Saelemaekers' goal in the third minute before scoring a banger of his own in the 31st. Those two goals were the difference: Milan wound up beating Napoli 2-1 and leapfrogged it to take the top spot in the Serie A table.

"It sends a message for sure,” Pulisic said of his team's performance, per CBS Sports Golazo America.

It does — but Pulisic's individual performance is sending a message, too. With four goals and two assists just five games into the Serie A season, he's one of the most in-form players in the world.

Juarez-born dual national Zendejas spent much of 2025 outside the USMNT looking in, but his nigh-unbelievable form with Club América in Mexico has brought him back into the fold for good. In a 4-1 win over Pumas UNAM on Saturday, he scored twice as América won the hotly contested Clasico Capitalino. His first goal was an audacious chip; his second, a thumping, decisive penalty.

Zendejas may not have the global appeal of Pulisic, the World Cup experience of Brenden Aaronson or the domestic pull of Diego Luna, but he's quietly become one of the USMNT's more fascinating wide attacking options — and he's done so at precisely the right moment. He's worth keeping an eye on as the Liga MX season develops.

Crystal Palace versus Liverpool was the headlining fixture of this Premier League weekend, and for good reason: Both teams entered the Saturday match unbeaten with plenty to prove. While many expected defending champion Liverpool to win, it was Palace that prevailed 2-1 thanks to an Eddie Nketiah goal on the last kick of the game.

Much has been written about Palace's brilliant offense, and rightfully so; Nketiah, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Adam Wharton, Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino are fantastic (and underrated) Premier League attackers. But Palace's defense, anchored by USMNT regular Richards, is arguably even more impressive. It's a three-man system that looks awfully similar to the one the USMNT experimented with successfully against Japan, and Richards looks fabulous within it.

21-year-old USMNT prospect Alex Freeman is the highest-scoring defender in Major League Soccer.

Freeman scored arguably the most impressive goal of his 2025 campaign Sunday against FC Cincinnati. With just two minutes left and Cincinnati up 1-0 in the crucial Eastern Conference clash, Freeman found himself some space in the penalty box and headed in a gorgeous Tyrese Spicer cross to level the score. The 1-1 tie all but ended Cincinnati's hopes of winning the 2025 Supporters' Shield and lifted Orlando to seventh in the Eastern Conference standings.

Verizon Ultimate Access may be your ticket to the World Cup


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The FIFA World Cup is the biggest sporting event in the world, and while the first games won't kick off until next year, Verizon is already getting ready to hype up the tournament. How, you might ask? By giving customers free tickets to the games, as part of what it's calling Verizon Ultimate Access.

The 2026 World Cup will take place all across Canada, Mexico and the United States, with Verizon being one of the key sponsors. So North American soccer fans will be able to experience the action on their home turf — and perhaps even without the pain of trying to purchase the tickets for themselves.

Naturally, the carrier has signed on soccer legend David Beckham to help promote all this free stuff.

Thousands of free tickets will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis in the My Verizon app via the Verizon Access rewards program. The first ticket drop starts this Thursday (October 2) at 9.00 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT.

New tickets will be dropped hourly, with the final one taking place at 7 p.m. ET / 4 p.m. PT. Following this, Verizon will have daily ticket drops at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT from October 3 to 13. All those games are scheduled for June 13-16, and will take place in locations across the U.S.

 




November will also see the launch of new sweepstakes, giving customers the chance to win hundreds of "Golden Tickets" that come with pitchside access. Plus, there will be additional giveaways at various points leading up to the tournament, which officially starts in Mexico City on June 11.

Various all-star players will also be on the road with Verizon in the run-up to the World Cup, offering meet-and-greets and surprise events along the way. Those players include Tim Howard, Alyssa and Giselle Thompson, Chucky Lozano and Sergio (Kun) Agüero.

Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.

So long as you're a Verizon customer, you can sign up for Verizon Access and be in with the chance to get those tickets for yourself. Membership also makes you eligible for all the other giveaways that happen throughout the year.

If you're not a member of Version Access, joining up is simple. Either head to the My Verizon website, then click Account > More > myAccess. Alternatively, from the My Verizon app, head to the Me tab > myAccess. Then be sure to keep an eye on the myAccess area for the next big giveaway.

Lassana Diarra changed the rules on contract termination. The European Court of Justice's landmark judgement presents players with more clarity and protection if they are thinking about terminating their contracts.

Italian international goalkeeper Katja Schroffenegger signed for Como in 2024 but spent the best part of her first season recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. During this period, she suffered a lung collapse, a condition that can be fatal if left untreated. The 34-year-old is back playing and wants to highlight the importance of talking about less common injuries in football.

On 15 December 2025, FIFPRO will celebrate its 60th anniversary – six decades of supporting footballers worldwide. To honour this milestone, FIFPRO is planning a year of campaigns, content, and initiatives to commemorate previous achievements and push the global player union forward into the next 60 years.

Players which competed in the FIFA Club World Cup after their domestic league season are among hundreds at the top of men's football who lack adequate offseason or preseason periods, increasing risks to player health and performance, according to the annual FIFPRO Player Workload Monitoring Report published in collaboration with Football Benchmark.

Maheta Molango, FIFPRO board member, said: "This report gives you the factual evidence of what is happening in football. Players are either getting injured or not being able to perform at their best because they are pushed to their limit."

Chelsea, the FIFA Club World Cup winners, and runners-up Paris Saint-Germain were the hardest hit by the calendar crunch: after having their holiday period reduced to barely three weeks, Chelsea players had just 13 days for preseason, while PSG players got only seven days.

These findings underscore the urgent need for common-sense player safeguards like those in a recently-published Consensus Study on Minimum Player Workload Safeguards, in which high-performance experts agreed players should receive 28 days offseason and a further 28 days preseason.

The 2024/25 season report, entitled 'Overworked and Underprotected: The Player Health and Performance Impact' uses data from 1,500 men's football players tracked on FIFPRO's Player Workload Monitoring platform, benchmarking their rest and recovery against recommendations from 70 medical and performance experts working for clubs and national teams. The report also looks at recovery time in other sports and, for the first time, incorporates extreme heat as a growing factor for performance, health, and competition planning. 

Many other players at the top of the game are also short on rest and recovery: only 14 percent of the 2024 UEFA European Championship participants in the sample had the recommended 28 days of offseason rest before last season, dropping to just nine percent for Copa America participants who play in Europe's top five leagues. Post-tournament preparation was equally inadequate: only 15 percent had sufficient preseason after the EURO, and just four percent after the Copa America.

Dr. Darren Burgess, chair of FIFPRO's High-Performance Advisory Network, said football should follow other sports in guaranteeing offseason breaks to protect players from injury and burnout. NBA and Australia's AFL players get 14 weeks off, while Major League Baseball players have 15 weeks.

"If you don't have enough off-season, you don't give your body enough time mentally and physically to freshen up," Dr. Burgess said. “Plus, not having 28 days as a minimum of preseason prevents players doing rigorous preparation for the season ahead. It leads at worst to injury, and at best reduced capacity to perform. In other sports, the priority has been placed on player performance and player well-being, and the offseason break is a substantial part of that."

While many players in football's pyramid lack competitive games, those at the elite level are often overburdened: the health risks for players become disproportionate to elite sports' inherent risks when they face sustained periods of two games per week, according to scientific research. The following were among players who experienced extreme fixture congestion with more than 50 games last season, many of which were with less than five days of recovery time:

Recovery time after international windows is often less than 48 hours – a smaller break than experts recommend – even for South Americans facing long-haul travel back to European and U.S. clubs. Argentina's Enzo Fernandez exemplified this burden, accumulating 195 hours of travel during 29 journeys spanning 149,010 kilometres last season.

Chris Wood, the New Zealand captain who is a member of the FIFPRO Global Player Council, said: "For us as players it's vitally important that we have the recovery period to allow the body to adapt and go again. We need to make sure that we are looking after our body in the long term. It's key we look at the minimum rest process and especially the preseason."

The consensus study identified specific workload safeguard needs for academy players under 18, with more research required for those under 21. However, evidence shows little caution: Lamine Yamal played 130 games before his 18th birthday in July, while Archie Gray, who turned 19 in March, appeared in 80 squad selections for Tottenham and England's Under-21 team last season.

Dr. Burgess emphasised that younger players need age-appropriate training loads, clear match exposure limits, and protected rest periods: "Growth plates, tendons, and ligaments remain vulnerable during these years, and excessive high-speed running or short recovery windows can lead to long-term structural damage,” he said. “The psychological toll should also not be underestimated."

South Africa have dropped from top of Group C to second in the table after fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in a qualifier in March

South Africa's hopes of qualifying for the 2026 Fifa World Cup have suffered a major blow after they were sanctioned for fielding an ineligible player.

Teboho Mokoena played in the 2-0 win over Lesotho in March despite the 28-year-old midfielder being due to serve a suspension after accumulating two yellow cards.

A Fifa disciplinary committee has ruled that South Africa breached competition rules, and has imposed a 3-0 forfeit.

The country's football association (Safa) has been fined 10,000 Swiss Francs ($12,500, £9,340), while Mokoena has been issued with a warning.

The decision has blown Group C of African World Cup qualifying wide open, with South Africa dropping from top of the table to second place, behind Benin on goal difference.

Only the group winners are assured of reaching next year's tournament in north and central America.

It also gives renewed hope to Nigeria and Rwanda of reaching the finals, with both of those sides now three points below Benin and South Africa.

Benin travel to Rwanda and Nigeria in the final two round of qualifiers between 10 and 14 October, while South Africa face an away game against Zimbabwe before hosting Rwanda.

Safa has 10 days to appeal Fifa's decision.

South Africa did have a three-point lead at the top of Group C before the decision by Fifa's disciplinary committee, but now Benin are top on goal difference - with Bafana Bafana dropping to second place as Lesotho gain three points

 Teboho Mokoena is a player of South Africa whose case caused his country this setback

South Africa's hopes of securing early control in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign has suffered a major setback after FIFA's Disciplinary Committee confirmed sanctions against the South African Football Association (SAFA) for fielding an ineligible player.

The ruling on Monday, September 29, 2025, stems from South Africa's match against Lesotho on March 21, 2025, in which midfielder Teboho Mokoena featured, despite being ineligible under FIFA regulations. FIFA ruled that the appearance breached both Article 19 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and Article 14 of the 2026 World Cup Preliminary Competition Regulations.As a consequence, FIFA has awarded the match as a 3-0 victory to Lesotho, with South Africa losing the three points they had earned on the pitch. The decision means South Africa now drops three points in Group C, tightening an already competitive qualifying race.UDS players snubbed in awards ceremony despite winning University Games In addition to the forfeiture, SAFA has been fined approximately $11,000, while Mokoena himself has been issued with a warning. 

FIFA stressed that all parties were informed of the decision and that SAFA has ten days to request a detailed, motivated judgment, which could be appealed before the FIFA Appeal Committee.For Coach Hugo Broos and his side, the ruling is a bitter blow. South Africa had been building momentum, but the deduction not only dents their points tally but also shifts the pressure onto their remaining fixtures.  FKA/AEWatch the latest episode of Sports Check with Boxer Jacob Dickson below:

ZURICH (AP) — South Africa was stripped of a win in 2026 World Cup qualifying by FIFA on Monday and lost top spot in its group for fielding an ineligible player.

FIFA's disciplinary ruling overturned a South Africa win against Lesotho in March, left Benin top with two rounds to go and gave Nigeria fresh hope of advancing to the finals tournament.

Only the group winner on Oct. 14 will advance direct to the World Cup being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. South Africa has not played at a World Cup since hosting the 2010 edition.

Ahead of decisive qualifying games resuming next week, FIFA said its disciplinary judges ordered South Africa to forfeit as a 3-0 loss what had been a 2-0 victory over Lesotho.

South Africa selected Teboho Mokoena for the game in Polokwane when the midfielder should have served a one-game ban for getting yellow cards in two previous qualifying games.

The administrative error is embarrassing for South Africa as its top soccer official, Patrice Motsepe, is a FIFA vice president as the elected leader of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Motsepe also owns the Mamelodi Sundowns club that Mokoena plays for. 

FIFA said the South African soccer federation can appeal against forfeiting the game. FIFA also fined the federation 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,500) and Mokoena was formally warned.

Without the three points, plus a negative five-goal swing in its goal difference, South Africa drops below new group leader Benin. The teams are tied on points, both three clear of Nigeria and Rwanda, but Benin's goal difference is one better than South Africa. 

South Africa completes the qualifying group against Zimbabwe on Oct. 10 and at home to Rwanda four days later. Zimbabwe's “home” game is being played in South Africa, at Durban, because it does not have a national stadium that meets CAF standards.

Mokoena was picked last week in the preliminary squad for those games by coach Hugo Broos. 

Benin plays at Rwanda on Oct. 10 and then goes to Nigeria, which aims to qualify for its seventh World Cup and first since 2018 in Russia. Nigeria also has to play Lesotho.

The runner-up in the group could advance to a four-team African playoffs bracket in November. That will decide which African team advances to the inter-continental playoffs in March at venues to be agreed in north America.

David Beckham is featured in Verizon's FIFA World Cup 26TM campaign launching today

NEW YORK, N.Y.- Verizon, the official telecommunication services sponsor for FIFA World Cup 26™, is teaming up with David Beckham and an all-star roster of talent, including Tim Howard, Alyssa and Gisele Thompson, Hirving “Chucky” Lozano, Sergio “Kun” Agüero, and more to roll out Verizon Ultimate Access to the FIFA World Cup 26TM.

“For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that's on or off the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament," said David Beckham, who is featured in Verizon's 360 marketing campaign released today. 

“The World Cup is the biggest sports event in the world and the fandom is unlike any other. We knew we wanted to deliver access and experiences to our customers that are once in a lifetime,” said Leslie Berland, Chief Marketing Officer at Verizon. “Our customers will get access throughout the World Cup - Beckham-style, with surprises, events and giveaways along the way.”

Verizon's Consumer Connections Report highlights how U.S. soccer fans are capturing their stadium experiences and sharing them with the world. Soccer fans in the U.S. used 148 terabytes of data at FIFA matches this year, the equivalent of half a million streaming hours, which would take a single fan 57 years to accomplish.

An undefeated champion at the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals will walk away with a record $5,071,000, the richest payout in the event's history.

The prestigious season finale, held from 9-16 November at the Inalpi Arena in Turin, will feature an event record $15.5 million in total prize money. 

Last year, Jannik Sinner set a new benchmark when he stormed to the title without dropping a set, collecting $4,881,100 — then the largest prize awarded at the event. Now a Nitto ATP Finals champion could break $5 million in winnings for the first time.



Each match from the semi-finals onwards will be worth more than $1 million. The semi-final victors will add $1,183,500 to their tally, while the champion of the title match will take home $2,367,000 on top of what they earned earlier in the tournament. See the full distribution below.




An undefeated doubles team will secure $959,300. See below the full doubles prize money breakdown.

Carlos Alcaraz faced perhaps the sternest examination of his debut run at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships on Monday, but he emerged with flying colours to book his spot in the final.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings overcame a resilient Casper Ruud and his own fitness concerns to secure a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory at the ATP 500 event. Alcaraz, who displayed limited movement at times during the opening set, eventually rediscovered his sharpness to set up a title showdown with former Tokyo champion Taylor Fritz.

“I had a lot of chances in the first set,” said Alcaraz. “I had four break points if I'm not wrong. It's just about details, so I just tried to be more positive than the first set. I was a little bit mad with myself, so I just tried to play with joy again, putting a lot of positive thoughts in my mind.”

With his two-hour, eight-minute victory, Alcaraz notched his personal-best 66th win in a season. On Tuesday, the 22-year-old Spaniard will seek revenge against Fritz, who defeated him at the Laver Cup last week.

“I know he's playing great tennis lately,” Alcaraz said of Fritz, who also defeated Alexander Zverev in San Francisco. “Since the Laver Cup against me, against Zverev, and here in this tournament, he's feeling great and really comfortable on the court. Everything is different since San Francisco... But it's another challenge for me and I'm looking forward to it.”

Since tweaking his left ankle in his Tokyo opener against Sebastian Baez, Alcaraz had downplayed concerns and proved it with assertive wins. Yet against Ruud, who tested him relentlessly with heavy topspin and court-stretching angles, the Spaniard's discomfort was more apparent.

Facing break point in the seventh game, Ruud attacked with a deep approach into Alcaraz's backhand corner. Though he got the ball back at his opponent's feet, Alcaraz hesitated when stretching for that ball and chasing the ensuing drop volley — a moment of vulnerability that underscored his struggles in the first set.

Watch Alcaraz struggle to deal with Ruud on break point:

Alcaraz's aggressive, risk-heavy tactics in the first set yielded 15 unforced errors, but he recalibrated in the second, finding consistency on serve: He dropped just four of 24 points behind his delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to overwhelm Ruud and level the match.

From there, Alcaraz carried that momentum into the deciding set, where he showcased his freedom of movement and fearless shotmaking, silencing any injury doubts. To overcome Fritz in the final, however, the Spaniard will need another commanding serving performance against one of the Tour's most formidable servers.

Despite defeat, Ruud has risen two spots to 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin as the former finalist seeks to return to the Nitto ATP Finals.



Earlier on Monday, Fritz powered his way into the final by serving his way past countryman Jenson Brooksby 6-4, 6-3. Though outplayed at times from the baseline, Fritz compensated for 13 aces to secure his first hard-court final of 2025 and climb to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

“Honestly, just by botting,” Fritz said when asked how he was able to triumph. “I served insanely well: High percentage first serves and spots too. It felt like any game that I didn't hit three aces, he was really outplaying me from the baseline. I was able to hang in on my serve, and then capitalise on that scoreboard pressure. My serve got me through it.”

Lewis Hamilton has withdrawn from a Pirelli tyre test after his beloved dog, Roscoe, was taken ill.

Lewis Hamilton has shared an update with fans on the health of his much-loved dog, Roscoe, after withdrawing from a Pirelli tyre test due to the bulldog being admitted to hospital.

Hamilton had been set to participate in Pirelli's testing of 2026 tyres at the Mugello Circuit in Italy on Friday, but the seven-time World Champion was replaced by Ferrari reserve driver Zhou Guanyu.

In a social media post, Hamilton told his followers that Roscoe was in a coma after being treated for pneumonia.

“Please keep Roscoe in your thoughts. I want to keep you all updated,” Hamilton wrote on Friday.

“Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped.

“They managed to get a heartbeat back and now he's in a coma. We don't know whether he will wake from this. Tomorrow we'll try to wake him up. I'm by his side and want to thank you all for your prayers and support.”

Hamilton's post was met with well wishes from his followers, including former team mate George Russell who wrote: “Thinking of you mate.”

Roscoe – who has his own Instagram account followed by 1.3 million fans – has been a regular fixture by Hamilton's side since 2013, with the Briton's beloved dog joining him at many Grands Prix over the years.

How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts?

Iconic Alain Prost onboards

Lewis Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, has passed away, a few days after being admitted to hospital due to serious illness.

Lewis Hamilton has announced the passing of his dog, Roscoe, following a health battle.

Roscoe was recently admitted to hospital and placed in a coma after being treated for pneumonia, with Hamilton missing a Pirelli tyre test last week to be by his side.

On Monday, Hamilton took to social media to share an emotional post confirming that Roscoe had died in his arms on Sunday evening.

It comes five years after another of Hamilton's dogs, Coco, passed away.

“After four days on life support, fighting with every bit of strength he had, I had to make the hardest decision of my life and say goodbye to Roscoe,” wrote Hamilton. “He never stopped fighting, right until the very end.

“I feel so grateful and honoured to have shared my life with such a beautiful soul, an angel and true friend. Bringing Roscoe into my life was the best decision I ever made, and I will forever cherish the memories we created together.

“Although I lost Coco, I have never been faced with putting a dog to sleep before, though I know my mum and many close friends have. It is one of the most painful experiences and I feel a deep connection to everyone who has gone through the loss of a beloved pet.

“Although it was so hard, having him was one of the most beautiful parts of life, to love so deeply and to be loved in return.

“Thank you all for the love and support you've shown Roscoe over the years. It has been so special to witness and feel.”

How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts?

Iconic Alain Prost onboards

Max Verstappen kept himself busy between the Azerbaijan and Singapore Grands Prix with a successful GT3 race weekend at the Nurburgring.

Max Verstappen added another note to his impressive motorsport CV by winning on his GT3 race debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife last weekend, as the Dutchman continues to explore endurance competition.

Alongside team mate Chris Lulham, who usually contests the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup for Verstappen.com Racing, the four-time F1 World Champion stormed to victory in the ninth round of the NLS (Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie).

Verstappen and Lulham took on the four-hour race in a Verstappen.com and Red Bull-liveried Ferrari 296 GT3, which was run by Swiss team Emil Frey Racing – the pair coming out on top in a field of 110 cars, of which 10 participated in the fastest category (SP9).

“It was great!” Verstappen beamed, after qualifying third and seizing the lead at the start of the race. “During my first two stints, the car was amazing.

“After Qualifying, I knew the car would be good on a dry track. Everything went well in terms of traffic, and we didn't make any big mistakes. To win my debut race here is amazing.”

As for what might come next in his growing endurance career, Verstappen added: “Of course, we really want to race the 24-hour race, here at the Nordschleife. If that's going to be next year, I don't know yet.

“We need more experience, so hopefully we can enter a few more NLS races next year.”

Verstappen will return to F1 duties at the upcoming Singapore Grand Prix, with the Red Bull racer aiming to further cut the gap to McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the Drivers' Championship standings.

A spokesperson for the White House attempted to refute Grande's reshared claims in a statement.

	After Ariana Grande slammed Donald Trump's administration on her Instagram Stories Sunday (Sept. 29), a spokesperson for the president fired back at the Grammy-winning singer. 


	In a statement provided to TMZ, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai responded to Grande's post, attempting to refute the points she shared about the Trump administration's actions during the president's second term.

	











	“Save your tears, Ariana, because President Trump's actions ended Joe Biden's inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investments,” Desai claimed. “He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande's concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!” 


	While Desai claims that the president “ended” the inflation crisis, a report earlier this month from the U.S.  Department of Labor showed that inflation increased to 2.9% in August, marking the biggest increase to consumer prices since January. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission did announce a lawsuit aimed at Live Nation and Ticketmaster for misleading consumers about resale ticket prices. 


	In her original post, Grande reshared a recent infographic from activist Matt Bernstein, who questioned Trump voters over the current state of political affairs. “It's been 250 days. now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?” the post asked. “Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised it would, or are you still waiting?”

Robert Irwin is quickly becoming a fan favorite on “Dancing With the Stars,” and part of his charm is his excitement while performing. For the show's first two dances, Irwin could be seen singing along to the music while dancing, and now he's sharing why.

“I [have] no idea about dance, but I do know I love music,” Irwin told Us Weekly following his performance on the show's second episode of season 34. He also explained that his pro partner Witney Carson tells him to “feel that music” while he's on the ballroom floor.

“For me, singing it, getting into it, and just giving every fiber of my being to this experience, that's why I'm here,” the wildlife photographer explained. And he's grateful that his partner is so good at helping him harness his energy.

“I'm so lucky that I have someone like Witney to direct all of this ridiculous tornado of passion and energy into some semblance of skill,” Irwin shared.

For the show's premiere episode, Irwin and Carson performed a fun jive number set to “Born to Be Wild” and earned an impressive score from the judges. Derek Hough even called it the “best first dance” in the history of “DWTS.”

Irwin and Carson followed up that performance with a tango to “Move Your Feet” which also garnered plenty of praise. Hough used the Aussie slang term “crikey” when giving his positive feedback, which Irwin appreciated.

“I think it is the most fitting response anyone could ever give,” the nature conservationist told Us Weekly. “Crikey is a great word. It sums up everything, and if my dance was crikey-level, mate, I'm happy.”

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

Irwin and Carson make a great team, and the dance pro is super supportive of her celeb partner. “Honestly, I'm so grateful for him and we're just going to keep doing what we're doing and hopefully we can just stay on top,” she shared.

As far as the pressure to stay on top, Carson is doing all she can to bring out the best in Irwin. “The hardest part is just trying to better yourself, right? We try to top ourselves and I always try and make the best choreography that I can,” the dancer explained, adding, “I always try and teach him the best way that I can.”

Carson has also taken on the job of playing matchmaker for Irwin, who is currently single. On September 27, Irwin shared a hilarious Instagram post of him and Carson getting ready to look at his likely overflowing DMs. “Witney taking the wingman job very seriously,” Irwin captioned the reel.

The KPop Demon Hunters smash also ties for the second-most weeks at No. 1 for a hit by an all-woman group.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's smash film KPop Demon Hunters, tops the Billboard Hot 100 for a seventh week — becoming one of the 10 longest-leading No. 1s from a movie over the chart's 67-year history.


	Meanwhile, “Golden” ties TLC's “Waterfalls,” from 1995, as the second-longest-leading Hot 100 hits ever by all-women groups. The only such song with more time at No. 1: Destiny's Child's “Independent Women Part I” dominated for 11 weeks in 2000-01.


	Previously, “Golden,” which first glowed atop the Hot 100 in August, made HUNTR/X — the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, in the roles of KPop Demon Hunters characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey — the first female group associated with Korean pop to rule the chart. “Golden” is also the sole longest-leading hit by an animated group in the Hot 100's archives, while KPop Demon Hunters became the first soundtrack to spin off four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 4, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 30. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.






	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 33.8 million official streams (up 5% week-over-week), 33.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 11%) — new weekly highs for the song in each metric — and 8,000 sold (up 2%) in the United States Sept. 19-25. (Helping its profile in the tracking week: contestant Jourdan Blue covered “Golden” in the final round of the latest season of NBC's America's Got Talent on Sept. 23.)


	The track adds a 10th week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; jumps 16-9 on Radio Songs; and rebounds 3-2 after two weeks atop Digital Song Sales. Since Streaming Songs began in 2013, “Golden” is just the 20th of 170 total No. 1s to lead for double-digit weeks. Plus, it's the first Radio Songs top 10 ever by an animated act, having outperformed cartoon tunes that hit the chart's top 40 by Gorillaz in the 2000s and (hopefully he doesn't have a cow if learning this) Bart Simpson in the ‘90s.


	With a seventh week leading the Hot 100, “Golden” ties two other hits as the ninth-longest-ruling No. 1s from movies all-time, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start.


	Here's a look at the longest-leading movie songs in the Hot 100's history (as defined by qualifications used for Billboard's Top 75 Movie Songs of All Time recap, which is based on weekly performance on the chart):




	Plus, “Golden” ties TLC's “Waterfalls” for the second-longest Hot 100 command by an all-female group (of three or more members).


	Here's a recap of the 10 longest-ruling songs by that measure:




	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2, after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It tacks on a 15th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (75.6 million in audience, down 1%).


	Also from KPop Demon Hunters, Saja Boys' “Soda Pop” buzzes 5-3 for a new Hot 100 high and their “Your Idol” rises 6-5, after reaching No. 4. (Both are sung by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.) Thanks to “Golden” and those songs, three tracks from the film chart in the Hot 100's top five simultaneously for a fourth week. (The only other soundtrack to generate three concurrent top five hits, Saturday Night Fever, did so for two weeks in 1978.)


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, is steady at No. 4 on the Hot 100, after it led in its first week in May. It adds a 19th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild,” which topped the Hot 100 in its debut week in June, drops 3-6.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become last year's No. 1 song, rises 9-7. It logs a record-extending 110th week on the chart overall and a record-furthering 79th week in the top 10.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” climbs 10-8 on the Hot 100; Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” descends 7-9, after hitting No. 5; and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” bumps 11-10, following five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.

Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners is also backing the transaction for the 'Battlefield' and 'Madden' game studio.

Senior Editor


	The video game giant Electronic Arts has inked a major $55 billion deal to be taken private, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the Egon Durban-led private equity giant Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners.


	EA shareholders will receive $210 per share in cash, with the PIF also rolling over its nearly 10 percent stake. The deal is expected to close in the company's fiscal first quarter of 2027.




	The studio, which is behind titles like the Battlefield and Madden NFL franchises, is one of the biggest players in gaming, with CEO Andrew Wilson spending the last decade-plus transforming its business model to focus more on recurring revenue like subscriptions.

	Wilson will remain CEO of the company when the take-private is complete, and will be a major shareholder himself.

	“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said Wilson in a statement. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”

	











	“PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and esports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators,” said Turqi Alnowaiser, deputy governor and head of international investments at PIF. “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to these sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA's long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”


	“This investment embodies Silver Lake's mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” added Egon Durban, co-CEO and managing partner of Silver Lake. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.”


	“Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future. ​I've admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids – I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead,” said Jared Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners.

	There's a new Simpsons movie, and it's coming out on July 23, 2027. 


	The second Simpsons movie to hit the screen will fill a date for Disney that's simultaneously being vacated by an untitled Marvel movie.


The Simpsons Movie was released in July 2007 and it was a hit, opening to $74 million and making $183M domestic and more than $536 million worldwide. It was at a time when TV properties, even if they were still on television, could excel on the big screen at the same time. David Silverman directed The Simpsons Movie. We'll apprise you when we have more intel on what the new movie is about, etc.

	











The Simpsons TV series, which first premiered in 1989, is currently in its 37th season. The series is co-created by James L. Brooks, Matt Groening and Sam Simon. The working class family of Homer, Marge and kids Bart, Maggie and Lisa, who live in the town of Springfield surrounded by a ton of kooky personalities, first made their premiere as a short on the 1987 sketch comedy series The Tracy Ullman Show, which was also co-created by Brooks.

The Simpsons features the voices of Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Yeardly Smith (Lisa), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) as well as Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer in multiple roles.

When Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt” premiered at the Venice Film Festival in late August, it was greeted with some of the most divided reviews of the filmmaker's career. Critics (candidly, including myself) were impressed by the performances and filmmaking but left bewildered by first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett's muddled screenplay that tackles post-#MeToo society, privilege, and power in the academic world. Reviews were, generally speaking, mixed to negative, with a few standouts.

A month later, the film arrived as the opening night gala at the New York Film Festival. So how did his topical drama, about a Yale philosophy professor (Julia Roberts) tied up in her Black student's (Ayo Edebiri) sexual assault accusation against a white colleague (Andrew Garfield), play at NYFF?

It opened the highbrow two-week program, overseen by artistic director and former film critic Dennis Lim and managing director Matt Bolish, last Friday at Alice Tully Hall. Past Guadagnino films to play NYFF include “Queer,” “Bones and All,” and “Call Me by Your Name” — all of which scored better receptions throughout their run than “After the Hunt” has so far.

But can new word-of-mouth — not necessarily good, but at the very least new — boost “After the Hunt” at this point?

A sampling of mostly millennial critics and journalists at Friday night's “After the Hunt” premiere that I spoke with at the official after-party at Tavern on the Green on the edges of Central Park, were also left cold by the movie. It runs long at just shy of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and one journalist I talked to said that, while the film wasn't necessarily boring, its length led them to feel the pains of an incoherent narrative. There are plot elements that don't always add up or seem easily ascribed to recognizable human behavior (such as why Julia Roberts' character Alma keeps a picture that's extremely revealing about a past secret taped under her bathroom vanity, rather than in the pied-à-terre she maintains as a private office).

But a colleague I'd spoken to who'd had a look at an earlier draft of the screenplay said that many elements were different in that script — including that very one. So we're curious to hear from screenwriter Garrett about what changed and why.

The film, however, has its admirers, including another critic who appreciated what they felt was its astute look at how trauma is processed differently across generations. (Alma, it's implied, is twice Edebiri's character's age.) “After the Hunt,” intended as Amazon MGM Studios' big horse in the Oscar race this year, might not make it all the way to the Academy Awards despite hopes for Julia Roberts returning to the Best Actress category since she won in 2001 for “Erin Brockovich.” (Her last Oscar nomination altogether was for Supporting Actress in 2014 for “August: Osage County.”)

 










But where the movie could remain a player is the HFPA-dismantled Golden Globes, a handful of whose international spectrum of voters attended a packed press conference during the film's weekend global junket. There, journalists (both in the room and joining via Zoom) asked engaging questions that Roberts and her cast and creative team praised — she was not having it at the Venice Film Festival, particularly when the first question asked at that Italian presser was, “Why does this movie undermine feminism?”

Roberts is a Globes darling, nominated most recently in 2023 for TV's similarly on-topic “Gaslit” as Martha Mitchell. She's won three times from 10 nominations, and the capaciousness of having two categories (Musical/Comedy and Drama) for Best Actress gives her room to play in. “After the Hunt” has a shot at playing better for two core audiences — the international coterie, and the Gen X or boomer audiences who didn't necessarily come of age with such proximity to the topics investigated in this American film — many of which reflect the makeup of the 300-some Golden Globes body.

Amazon MGM Studios opens “After the Hunt” in select theaters on Friday, October 10 followed by a nationwide release on Friday, October 17. How it plays for non-trade critics will factor into its eventual theatrical business. And when the film eventually reaches Amazon's Prime Video streaming service, fans of Edebiri, Roberts, Garfield, and Guadagnino can tune in with little risk, and share thoughts and soundbites and viral clips of the movie on social media, where it may well find an entirely new life.

	After Emma Watson offered a thoughtful and nuanced account of her relationship with J.K. Rowling in light of the Harry Potter creator's anti-trans stances, Rowling responded by lambasting the actress as “ignorant.” 


	During a recent podcast appearance, Watson described how she's still able to value Rowling as a person, and the time the two spent together, saying, “I really don't believe that by having had that experience, and holding the love and support and views that I have, means that I can't and don't treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with. I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person I don't get to keep and cherish. I just don't think these things are either/or.”


	Rowling, however, dismissed Watson's assessment in a lengthy retort on X. “Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is,” the author said. 

	











	The author did acknowledge she's “not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created.” And even said that, for a while, she retained a “certain protectiveness” for Watson and her co-star Daniel Radcliffe (who'd also spoken out against Rowling's views).


	But with Watson, she cited the actress' remarks at the 2022 BAFTA awards (“I'm here for all of the witches”) as a “turning point.” She alleged that the actress had “publicly poured more petrol on the flames” when the backlash and threats against Rowling were at their fiercest. 

	











	Rowling also revealed that, around the same time, Watson allegedly asked someone to pass on a handwritten note, which Rowling said read, “I'm so sorry for what you're going through.” Rowling dismissed this as well, suggesting Watson “thought a one line of expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”

	As for what prompted such a fierce response this time, Rowling blamed Watson, “The greatest irony here is that, had Emma not decided in her most recent interview to declare that she loves and treasures me — a change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was — I might never have been this honest. Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother. Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public – but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.”


	That's in sharp contrast to what Watson herself said in her original interview — though, it's unclear if Rowling heard or read Watson's comments in full, or just regurgitated the bits contained in the clip from the British right-wing TV news station that accompanied her post.

	Watson, for her part, said she remained open to reconnecting with Rowling, especially because “a conversation was never made possible.” And she stressed her own desire to be careful about her comments regarding Rowling going forward, likely out of concern for what the author had endured in the past.


	“I just don't want to say anything that continues to weaponize a really like toxic debate and conversation,” Watson said. “It is why I don't comment or continue to comment. Not because I don't care about her or about the issue, but because the way that the conversation is being had feels really painful to me.”

Bad Bunny is at the peak of his powers. The Puerto Rican artist just finished a sold-out, month-long residency at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, and on Sunday DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS became the first album of 2025 to surpass 7 billion streams on Spotify. The NFL announced the same day that Benito will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. 


	It's going to be loud, it's going to be Latin, it's going to be (mostly) in Spanish, and it's already driving right-wingers insane. 


	Prominent Republicans are already fuming at the possibility that Bad Bunny's halftime performance in February will feature critiques of President Donald Trump and his targeting of immigrant communities, and that it may require them to turn on English subtitles. 


	Earlier this month, Bad Bunny canceled the U.S. dates of the DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS tour over concerns that large gatherings of Latinos in the U.S. could be magnets for the Trump administration's anti-immigration efforts. “There was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said of the decision. 

	











	The announcement that a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's agenda will play the Super Bowl sparked immediate outrage from the MAGA base. 


	“The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” MAGA slop YouTuber Benny Johnson wrote on X. “Massive Trump hater. Anti-ICE activist. No songs in English,” he added.

	











	Conspiracy theorist and right-wing commentator Jack Posobiec suggested that the selection was a conspiracy orchestrated by former President Barack Obama. 


	“Barack Obama's best friend Jay-Z runs the Super Bowl selection process through his company Roc Nation which has an exclusive contract with the NFL. This is who chooses the halftime show, the most-watched musical performance in America,” he wrote.  


	Conservative commentator Greg Price noted that “the NFL chose Bad Bunny to perform the Super Bowl halftime show despite the fact that he recently said he wouldn't perform in the continental United States again because ICE is deporting illegal aliens.”

	Some of the criticism was a little more stylistic. The right wing account “Redheaded Libertarian” described Bad Bunny as “demonic Marxist who has been granted the largest stage with the greatest audience in the middle of a Christian revival.” Podcaster Trish Regan complained that Bad Bunny's music contained Spanish-language slang and explicit language, even halftime show performers typically edit out any explicit content. “This is a rapper with a catalog of vulgar lyrics in Spanish and English — including calling a president a “mamabicho” (translation: vile insult),” she wrote.


	The account “End Wokeness,” which boasts almost 4 million followers on X, suggested that a Harper's Bazaar photoshoot in which Bad Bunny wore a skirt should have weighed against his selection for the performance. Commentator Mario Nawfal wrote that “maybe someone should let the NFL know that the average halftime viewer in Des Moines doesn't speak fluent reggaeton […]  Enjoy the show, America. Just don't ask for subtitles.” Right wing filmmaker Robby Starbuck complained that “the guy literally says he isn't touring the US because of Trump's ICE raids and just released a video mocking President Trump.”

	“Also, most of his songs aren't even in English,” Starbuck griped. “This is not a pick designed to unite football fans or let people just enjoy the show. It was a pick designed to divide fans and no doubt Bad Bunny will find some way to push a woke message.” Starbuck also suggested that team owners were either “in on this idiocy” or “just culturally that disconnected from reality.”


	Starbuck and the nativist right are speaking to a mirror. The reality is that public approval of the Trump administration's handling of immigration enforcement continues to slip as the Department of Homeland Security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement continue to use authoritarian tactics. The reality is that Latin and South America are two of the largest and fastest-growing viewership markets for the NFL. The reality is that Bad Bunny, a vocal Trump critic, is one of the most popular artists in the world — whether conservatives like it or not.

The whole situation with J.K. Rowling and Emma Watson keeps getting worse. Based on Rowling's latest, nearly 700-word post, one might think Watson gleefully cast the Cruciatus curse on the Harry Potter author's family. In reality, she just said the following in an interview on the On Purpose With Jay Shetty podcast last week: “I think it's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with.” Rowling clearly does not share this wish, nor does she seem to have retained a lot of love for the actor she's known since Watson was 11. Last week, Rowling reposted a video mocking Watson's comments on X. Today's post only doubled down on her earlier suggestion that she'd never forgive Watson (or her co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint) for their public dissent. 

“I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created,” Rowling opened, before reiterating that “Emma Watson and her co-stars have every right to embrace gender identity ideology.” What she takes issue with, however, is the fact that “Emma and Dan in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right – nay, obligation – to critique me and my views in public.” Watson has arguably done this very little. In 2020, Watson posted, “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are,” without mentioning Rowling by name as the author's transphobia ramped up online. Two years later, she said she was here for “all the witches” in a BAFTA speech Rowling directly referenced in today's post. 

That speech, which again, did not mention Rowling by name, was apparently a “turning point” for the author, but it “had a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself.” “Emma asked someone to pass on a handwritten note from her to me, which contained the single sentence ‘I'm so sorry for what you're going through' (she has my phone number),” Rowling's post continued. “This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety. Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”

Rowling then went on to imply that Watson is “ignorant of how ignorant she is” because “like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life.” To Rowling, that life Watson hasn't experienced includes “mixed sex public hospital ward[s]” and the possibility of “sharing a prison cell with a male rapist who's identified into the women's prison.” These are all things Rowling understands, of course, because she “wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen” and “lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous.”

“Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother,” Rowling's post concluded. “Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public – but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.” It doesn't seem like this spat will be over any time soon.

Madonna is approaching the first anniversary of the death of her younger brother, Christopher Ciccone, who died this past October at the age of 63. At times, the singer's relationship with her sibling was tumultuous, leading to periods during which they rarely spoke. During her first podcast appearance, on Jay Shetty's On Purpose, Madonna details a spiritual encounter she had while in a medically-induced coma (during her four-day hospitalization in the ICU in June 2023 for a serious bacterial infection) that led to her reconnecting with Ciccone. 


	“I was almost there on the other side and I had a conscious moment and my mother appeared to me and she said, ‘Do you want to come with me?' And I said, ‘No,'” Madonna said. “My assistant was in the room with me, but I was still unconscious, but she heard me say, ‘No.' And then when I did eventually wake up, I realized that the ‘No' was about me needing to forgive and make good with people that I still held grudges against.” 


	Soon after, Madonna wrote a song about her brother and another about forgiveness. The unreleased tracks, titled “Fragile” and “Forgive Yourself,” center around the idea of accountability and responsibility. “We have to forgive others but we also have to forgive ourselves and stop beating up on ourselves about things, choices we've made in the past that haven't worked out for ourselves or other people,” she said.

	For a while, Madonna added, she pushed off forgiving with Ciccone because she assumed she'd have more time to do so. “Your ego dances around it like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get to it. I'll get to calling him up or talking to him or being his friend or helping him,'” she said. “But eventually I did. And, I know I'm being mysterious, if someone you love deeply betrays you and does something that shows that they have no consciousness in that moment that they made that choice to do that, it's a bitter pill for me to swallow.” 

	











	She continued, “For my brother, I didn't speak to him for years, years, and years. It was him being ill and reaching out to me and saying, ‘I need your help,' and me having that moment like, ‘Am I going to help my enemy?' That's how it felt. And I just did. I felt so relieved. It was such a load off my back, such a weight that was removed, baggage that I could put down to finally be able to be in a room with him and holding his hand — even if he was dying — and saying, ‘I love you and I forgive you.'”

Fans say they also spotted the pop star's dad and brother at the game.

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift may be one of the busiest people on earth, but she still makes time for the important people in her life. 


Billboard has confirmed that the pop superstar was at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday (Sept. 28) to cheer on Travis Kelce, just hours after she was in a different time zone to watch Selena Gomez marry Benny Blanco. Though Swift kept a low profile while at Arrowhead Stadium, fans online say they spotted her dad, Scott, and brother, Austin, at the game as well.


	The day prior, the 14-time Grammy winner was reportedly one of many celebrities in attendance at one of the biggest weddings of the year. Gomez and Blanco tied the knot on Saturday (Sept. 27) in a private ceremony in California, as shared by the Rare Beauty founder on Instagram that day.

	











	Swift and Gomez have long been besties, so it's no surprise to fans that the former was there for the latter's big day. When the Only Murders in the Building actress first announced in December that she and the producer were getting married, the Eras Tour headliner joked in the comments, “yes I will be the flower girl.”


	It may not be long before the roles are reversed and Gomez is watching her friend walk down the aisle. In August, Swift announced that she and Kelce had gotten engaged, sharing photos of her new ring and the tight end down on one knee and writing on Instagram, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”


	“When bestie gets engaged,” Gomez wrote at the time.

	











	This weekend's Chiefs game — which ended in the Kansas City team defeating the Ravens 37-20 — marked the second match-up Swift has attended this season without being spotted by the usual horde of fans and cameras that used to flock to her on game days. She was also present at the Sept. 14 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.


	Swift is currently gearing up to release her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3.

Taylor Swift knows what excellence requires and is not afraid to demand it. Even if the one she's insisting on it from is herself. In a jokey promo video posted on Monday morning (Sept. 28) to promote the upcoming Target-only The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King “summertime spritz pink shimmer” disc due out on Friday (Oct. 3).

	Playing the role of director — which is not new for the award-winning singer — a suit-wearing Swift gives patient direction through a pink megaphone. “All right, we are still rolling, we're gonna try again. Okay? We're elegant, we're luxurious, we're in front of the most beautiful pink vinyl we've ever seen,” she says with enthusiasm before things turn grim in the clip captioned, “she's got 4 days left to rehearse for her big moment… [laughing crying emoji].”

	“What is going on with the posture?” Swift asks with growing exasperation at an unseen model. “It's giving ‘no girl,' not showgirl. What are we doing?,” Swift says as the camera spins to a scene of the singer in her glittery showgirl cover outfit standing in front of a giant version of the pink vinyl. To her director's consternation, cover model Taylor listlessly tosses handfuls of glitter as director Swift implores, “Elegance! Charm!… Not that,” as the unsteady model Swift wobbles on her heels and fails to impress.

	











	“She's got cat hair all over her,” the director seethes. “Is there a school we could very quickly send her to?”


	Swift announced the latest vinyl variant of her upcoming The Life of a Showgirl album last week, revealing that the store-exclusive variant will feature a collectible sleeve, a giant double-sided poster, an exclusive poem penned by Swift and special photos when it drops on Friday.

In the most beautiful celebration of love, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco got married in Santa Barbara, California, on September 27. It was one of the biggest celebrity events of this year, and loved ones rallied around the pair.

Gomez and Blanco's friends and family surrounded the couple at their wedding. There was also a star-studded guest list. Among the guests were Taylor Swift, Paris Hilton, and Ed Sheeran, Vogue reports. It was also a mini “Wizards of Waverly Place” reunion because Gomez's former costar David Henrie was there, and her “Only Murders in the Building” costars Martin Short, Steve Martin, Paul Rudd, and Ashley Park.

Short and Martin gave a joint speech at the rehearsal dinner, People reports. 

Other guests include Édgar Ramírez, Zoe Saldana, SZA, Camila Cabello, Cara Delevingne, Eric André, and Finneas, People reports. Mark Ronson DJed at the reception.

Gomez teased details of her wedding plans ahead of their big day. “I am looking to have a special dance with my papa,” she said on the “Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware” podcast in April.  “He never got a chance to walk my mom [Mandy Teefey] down the aisle because — good for my mom— she decided to go to Vegas and was like, ‘Whooo.'” She is referring to how her mom eloped in 2006. 

“There was so much love in the room,” a source told People of Blanco and Gomez's wedding. “At the reception, everyone was letting loose and celebrating them well into the night. The vibe was so much fun.”

The source continued, “The ceremony moved guests to tears. They wrote their own vows, which were both funny and sentimental.”

On Saturday, September 27, Gomez posed a selection of photos from her wedding on Instagram. The photos gave a glimpse at her and Blanco's beautiful day, including her dress and the love between them. The comment section has been flooded with reactions. “So happy for you guys, love yal” a comment reads- “The beauty! The love!! Stunning!” another person shared.

Other reactions include, “Everyone's favorite couple! So happy for you guys!,” “You are glowing! Congratulations, wishing you a lifetime of love, good health, and happiness!” and “​I love you and so happy for you guys!!!”

Blanco also posted on Instagram about his wedding, showing an upclose picture of their rings and a closer look at Gomez's stunning, full veil. “i married a real life disney princess,” he wrote in the caption.

Season 34 “Dancing with the Stars” contestant Hilaria Baldwin and her family are feeling the love from DWTS fans after revealing a difficult loss. 

On September 27, Baldwin shared the sad news in an Instagram post. The initial photo she included in her carousel showed her husband, actor Alec Baldwin, posing with two small dogs. Additional photos showed highlights from the family's time with both dogs over the years, and it was the white dog Baldwin was mourning.

A post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin)

In the caption of her post, she wrote, “Rest in peace, sweet Dama. You brought so much joy to our lives.” 

She continued, “You were that dog that slept on my pregnant belly. Your life was long and happy. I know you are running through fields and eating all the cookies you want.”

“We are sad but grateful that we had you in our lives,” Baldwin added. 

One of the pictures Baldwin included in her post showed Dama as a small puppy, indicating she was a part of the family for many years. 

The post quickly received nearly 35,000 “likes” and almost 2,200 comments in the day after it was shared. Several comments came from people who wrote that they remembered when the Baldwin family got Dama initially and noted she was well-loved. 

“I remember when you got her. I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending you and the fam all the love,” one fan wrote.

“Oh nooo. Dama!!!! Sending you guys all the love,” read another comment.

Someone else added, “I'm so sorry about your loss. Such a heartbreaking time. Sending hugs!!!”

An additional comment read, “She had years of peanut butter/sticky fingers hugs and kisses. What more could one pup want. Warm hugs to the family.”

Next up for Baldwin and her partner, Gleb Savchenko, on “Dancing with the Stars” is “TikTok Night.” The third week of the season 34 competition airs on September 30 and viewers will see Baldwin and Savchenko dance a samba to “Shake It to the Max (FLY) [Remix].”

During the second week of the competition, Baldwin and Savchenko did a tango and received a total of 21 out of 30 points from the judges. They were one of three couples left at risk of elimination after others were called safe, and “Dancing with the Stars” fans knew that two of the three would be eliminated.

Ultimately, Baldwin and Savchenko were called safe while Britt Stewart and Baron Davis, along with Jenna Johnson and Corey Feldman, were eliminated.

Coined by American philosopher W.V. Quine, “Gavagai” is a nonsense word meant to convey the indeterminacy of translation. The classic example: A British ethnologist visits some “exotic” foreign land, where a speaker of the native tongue points to a rabbit and says “gavagai.” While the natural assumption would be that “gavagai” is the local word for “rabbit,” the reality is that “gavagai” could just as easily mean “food,” “pet,” “mammal,” or “we're all vegans here.”  

Some assumptions are more plausible than others, but the fact remains that no two people can ever perfectly understand one another, let alone two people from completely different backgrounds. Communication is miscommunication, and if that's true of a single word, then it's exponentially more so of an ancient play, or a modern adaptation of it, or — say — of a racist incident that occurs to the lead actor of a modern adaptation of an ancient play in the hours before the new “Medea” he stars in is set to premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival.

So goes the premise of Ulrich Köhler's “Gavagai,” a patchy but provocative thought exercise of a movie that fittingly neglects to explain its title (hence the preamble here), which is all the better to let viewers arrive at their own interpretations. Loosely inspired by his experience shooting “Sleeping Sickness” (2011) in Cameroon, when the well-intentioned German director — sweating under the pressures of running a set in a distant country with a local crew — wound up “reproducing the neocolonial hierarchies and behavioral patterns that we address in the film” (as he puts it in the “Gavagai” press notes), this stilted meta-drama allows Köhler to more deliberately trace the inexorable tensions that underpin today's globalized film trade. 

 










Here, he recasts himself as a French director named Caroline (an extremely Claire Denis-coded Nathalie Richard), who seems a bit too headstrong and oblivious to appreciate why her Senegalese reimagining of Euripides' tragedy — in which the titular child-murderer is an entitled white immigrant who's reduced to refugee status after her native Black husband betrays her — could potentially reaffirm the same hierarchies of privilege that it hopes to address. Caroline is a headstrong liberal who's doing what she can to push civilization forward according to her understanding of what that means, but flipping the script on racist stereotypes may not be the most effective way of dismantling them, especially when the process of doing so finds the director stranding her extras in the hot Dakar sun for 10 hours at a time while denying them access to the craft services tent. 

To its credit, Köhler's film is much less interested in wallowing in such archly observed (and self-exculpatory) ironies than it is in articulating how difficult they are to avoid in a world where nothing is a rabbit, and everything is “gavagai.” While there are several wry moments of movie-within-a-movie satire toward the start (Medea comes to shore on the bow of a speedboat, and Caroline is horrified to see that Medea's dead children have been outfitted with life jackets for safety reasons), “Gavagai” soon keys into a wide variety of overlapping — and sometimes conflicting — realities about the process of exhuming an ancient text, most of which are more sober in tone. 

 










For starters, Caroline projects her frustration onto her lead actress, Maja (Maren Eggert), who she argues is too bourgeois to play an outcast “savage” capable of killing her own kids. The director is unaware that Maja — who FaceTimes her husband and daughter back home in Berlin during her breaks on set — is secretly having an affair with the film's Jason (“Sleeping Sickness” star Jean-Christophe Folly, wonderful as Nourou, a character who's always taking uncertain shape of his burden), which hardly rises to the crime of homicide, but suggests that Caroline doesn't perceive her cast as clearly as she might think. 

She's certainly oblivious to the anxieties that have confronted her leading man by virtue of his accepting a major role in this splashy European production. She's blithely unaware that Nourou's Senegalese identity is so threatened that he can only justify his part in the film by insisting that it's a masterpiece, even if the frequent clips we see of the finished product make it look like a hodgepodge of all the worst ideas that Julie Taymor never had (jet skis can only add so much to a 2,500-year-old play). 

Nourou's awareness of his own “complicity” in the project — the uncertain degree to which he's swallowing his doubts about the movie in order to enjoy the benefits of being in it — is left ambiguous, but other tensions produced by his performance are more evident on the surface. A high-status artist in the African city where “Medea” is shot, Nourou is forced to assume the role of barely tolerated outsider in the German city where the film is slated to premiere, a downshift in privilege that leads to a racist incident outside of the Berlin hotel where he's staying for the festival. A hostile security guard treats Nourou with undue suspicion, questioning his right to enter the lobby of the Intercontinental; the actor is understandably irked by the encounter, but it's Maja who sees it as a chance to perform her identity as a good white lady, and perhaps to openly defend the lover she's otherwise ashamed to keep as a secret. It's Maja who adopts the role of savior and insists that the security guard be fired.

 










 This too is based on a real incident, as a bigoted staffer — maybe or maybe not at the Intercontinental — confronted Folly after the premiere of “Sleeping Sickness.” This is also a chance for Köhler to redress his reaction to the event, and to examine how his reflexive transformation into a white savior may have been more for his own benefit than anything else. Like so much of “Gavagai,” the encounter is filmed from a remove (and in this case additionally obfuscated by a glass door), which doesn't approximate some kind of objectivity so much as it heightens our attention to the nature of perspective. 

Once again, this story is not being told through the eyes of its victim, but through those of his director, and while “Gavagai” avoids any self-flagellating displays of white guilt, the film is only so interesting because Köhler is keenly aware that he's at risk of repeating this cycle of moral relativism, and making the fact of his awareness more important than Folly's experience of prejudice. Is the act of extrapolating that experience into a feature-length film meant to absolve Köhler of his embarrassment over how it played out in real life, or — by reducing a long-time collaborator to his role in a particularly dehumanizing moment — is the director further confining Folly to the limits of his neoliberal gaze? 

 










These would be easy questions for Köhler to address on his own behalf, but “Gavagai” complicates them well beyond the yes/no binary (even if the film is weakened by its quasi-cartoonish portrait of Caroline's blinkered privilege, which prevents her from displaying any trace of self-awareness). Every scene is relaxedly suffused with the tension between the limits of perspective and the empathy of storytelling, until the act of seeing becomes as problematized as the refusal to look, and the boundaries between reality and fiction grow as blurred as those between the various genres that “Gavagai” swirls into an unclassifiable sludge. 

The last act of this movie becomes a ticking clock thriller set during the “Medea” premiere, by which point “Gavagai” has already refracted the dynamic between Köhler and his subject into an inescapable house of mirrors that's less interesting for its reflections than it is for the parallax of considering them from different angles. Those angles can be too obtuse in the moments when they aren't unavoidably acute, and I can't help but wish that Köhler had jettisoned the unhelpful “Medea” flashbacks in favor of a more explicitly self-reflexive approach that elevated the “Sleeping Sickness” of it all from backstory to text. Still, “Gavagai” remains worthwhile because it constantly adds new dimensions to the question of who this — or any — film is “for” in a world where even the simplest gestures can be lost in translation, and every viewer is left to arrive at their own meaning.

 










“Gavagai” premiered at the 2025 New York Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, A24 has boarded Hotel Hotel Hotel Hotel, the sci-fi thriller from Together writer-director Michael Shanks. Shanks, who wrote the script that appeared on the 2021 Black List, will also direct and produce.


	The sci-fi thriller follows a man wakes up trapped in a mysterious hotel room. All alone in a mind-bending prison, his only chance for escape is teamwork — with himself.


	The film will be produced by Mike Cowap of Princess Pictures and Adam McKay and Todd Schulman of HyperObject Industries.


	Shanks was one of the big winners at this year's Sundance Film Festival, where his body horror comedy Together earned rave reviews and became one of the bigger acquisition deals of the fest when Neon came in to land distribution rights.

	The film bowed in the summer and grossed $32 million at the global box office, strong results for an indie horror pic in the thick of the summer tentpole season. When Shanks declared that Hotel Hotel Hotel Hotel would be next up, A24 moved fast to make sure it was the home of his next film, and are now moving fast to get it up and running as Shanks begins the casting process.


	Shanks is repped by WME and Untitled Entertainment.

Yusuf/Cat Stevens has officially postponed his North American book tour due to ongoing visa delays.


	Earlier this month, the singer-songwriter warned fans that the tour — which is in support of his upcoming memoir, Cat on the Road to Findout — was in “serious jeopardy.” The trek was slated to kick off in Philadelphia on Oct. 2, followed by stops in major cities that include New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. 


	“Waiting months for visa approvals, we held out as long as we could,” Yusuf said in a statement. “However, at this point, the production logistics necessary for my show cannot be arranged in time. I am really upset! Not least for my fans who have bought tickets and made travel plans to see me perform.”


	He added, “North American audiences may still get a chance to see the tour if visa approvals eventually come through. Those dates would be some time away because of other travel tour plans but, hopefully, fans will be able to hop on the Peace Train route at some time in the future. Meanwhile, tour delays should not affect the book, which you'll still be able to enjoy… the obvious benefit of it being — books don't need visas!”

Why is Glen Powell so determined to hide his handsome face? The Tom Cruise-approved action star has two professional writing credits to his name — co-writer Richard Linklater's 2023 film “Hit Man” and co-creator Michael Waldron's 2025 series “Chad Powers” — and both require Powell, a man once described on this very site as “plainly one of the most handsome and charismatic human beings on planet Earth,” to disguise himself as a goofy nobody. For all the debate over the state of movie stardom, which often centers discussion around Powell's ticket-selling muscles, it's clear, at least, he's not a nobody. He's a charming bad boy. A versatile beefcake. A cerebral bro (cerebro? no, that's something else) who can showcase his style on the cover of GQ in a half-lifted tank and pop two buttons too many for the suits who subscribe to The Hollywood Reporter.

“Hit Man,” at least, gives Powell ample opportunity to flex his range. As Gary, a nerdy professor pretending to be an assassin-for-hire in order to help the police expose real people's murder plots, each new “job” requires a new personality, and Powell's transformations provide plenty of hoots and hollers, a dash of heat, and a dab of human drama. But Chad Powers — the puffy-faced hillbilly persona assumed by disgraced quarterback Russ Holliday so he can reenter college football — actively gets in the way of “Chad Powers.” He's all disguise and no character, stranding Hulu‘s half-hour sports comedy in an implausible premise it doesn't know how to manage. Rather than bring out Powell's good side(s), “Chad Powers” gets stuck in the same identity crisis as its subject.

 










Before Chad, there was Russ. And Russ is an asshole. He drives a Cybertruck. He's got “buddies in crypto.” He believes conspiracy theories, most notably that Osama bin Laden is still alive. All of these personality traits are introduced within the first hour of “Chad Powers,” and while they're largely played for jokes, they also establish just how deep a moral hole ol' Russ has to climb out of by pretending to be someone else — someone nice or, at least, someone better.

You see, Russ hasn't recovered from his spectacular collapse eight years earlier. As the star quarterback of the Oregon Ducks, he led his team to the national championship and was inches away from winning it when he dropped the ball on the 1-yard-line. Just like that, everything changed. He went from athletic icon to laughing stock, from a first-round NFL draft pick with sponsorship deals to a former “Masked Singer” contestant who's too toxic for the XFL.

He didn't have to crash and burn quite so garishly, but Russ didn't handle his fall from grace with any, well, grace. The second he loses the big game, a young fan in a wheelchair shouts to Russ, “You're still my favorite player.” But Russ is too wrapped up in his own failure to recognize an outstretched arm as anything but an annoyance, and his reaction is ugly enough to “haunt him … for the rest of his life.”

 










Or that's what play-by-play announcer Chris Fowler says on TV, and his pointed prophecy is proven out by the disastrous decisions Russ makes in the present. Watching videos on his phone while driving through Los Angeles, he sees South Georgia University is holding open tryouts for their football team. Just then, he pulls up to the Fox lot, where he's supposed to drop off a set of prosthetics his father (Toby Huss) made for the new Michael Bay movie. But as Stephen A. Smith complains about open try-outs, shouting, “This isn't a movie,” Russ looks up and sees the “Mrs. Doubtfire” poster hanging above the studio entrance. He thinks for a second. An idea sparks. Then he looks directly into the camera… and smiles.

From that point on, any inkling that the TV show based on an Eli Manning sketch is meant to have both cleated feet rooted in reality vanishes. The premise is just there to set up jokes about Chad Powers' weird looks and absurd backstory (Russ likes to improvise answers, despite being terrible at it), while establishing a unique starting point for a conventional sports redemption story. Russ doesn't know who he is without football (other than a big ol' jerk), so maybe walking a football field in someone else's shoes will help him figure it out.

 










…except Chad's jokes are redundant and shallow, his prosthetics are an impediment to a good time, and the premise refuses to get out of its own way. First, the jokes: Russ is instinctually hesitant to talk about himself, which makes sense considering the more he says about Chad, the more opportunities there are for him to get caught in a lie. But establishing your lead funnyman as someone who just shuts up and stares blankly ahead isn't a recipe for sustainable comedy. He'll occasionally mumble made-up excuses, but those are too out-there to laugh at, and his coaches and teammates' confused conclusions aren't all that humorous either (especially when they involve the word “retard,” which continues its frustrating cultural comeback). 

As a commentary on how much leeway athletes are given in America, Chad's inability to string sentences together is disturbingly accurate, but “Chad Powers” isn't trying to make a point. It's trying to be funny, and the laughs only come elsewhere. Namely, they stem from Steve Zahn as Chad's oft-bewildered head coach, Clayne Crawford as Chad's bluntly entitled quarterbacks coach, and Frankie A. Rodriguez as Chad's unpaid assistant, roommate, and team mascot, Danny.

The colorful supporting cast gels well enough, taking pressure off Chad to score laughs and lending the series a “Ted Lasso” niceness. (Team-building through sports! Huzzah!) But a lot of the jokes are too crass to fit the forced inspirational tone, let alone a series about a douchebag learning to be less douchey. Plus, at least one cast member's side plot feels too much like a minefield. Perry Mattfeld plays Ricky, a talented assistant coach who's routinely overlooked because she's a) the coach's daughter and b) a woman. But Ricky also provides ample reasons of her own to negate moving up the ranks, as she forms a “will they, won't they” romance with Chad despite their perceived age-gap and very real coach-player dynamic.

 










In a show that so clearly wants you to just go along with its story, these kind of emotional (st)ick-ing points act as road blocks toward relaxed fun. There are too many unanswered questions — how is Chad passing his classes? does he even go? — and too many missed opportunities. (The cold opens are… rough.) But worst of all, “Chad Powers” manages to waste Glen Powell. Saddled with an uninteresting jerk half the time and a muzzled non-entity the other half, there's only a handful of moments in the first six episodes where Powell's star power shines through. That the majority of them arrive in the later episodes may be a sign for optimism, but “Chad Powers” has a lot more work to do if it's ever going to become its best self. 

“Chad Powers” premieres Tuesday, September 30 on Hulu. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 28.

This article features plot details of One Battle After Another.

There isn't much backstory for Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn), the scowling face of white nationalism in Paul Thomas Anderson‘s One Battle After Another. There doesn't need to be. When French 75 revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) gets the drop on him, she already knows his whole deal. She instinctively understands that she can force the overseer of the Los Angeles migrant detention center into having an erection while taken captive, adding insult to injury as her team frees his prisoners. The irony serves the film‘s underlying view of white supremacy: To claim racial purity is to reject your humanity. But as persistent as that hate is, humanity keeps fighting. Their meeting is the starter pistol for a film about the pervasiveness and hypocrisy of white supremacy, and the endless fight to rid society of it.

At its core, One Battle After Another is about one racist's inability to accept his sexual desires and his decision to make that everyone else's problem. His coercive relationship with Perfidia, which allows him to act on his feelings, ends with an attempt to subjugate her further. This sets the whole plot in motion. He forces her to rat out her comrades and pushes her into witness protection, where she can be safely hidden as his dirty little secret. After Perfidia flees from Lockjaw—a more desperate flight than she'd previously taken from her lover Bob (Leonardo DiCaprio) and their daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti)—the colonel gives his life meaning by applying to the Christmas Adventurers Club, the white nationalist organization apparently at the center of American power. However, if they were to find out that Willa was actually Lockjaw's child, it would disqualify him from membership. To be accepted, he must hide his transgression by any means necessary. His insecurity becomes a town's terror. 

White supremacy invades every element of One Battle After Another through systems of surveillance, enforcement, and resistance. Part of that reveals itself in Bob, née Ghetto Pat, who successfully goes into paranoid hiding after Perfidia's betrayal. But white supremacy has long had its eye on Bob, whether he knows it or not. In their only meeting, Lockjaw accosts Bob in the supermarket, where the new father is picking up diapers. “You like Black girls?” Lockjaw asks. “I love 'em.” The surprise interaction reflects the pervasiveness and hypocrisy of Lockjaw's ideology. He's resentful and jealous of Bob while also reminding him that he's being watched—if Lockjaw can't have Perfidia, he can at least flex his power over Bob. But it's also a confession. Because of this power imbalance, it's the only time in the film that Lockjaw can express what he actually wants to someone. 

What Lockjaw doesn't get is that he's just another mark, a pawn, for the Christmas Adventurers Club. He even walks like a strung-up marionette. They will never accept him, despite his willingness to terrorize non-white communities. Before he can even give Willa a DNA test, the shadowy admissions council plans on tossing him into the incinerator. That he debases himself further for their approval—surviving their assassination attempt in order to spend a few minutes in the crappy corner office of his dreams before the nerve gas begins to flood in—shows how little solidarity exists at the North Pole. It's all in-fighting, purity tests, and self-loathing. That's the truth about white supremacy: No one will ever be white enough for the people at the top. Like so many neo-Nazi foot soldiers, white nationalist mouthpieces, and violent ICE agents, Lockjaw is a means to an end for someone in power. Nothing more. 

But on the other side of this Battle, resistance springs eternal. For pretty much everyone other than Bob, white supremacy isn't something they can hide from. They've been living around it for so long that resisting its threats has become a casual and instinctive response. When a radio operator is snatched from his post, a pair of neighborhood kids jump on the mic to air an emergency transmission. When Bob needs to escape from Lockjaw's military forces, invading the sanctuary city of Baktan Cross, his daughter's martial arts sensei, Sergio St. Carlos (Benicio del Toro), cracks a Modelo and lends him a hand, despite having a “Harriet Tubman thing going on” with the rest of the town's immigrant community. Supported by an unbothered and enthusiastic network of skaters and nurses, Sergio fends off the military and shepherds Bob out of town without breaking a sweat. Sergio's network shows the forces organically formed to stop white supremacy, the underfunded community-building required to prevent the state from flattening us into homogeneity. Bob has always aligned himself with the opposition, and that's why he gets the happy ending—one where he can learn to ease his paranoia and where Willa can join the cause to fight the next battle.

Anderson does all this without making it explicit to the contemporary political landscape. There are no red baseball caps. No messages scrawled on bullets or warnings about online radicalization. This isn't adapted from a doomscroll. Rather, he structures the fight against white supremacy like it's Terminator 2: Two men in pursuit of the next generation, a necessary and humanistic battle for the future that we're all already fighting.

Before Chad, there was Russ. And Russ is an asshole. He drives a Cybertruck. He's got “buddies in crypto.” He believes conspiracy theories, most notably that Osama bin Laden is still alive. All of these personality traits are introduced within the first hour of “Chad Powers,” and while they're largely played for jokes, they also establish just how deep a moral hole ol' Russ has to climb out of by pretending to be someone else — someone nice or, at least, someone better.

Or that's what play-by-play announcer Chris Fowler says on TV, and his pointed prophecy is proven out by the disastrous decisions Russ makes in the present. Watching videos on his phone while driving through Los Angeles, he sees South Georgia University is holding open tryouts for their football team. Just then, he pulls up to the Fox lot, where he's supposed to drop off a set of prosthetics his father (Toby Huss) made for the new Michael Bay movie. But as Stephen A. Smith complains about open try-outs, shouting, “This isn't a movie,” Russ looks up and sees the “Mrs. Doubtfire” poster hanging above the studio entrance. He thinks for a second. An idea sparks.

…except Chad's jokes are redundant and shallow, his prosthetics are an impediment to a good time, and the premise refuses to get out of its own way. First, the jokes: Russ is instinctually hesitant to talk about himself, which makes sense considering the more he says about Chad, the more opportunities there are for him to get caught in a lie. But establishing your lead funnyman as someone who just shuts up and stares blankly ahead isn't a recipe for sustainable comedy. He'll occasionally mumble made-up excuses, but those are too out-there to laugh at, and his coaches and teammates' confused conclusions aren't all that humorous either (especially when they involve the word “retard,” which continues its frustrating cultural comeback). 

As a commentary on how much leeway athletes are given in America, Chad's inability to string sentences together is disturbingly accurate, but “Chad Powers” isn't trying to make a point. It's trying to be funny, and the laughs only come elsewhere. Namely, they stem from Steve Zahn as Chad's oft-bewildered head coach, Clayne Crawford as Chad's bluntly entitled quarterbacks coach, and Frankie A. Rodriguez as Chad's unpaid assistant, roommate, and team mascot, Danny.

The colorful supporting cast gels well enough, taking pressure off Chad to score laughs and lending the series a “Ted Lasso” niceness. (Team-building through sports! Huzzah!) But a lot of the jokes are too crass to fit the forced inspirational tone, let alone a series about a douchebag learning to be less douchey. Plus, at least one cast member's side plot feels too much like a minefield. Perry Mattfeld plays Ricky, a talented assistant coach who's routinely overlooked because she's a) the coach's daughter and b) a woman. But Ricky also provides ample reasons of her own to negate moving up the ranks, as she forms a “will they, won't they” romance with Chad despite their perceived age-gap and very real coach-player dynamic.

 










In a show that so clearly wants you to just go along with its story, these kind of emotional (st)ick-ing points act as road blocks toward relaxed fun. There are too many unanswered questions — how is Chad passing his classes? does he even go? — and too many missed opportunities. (The cold opens are… rough.) But worst of all, “Chad Powers” manages to waste Glen Powell. Saddled with an uninteresting jerk half the time and a muzzled non-entity the other half, there's only a handful of moments in the first six episodes where Powell's star power shines through. That the majority of them arrive in the later episodes may be a sign for optimism, but “Chad Powers” has a lot more work to do if it's ever going to become its best self. 

“Chad Powers” premieres Tuesday, September 30 on Hulu. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 28.

	President Donald Trump appears keen on reviving his roundly criticized threat to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside the United States.


	Trump made the announcement on Truth Social Monday, Sept. 29, writing, “Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor [Gavin Newsom], has been particularly hard hit! Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.” 


	Like the last time he threatened to slap a 100 percent tariff on films made outside the U.S., Trump did not say when or how the tariff would be enacted. He first raised the prospect of the film tariffs in May, but there was no follow through.


	As Trump's post did note, film and television jobs in the United States, especially in California, have declined significantly in recent years because of high production costs and fewer tax incentives. But while many Hollywood productions have gone overseas in search of lucrative inducements, there are still plenty of creative — and non-economic — reasons a film would shoot outside the United States. Ostensibly, Trump's tariff would affect all of these productions if implemented.

	











	Unsurprisingly, Hollywood has balked at the plan — both because of the havoc it would wreak on the industry, and because of its general unfeasibility. As one industry source told CNN back when the first tariff announcement was made, “On first blush, it's shocking and would represent a virtually complete halt of production. But in reality, he has no jurisdiction to do this and it's too complex to enforce.”

	Following Trump's initial tariff announcement, one of his own hand-picked “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, Jon Voight, shared a plan for revitalizing the U.S. film industry that did not contain anything close to a 100 percent tariff on foreign productions. He suggested, instead, a combination of federal tax incentives, tax-code changes, co-production treaties, and infrastructure subsidies for theater owners, production, and postproduction companies. At most, Voight called for “tariffs in certain limited circumstances.” 


	A rep for Voight said the actor did not have any comment on Trump's latest tariff call.

President Trump is once again threatening to impose tariffs on film productions outside the United States, he shared on the Truth Social platform Monday morning.

“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby,'” the President wrote. “California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit! Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DJT”

Trump made a similar announcement back on May 4, in which he proposed 100% tariffs on all movies made outside the U.S., deeming the increased move of productions abroad a “national security threat” and an effort to undermine American businesses. It's not clear what reactivated the threat, though moments later on the same Truth Social platform, he motioned toward “substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States.” When Trump threatened tariffs this past Spring, the White House shortly after walked back his remarks.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Though filmmaking is increasingly moving overseas at an alarming speed and to places like Hungary, which offer large tax credits, tariffs such as these would likely only encourage more decampment of production, as IndieWire previously reported. There remains the question of can Trump even do this? How do you tax something that exists as a digital file, or an idea, and is not a physical object or product, and how will it be enforced? 

There's also the even simpler question of… how do you shoot in the United States to depict a foreign country when your American-made movie isn't actually set here or calls for a sequence shot abroad?

Last time around, Trump's threat against the film industry didn't amount to much. Also earlier this year, Governor Newsom (whom Trump is referring to here) signed a $750 million tax credit for film and TV made in California to help keep productions in the United States. He also suggested to Trump collaborating on a national federal incentive that would offer similar benefits, though no formal proposal has occurred.

While out promoting her starring role in 'Kiss of the Spider Woman," the singer/actress weighed in on what's changed since the couple's split.

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have said very little in public about their 2024 divorce. But in a new sit-down interview with CBS Sunday Morning‘s Lee Cowan over the weekend to promote her starring role in the upcoming remake of Kiss of the Spider Woman, Lopez opened up about how her fairy tale second chance and then subsequent second split with Affleck was actually a good thing.

	In fact, Lopez told Cowan that her divorce from Affleck was “the best thing that ever happened to me.” Lopez praised Affleck's independent, artist-led studio, Artist Equity, for helping to finance the musical drama that is slated to open on Oct. 10, describing how, “I told him [Affleck] that this was the role I was born to play and I wanted to do it and he was like, ‘Okay,' and he helped make it happen.” The Accountant 2 actor is one of the executive producers on the project that is the second big screen adaptation of Argentine author Manuel Puig's 1976 novel about the intimate conversations between two Argentine prisoners.


	Lopez called the filming of the movie a “refuge” from thinking about the chaos of her personal life at the time. “It was like the best and the worst of times in a way because it was every moment on set and every moment I was doing this role… I was so happy and then it was, like, back home it was not great and it was just like, ‘How do I reconcile this?,'” she said.

	











	She then added, seemingly of the couple's divorce, “it was the best thing that ever happened to me, because it changed me… it didn't change me… it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow. Become more self-aware. I'm a different person now than I was last year I think.” 


	Lopez and Affleck first dated in 2002 and got engaged before breaking up and then reconnecting in 2021, getting married the following year and divorcing last year. Speaking about the divorce in March of this year, Affleck told GQ that Lopez was “somebody I have a lot of respect for,” noting that, “I get wanting to divine or explore the kind of differences in perspective that we have in terms of how a person feels comfortable approaching the line between public and private life. But I really hope that whatever you use doesn't suggest that I have any negativity or judgment or anything regarding that.”


	At the time, he promised the magazine that there was “no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue” about the couple's split. “It's just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.”

			By Dominic Patten, Ted Johnson 


	Letting loose with a barrage of social media postings Monday morning on subjects ranging from furniture production in North Carolina, the NYC mayoral race and the NFL, Donald Trump is back to attacking Gavin Newsom and promising big tariffs on overseas movies — really big tariffs.


	“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit,” Trump wrote Monday on his Truth Social platform. “Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

	











	If you are experiencing déjà vu reading those lines, yes that is almost exactly what the former Apprentice host said back in May.


			Watch on Deadline		







	Calling runaway production a “national security threat,” Trump's threats of a “100% tariff” earlier this year came after reports that one of his “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, Jon Voight, was a devising a plan to save the entertainment industry. That plan, as of today, has yet to bear fruit.


	While Trump hasn't signed any Executive Order on his latest proposed tariffs as of yet, their implication would bring down a heavy domestic burden on films like newly minted DGA boss Christopher Nolan‘s The Odyssey and pal/Ambassador to Hollywood Mel Gibson‘s upcoming Passion of the Christ sequel — both of which are being filmed outside the US of A.  

	











	The Motion Picture Association today had no comment on Trump's latest post. A White House spokesperson also did not immediately respond to a request to elaborate on the president's latest post.

	After Trump posted his threat in May, industry representatives grappled with how to respond. Within 24 hours, the White House cautioned that the tariffs would be under review by the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump himself said he would host a gathering of Hollywood reps, but that hasn't happened yet. “I'm not looking to hurt the industry,” Trump told reporters.


	About a week later, after tariff talk died down, the studios, unions, Voight and Sylvester Stallone, another of the president's special ambassadors, penned a letter to Trump outlining proposals for expanded production incentives. The letter did not mention tariffs. There have been hopes ever since that movie tariffs would be on the back burner.


	Among studios, there also have been concerns that Trump would try to impose restrictions on any filming overseas, as generous incentives in the UK, Canada and Australia long have lured Hollywood studio tentpole production. Major Hollywood studios have come to depend on those overseas incentives as a way to try to reduce production costs.

	According to the MPA, the industry generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world, with exports 3.1 times that of imports. The industry produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus.


	There also is the question of how tariffs would work on services, not actual goods. Trump's tariff authority overall is already facing a court challenge, with the Supreme Court reviewing it and hearing oral arguments in November. Movies actually are listed as an exception to presidential authority under the International Emergency Powers Act, which gives the president authority to address threats to national security and the economy.


	Trump's post also follows his attacks on Jimmy Kimmel and other late-night hosts. ABC pulled Kimmel's show following warnings from the president's FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, and announcements from major station groups that they would stop airing the late-night host's show. But Disney returned Kimmel to the air last week, with Nexstar and Sinclair following several days later. Trump blasted Kimmel's return, and threatened the network again.

	When Trump made his Hollywood tariff threat back in May, Kimmel quipped, “Next year, The White Lotus is gonna be set at a Hampton Inn.”

They're leaving because other countries not only have incentives, but they also have universal healthcare and therefore producers don't have to pay as much in fringe benefits.

If he really wants movies back, Medicare for All!

Great news!

just like everything else he does this will surely work swimmingly and exactly as intended

Better off pushing for a national film and tv tax incentive. We need more opportunity for Americans who can't just go to Canada or UK for filming because they have families, if they're even hired to in the first place. The big name actors and producers need to push for domestic production and put pressure on the studios. Executives will continue only to protect the bottom line and seek the cheapest option.

How about we just pay 100% if the cost of movies?  Will that help?

You need a stick with that carrot.

Trump's executive orders have usurped Congress and turned our system of checks and balances on its head. And if the Supreme Court allows him to continue, he will undo our system of government beyond repair. We are already halfway there.

International Investigations Editor


	J.K. Rowling has published her most fulsome comments yet on her rift with Harry Potter star Emma Watson.


	In a near-700-word post on X/Twitter, the Wizarding World author tore into Watson over her “ignorant” views on transgender rights and published the letter that shattered their relationship.


	Her intervention comes after Watson appeared on a podcast last week, during which the actress said she still has love for Rowling and is grateful for the creation of Hermione Granger, but is upset at the tone and nature of the debate around gender diversity.

	Rowling said Watson is entitled to her views, but voiced irritation that the Little Women star and Daniel Radcliffe “continue to assume the role of de facto spokespeople for the world I created.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Rowling said the breaking point in their relationship happened in March 2022, when Watson presented a prize at the BAFTA Film Awards and opened her remarks by saying: “I'm here for all of the witches.”


	Rowling said Watson's comment came at a time when “death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak” amid the dispute over trans rights.


	What was not known at the time was that Watson privately wrote to Rowling soon after the BAFTA event to express her concern for the author, according to Rowling.


	“Emma asked someone to pass on a handwritten note from her to me, which contained the single sentence ‘I'm so sorry for what you're going through' (she has my phone number),” Rowling said.

	











	“Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”


	Rowling claimed that Watson's views on transgender rights come from a place of ignorance because her wealth means she does not use “mixed sex” hospital wards or changing rooms, and security guards tail her when she is in public spaces.

I'm seeing quite a bit of comment about this, so I want to make a couple of points.I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created. The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should… https://t.co/c0pz19P7jc


	“Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is,” Rowling said. 


	“I wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous. I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women's rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.”


	She continued: “The greatest irony here is that, had Emma not decided in her most recent interview to declare that she loves and treasures me – a change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was – I might never have been this honest.”


	“Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother. Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public – but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.”

JK for prime minister.

Rowling speaks of ignorance yet sees trans-women as predators looking to sneak into changing rooms to assault women.

All of the cowardly comments come from anonymous writers.

JK Rowling demonstrates more courage in a week than most people do in a lifetime.

There's nothing courageous about making sure the most marginalised segment of the population remains so.

Yeah, but what has her past pain and trauma to do with trans people? She never explained that. Just an old woman shouting at the clouds.

I've never read any of J.K. Rowling's books and, after her tirades, I have no motivation to do so.  Her personal attacks on Emma Watson sound very familiar to this American.  When the “other side” doesn't agree with my viewpoint, they resort to personal ambushes.

When Snoop Dogg wraps up season 28 of “The Voice,” he won't have much downtime before his next big assignment with NBC. On September 28, 2025, the network revealed the legendary rapper will head to Cortina, Italy, to cover the 2026 Winter Olympics. 

Snoop's commentary was so popular during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, he will team up again with NBC Olympics host Mike Tirico, providing primetime viewers in the U.S. with “his wintry take on what's happening in northern Italy,” per NBC Sports. 

In a 15-second promo that aired during NBC's coverage of the NFL matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers, Snoop stood on a snowy mountaintop, turned to the TV audience and exclaimed, “Guess who's back!?” 

Later in the “Sunday Night Football” broadcast, Tirico and Cris Collinsworth watched an amusing video message from Snoop, taken as he rode in a limo decked out with twinkling lights. 

“Tirico, it's your boy, big Snoop Dogg,” he said. “Dynamic duo. Remember me? I'll be waiting on you in Milan, Cortina, so we can get this Winter Olympics poppin'. You know how we do it. In the meantime, in between time, hold it down till I get with you.”

Laughing, Tirico said, “I hear you! Alright, so Snoop is coming back to Italy” and then he turned to Collinsworth and asked, “How come you don't roll as cool as Snoop?”

Collinsworth smirked, “I wish I had one one-millionth of that (cool factor) — I would take that!” 

A post shared by The Olympic Games (@olympics)

NBC Sports' announcement about Snoop's addition to its team of Olympics correspondents said, “Similar to Paris, he'll explore the region's iconic landmarks and culture, attend Olympic competitions, and cheer alongside the athletes, their friends, and families.”

He'll bring back his “Snoop's Greatest Hits” segment, in which he joins Tirico on the primetime set “to riff on the day's biggest stories and most unforgettable moments with his unmistakable rhythm and style,” the announcement said. 

Viewers couldn't get enough of Snoop during the Paris Olympics, as he carried the Olympic flame, got to know and cheer on many of the American athletes, and attended some of the biggest events, including watching equestrian at the Palace of Versailles with his very proper pal, Martha Stewart. 

In a statement about the upcoming games, Snoop said, “The D O double G will be on the scene, and I am looking forward to celebrating with the athletes and their families. The Olympics is the biggest stage in the world and as everyone knows, I am about sports, bringing people together, and unifying while bringing the fun. I'll be bringing my puffy jackets, snow pants, goggles, skates (and will definitely be iced out).”

Right after Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Games will begin on February 6 at the most famous soccer stadium in Italy — the San Siro. The opening ceremony will air on NBC beginning at noon Eastern time that day, with primetime coverage kicking off at 8 p.m. Eastern time on both NBC and Peacock. 

Once the Opening Ceremony is over, athletes from around the world will compete in a record 116 medal events in 16 sports across 16 days, NBC said. 

But before Snoop focuses his energy on covering the Olympics, he has another job to do: coaching his season 28 team on “The Voice.” The next Blind Auditions air on September 29 and 30, with the season lasting through mid-December.

The veteran executive joined Comcast a decade ago as CFO, and was most recently president.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	In a major move atop one of the world's largest entertainment companies, Comcast has named Mike Cavanagh co-CEO, joining Brian Roberts atop his family's communications conglomerate.


	Cavanagh was most recently president of the company, and also effectively ran NBCUniversal, with all of the media company's executives reporting to him. He joined Comcast as CFO in 2015.




	Cavanagh's elevation will be effective Jan. 1, at which time he will also join the Comcast board of directors. Roberts will remain as chairman and co-CEO.

	“Since joining Comcast a decade ago, Mike has proven himself to be a trusted and collaborative leader,” said Roberts in a statement. “He is the ideal person to help lead Comcast as we manage the pivot we are making to drive growth across the company. Mike and I work seamlessly together, and I am thrilled to be partnering with him as Co-CEO and with the rest of our talented management team, for years to come.”

	











	“Comcast is a special company with exceptional businesses and an incredible team. It is an honor to work with Brian and the entire Comcast NBCUniversal leadership team during this exciting and transformative time in our industry,” added Cavanagh.


	The elevation of Cavanagh is unusual in that Comcast is a family-controlled company, having been founded by Brian Roberts' father Ralph Roberts more than 60 years ago. Brian succeeded his father atop the company in 1990. Brian Roberts' son Tucker Roberts is also an employee of Comcast, in its Spectator division, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers NHL team and the Wells Fargo Center.

	











	That said, it is not unusual for controlled by companies to elevate executives to run them day to day. Paramount and its predecessors, under both Sumner Redstone and Shari Redstone, relied on professional CEOs to run the companies, while the Murdoch family turns to Robert Thomson to run News Corp.


	And while the co-CEO structure is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Netflix, of course, has had a co-CEO since Ted Sarandos was elevated to lead the company alongside Reed Hastings.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: UK sales firm Architect has launched worldwide sales ahead of next month's AFM on Dogs of War, the latest creature horror set within writer-director Kiah Roache-Turner's wartime world.


Dogs of War, inspired by real events, plunges a crack squad of British commandos into a Nazi-infested forest, in the depths of winter on the Eastern Front during WWII. Tasked with delivering a vital secret weapon to their allies, the soldiers soon discover that what lurks in the forest is far more terrifying than their German foe. Forming an uneasy alliance with their sworn enemy, and joining forces with legendary sniper Lady Death, survival quickly becomes the only victory for the embattled soldiers. Above is first artwork from the project.

	Cast includes Daniel Webber (Billy The Kid), Bart Edwards (The Witcher), Robert Maaser (Ballerina), Jake Ryan (Wolf Creek), CJ Bloomfield (Mortal Kombat), Sam Parsonson (Beast of War) and Masha Basman as Lady Death. Principal photography is due to begin Q1, 2026, in Australia and Bulgaria.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Producers are Blake Northfield and Michelle Krumm for Bronte Studios (Beast of War). Bronte will also handle ANZ and North American sales. Executive producers include Todd Brown, and Calum Gray and Max Pirkis for Architect.


	The film's visual effects team will be led by Model Farm (The Equalizer 3), tasked with bringing to life Dogs' beasts, and Resin (MaXXXine).


	The launch comes ahead of the worldwide release, led by Well Go in the U.S. on 10th October, of Roache-Turner's Beast of War.


	Roache-Turner's regular HODs return, including cinematographer Mark Wareham (Boy Swallows Universe), costume designer Tracey Rose Sparke, and production designer Esther Rosenberg. Double Academy Award nominee David Hirschfelder (Elizabeth) is the composer.


	Roache-Turner said: “With Dogs Of War, I wanted to explore a different corner of WWII storytelling, bringing together real historical figures and high-concept genre elements. I have always been fascinated with crack sniper Lady Death and her story which has become such a mythical part of WWII folklore. I know that her desperate fight to protect her country more than 80 years ago has a contemporary resonance that today's audiences will respond to.”

	











	“Kiah Roache-Turner is a part of the Bronte DNA. He's an extraordinary filmmaker and we're thrilled to be teaming up once again” added Northfield and Krumm. “This film is a bold, adrenaline-filled fusion of war story, myth, and survival horror that we believe audiences worldwide will connect with.”


	Architect's Gray said: “We've keenly tracked Kiah's evolution as a filmmaker and are delighted to represent Dogs of War for him and Bronte Studios. Kiah's creature work, on both Sting and Beast of War, is hugely impressive and he is an immersive world-builder in the truest sense. A genre director who cares about connecting audiences to real, authentic characters…but then delights in picking them off one by one!”

George Clooney is an actor approaching the end of his tether in Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly.” That's because he is in fact playing an actor, who here is Hollywood-famous and adored, but with a career on the line after a bad run-in with a former acting school colleague (Billy Crudup) and a strained relationship with his daughter (Grace Edwards). The latest movie from the “Marriage Story” and “The Squid and the Whale” director opens in theaters from Netflix on November 14 before streaming December 5. Watch the trailer below.

“Jay Kelly,” which Baumbach co-wrote with Emily Mortimer, opens with a oner worthy of Robert Altman's “The Player,” inviting us onto a movie set as lights descend, cameras swirl in, and Jay (Clooney) is giving another performance that he feels he's phoning in. He's got a manager who's worried about Jay's career (played by Adam Sandler), a publicist who's spinning out (played by “Marriage Story” Oscar winner Laura Dern), and a bunch of other people whose whole lives are on the line because of him and dependent on him.

Jay decides to take all of them with him on a European trip in pursuit of his daughter, who's headed to a jazz festival, as the film turns into a screwball set piece on a train. Meanwhile, Jay is up for a career-acheivement award at a festival in Tuscany.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Clooney and Sandler are both expected to receive Oscar nominations for their performances, with the narrative of Sandler's overdueness merging with his deeply felt turn, and as a previous collaborator with Baumbach circa “The Meyerowitz Stories.” IndieWire reviewed the film out of Venice, where “Jay Kelly” didn't win any awards but energized conversation nonetheless. Baumbach's real-life partner, Greta Gerwig, co-stars in this film as Sandler's wife, who is saddled with childcare duties while Sandler's character is saddled with Jay Kelly-care duties abroad.

Also in the cast is Riley Keough as Jay's other daughter, this one estranged, who is shown in flashbacks and over phone calls as a woman who felt aggrieved and abandoned amid her father's success. Lars Eidinger, Louis Partridge, Patrick Wilson, Alba Rohrwacher (in a scene-stealing role), and Isla Fisher are also among the ensemble. Baumbach is on the hook for an Oscar win after four nominations, including in 2024 for Best Adapted Screenplay for “Barbie” with Gerwig. It's fascinating to see how his sensibility has broadened (and with a bigger budget) since the days of “Kicking and Screaming” and “The Squid and the Whale,” scrappy indies about neurotic New Yorkers.

Here's the trailer for “Jay Kelly,” which premieres at the New York Film Festival on Monday, September 29.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	The creator of AI actress Tilly Norwood has put out a statement following a fierce backlash in response to news over the weekend that talent agents were looking to sign the AI-generated character.


	Tilly Norwood is the creation of actress, comedian and technologist Eline Van der Velden, CEO of AI-focused production company Particle 6, who has also just launched AI talent studio Xicoia.


	“To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work – a piece of art. Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity,” Van der Velden wrote in a statement made available to Deadline and posted on social networks.

	“I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool, a new paintbrush. Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories. I'm an actor myself, and nothing – certainly not an AI character – can take away the craft or joy of human performance,” she continued.

	“Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role, or shaping a performance. It takes time, skill, and iteration to bring such a character to life. She represents experimentation, not substitution. Much of my work has always been about holding up a mirror to society through satire, and this is no different.”

	











	Van der Velden soft-launched Norwood earlier this year, with accounts on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, ahead of officially announcing the creation of Xicoia last week.

A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)


	The character has been slowly building a following, but the revelation in a panel at the film industry-focused Zurich Summit over the weekend that talent agents were circling Norwood with the intention of signing the character as a client has sparked fierce debate.


Melissa Barrera, Kiersey Clemons and Toni Collette are among a raft of actors to have expressed their displeasure at the development on the social networks, with some even suggesting a boycott of agencies that work with AI talent. 


	Van der Velden suggested in her statement that AI characters should not be compared directly with human actors.“AI characters should be judged as part of their own genre, on their own merits… Each form of art has its place, and each can be valued for what it uniquely brings,” she wrote.


	“I hope we can welcome AI as part of the wider artistic family; one more way to express ourselves, alongside theatre, film, painting, music, and countless others. When we celebrate all forms of creativity, we open doors to new voices, new stories, and new ways of connecting with each other.”

Eline van der Velden is either disingenuous or painfully naive. Just how exactly does she THINK this very human-looking “piece of digital art” will be used? How her technology will be built upon? Why does “it” need an agent? OF COURSE IT WILL REPLACE HUMAN BEINGS.

This “actress” wasn't designed to look like a puppet or a cartoon. She was designed to look human. The design was intentional. It looks exactly like a human female. Eline is seriously trying to gloss over the fact that this creation is in no way going to disrupt the industry. Why pay actors when there's AI? Actor is unhappy? Replace with them with AI. Union issues? AI will solve the problem. No matter what the creators say, several aspects of AI were designed to eliminate humans.

I was at the conference, and I must confess that, apart from the scariness of the newest tech, I was appalled by the lack understanding for the impact that this will have by the people developing (and benefitting) from them. The presentations we characterized by constant “optimism” and statements like “Everyone loves this!”, “It's going to be okay!” – all smiles, no self-criticism. Specifically during the Tilly Norwood presentation, Van der Velden actually said “Now we have given her a soul!” with a big smile. It was unsettling.

AI has been coming for jobs for years.  Actors aren't special.

You're right; they shouldn't take ANYONE's job.

Boycott the agencies…. sure. And I still can't over the fact that Bob Dylan uses the electric guitar.

Hilarious that you use one of our greatest original human artists to make your idiotic point. This isn't about being anti-tech.

She's either being naive or lying through her teeth

Kieran Culkin's biggest win may not be onstage but at home, as he and Jazz Charton get ready for their third child. Culkin's wish has come true. More than a year after the “Succession” star melted hearts at the 2024 Emmys by asking his wife, Jazz Charton, for more kids, the couple revealed they are now expecting their third child.

The pair stepped out in New York City on Sunday, September 28, for the opening night of “Waiting for Godot,” where Charton, 37, proudly debuted her baby bump. Culkin, 42, couldn't hide his joy, smiling as he lovingly placed his hand on her belly for photos.

Culkin and Charton are already parents to their daughter, Kinsey Sioux, 6, and son, Wilder Wolf, 4. The couple looked overjoyed as they celebrated the milestone together in New York.

The reveal comes after Culkin reminded his wife of her promise to expand their family earlier this year. 

At the Academy Awards in March 2025, where he won his first Oscar for “A Real Pain,” he gently joked from the stage about their ongoing “deal.”

Culkin first made headlines in January 2024 when he used his Emmys acceptance speech for “Succession” to ask Charton for more kids. Fighting back tears, he thanked his mother and then turned to his wife.

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

“[Jazz] said, ‘I will give you four [children] when you win an Oscar,'” Culkin told the audience at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. 

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

“No pressure. I love you. I'm really sorry I did this again,” he added with a laugh, looking directly at his wife, who smiled from her seat. 

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

“And let's get cracking on those kids. What do you say?”

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

Culkin later admitted he had been asking Charton about having more children for years. “Jazz said, ‘Maybe if you win the Emmy,'” he recalled. “I didn't bring it up for months, and then when I won the Globe, I said, ‘Do you remember what you said?' And she was like, ‘What? No. What did I say?'”

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

He joked that Charton spent the week before the Emmys “being nervous” as she remembered their playful promise. When asked if he might name the baby after one of his trophies, Culkin laughed: “I wouldn't name it Emmy, or whatever other cute little thing.”

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

Now, with another little one on the way, Culkin and Charton's story feels like a love letter built on humor, patience, and the joy of family.

The 2026 European "Deadbeat" dates start April 4 in Porto, Portugal.

Tame Impala takes another bite from Deadbeat, by unleashing “Dracula”.


	Kevin Parker's psychedelic rock project channels the Prince of Darkness on this funky, electro-pop nugget, the third, wide release from their forthcoming fifth studio album after the epic “End of Summer” and “Loser.”


	Another cut, understood to be “Ethereal Connection,” was gifted to the world as an untitled b-side for the 12-inch of “End of Summer”, which was sold on the Aussie artist's website with a limited number of copies.

	Parker actually gave us a dose of “Dracula” earlier this month, using a snippet as the soundbed for a social post revealing the Deadbeat tracklist.


Deadbeat is slated for a global release Oct. 17th, Tame Impala's first through the Sony Music machine, by way of a new deal with Columbia Records, ending a career-long relationship with Modular Recordings and Universal Music.


	Parker will assemble his touring band for a raft of newly-announced pan-European and U.K. concerts next year, starting April 4 at Super Bock Arena in Porto, Portugal and wrapping up May 13 at 3Arena in Dublin, Ireland. The Deadbeat Tour starts in North America, opening with a show Oct. 27, 2025 at Brooklyn's Barclays Center.


	As previously reported, Deadbeat is inspired by the “bush doof” culture of Parker's native Western Australia rave scene.

	











	A message on the pre-order page for the Deadbeat vinyl reckons “Parker sculpts a collection of wickedly potent club-psych explorations as a vehicle for some of his most direct, brain-wormy songwriting to date, recasting Tame Impala as a kind of future primitive rave act in the process.”


Deadbeat will arrive more than half a decade after The Slow Rush, from February 2020, a record that went to No. 1 on Australia's ARIA Chart, and earned career peak positions on the Billboard 200 and Official U.K. Albums Chart UK, both at No. 3. Its predecessor, 2015's Currents, topped the Australian chart and crashed the top 5 in the U.S. (at No. 4) and in the U.K. (No. 3), where Parker and his Tame Impala bandmates collected the Brit Award for best international group.

The 63rd New York Film Festival brought The Boss to Alice Tully Hall for the NYC premiere of “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” Jeremy Allen White transforms into iconic rocker Bruce Springsteen for the biopic, which is set in the early '80s during the recordings of “Born in the USA” and “Nebraska,” and co-stars Jeremy Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Marc Maron, Gaby Hoffmann, and Odessa Young.

We caught up with White on the red carpet, who will soon go into production for the sequel to “The Social Network,” titled “The Social Reckoning.” “I have read the script, but I can't tell you anything,” White told IndieWire. As for whether he has connected with writer and director Aaron Sorkin, White said, “Yeah, of course.” He will also reunite with Strong in this film. “I feel like every October Jeremy and I should do a movie together,” he joked.

Last week we asked Andrew Garfield, star of the first film, if there was any chance he would return for this one. “No, no,” Garfield told IndieWire. “Eduardo [Saverin] is in Singapore having a good time.” And is the actor excited to eventually see it? “Oh yeah.”

 










The film will open in theaters on October 9, 2026. And alongside White and Jeremy Strong as Mark Zuckerberg, Mikey Madison and Bill Burr will also star. Sorkin's original screenplay for the film tells the true story of how Frances Haugen (Madison), a young Facebook engineer, enlists the help of Jeff Horwitz (White), a Wall Street Journal reporter, to go on a dangerous journey that ends up blowing the whistle on the social network's most guarded secrets.

But Sunday night at NYFF was all about all things Springsteen. In David Ehrlich's review for “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” he writes that it “is a semi-desolate sketch of a biopic about a depressed 32-year-old man who channel surfs across a much better movie on TV one night in the fall of 1981. The man is Bruce Springsteen (a possessed Jeremy Allen White), the movie is Terrence Malick's “Badlands,” and its story of a Korean War vet who takes his 15-year-old girlfriend on a killing spree across the American heartland gives the wayward rock god a newfound sense of direction that just might save his life.”

It is the latest musical biopic starring an in-demand rising actor: “A Complete Unknown” landed a slew of Academy noms, including a Best Actor nod for Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan. The four-part Beatles biopic is also in the works, with Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, and Harris Dickinson as John Lennon.

 










20th Century Studios will release “Deliver Me from Nowhere” in theaters on Friday, October 24. Check out the trailer here.

Following the 2024 Paris Games, the rapper will reprise his role sharing his take on the competitions and exploring the culture and landmarks of the Milano Cortina region.

Managing Editor, Digital


NBCUniversal said Sunday night that Snoop Dogg will return to his gig helping cover the Olympics for NBC and Peacock.


	Following on the heels of the 2024 Summer Games in Paris, the rapper will head to Italy for the Milano Cortina Olympics. The Games kick off Feb. 6 with the Opening Ceremony. 




	According to NBCUniversal: “The global megastar will explore northern Italy, from the vibrant streets of Milan to the breathtaking Dolomites, providing his unique perspective to viewers during NBCUniversal's Winter Olympic primetime coverage.”

	Throughout the Winter Games, Snoop also will speak with NBC Olympics host Mike Tirico and share his take on what's going on in the Games as part of the “Snoop's Greatest Hits” segment. As he did previously, Snoop will also explore the culture and landmarks in the region, attend Olympics competitions and cheer alongside the athletes, their friends and families. 


	The announcement was made Sunday night during NBC Sports' Sunday Night Football coverage of the Green Bay Packers at Dallas Cowboys. 


	“I am excited to be back with my main man Mike Tirico for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina,” Snoop said in a statement. “The D O double G will be on the scene, and I am looking forward to celebrating with the athletes and their families. The Olympics is the biggest stage in the world and, as everyone knows, I'm all about sports, bringing people together, and unifying while bringing the fun. I'll be bringing my puffy jackets, snow pants, goggles, skates (and will definitely be iced out).” 

	











	Added NBC Olympics executive producer Molly Solomon: “Our Ambassador of Happiness returns! We can't wait to see how the kid from Long Beach handles the snow and ice of Italy at his first-ever Winter Olympics. In Paris, Snoop amplified the joy of the Summer Olympics: training with the athletes, watching nervously alongside their families, and cheering on their performances. He connected with viewers in a way we've never seen before and now he's primed to return as Team USA's most effusive supporter. Mike Tirico has the announcer blazer and microphone standing by.”


	During the Paris Games, Snoop carried the Olympic torch ahead of the Opening Ceremony, celebrated with athletes including gymnast Simone Biles, watched equestrian with longtime friend Martha Stewart and celebrated with gold-medalist swimmer Caeleb Dressel's wife Meghan and infant son August.


	Earlier this year, the NBCU's Entertainment & Studios division under Donna Langley announced an expansive deal with Snoop's Death Row Pictures across film, television and streaming. The company's upcoming slate of projects includes a Snoop Dogg biopic. Snoop also returned to NBC's The Voice this fall and will host Snoop Dogg's New Year's Eve celebration live from Miami on NBC and Peacock.

Before his death in August at the age of 87, actor Terence Stamp completed his scenes for a sequel to the 1994 film The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. Reprising his role as the transgender nightclub performer Bernadette, Stamp went through “grueling sessions” to complete the film, but had “the time of his life,” director Stephan Elliott told Deadline. Elliott says that “it took decades to find a plot.” It also took decades for Stamp to agree to make the film. For years, the actor “absolutely refused.” Still, Elliott and the original core cast, including Stamp, Hugo Weaving, and Guy Pearce, agreed to make the sequel “just before COVID.” But as other films began using CGI to bring actors back from the dead, Stamp worried that “a digital clone of himself” would get the part if they didn't start filming. “With the blessing of him and his family, Guy, Hugo, and the financiers, I decided to pre-shoot all the Bernadette scenes.”

“Terence wasn't getting any younger, and that's a fact he loved to shove down our throats almost every day,” Elliott said. “What Terence's character, Bernadette, was going to look like at 88, it took a lot of trial and error. So the clock clicked on, and then when the AI wars broke out, Terence was indignant that he didn't want a digital clone of himself playing Bernadette.” Once it comes time to complete the film, Elliott will utilize “CGI face replacement” technology. “I'm going to have to have an actor playing Terence Stamp. I mean, it is scary. We're all scared, of course.”

“He exists as Bernadette, and we've just got to work out how to make it work. And the question is, as I said earlier, does anyone want to see this film? And part of me thinks that they would. Now that he's put the effort in, and basically, he gave the last months of his life to this. I think people want to see it. It's a tough one. It's a real tough one.”

Monday, September 29, 2025 | News

By MICHAEL GINGOLD

The ghost hunters in this one are rumored to be cousins of the famed Ed and Lorraine Warren.

Black Mandala has released the trailer and poster for the Australian production NIGHTFALL: A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION. Directed by Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens, who also co-star, from a script by McEwen, who served as cinematographer, it also features Selwyn G. Stevens, Selwyn R. Stevens, Lorenzo Marte and Bill McEwen. The synopsis: “The year is 1988. Paranormal investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth have built their careers confronting the unexplained across Northern Europe. But when a desperate call draws them to the isolated home of Elizabeth Blair, they encounter a presence unlike anything they have ever faced. Over the course of seven days, this force unravels their sanity, twists their perception of reality, and threatens to destroy their bond.

“This is no ordinary haunting. This is Case 13.”

Over the weekend, the president of the United States posted an A.I.-generated video of himself making a major announcement. The post, which was made on TruthSocial, prompted an online furor among those familiar with conspiracy theories, because it promoted a particularly fringe one, even by the standards of an administration that has pushed anti-vaccine paranoia onto the public and advanced widespread falsehoods about a presidential election. The theory, which revolves around something called a “medbed,” is pulled from the strangest, most paranoid corners of the conspiracy world—not something one of the most powerful world leaders should be tapped into. Let's get into it.

So, what exactly happened?

At 10:19 p.m. Saturday, Donald Trump's account posted a 37-second video on TruthSocial. The video, which was A.I.-generated, was meant to look like a Fox News segment announcing the arrival of a medbed hospital—a kind of fantastical facility that uses advanced technology to more or less magically treat everything that ails the human body. Remarkably, the video included an A.I.-generated video of Trump himself talking; the promotion of this video from his account seemed, bafflingly, to make the announcement look legitimate. Trump has never posted anything like this before—an A.I.-generated version of him announcing news, giving life to a fringe conspiracy theory—on any of his accounts.

The next morning, the account deleted the post.

What did the video say?

It announced “the launch of America's first medbed hospital and a national medbed card for every citizen.” It showed B-roll shots of gleaming hospitals with futuristic-looking technology. An A.I.-generated version of Trump, speaking with low energy from the Resolute Desk, says, “Every American will soon receive their own medbed card. With it, you'll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals, led by the top doctors in the nation, equipped with the most advanced technology in the world. These facilities are safe, modern, and designed to return every citizen to full health and strength. This is the beginning of a new era in American health care.” An A.I.-generated version of Lara Trump, speaking as a Fox News host, then clarifies that there will first only be a limited number available and that registration details would be announced soon. Trump's post came without commentary—just the video.

OK, then. What is a medbed? 

To be abundantly clear, medbeds are not real. But per the conspiracy theory, a medbed is a kind of extremely advanced technology capable of healing the human body of literally everything, including natural aging. They're often thought of as pods of some kind. In the telling of the conspiracy theory, it may have an alien origin or a mystical origin or just be breathtakingly advanced science. A medbed has no limits to what it can do.

My goodness. Where does that come from?

Mostly, it comes from the QAnon world. For years, Q influencers have hyped it as a way to promise a kind of golden future on the other side of their revolution. Medbeds are one of the many exciting promises that were supposed to come after the Storm, the long-promised mass roundup of the evil cabal members at the center of the QAnon conspiracy theories. At times, medbeds have also been useful for connected conspiracy theories, explaining how some figure—an assassinated John F. Kennedy, for example—who should have died long ago is still alive.

In the theory, how is it this technology exists but has not been in use?

Well, as with so many conspiracy theories, there are variations. Some people believe that medbed technology is in development but still somewhat theoretical, or that it's already here but being suppressed by evil actors—sometimes the cabal, sometimes the pharmaceutical industry, keen on keeping people sick. Other variations have it that the elite have had access to medbeds for years and have hoarded the technology for themselves. But some in the community believe that under Trump, it's being quietly tested and rolled out for the public. Some QAnon influencers have even claimed to have firsthand or secondhand experience with medbeds.

Uh-oh. Does that mean there's a grift element?

Unfortunately, yes. As the Daily Beast has detailed, some companies sell devices they describe as medbeds, invoking some kind of New Age healing promises or other nonsense science. These devices are advertised as having the ability to do some pretty miraculous things, including heal terminal cancer. Some cost tens of thousands of dollars. There are also medbed clinics, where people can pay to receive quack treatments from people who claim to have working medbeds.

Oh no. 

Right. Medbed theories, at their core, are deeply depressing, because they offer false hope to people with pretty desperate situations. At their least harmful, they're a way of making healthy people excited about some kind of futuristic golden age without suffering. At their most harmful, they encourage desperate people with debilitating or life-threatening medical conditions to turn away from legitimate medical science and possibly spend fortunes on useless woo-woo junk.

Why on earth would Trump promote this?

It's unclear. Trump does often promote QAnon content, but it typically doesn't involve anything as fantastical as medbeds. It's possible it was someone else who had control of his account, but we don't know. Sometimes, Trump appears to enjoy what he sees as hyperbolic, semi-trolling claims of his greatness, as when he reposts videos of him as a muscular wrestler or some other heroic figure; it's possible he or someone with account access thought this was harmless fun. If so, he underestimated the level at which conspiracy theorists actually buy into these ideas. It's also possible that he wants to continue to string along his QAnon supporters, some of whom are growing restless, particularly after Trump failed to expose Democrats and other “deep state” actors with Epstein's “client list.”

Do we know where this video came from?

No, but it's certainly not a Trump original. It's unclear how Trump himself stumbled upon this video, but one journalist found it on a couple of scam Instagram pages. On TruthSocial, it was shared by at least one QAnon account before Trump posted it.

How has the right-wing-conspiracy-theory world responded to the video?

Most of the community seems aware that it's A.I. and aren't being fooled into thinking it's a genuine Fox News segment. (That being said: Many people—often older people—do have a hard time discerning what is real and what is not with A.I.-generated content, so it is very likely that some people will encounter this video on Facebook and take it at face value.) But, judging by posts on TruthSocial and activity from known QAnon accounts on X, some see the post as a message from Trump that medbeds are indeed on their way, possibly thanks to advances from A.I. technology. Others have other, convoluted theories about some play he's making related to A.I. Perhaps predictably, others have been using the post to boost their own scams, latching onto the moment to peddle their medbed products or even try to sell the medbed cards promised in the video.

So this post may actually cause sick people real harm?

It does seem very possible, yes. Trump deleted the video, limiting its harm to some degree, but some will choose to see the deletion not as a retraction but as part of the secret form of communication he uses for his most devoted followers. Trump has a huge audience, and he's a near-messianic figure for some of these people; even if the medbed post was meant as a joke—and nothing he has said or written has indicated it was—people will almost certainly latch onto this post as a coded message, telling them to turn away from the corrupt medical community and hold out for something better. For people facing life-threatening illnesses, such false hope can be deadly.

While some of these towns are truly vanished "ghosts," some remnants linger of others. Here is a look at ghost towns of Montana. 

A group of believers and some folks who are just plain curious met in Butte over the weekend to discuss all things paranormal.

The Bozeman Paranormal Society had its fourth annual Big Sky Paranormal Conference on Saturday at the Clark Chateau.

It featured nearly two dozen speaking guests, ghost-busters, classes, lectures a séance and workshops. Ghost tours were provided by the Spooks and Spirits Tours.

Among those attending was Justine LaBreche of Butte, who said it was something of a honeymoon present for her and her husband, Johnathan.

“It's interesting,” she said as she stood in front of the chateau. “I like the paranormal stuff and the spirits.”

She said she had just attended a discussion by Richard O'Connor of Clancy, with the Crop Circles Research Foundation Inc., on crop circles. 

“That was actually pretty cool,” she said.

She laughs when asked if people think she's a little wacky for believing in the paranormal.

“My mom and I, we both believe in spirits. My dad on the other hand, is kind of iffy on that kind of stuff,” she said. “I think they're kind of cool. I believe in that stuff.”

Her husband said he was enjoying the conference and said it was good to have it at this time of year as Halloween approaches and the vibe is spooky.

He thinks paranormal activity “could be possible,” adding he goes “back and forth” on how he feels.

Among those at the show was Kathleen Johns, a psychic medium who was selling her book “Echoes of the Afterlife.“

Kathleen Johns, a psychic medium from Bozeman, holds a copy of her book "Echoes from the Afterlife" at the Big Sky Paranormal Conference on Saturday.

She said she was going to speak later at the conference about “mediumship,” in which she delivers a message from someone on the afterlife to someone in the audience.

Johns, who is based in Bozeman, said the messages from beyond are great, and that she has found that people in the afterlife do not hold on to grudges.

She said she hoped to make “connections” on Saturday as the chateau, like many other buildings in Butte, is great for making connections with those not in this dimension.

“I think people are just curious, they just want to know,” Johns said, adding statistics show that 75% of Americans believe they have had some kind of encounter with a dead loved one.

“I don't generally run into skeptics in my work,” said Johns, whose grandmothers were also mediums.

Elies Adams, president and founder of Bozeman Paranormal Society, which has been around for about 13 years, said they like coming to Butte.

She said the conference was originally in Philipsburg, but they outgrew that location. She said they partnered with the Clark Chateau and moved it to Butte. Last year was the first year in town “and we had great success,” she said, adding nearly 60-70 people attended.

Bobby Brown of Baker talks Saturday at the Big Sky Paranormal Conference about investigating paranormal activity. 

“We decided it was very thriving in Butte and we decided to stay in Butte,” Adams said.

She said the conference could handle as many as 80 people.

“The more the merrier, but 80 is always a good number,” Adams said.

She said the growing numbers show that people have an interest in learning more about the paranormal, learning more about the unknown and learning more about passion of the paranormal.

When people ask her about paranormal activity in Montana she points out the state has a lot of history and a lot of ghost towns.

Adams said the event brings people together to find out more about the paranormal, but "we want to make it where other paranormal enthusiasts learn from each other.”

“A lot of people are like me, they want to know more about the paranormal and other aspects of the paranormal,” she said.

She realizes some people are skeptical.

“They want a scientific answer to everything,” Adams said. “It isn't a bad thing, it just tells you they are trying to get answers and trying to figure out what is going on.”

A respected congressman has claimed that advanced alien beings could be hiding out in 'five or six' underwater UFO bases right off the US coast.

Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee overseeing UFO reports, drew massive attention on social media after saying that he believed there were alien 'entities' currently living in deep-water areas on Earth.

The September 17 clip posted on X has already been viewed more than 1.9 million times.

During the sidewalk interview with Matt Laslo, reposted online by a UFO researcher who goes by the pseudonym Red Panda Koala, Burchett suggested that advanced alien beings or civilizations may have been hiding in Earth's oceans for generations.

He added that there have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft around five or six specific deep-sea areas, which he found significant given how little is known about the ocean compared to the moon's surface.

The congressman also noted that US Navy personnel have reported chasing these underwater craft that move at extraordinary speeds and far surpass the abilities of current US military technology.

Despite these claims, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these underwater craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of alien bases.

Skeptics have argued that the reliance on anecdotal reports from naval personnel and the lack of peer-reviewed scientific data casts significant doubt on the claims made during recent congressional hearings on UFO phenomena.

UFO researcher Dr Michael Salla said these bases are believed to be in a region of the Atlantic near the Bahamas

Following the explosive revelations, Dr Michael Salla, an author and researcher focused on extraterrestrial phenomena, revealed where it's believed these UFO bases may be, singling out a region of the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas.

He added that he's also spoken to credible whistleblowers, including senior military and executive branch officials, who confirm the existence of underwater bases and advanced craft.

Dr Salla highlighted that the US Navy operates a top-secret underwater facility he likened to Area 51 called AUTEC, which stands for the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center, right in this region of the Atlantic.

'Just to the right of it is Tongue of the Ocean, which is a very deep part of the ocean there in the Bahamas. It drops off immediately around 3,000 feet,' Salla said while appearing on the Redacted podcast on September 19.

'So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water. So, there have been a lot of UFO sightings in that area,' he revealed.

The UFO researcher noted that he had interviewed two eyewitnesses who claimed that they had visited these secret bases, including one who was a US Army whistleblower who used the pseudonym 'JP.'

The whistleblower claimed he was on a mission where he was taken by a Blackhawk helicopter to an ocean platform, then boarded a high-tech submarine crewed by tall, Nordic-looking extraterrestrials.

The submarine, capable of space travel, took him to an underwater city under a dome, resembling Dubai, with a large white pyramid. The mission involved retrieving an artifact, but no physical evidence of this mission has ever been produced.

Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri recently revealed video of a US military drone striking an orb-shaped UFO with a missile, which bounced off and did not stop the craft

Despite Burchett and Salla's lack of tangible evidence, there has been growing interest and testimony from credible sources, including military personnel at congressional hearings, suggesting that UFOs and extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth. 

A recent congressional hearing on September 9 featured new whistleblowers who shared their experiences with UFOs, including a video showing an orb-like object surviving a missile strike and splitting into four parts they kept flying.

'We have naval personnel telling me we have these sightings, these underwater craft they're chasing that go hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we got is something that does maybe a little under forty miles an hour,' Burchett said in the interview with Laslo.

'So I got a lot of questions about that stuff.'

According to an American congressman, there may be "five or six" undersea bases off the US coast where aliens could be hiding.

According to Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee, alien "entities" are already residing in Earth's deep waters. Social media was rocked by the assertions made by the member of the House Oversight Committee that deals with UFO cases.

Burchett made the suggestion that intelligent alien entities or civilizations might have been lurking beneath the water for "millennia" in a now-viral video that was uploaded to X on September 17.

“There have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft in about five or six specific deep sea areas,” Burchett stated in a sidewalk interview with Red Panda Koala, a UFO researcher and documentary maker.

"We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings ... of these underwater crafts that they're chasing," he said.



"[The underwater crafts] they're chasing are doing hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we've got is something that does maybe just a little bit under 40 miles an hour".

"I've got a lot of questions about that stuff," he added. He added in the brief video that humans know more about the moon's surface than the ocean floor.

Despite these assertions, the public has not been provided with any substantiating proof, such as artifacts or unobscured video of these crafts.

The claims are questioned, according to critics, because they are based on anecdotal stories from military personnel and lack peer-reviewed scientific data.

After Burchett's disclosures, Dr. Michael Salla said that one of the purported UFO bases was located in an area of the Atlantic Ocean close to the Bahamas.

The author and researcher who specializes in extraterrestrial phenomena claimed to have also had conversations with reliable informants who verified the existence of these undersea outposts, including high-ranking military and executive branch personnel.

According to Dr. Salla, AUTEC, a top-secret undersea facility run by the US Navy, is comparable to Area 51. That particular area of the Atlantic Ocean was home to the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Centre, or AUTEC.

"Just to the right of it is the Tongue of the Ocean, which is a very deep part of the ocean there in the Bahamas," he said on the Redacted podcast on September 19. It drops off immediately around 3000 ft."

"So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater crafts coming into and leaving the water."

Dr. Salla claimed to have spoken with two eyewitnesses, one of which was a US Army whistleblower who went by the moniker JP, who claimed to have visited these covert bases.

Researcher Dr Michael Salla even linked the claims to a secretive Atlantic facility near the Bahamas, dubbed “Area 51 underwater”

A sitting US Congressman has ignited widespread debate with claims that aliens might not be arriving from faraway galaxies but could already be inhabiting Earth's oceans.

Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee which reviews UFO reports, was filmed in a casual sidewalk interview with UFO researcher and documentary maker “Red Panda Koala” near the US Capitol. In the clip, posted to X on 17 September, Burchett proposed that alien entities may have established underwater bases in the Atlantic Ocean.

“What if these are entities that are here on this earth, that have been on this earth for who knows how long, and we think they're coming from way out. Maybe they did a millennia ago, but they're here, and they're in these deep water areas,” Burchett said.

The Congressman also claimed that US Navy personnel had reported multiple sightings of unidentified underwater craft at “five or six” specific ocean locations. According to him, these objects were capable of speeds far beyond the limits of existing American military technology. “We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings … of these underwater crafts that they're chasing,” he added.

Supporting these remarks, Dr Michael Salla, a researcher specialising in extraterrestrial phenomena, pointed to a region near the Bahamas where the US Navy operates the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center (AUTEC). The highly classified facility, often compared to an “Area 51 underwater,” lies close to the Tongue of the Ocean — a deep marine trench plunging around 3,000 feet.

“That's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water,” Salla explained during an appearance on the Redacted podcast on 19 September.

While there is no verified evidence of extraterrestrial underwater bases, Burchett's remarks have added to a growing list of UFO-related claims made by US officials in recent years. His comments have since gone viral, fuelling speculation and renewed debate about what lies hidden beneath the oceans.

In recent weeks, a photo allegedly depicting a massive, disc-shaped object hovering hundreds of feet above the ground has sparked widespread debate and intrigue. The image was presented by Luis “Lue” Elizondo, a former U.S. Army counterintelligence officer and prominent figure in the UFO community, during a House Oversight and Accountability Committee meeting. The event, hosted by the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Fund, aimed to bring attention to the ongoing mystery surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). However, what initially seemed like compelling evidence of extraterrestrial activity quickly unraveled into a case of mistaken identity, leading to significant scrutiny and skepticism.

The image in question was reportedly captured by a civilian pilot and showed a silver-hued, disc-shaped object that was estimated to be between 600 and 1,000 feet in diameter. This revelation was shared during a panel titled “Science, National Security & Innovation,” where multiple speakers, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, were in attendance. Elizondo, who has been vocal about the need for transparency regarding UAPs, used the photo to call for a full declassification and scientific analysis of such occurrences.

Despite the initial excitement surrounding the photo, Elizondo admitted he could not verify its authenticity, as he did not take the picture himself. According to him, the image was provided by a private pilot just hours before the forum. This admission, coupled with the lack of due diligence, cast doubt on the photo's credibility and highlighted the challenges faced by those seeking to uncover the truth about UAPs.

The photo quickly attracted attention on social media platforms, particularly Reddit, where users began to scrutinize its authenticity. In the r/UFOs community, known for its openness to conspiracy theories, a user named mattperkins86 traced the image back to a satellite photo of two adjacent circular fields near Colorado Springs. The darker circle appeared to be a shadow of the lighter circle, suggesting a natural, terrestrial explanation rather than an extraterrestrial one.

This discovery prompted ridicule and criticism of Elizondo's presentation, with some users expressing disbelief at what they perceived as a blatant oversight. UFO debunker Mick West further examined the image, finding inconsistencies in the shadows, which contradicted the claim of an object floating in the sky. These revelations underscored the importance of thorough investigation and verification in the pursuit of credible evidence.

In response to the backlash, Elizondo took to social media to clarify his position. He explained that the dimensions he quoted were based on the pilot's assessment and that the photo had not been vetted prior to the forum. Despite acknowledging the need for careful examination, Elizondo maintained that the incident highlighted the stigma and ridicule faced by those reporting UFO sightings.

Elizondo, who resigned from the Department of Defense in 2017 over bureaucratic challenges related to UAP investigations, has been a vocal advocate for the release of classified information on the subject. However, his efforts have often been marred by controversies and debunked claims, such as a previous incident involving a photo of a cloud mistaken for a "mothership" UFO. These missteps have raised questions about the credibility of his assertions and the broader movement for transparency.

The recent incident has implications for the broader movement advocating for disclosure of UAP-related information. While Elizondo's presentation was intended to advance the cause, the exposure of the photo's terrestrial origins has instead fueled skepticism and undermined the credibility of the UAP Disclosure Fund. Critics argue that such blunders detract from the legitimate scientific inquiry and risk further stigmatizing the subject.

Despite these setbacks, the fascination with UAPs continues to captivate both the public and the scientific community. The ongoing debate highlights the need for rigorous scientific investigation and open dialogue about the potential implications of unidentified aerial phenomena. As the search for answers persists, the challenge remains to balance skepticism with genuine inquiry, ensuring that future revelations are grounded in verifiable evidence.

The controversy surrounding the recent photo of a purported UFO serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in the pursuit of the unknown. While the image ultimately proved to be a case of mistaken identity, it underscores the enduring intrigue and debate surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena. As researchers and enthusiasts continue to explore this enigmatic subject, one question remains: How can we ensure that the quest for knowledge is driven by evidence and scientific integrity, rather than sensationalism and speculation?

Wow, I can't believe someone tried to pass off farm fields as a UFO! 🤣

Wow, this is hilarious! A farm field mistaken for a UFO? 😂

How could a former army officer make such a blunder? Seems like someone needs new glasses! 🕶️

Why wasn't the photo verified before it was presented to Congress? Seems like a major oversight.

Thank you for the detailed article. It's a good reminder to always verify our sources.

Elizondo should have done his homework. This kind of mistake doesn't help the credibility of UFO researchers.

Is there any chance that the farm fields are actually a secret alien base? 🤔

Thank you for the article! It's important to highlight these incidents to keep the conversation grounded in reality.

This is why scientific rigor is so important. Mistakes like this can damage credibility.

Did anyone else notice how quickly Reddit users debunked the photo? Props to the online sleuths! 🕵️‍♂️

So, was the photo really just a shadow? That's insane!

Honestly, how can anyone take this seriously when such errors are made? It's embarrassing.

I feel bad for Elizondo. He probably just got excited about the news.

This incident shows how crucial it is to have rigorous scientific investigation in these matters.
