                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House on Monday released a 20-point plan by President Donald Trump to end the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Trump was joined by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump said that Israel and other nations have accepted the outline he detailed. "If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages, immediately, but in no case more than 72 hours," Trump said. That provision would require all dead and living hostages to be released by Hamas. "I hope that we're going to have a deal for peace, and if Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they're the only one left," Trump said. The plan calls for Gaza to "be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. "Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release," the proposal said. "Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty," the proposal says. "Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries." "Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip." Netanyahu said, "I believe that today, we're taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East." "I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims," Netanyahu said. He warned that Israel would continue to prosecute the war if Hamas refuses Trump's plan. "If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then, then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself," Netanyahu said. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done." President Donald J. Trump'sComprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The S&P 500 inched up on Monday as Wall Street tried to regain its footing after a week in which the artificial intelligence trade lost some steam. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, however, falling 60 points, or 0.1%. AI chip darling Nvidia rose after skepticism around the AI trade put pressure on the broader stock market last week. Some traders even questioned whether there was enough energy to power an infrastructure plan between Nvidia and OpenAI. Meanwhile, shares of Electronic Arts jumped 4% after the video game company announced that it's going to be taken private in a $55 billion deal. U.S. M&A announced has surpassed $1 trillion year-to-date so far this year, up 29% from the same time a year ago, according to Goldman Sachs. U.S. stocks slipped last week as cracks appeared in a key pillar of the bull market rally â€” enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence buildout. The S&P 500 saw its worst weekly performance since Aug. 1. But Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays, believes that capital expenditures in the AI industry is still ultimately providing a boost to the market. "The AI capex story is showing no signs of slowdown. Moreover, other industries have also been benefiting from the tidal wave of AI infrastructure spend," he said in a note on Monday. "Concentration warrants some caution, but with AI gaining momentum as the focal point of global growth, S&P 500 should be well-positioned vs. peers given its Tech-heavy sector mix." All eyes are watching for a possible shutdown of the federal government as this week's funding deadline looms. The Labor Department is preparing to not release any data, including the September nonfarm payrolls report that was slated for release Friday, if a shutdown cannot be averted. Additionally, President Donald Trump told NBC News over the weekend that mass firings of federal workers could take place in the event of a shutdown. Government shutdowns have historically not impacted markets much, but sentiment could take a hit if any delays around the release of key economic data muddy the interest rate outlook for the Federal Reserve. Coal stocks are rising after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to keep power plants from closing. The Department of Energy will invest $625 million to support the struggling industry, with $350 million dedicated  to upgrade and recommission coal plants. And the Interior Department announced Monday it would make 13.1 milion acres of federal land available for the industry to lease. The coal inudstry has struggled as plants have been displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable energy in recent years. The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations. In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking "to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse." Alibaba shares gained about 4% on Monday, reaching a fresh 52-week high, after Morgan Stanley earlier lifted its price target on the Chinese cloud giant. After Alibaba's Apsara Conference 2025, analyst Gary Yu walked away more bullish on the company's cloud revenue business, upgrades in its AI models and accelerating international expansion. He maintained his overweight rating on the stock while lifting his price target by $40 to $200, which suggests 16.3% potential upside from its latest close. Yu pointed out that Alibaba management during the conference highlighted strong demand, saying the number of tokens it was processing has been doubling every 2 to 3 months. "BABA also announced new developments during the conference, such as 1) its flagship model Qwen3-Max (ranking top 3 globally) and Bailian agent platform upgrades, 2) partnership with NVIDIA on physical AI, and 3) accelerating overseas expansion with the first data centers launching in Brazil, France, Netherlands etc," Yu added. "We expect these initiatives, in addition to increased capex, to further accelerate cloud growth, and thus we raise our cloud growth estimates to 32% for F26 and 40% for F27 (vs. 30% for each of F26 and F27 previously." Novo Nordisk could be due for even more losses over the coming months, spurred by a pullback in the growth rate of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, according to Morgan Stanley. U.S. shares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant were under pressure in late morning trading Monday after analyst Thibault Boutherin downgraded the stock to underweight from equal-weight, saying that there's a "tough path ahead." "We expect downward revisions to 2026-27 consensus from slower US GLP-1 prescription growth and competitive pressure, and we see catalysts with downside risk over the next 6 months," Boutherin wrote on Monday. He added that a "lack of momentum" in U.S. prescriptions for Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus specifically makes him "cautious on the short-term growth profile." "As the window before semaglutide US/EU [Loss of Exclusivity] narrows, we expect valuation multiples to compress," Boutherin also said. Monday's losses put the stock's year-to-date fall at more than 35%. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Monday said the U.S. central bank faces challenges as it attempts to balance fighting stubborn inflation or protecting jobs. "On the inflation side right now, I continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective," Hammack told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." "We have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than four-and-a-half years and I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation both in the headline, in the core, and particularly, where I am worried about it, is I'm seeing it in the services," she added. Asked whether it is mistake for the Federal Reserve to be cutting interest rates given the economic backdrop, Hammack described it as "a challenging time for monetary policy," saying the U.S. central bank was facing pressure on both sides of its mandate. There was more good news for the housing market Monday as pending home sales unexpectedly rose in August. "Lower mortgage rates are enabling more homebuyers to go under contract. In the Midwest, low mortgage rates combined with high levels of affordability are attracting more buyers compared to other regions," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. "Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit!" "Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States." He previously said foreign productions could be a national security threat. Others like Disney and Netflix were last higher, however, after initially falling in premarket trading. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Stocks opened in the green on Monday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 98 points, or 0.2%. The firm upgraded global equities to overweight from neutral for the next three months, saying that "good earnings growth, Fed easing without a recession and global fiscal policy easing will continue to support equities." "Markets have continued with their 'risk on' shift supported by a Goldilocks backdrop based on optimistic growth expectations (boosted by AI) with dovish Fed expectations," said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman's head of asset allocation research in London, in a Monday note. "While Goldilocks regimes with strong growth and low inflation can last for a long time as seen since the 1990s, the current backdrop is different as weak labor market conditions drive Fed dovishness rather than anchored inflation. Mueller-Glissmann noted that investor sentiment and positioning has "not picked up materially" even with the risk-on performance in the market. "Unlike previous Goldilocks periods, positioning hasn't reached very bullish levels - flows into bonds, gold, and money markets stay strong while surveys remain somewhat bearish (only retail investors are more bullish)," he said. "We remain modestly pro-risk in our asset allocation," he added. To be sure, Mueller-Glissmann pointed out that the Goldilocks backdrop could meet a bearish scenario in one of three ways: firstly, a growth shock due to rising unemployment rate or AI disappointments; secondly, a rate shock from the Federal Reserve not delivering on more dovish expectations or from long-term yields signaling more risk of fiscal dominance; or thirdly, increasing pessimism about the prospects of the U.S. dollar. Electronic Arts will be taken private by PIF, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in an all-cash deal valued at $55 billion, the video game company said Monday. Oracle and Nvidia, two key stocks that traders are watching to assess the sustainability of artificial intelligence trade, gained 0.9% and 1.1% in the premarket on Monday, respectively. The moves come after shares of the two AI-names saw some selling pressure last week, which kicked off on Tuesday in the wake of Nvidia announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI a day prior. President Donald Trump warned Sunday of widespread layoffs if the federal government shuts down this week, telling NBC News that "we are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis." â€³[I'd] rather not do that," he told NBC News in an exclusive interview. Cannabis stocks ripped higher on Monday after President Donald Trump put up a video on Truth Social that endorsed the use of cannabinoids for seniors. The Nasdaq dropped 0.7%, also its weakest since early August. The Dow edged down 0.2%, its first loss in three weeks. Oracle shares fell more than 8% last week to lead the AI trade lower.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Monday announced Instant Checkout, a new feature that allows users to buy products through its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Instant Checkout initially supports single-item purchases directly from U.S. Etsy sellers, and it's available to U.S. ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Free users. OpenAI said more than one million Shopify merchants, including Skims and Glossier, are coming soon. Shares of Etsy closed up nearly 16% on Monday. OpenAI will take a fee from transactions that are completed through ChatGPT, which means Instant Checkout could become an important new revenue stream for the startup. The company declined to share specific details about how large the fees are since they are determined through confidential contracts with Etsy and Shopify. Instant Checkout is free to users and will not affect their prices, OpenAI said. "Our vision for ChatGPT â€” and a lot of the technology we create, but especially ChatGPT â€” is that it's not just providing you information, it is also helping you get things done in the real world," Michelle Fradin, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT commerce, told CNBC in an interview. OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months and introduced product recommendations as part of its search experience in April. Following the launch of Instant Checkout, if users are browsing and come across a product from an Etsy seller, for instance, they'll be able to purchase that item directly through ChatGPT instead of clicking out to the merchant's site. Instant Checkout is powered by OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol, which is the underlying technology that allows users to complete a transaction directly with a merchant through ChatGPT. OpenAI initially decided to use Agentic Commerce Protocol for e-commerce, but Fradin said the company thinks it could be used to facilitate other types of purchases or payments as well. OpenAI is open-sourcing the framework to help merchants build integrations more quickly, and so that developers can explore different use cases, she said. ChatGPT surpassed 700 million weekly active users in August, and Fradin said "a huge portion" of the questions people are asking are related to shopping and commerce in some capacity. The questions can be specific, such as asking for help finding a pair of black boots, or more broad, such as how to plan a birthday party for 12 kids. "What we wanted to do is make it even easier for users to complete their journey in ChatGPT, and for merchants and developers to convert those conversations into checkouts," Fradin said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic on Monday announced its latest artificial intelligence model: Claude Sonnet 4.5. The Amazon-backed startup, which is valued at $183 billion, is making Claude Sonnet 4.5 available to all users. Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the "best coding model in the world" according to industry benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities. "People are just noticing with this model, because it's just smarter and more of a colleague, that it's kind of fun to work with it when encountering problems and fixing them," Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's co-founder and chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview. The model generates higher-quality code, is better at identifying code improvements and can follow instructions more reliably, the company said. Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers in 2021, and the two companies have been fierce competitors ever since. The startup, which has seen its valuation swell to $500 billion, announced its latest model, GPT-5, in August. Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, said that Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be the default for users and that Anthropic recommends the model for "basically every use case." Paid subscribers can still choose to use Opus, and users with specific workflows can select an older generation of Sonnet if they aren't ready to migrate overnight, he said. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is smaller than Claude Opus 4.1 but smarter than it in "almost every single way," Krieger added. "We have found it, and our customers are finding it, very useful for real, actual work," Krieger said. Claude Sonnet 4.5 can run autonomously for 30 hours, and Anthropic said it's able to maintain focus on complex, multistep tasks throughout that period. Claude Opus 4, which the company launched in May, could run autonomously for just seven hours. Anthropic has also been able to improve the model's behavior through extensive safety training, the company said. It has reduced "concerning behaviors" like deception, power seeking and sycophancy, which is when a model tells a user what they want to hear. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is also more resistant to prompt injection attacks, where a model can get tricked into doing something malicious, like exposing sensitive data. "This is the biggest jump in safety that I think we've seen in the last probably year, year and a half," Kaplan said. Additional model launches are already on the horizon for Anthropic. Kaplan said better models are coming, including "very likely Opus." "But I think that we'll probably have one or two more releases before the end of the year."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday bashed New York City mayoral race front-runner Zohran Mamdani and renewed a threat to withhold federal funding from the Big Apple if the Democratic nominee wins. Trump's rant came a day after Mayor Eric Adams said that he is suspending his campaign after pressure from the president and others to quit the race to improve former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's chances of beating Mamdani in November. "Self proclaimed New York City Communist, Zohran Mamdani, who is running for Mayor, will prove to be one of the best things to ever happen to our great Republican Party," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "He is going to have problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great City," Trump wrote. "Remember, he needs the money from me, as President, in order to fulfill all of his FAKE Communist promises. He won't be getting any of it, so what's the point of voting for him?" Mamdani, who is a self-described democratic socialist â€” not a communist â€” bested Cuomo in the Democratic primary. The Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, has refused to drop out despite pressure from Trump and entreaties from others. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made films and slap "substantial Tariffs" on any country that does not make furniture in the United States. Trump's statements left key questions about the plans unanswered. In a pair of Truth Social posts, Trump claimed that California's movie-making business and North Carolina's furniture industry have been lost to other countries, and that the new duties on imports would reverse the slide. "Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby,'" Trump wrote. "Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States." Trump made an identical threat to tariff foreign-made films in May. But the White House quickly softened its tone and no action was taken. Separately on Monday, Trump wrote, "I will be imposing substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States." That statement raised the question of whether Trump would go beyond his vow last week to slap 50% duties on imports of kitchen and bathroom furnishings, as well as 30% tariffs on upholstered furniture. Those product-specific tariffs, which Trump also unveiled on social media, will take effect starting Wednesday, he wrote at the time. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about Trump's latest tariff threats. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

President Donald Trump is expected to meet with the top four congressional leaders today after abruptly canceling a meeting with Democratic leadership last week. Such platforms represent a small but growing segment of the artificial intelligence space. As CNBC's Jonathan Vanian reports, the group of women have become key in the fight against nonconsensual, AI-generated pornography. Read CNBC's full investigation into these sites here. Stocks ended last week in the red, a significant vibe shift after recently hitting all-time highs. The benchmark S&P 500 recorded its first losing week in four, while the small cap-focused Russell 2000 snapped a seven-week win streak. Despite last week's pullback, the stock market's recent gains have pushed a measure of public U.S. companies' total value against GDP to an all-time high of 217%. That's past levels indicating traders are "playing with fire," Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in 2001. Looking ahead, investors are gearing up for a slate of employment data due this week. Honeywell is testing out new alerts that would give pilots more reaction time in hopes of avoiding close-call situations at airports, which have dominated headlines in recent years. While serious airplane accidents are rare, a series of recent incidents have raised concern about how to best ensure safety in situations when every moment matters. Safety experts have pushed for innovation in cockpit alerts similar to what Honeywell is currently exploring. CNBC's Leslie Josephs rode in a Boeing 757 test plane for Honeywell's new alert system.

With the help of social media and reality TV, the "dirty soda" craze is expanding far beyond its Utah roots. "Dirty soda" â€” which refers to pop-based drinks with flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients mixed in â€” was first coined by the Utah-based chain Swig 15 years ago. Now, companies from PepsiCo to TGI Fridays are jumping on the trend as it gains traction nationwide, CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports. The numbers don't lie: 2.7% of U.S. eateries serve a carbonated soft drink that contains cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago, per Datassential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electronic Arts said Monday that it has agreed to be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in an all-cash deal worth $55 billion. Shareholders of the company will receive $210 per share in cash. The shares gained about 15% on Friday, closing at $193.35, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was nearing a deal to go private. The acquisition is the latest in a "recent gaming spree" by the Saudi PIF, which has been active in gaming since 2022, analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note early Monday. The fund's gaming arm, Savvy Gaming, has taken stakes in public video gaming publishers and bought ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely, the analysts noted, but the deal for EA is "the biggest such move to date by some distance." Affinity CEO Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, touted EA's "bold vision â€‹for â€‹the â€‹future" in a release announcing the deal. "I've admired their â€‹ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, â€‹and â€‹as â€‹someone â€‹who â€‹grew up playing their â€‹games â€‹- and now enjoys them with his â€‹kids - I couldn't be â€‹more â€‹excited about â€‹what's â€‹ahead," Kushner said in a statement. The group of companies is making a total $36 billion equity investment, with $20 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan, according to the release. JPMorgan was brought in a couple of weeks ago, people familiar with the deal told Faber. In a note to employees, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he is "excited to continue as CEO." "Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment," he wrote. "They are committed with conviction to EA â€“ they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together." There is a 45-day window to allow for other proposals, people familiar with the terms of the deal told Faber. Silver Lake, which is led by co-CEOs Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, is also one of the key investors in Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everyone is into watches these days, but which brand or style you gravitate toward could depend on your generation. The pre-owned luxury watch market got a boost earlier this year in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, as some watchmakers announced they were increasing retail prices partly due to import costs. The United States in August placed a 39% tariff on some goods from Switzerland, where many luxury watchmakers are based. Some resellers said they saw an increase in demand for secondhand watches in the wake of the tariffs and higher retail prices. The RealReal found that interest in secondhand luxury watches was not limited to any generation, but that each generation was searching for different brands and styles. The report found that boomers, ages 61 to 79, were most interested in long-standing watch brands. They purchased the Rolex Datejust, which is The RealReal's most popular watch for both men and women, more than any other generation. The Datejust is often considered an entry point into luxury watches. A reseller told Business Insider last month it was one of the top styles shoppers were purchasing pre-owned as they sought to avoid price hikes. Sales for legacy brands like Audemars Piguet, Chopard, and Chanel also doubled among baby boomers this year, The RealReal found. Gen X shoppers buy more watches than any other generation, according to the report. The most bought watches for Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, were Rolex Daytonas and Bvlgari Tubogas, for men and women, respectively. The Rolex Daytona is an iconic watch for the brand, always in demand and often cited as a good investment piece. The Patek Philippe Nautilus is another style that some consider a good investment, as it often sells for above its retail price Gen Z's interest in luxury watches has been credited with boosting the secondhand market, as the generation in general has been found to buy more pre-owned items than its older counterparts.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2022, I was standing at the crossroads between quant trading and tech. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm as a quantitative strategist for the summer. I could accelerate my career quickly, whereas in AI, it was much messier and unpredictable because we're still in the first stages of the AI revolution, and the industry is changing every day. After interviewing in both fields, I chose an AI startup. The hours are long, the base pay is lower than I would've gotten in quant, and it's been an intense year, but I don't regret my decision, and here's why. When I moved to the US to get my master's in computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I already knew that I wanted to pursue courses in quant, AI, and computer science. Both AI and quant roles require core computer science algorithm skills. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like 10 years down the line. When I entered my master's, I leaned heavily toward quant because the initial compensation there is almost always higher, but these conversations helped me see beyond the starting paycheck. People I knew who were two or three years out of school were working at some of the best quant firms in New York and Chicago. As an extrovert who thrives in a collaborative environment, that felt restrictive. The exit options in quant felt more constrained, too. It's typical to grow into roles like senior quant researcher, strategy owner, or portfolio manager. Those are excellent paths, but they're tied to very specialized expertise. I applied for both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I started leaning toward working in AI because it's redesigning the capacity of human productivity from the ground up, which is so exciting. In AI, especially at startups, the day-to-day challenges are broader, less predictable, and that mix of liberty and freshness appealed to me much more. I could imagine paths into founding, venture capital, and leadership roles in Big Tech, and I could start honing all of those skills early in my career. AI ultimately left my options more open with what I could do later in life, and working at a startup provided the collaborative environment I wanted. In AI startups, the base salary still provides a good standard of living, but the real upside comes from equity. The opportunity to learn is everywhere in an AI startup. Part of the appeal is the chance to learn how to make a company successful rather than optimizing within a well-established machine. I'm learning to hire, adapt, lead the product direction, and sell. These skills make me more than just an engineer. I'm trying to jump on customer meetings, understand their needs, contribute to hiring decisions, and shadow and learn from the founders where I can. If we don't launch the features and tools in a new research paper within a few days, we've basically lost that one to the competition, so it can be stressful, but it also keeps me sharp. In AI, I'm in an uncomfortable seat every few months trying to keep up with the market pace, but I'm happy with my decision. If I were in the decision stage again, one thing I'd consider is the difficulty of moving from quant to AI or vice versa later in you're career. Having spent one year in AI, I'd feel a little uncomfortable jumping into quant. Quant narrows your skills down to a specialty very quickly, and if you want to expand outside that, it's hard. But I have some friends from undergrad who did a year or two in quant and then later moved over. Do you have an AI career journey story to share?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this month, an OpenAI engineer announced he was hiring for a new team. OpenAI is building a new team called "Applied Evals," which helps businesses refine complex processes using AI, like refund requests or migrating code. This new team reflects a shift across the AI talent landscape.. The tech industry has long hired technical minds to build and train AI models, and now people with specific subject-matter expertise are being tapped to make these models useful, AI founders and executives told Business Insider. Anadkat's post said his team will comprise engineers with "real, deep, lived expertise." He plans to bring in specialists from different fields, such as software engineers for code-related tasks and, perhaps eventually, humanities-focused workers if there is more demand for tasks like writing. Anadkat told Business Insider the team will work with companies using OpenAI's developer platform to help them create their own evals for specific use cases. "Now the shift that, at least I hope we'll see, is how research and product can work very closely together and collaborate on some of this to basically define what good looks like." Anadkat's team is starting small and will grow with demand. Applied Evals will work with OpenAI's sales and business teams to determine what projects to prioritize based on customer need and where its models are underperforming, Anadkat said. The AI industry has long had engineers work on evals within companies, large and small, though they mostly evaluated if the AI model was working well or not. Over time, they've shifted from "thumbs up or down" to being more focused on context and asking the right questions, said Michael Jacobides, a strategy and entrepreneurship professor at London Business School. "There's probably a hundred people in the world that could lead a team to build these frontier models," said Justin Farris, vice president of product at Read AI, "but there's so much work that needs to be done to take those and make them useful." AI is increasingly moving from generic to specific use cases, said Tanmai Gopal, CEO of PromptQL. "For a lot of applied use cases, the ways of working out what good is and what bad is start to become quite nuanced," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jensen Huang said President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee could put the American dream further out of reach for immigrants, marking a more critical take on the visa change after he initially offered positive feedback on it last week. He agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the fee also tilts the playing field toward Big Tech firms that can more easily afford to sponsor visas, leaving startups at a disadvantage. Huang said the US must remain mindful of how such policies affect global talent flows, saying they could make "foreign students uncomfortable." He pointed to Chinese researchers as one example, separating the ideas of the US competing with China as a country from American policies that affect Chinese people. Talent inflow is an early indicator of the country's future success. The Taiwan-born CEO has often described his own journey as a product of the American dream. America's immigration system is in a "difficult situation," and Trump has limited time to improve it, Huang said. At the end of fiscal year 2025, the company had 1,519 H-1B filings and 36,000 employees worldwide, a Business Insider analysis found in March. The White House told Business Insider earlier this month that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas. Trump has said the visa changes are meant to encourage employers to hire US workers instead of international ones. The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last week that he was "glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making." And we represent the American dream," Huang said during an interview with CNBC. "Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future." "We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during the joint interview.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks presented its laid-off baristas with a severance package less than a week after it announced sweeping layoffs and store closures. On Thursday, the Seattle-based coffee giant said it would close about 1% of its stores across North America, which amounts to more than 100 locations. Its flagship Capitol Hill Roastery in Seattle was one of the outlets that will shutter. Starbucks sent documents of its severance package to laid-off retail employees on Sunday, which Business Insider has viewed. According to a Starbucks document titled "Severance Summary," laid-off baristas and shift supervisors would be entitled to 60 and 84 hours of pay, respectively. Starbucks baristas earn about $15 to $22 an hour, depending on the store's location in the US, per job listings on Starbucks' careers website. CafÃ© attendants â€” entry-level service staff in charge of keeping the cafÃ©s clean and organized â€” would be entitled to 30 hours of pay after being laid off, per the document. States do not typically require companies to provide hourly workers with severance. Laid-off retail staff can also claim a lump sum payment equal to three months' worth of their health insurance premiums. Affected staff have healthcare coverage for three months from the end of October, which is in line with the Department of Labor's COBRA Act. The document said employees would get 45 days to decide whether to sign a release agreement in exchange for their severance pay. In a separate document titled "Partner Separation FAQ â€” U.S. Retail Stores," seen by Business Insider, Starbucks said that employees in nine states would be paid for their accrued vacation hours. In an SEC filing dated September 23, Starbucks said it expected to incur a $1 billion bill from its store closures. It said about $150 million of that cost would be linked to employee separation benefits. The store closures are part of Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" turnaround plan, which aims to revitalize the chain after several quarters of declining sales. Starbucks' stock price is down more than 14% in the past year.</p>

When Starbucks announced on Thursday that it would shutter more than 100 coffeehouse locations across North America, the company didn't publicly specify which stores would close.

So, Business Insider has begun creating a list compiled from accounts from affected in-store staff members, reporter visits, and verification through the Starbucks "store locator" feature. While incomplete, it begins to show which neighborhoods and states are most affected by the closures.

When reached for comment by Business Insider, Starbucks pointed to a message it's sending its customers about the store closures: "We know this isn't just any store to customers. It's their coffeehouse, a place woven into their daily rhythm, where memories were made, and where meaningful connections with our partners grew over the years. We're deeply grateful for the communities that have been built."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Reiji Kobayashi, a Japanese startup founder based in Bengaluru, India. The essay has been edited for length and clarity. I dropped out of university before my final year to launch a web marketing business in Japan. I sold the company, started learning about the real estate business, and launched a share house company. After leaving that company, I moved to Kenya in 2018, where I had traveled in college, to launch a startup. My first year in Kenya was a nightmare. I had built and sold several businesses at that point, but still struggled to raise money from external investors for a new startup. I built a microfinancing platform for people who wanted to buy cars because Kenya seemed to have a lack of credit options. After working on Hakki for six years, where we financed over 3,500 cars, growth in Kenya seemed limited. Africa has about 1.4 billion people, but they are scattered. India, with its 1.3 billion people and rapidly growing economy, felt like the next best target market for us. There are a lot of things I like about living in Bengaluru. For one, I like to wear casual T-shirts instead of suits, and Bengaluru's weather is stable and comfortable. The people are kind, have lots of energy, and are positive about the future, which I really like. I've also made some friends I watch cricket matches with, accompanied by alcohol and chicken, which was surprising to me because I always thought most Indians are vegetarian. I don't like the spicy food and haven't gotten used to it, so I spend most of my time eating noodles I bring over from Japan. Indians have the attitude to try or take up something challenging without needing accurate projections of what will happen. India also feels like a much friendlier market for startups because people are open to trying new products and don't get suspicious of new companies that may be offering a cheaper solution than existing brands. We've hired four Indian employees, and I'm surprised to say that they work more than me. They come into the office at 9 a.m. and easily work until 9 p.m. Even our company driver is up early in the morning and available with the car until midnight, which I was not expecting. I may have to move out of India in a few months to expand the company in other countries like Thailand. But I'm commited to growing the startup here and having a big presence in India. Are you a foreign founder or VC who moved to India in the last few years?</p>
