                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Ariana Grande slammed Donald Trump's administration on her Instagram Stories Sunday (Sept. 29), a spokesperson for the president fired back at the Grammy-winning singer. In a statement provided to TMZ, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai responded to Grande's post, attempting to refute the points she shared about the Trump administration's actions during the president's second term. “Save your tears, Ariana, because President Trump's actions ended Joe Biden's inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investments,” Desai claimed. “He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande's concert-going fans. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission did announce a lawsuit aimed at Live Nation and Ticketmaster for misleading consumers about resale ticket prices. In her original post, Grande reshared a recent infographic from activist Matt Bernstein, who questioned Trump voters over the current state of political affairs. now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?” the post asked. “Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised it would, or are you still waiting?” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Irwin is quickly becoming a fan favorite on “Dancing With the Stars,” and part of his charm is his excitement while performing. For the show's first two dances, Irwin could be seen singing along to the music while dancing, and now he's sharing why. He also explained that his pro partner Witney Carson tells him to “feel that music” while he's on the ballroom floor. “For me, singing it, getting into it, and just giving every fiber of my being to this experience, that's why I'm here,” the wildlife photographer explained. For the show's premiere episode, Irwin and Carson performed a fun jive number set to “Born to Be Wild” and earned an impressive score from the judges. Irwin and Carson followed up that performance with a tango to “Move Your Feet” which also garnered plenty of praise. Hough used the Aussie slang term “crikey” when giving his positive feedback, which Irwin appreciated. It sums up everything, and if my dance was crikey-level, mate, I'm happy.” As far as the pressure to stay on top, Carson is doing all she can to bring out the best in Irwin. “The hardest part is just trying to better yourself, right? Carson has also taken on the job of playing matchmaker for Irwin, who is currently single. On September 27, Irwin shared a hilarious Instagram post of him and Carson getting ready to look at his likely overflowing DMs. Go here and check the boxnext to EntertainmentNow</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's smash film KPop Demon Hunters, tops the Billboard Hot 100 for a seventh week — becoming one of the 10 longest-leading No. 1s from a movie over the chart's 67-year history. Meanwhile, “Golden” ties TLC's “Waterfalls,” from 1995, as the second-longest-leading Hot 100 hits ever by all-women groups. The only such song with more time at No. 1: Destiny's Child's “Independent Women Part I” dominated for 11 weeks in 2000-01. “Golden” is also the sole longest-leading hit by an animated group in the Hot 100's archives, while KPop Demon Hunters became the first soundtrack to spin off four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s. Browse the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 33.8 million official streams (up 5% week-over-week), 33.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 11%) — new weekly highs for the song in each metric — and 8,000 sold (up 2%) in the United States Sept. 19-25. The track adds a 10th week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; jumps 16-9 on Radio Songs; and rebounds 3-2 after two weeks atop Digital Song Sales. Since Streaming Songs began in 2013, “Golden” is just the 20th of 170 total No. Plus, it's the first Radio Songs top 10 ever by an animated act, having outperformed cartoon tunes that hit the chart's top 40 by Gorillaz in the 2000s and (hopefully he doesn't have a cow if learning this) Bart Simpson in the ‘90s. 1s from movies all-time, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start. Here's a look at the longest-leading movie songs in the Hot 100's history (as defined by qualifications used for Billboard's Top 75 Movie Songs of All Time recap, which is based on weekly performance on the chart): Plus, “Golden” ties TLC's “Waterfalls” for the second-longest Hot 100 command by an all-female group (of three or more members). Here's a recap of the 10 longest-ruling songs by that measure: Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. Also from KPop Demon Hunters, Saja Boys' “Soda Pop” buzzes 5-3 for a new Hot 100 high and their “Your Idol” rises 6-5, after reaching No. (Both are sung by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.) Thanks to “Golden” and those songs, three tracks from the film chart in the Hot 100's top five simultaneously for a fourth week. (The only other soundtrack to generate three concurrent top five hits, Saturday Night Fever, did so for two weeks in 1978.) Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, is steady at No. It adds a 19th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become last year's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” climbs 10-8 on the Hot 100; Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” descends 7-9, after hitting No. Through Sept. 30, subscribers to Billboard's Chart Beat newsletter, emailed each Friday, can unlock access to Billboard's weekly and historical charts, artist chart histories and all Chart Beat stories simply by visiting the newly redesigned Billboard.com through any story link in the newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a new Simpsons movie, and it's coming out on July 23, 2027. The second Simpsons movie to hit the screen will fill a date for Disney that's simultaneously being vacated by an untitled Marvel movie. It was at a time when TV properties, even if they were still on television, could excel on the big screen at the same time. The series is co-created by James L. Brooks, Matt Groening and Sam Simon. The working class family of Homer, Marge and kids Bart, Maggie and Lisa, who live in the town of Springfield surrounded by a ton of kooky personalities, first made their premiere as a short on the 1987 sketch comedy series The Tracy Ullman Show, which was also co-created by Brooks. The Simpsons features the voices of Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Yeardly Smith (Lisa), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) as well as Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer in multiple roles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Critics (candidly, including myself) were impressed by the performances and filmmaking but left bewildered by first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett's muddled screenplay that tackles post-#MeToo society, privilege, and power in the academic world. Reviews were, generally speaking, mixed to negative, with a few standouts. So how did his topical drama, about a Yale philosophy professor (Julia Roberts) tied up in her Black student's (Ayo Edebiri) sexual assault accusation against a white colleague (Andrew Garfield), play at NYFF? It opened the highbrow two-week program, overseen by artistic director and former film critic Dennis Lim and managing director Matt Bolish, last Friday at Alice Tully Hall. Past Guadagnino films to play NYFF include “Queer,” “Bones and All,” and “Call Me by Your Name” — all of which scored better receptions throughout their run than “After the Hunt” has so far. But can new word-of-mouth — not necessarily good, but at the very least new — boost “After the Hunt” at this point? It runs long at just shy of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and one journalist I talked to said that, while the film wasn't necessarily boring, its length led them to feel the pains of an incoherent narrative. There are plot elements that don't always add up or seem easily ascribed to recognizable human behavior (such as why Julia Roberts' character Alma keeps a picture that's extremely revealing about a past secret taped under her bathroom vanity, rather than in the pied-à-terre she maintains as a private office). So we're curious to hear from screenwriter Garrett about what changed and why. The film, however, has its admirers, including another critic who appreciated what they felt was its astute look at how trauma is processed differently across generations. There, journalists (both in the room and joining via Zoom) asked engaging questions that Roberts and her cast and creative team praised — she was not having it at the Venice Film Festival, particularly when the first question asked at that Italian presser was, “Why does this movie undermine feminism?” Roberts is a Globes darling, nominated most recently in 2023 for TV's similarly on-topic “Gaslit” as Martha Mitchell. She's won three times from 10 nominations, and the capaciousness of having two categories (Musical/Comedy and Drama) for Best Actress gives her room to play in. Amazon MGM Studios opens “After the Hunt” in select theaters on Friday, October 10 followed by a nationwide release on Friday, October 17. How it plays for non-trade critics will factor into its eventual theatrical business. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Emma Watson offered a thoughtful and nuanced account of her relationship with J.K. Rowling in light of the Harry Potter creator's anti-trans stances, Rowling responded by lambasting the actress as “ignorant.” Rowling, however, dismissed Watson's assessment in a lengthy retort on X. “Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is,” the author said. The author did acknowledge she's “not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created.” And even said that, for a while, she retained a “certain protectiveness” for Watson and her co-star Daniel Radcliffe (who'd also spoken out against Rowling's views). Rowling also revealed that, around the same time, Watson allegedly asked someone to pass on a handwritten note, which Rowling said read, “I'm so sorry for what you're going through.” Rowling dismissed this as well, suggesting Watson “thought a one line of expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.” As for what prompted such a fierce response this time, Rowling blamed Watson, “The greatest irony here is that, had Emma not decided in her most recent interview to declare that she loves and treasures me — a change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was — I might never have been this honest. Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother. What Is the ‘Med Bed' Conspiracy Theory Trump Promoted? ‘The Exact Performer We Need': Internet Erupts Over Bad Bunny's 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show Watson, for her part, said she remained open to reconnecting with Rowling, especially because “a conversation was never made possible.” And she stressed her own desire to be careful about her comments regarding Rowling going forward, likely out of concern for what the author had endured in the past.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bad Bunny is at the peak of his powers. The Puerto Rican artist just finished a sold-out, month-long residency at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, and on Sunday DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS became the first album of 2025 to surpass 7 billion streams on Spotify. Prominent Republicans are already fuming at the possibility that Bad Bunny's halftime performance in February will feature critiques of President Donald Trump and his targeting of immigrant communities, and that it may require them to turn on English subtitles. “There was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. Conspiracy theorist and right-wing commentator Jack Posobiec suggested that the selection was a conspiracy orchestrated by former President Barack Obama. “Barack Obama's best friend Jay-Z runs the Super Bowl selection process through his company Roc Nation which has an exclusive contract with the NFL. Some of the criticism was a little more stylistic. The right wing account “Redheaded Libertarian” described Bad Bunny as “demonic Marxist who has been granted the largest stage with the greatest audience in the middle of a Christian revival.” Podcaster Trish Regan complained that Bad Bunny's music contained Spanish-language slang and explicit language, even halftime show performers typically edit out any explicit content. The account “End Wokeness,” which boasts almost 4 million followers on X, suggested that a Harper's Bazaar photoshoot in which Bad Bunny wore a skirt should have weighed against his selection for the performance. Just don't ask for subtitles.” Right wing filmmaker Robby Starbuck complained that “the guy literally says he isn't touring the US because of Trump's ICE raids and just released a video mocking President Trump.” What Is the ‘Med Bed' Conspiracy Theory Trump Promoted? Bad Bunny to Headline 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show ‘The Exact Performer We Need': Internet Erupts Over Bad Bunny's 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show “Also, most of his songs aren't even in English,” Starbuck griped. “This is not a pick designed to unite football fans or let people just enjoy the show. It was a pick designed to divide fans and no doubt Bad Bunny will find some way to push a woke message.” Starbuck also suggested that team owners were either “in on this idiocy” or “just culturally that disconnected from reality.” Starbuck and the nativist right are speaking to a mirror. The reality is that public approval of the Trump administration's handling of immigration enforcement continues to slip as the Department of Homeland Security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement continue to use authoritarian tactics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In reality, she just said the following in an interview on the On Purpose With Jay Shetty podcast last week: “I think it's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with.” Rowling clearly does not share this wish, nor does she seem to have retained a lot of love for the actor she's known since Watson was 11. “I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created,” Rowling opened, before reiterating that “Emma Watson and her co-stars have every right to embrace gender identity ideology.” What she takes issue with, however, is the fact that “Emma and Dan in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right – nay, obligation – to critique me and my views in public.” Watson has arguably done this very little. That speech, which again, did not mention Rowling by name, was apparently a “turning point” for the author, but it “had a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself.” “Emma asked someone to pass on a handwritten note from her to me, which contained the single sentence ‘I'm so sorry for what you're going through' (she has my phone number),” Rowling's post continued. “This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety. Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.” Rowling then went on to imply that Watson is “ignorant of how ignorant she is” because “like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life.” To Rowling, that life Watson hasn't experienced includes “mixed sex public hospital ward[s]” and the possibility of “sharing a prison cell with a male rapist who's identified into the women's prison.” These are all things Rowling understands, of course, because she “wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen” and “lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous.” Glen Powell's Chad Powers literally and figuratively drops the ball By Meredith Hobbs Coons September 26, 2025 | 9:00am Toni Collette steals the show in Netflix's creepy miniseries Wayward By Saloni Gajjar September 25, 2025 | 7:00am JEZEBELOh Nothing, Just the President Posting AI Videos About QAnon Conspiracy Theories ENDLESS MODEAnanta Wants to Be Marvel's Spider-Man, And Just About Any Other Game Too</p>

Quine, “Gavagai” is a nonsense word meant to convey the indeterminacy of translation. Some assumptions are more plausible than others, but the fact remains that no two people can ever perfectly understand one another, let alone two people from completely different backgrounds. Related Stories ‘Chad Powers' Review: Glen Powell's Fitfully Funny Hulu Comedy Can't Decide Who It Wants to Be Trump Renews Tariff Threat on Films Made Outside the U.S., Still Doesn't Make Sense So goes the premise of Ulrich Köhler's “Gavagai,” a patchy but provocative thought exercise of a movie that fittingly neglects to explain its title (hence the preamble here), which is all the better to let viewers arrive at their own interpretations. Loosely inspired by his experience shooting “Sleeping Sickness” (2011) in Cameroon, when the well-intentioned German director — sweating under the pressures of running a set in a distant country with a local crew — wound up “reproducing the neocolonial hierarchies and behavioral patterns that we address in the film” (as he puts it in the “Gavagai” press notes), this stilted meta-drama allows Köhler to more deliberately trace the inexorable tensions that underpin today's globalized film trade. Here, he recasts himself as a French director named Caroline (an extremely Claire Denis-coded Nathalie Richard), who seems a bit too headstrong and oblivious to appreciate why her Senegalese reimagining of Euripides' tragedy — in which the titular child-murderer is an entitled white immigrant who's reduced to refugee status after her native Black husband betrays her — could potentially reaffirm the same hierarchies of privilege that it hopes to address. Caroline is a headstrong liberal who's doing what she can to push civilization forward according to her understanding of what that means, but flipping the script on racist stereotypes may not be the most effective way of dismantling them, especially when the process of doing so finds the director stranding her extras in the hot Dakar sun for 10 hours at a time while denying them access to the craft services tent. To its credit, Köhler's film is much less interested in wallowing in such archly observed (and self-exculpatory) ironies than it is in articulating how difficult they are to avoid in a world where nothing is a rabbit, and everything is “gavagai.” While there are several wry moments of movie-within-a-movie satire toward the start (Medea comes to shore on the bow of a speedboat, and Caroline is horrified to see that Medea's dead children have been outfitted with life jackets for safety reasons), “Gavagai” soon keys into a wide variety of overlapping — and sometimes conflicting — realities about the process of exhuming an ancient text, most of which are more sober in tone. The director is unaware that Maja — who FaceTimes her husband and daughter back home in Berlin during her breaks on set — is secretly having an affair with the film's Jason (“Sleeping Sickness” star Jean-Christophe Folly, wonderful as Nourou, a character who's always taking uncertain shape of his burden), which hardly rises to the crime of homicide, but suggests that Caroline doesn't perceive her cast as clearly as she might think. She's certainly oblivious to the anxieties that have confronted her leading man by virtue of his accepting a major role in this splashy European production. She's blithely unaware that Nourou's Senegalese identity is so threatened that he can only justify his part in the film by insisting that it's a masterpiece, even if the frequent clips we see of the finished product make it look like a hodgepodge of all the worst ideas that Julie Taymor never had (jet skis can only add so much to a 2,500-year-old play). A hostile security guard treats Nourou with undue suspicion, questioning his right to enter the lobby of the Intercontinental; the actor is understandably irked by the encounter, but it's Maja who sees it as a chance to perform her identity as a good white lady, and perhaps to openly defend the lover she's otherwise ashamed to keep as a secret. This too is based on a real incident, as a bigoted staffer — maybe or maybe not at the Intercontinental — confronted Folly after the premiere of “Sleeping Sickness.” This is also a chance for Köhler to redress his reaction to the event, and to examine how his reflexive transformation into a white savior may have been more for his own benefit than anything else. Like so much of “Gavagai,” the encounter is filmed from a remove (and in this case additionally obfuscated by a glass door), which doesn't approximate some kind of objectivity so much as it heightens our attention to the nature of perspective. Is the act of extrapolating that experience into a feature-length film meant to absolve Köhler of his embarrassment over how it played out in real life, or — by reducing a long-time collaborator to his role in a particularly dehumanizing moment — is the director further confining Folly to the limits of his neoliberal gaze? These would be easy questions for Köhler to address on his own behalf, but “Gavagai” complicates them well beyond the yes/no binary (even if the film is weakened by its quasi-cartoonish portrait of Caroline's blinkered privilege, which prevents her from displaying any trace of self-awareness). The last act of this movie becomes a ticking clock thriller set during the “Medea” premiere, by which point “Gavagai” has already refracted the dynamic between Köhler and his subject into an inescapable house of mirrors that's less interesting for its reflections than it is for the parallax of considering them from different angles. Those angles can be too obtuse in the moments when they aren't unavoidably acute, and I can't help but wish that Köhler had jettisoned the unhelpful “Medea” flashbacks in favor of a more explicitly self-reflexive approach that elevated the “Sleeping Sickness” of it all from backstory to text. Still, “Gavagai” remains worthwhile because it constantly adds new dimensions to the question of who this — or any — film is “for” in a world where even the simplest gestures can be lost in translation, and every viewer is left to arrive at their own meaning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article features plot details of One Battle After Another. There isn't much backstory for Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn), the scowling face of white nationalism in Paul Thomas Anderson‘s One Battle After Another. When French 75 revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) gets the drop on him, she already knows his whole deal. She instinctively understands that she can force the overseer of the Los Angeles migrant detention center into having an erection while taken captive, adding insult to injury as her team frees his prisoners. The irony serves the film‘s underlying view of white supremacy: To claim racial purity is to reject your humanity. At its core, One Battle After Another is about one racist's inability to accept his sexual desires and his decision to make that everyone else's problem. His coercive relationship with Perfidia, which allows him to act on his feelings, ends with an attempt to subjugate her further. After Perfidia flees from Lockjaw—a more desperate flight than she'd previously taken from her lover Bob (Leonardo DiCaprio) and their daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti)—the colonel gives his life meaning by applying to the Christmas Adventurers Club, the white nationalist organization apparently at the center of American power. However, if they were to find out that Willa was actually Lockjaw's child, it would disqualify him from membership. To be accepted, he must hide his transgression by any means necessary. Part of that reveals itself in Bob, née Ghetto Pat, who successfully goes into paranoid hiding after Perfidia's betrayal. But white supremacy has long had its eye on Bob, whether he knows it or not. Because of this power imbalance, it's the only time in the film that Lockjaw can express what he actually wants to someone. What Lockjaw doesn't get is that he's just another mark, a pawn, for the Christmas Adventurers Club. They will never accept him, despite his willingness to terrorize non-white communities. Before he can even give Willa a DNA test, the shadowy admissions council plans on tossing him into the incinerator. That he debases himself further for their approval—surviving their assassination attempt in order to spend a few minutes in the crappy corner office of his dreams before the nerve gas begins to flood in—shows how little solidarity exists at the North Pole. Like so many neo-Nazi foot soldiers, white nationalist mouthpieces, and violent ICE agents, Lockjaw is a means to an end for someone in power. But on the other side of this Battle, resistance springs eternal. For pretty much everyone other than Bob, white supremacy isn't something they can hide from. They've been living around it for so long that resisting its threats has become a casual and instinctive response. When a radio operator is snatched from his post, a pair of neighborhood kids jump on the mic to air an emergency transmission. When Bob needs to escape from Lockjaw's military forces, invading the sanctuary city of Baktan Cross, his daughter's martial arts sensei, Sergio St. Carlos (Benicio del Toro), cracks a Modelo and lends him a hand, despite having a “Harriet Tubman thing going on” with the rest of the town's immigrant community. Anderson does all this without making it explicit to the contemporary political landscape. No messages scrawled on bullets or warnings about online radicalization. Rather, he structures the fight against white supremacy like it's Terminator 2: Two men in pursuit of the next generation, a necessary and humanistic battle for the future that we're all already fighting.
