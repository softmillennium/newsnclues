Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have identified several design flaws in Tile's location trackers that could be exploited to stalk the device's owner. Wired reported that Georgia Tech's Akshaya Kumar, Anna Raymaker, and Michael Specter discovered problems affecting both individual Tile devices and the methods those devices use to communicate with infrastructure managed by Tile owner Life360. The trio "found that each tag broadcasts an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that can be picked up by other Bluetooth devices or radio-frequency antennas in a tag's vicinity to track the movements of the tag and its owner," Wired reported. The New York Times reported in 2019 that retailers were using Bluetooth beacons to track people's movement through their stores, for example, and so-called "sniffers" are readily available to individuals. Those methods of collecting data about location trackers would also circumvent the safeguards Tile added to its devices in 2023. Those protections, which the company introduced after several high-profile incidents of location trackers being used by thieves, stalkers, and other criminals, apply only to the misuse of its products. Those safeguards are supposed to make it more difficult for a Tile owner to stalk someone by slipping a tracker into their bag, for example. However, those same safeguards cannot determine if the Tile is communicating with a seemingly innocuous Bluetooth device while it's still in the owner's possession.

The problem, of course, is the difference between claiming not to currently have this capability and ensuring that this capability won't be developed later. Encrypting this data wouldn't just protect it now; it would also ensure that historical data can't be misused by Life360, cybercriminals, or even government agencies in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The billionaire Tesla CEO was responding to a tweet from an account called @iamyesyouareno, which has about half a million followers. All of that is explained in the ADL's page for Christian Identity. It's not clear if Musk understands the difference between Christian Identity as a specific extremist ideology and small-i Christian identity. The far-right billionaire often operates in bad faith while discussing politics on X, the platform he owns, but he also simply isn't that smart when it comes to many topics. Replies for that tweet have been turned off, perhaps because X has itself become an extremist platform filled with anti-semitic hate since Musk bought the site in late 2022. The ADL also sent Gizmodo a link to a tweet from CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who wrote that the idea ADL is anti-Christian is “offensive and wrong.” “We are blessed to work with many Christian brothers and sisters in the shared fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate. In contrast, the Christian Identity movement is an antisemitic, racist, and unambiguously poisonous ideology. Its values bear no resemblance to those of any mainstream Christian denomination.” Replies to Greenblatt's tweets have also been turned off, and the ADL didn't specifically address Elon Musk in its tweets. Other high-profile accounts also commented on the ADL's page about Christian Identity recently, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida. Luna accused the ADL of “intentionally creating a targeted hate campaign against Christians.” Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who has taken credit for getting several people fired from the Trump administration for supposedly being disloyal, replied to Musk that the ADL should be “designated as a domestic terror org.” Musk made several changes after he bought Twitter and changed the name to X, including a big shift in what kind of content gets moderated. The CEO has welcomed back white supremacists who had previously been banned from Twitter, including Nick Fuentes, who's been able to get a lot more attention ever since he was allowed to again have a mainstream platform. Fuentes has a long history of praising Adolf Hitler and spreading anti-semitic hate. “Almost daily, he spreads heinous conspiracy theories like the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, promotes neo-Nazis, and agrees with tweets claiming Jews push hate against white people.” Musk has previously defended his salutes as something he did to express the idea that he was sending out love to the audience. “It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,” the ADL tweeted on Jan. 20. “In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath. “The ADL needs to change this now,” Musk tweeted on Sept. 27. X didn't respond to an email on Monday seeking comment about Musk's tweet calling the ADL a hate group. Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back. One exec who recently left praised Elon Musk while noting that there was "daylight between our worldviews." The Tesla billionaire may be on his way to being human history's wealthiest human, but he is not above religious judgement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Anthropic launched a new frontier model called Claude Sonnet 4.5, which it claims to offer state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks. The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models. In the last year, Anthropic's AI models have emerged as a favorite among developers and enterprises, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Recently, OpenAI's GPT-5 has challenged Anthropic's dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks. Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance on benchmarks alone. Hershey says he's seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure. In a statement shared with TechCrunch Cursor CEO Micheal Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models. The company says it has also improved Claude's susceptibility to prompt injection attacks. The company says this is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, and can be used to help developers build their own agents. Anthropic is also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude” for Max subscribers, which shows the AI model generating software on the fly.

It looks like Intel is getting ready to launch a new branch of Granite Rapids processors designed to compete directly with AMD's Ryzen 9000WX series parts based on Zen 5. But being based on the Granite Rapids architecture, it is very likely that this chip is a much higher clocking offshoot of the Xeon 6787P, which also boasts 86 cores across two compute tiles, but peaks at a 3.8GHz peak turbo clock speed. This SKU might not even be the flagship part since Granite Rapids can scale up to 128 cores. Rumors have been circulating about a workstation-offshoot of Granite Rapids for months. In February, we covered a Granite Rapids-W leak, allegedly stating these new workstation parts will come with up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, feature eight-channel DDR5 memory support, and support Intel's outgoing W890 chipset. Granite Rapids is Intel's latest generation server architecture, and one of its most competitive yet, featuring core count parity with AMD EYPC processors for the first time since 2017, when it launched in the Xeon 6900P series late last year. Similar to Arrow Lake-S, Granite Rapids is based on a tile-based architecture, featuring several I/O and compute tiles to reach previously untouchable core counts. Intel hasn't had a serious CPU lineup that has been able to compete with AMD's Threadripper WX-series parts over the past two generations. Its outgoing W-3500 Sapphire Rapids Refresh chips only scale up to 60 cores, while AMD has had 96-core trims since the Threadripper 7000WX series and 64-core chips dating all the way back to the Threadripper 3000 series. With Granite Rapids-WS, Intel has its first opportunity in years to approach or outpace AMD on core count in the HEDT/workstation segment, similar to the server market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a somewhat surprising team up, Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund are joining together to buy video game giant Electronic Arts for a staggering $55 billion. EA announced today that it has agreed to be taken private by a group of investors that includes Kushner's private-equity firm Affinity Partners, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and investment firm Silver Lake. The group plans to pay stockholders $210 a share in cash. Founded in 1982 by ex-Apple exec Trip Hawkins, EA has built mega-series like sports franchises FIFA and Madden NFL, as well as the iconic life simulator The Sims. “Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment. They are committed with conviction to EA – they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together,” Wilson wrote. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund already owns nearly 10% of EA, a stake it's rolling into the new deal. The fund has been on a gaming buying spree in recent years. In 2021, it launched Savvy Games Group to manage a planned $38 billion push into the industry. Savvy has since acquired companies like Scopely, the studio behind Monopoly Go. These moves could hint at where the new owners want to steer EA. By taking the company private, they can make big changes without considering quarterly market reactions. The deal is slated to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027, at which point EA would be removed from public trading. Shareholders and regulators still need to sign off, though regulatory approval may be easier in a business-friendly Trump administration—especially with the president's son-in-law among the investors. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead,” Kushner said in a press release. 'Star Wars Outlaws' on Switch 2 shows us how power doesn't matter nearly as much as a developer who puts in the time. Maybe mouse controls would have made the Wii more usable. Arc System Works and CD Projekt Red producers say Lucy is 'an excellent fit' for 'Guilty Gear Strive' season four.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI coding tools are redefining software development and speeding up code generation. While AI coding tools can streamline some software tasks, they are also adding new ones — such as more manual review, coordination tasks, and maintenance challenges, according to Actual AI. Some studies show how AI tools are actually slowing down developers and creating more vulnerabilities. The company's agent can automate recurring management duties: triaging issues, generating sprint summaries, routing code reviews, and enforcing architectural consistency. It's also designed to help reduce reliance on senior engineers and up-skill junior developers. “We're building an engineering manager agent that actually brings guardrails to AI-powered software development,” said CEO John Kennedy. “Every engineering manager now manages teams comprised of dozens of developers along with just as many AI agents,” Kenneth Auchenberg, partner at AlleyCorp, said in a statement. The six-person company is led by Kennedy, a tech industry vet who worked at Amazon Web Services and Acquia. Actual AI competes with a number of developer productivity tools from startups and large corporations. Atlassian this month announced plans to acquire developer productivity insight platform DX for $1 billion. Kennedy said his startup goes beyond traditional dashboards that provide metrics and instead acts on behalf of managers — automating the work itself rather than just reporting on it. “A lot of engineering managers want to be player-coaches,” Kennedy said. They want to be helping with big, hard technical decisions. They don't want to be doing mechanical admin work.” Actual AI was previously spotlighted in GeekWire's Startup Radar series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Browser maker and Google Search alternative Brave announced on Monday that it's adding a new feature to its AI-powered search suite, Ask Brave, to provide detailed answers on a topic based on the query. The company said that people are getting more than 15 million answers every day. The search engine will automatically recognize what kind of query you are asking and give a response accordingly. “While AI Answers give our users quick summaries, Ask Brave provides longer answers, follow-ups, and a chat mode enhanced with Deep Research, and most importantly, contextually relevant enrichments such as videos, news articles, products, businesses, shopping, and more – in the right place, at the right time,” said Chief of Search at Brave, Josep M. Pujol, in a statement. We anticipate that Ask Brave will generate millions more daily AI-powered answers with this powerful combination of search and chat, and look forward to deploying more useful AI-powered search tools for our users.” The format of the answer you get out of Ask Brave is more akin to a report format that you get out of ChatGPT or Perplexity, which includes links, videos, and image carousels. Brave said that it is using the company's own API to ground search results for accuracy, along with deep research for certain queries. AI-powered Q&A is now creeping into various search experiences. Google has expanded its AI mode to multiple languages, including a global rollout for Spanish last week. Brave's feature is similar but comes with a privacy claim that the company encrypts users' chats and deletes them after 24 hours of inactivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Much as non-developers can describe what types of programs to build, and let AI do the coding, Microsoft is bringing the concept to documents, spreadsheets and presentations with new features for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The company describes “vibe working” as collaboration between people and AI agents inside its productivity apps. Instead of giving a one-time response, the updated Copilot AI tools generate, test, and refine content while users steer the direction, more like a dialogue. That's part of a broader move by Microsoft to expand beyond models from OpenAI. The company is racing to add AI features against Google, which is steadily adding generative AI to its Workspace apps, along with Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic, Canva, Notion, and many others developing agent-style AI systems for business, productivity, and design applications. Desktop versions and PowerPoint support will be released later. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Corvus One Autonomous Inventory Management System provides warehouse managers with a bird's-eye view, enabling them to oversee up-to-the-minute reports on product locations and resolve discrepancies in real time. Jackie Wu, co-founder and CEO of Corvus Robotics, developed his autonomous drone idea by observing warehousing operations in 10 countries. He found inventory scattered on massive pallets and sky-high metal shelves. Wu noticed that they all have one thing in common: people with barcode scanners or paper and pencils climb around product stockpiles, updating printouts from previous inventory logs. He teamed up with co-founder Mohammed Kabir to develop the Boston-based company that currently has 20 employees. Research and development took several years for the company to reach its first real deployments in 2022. Corvus' fully autonomous micro aerial vehicles need no human operators to fly them. They silently zip around corridors, vertically scale elevated storage shelves, record barcoded data, and deliver all surveillance results to the computer system. Corvus uses computer vision, AI, and aerial robotics, which it designed from scratch to deploy a solution that tracks inventory. Wu claims it is 10 times faster and much cheaper than other warehousing management platforms. Only recently has the technology for autonomous indoor navigation matured enough to support practical commercial use. Early UAV deployments primarily focused on outdoor applications, including filmmaking, agriculture, and infrastructure inspection. Around 2010, innovative companies started combining logistics expertise with industrial drone technology to overcome the challenges of autonomous indoor flight. Stumbling points included unreliable GPS signals indoors, poor computer vision due to inadequate interior lighting, and the nascent state of AI sensor technology. Industry reports show a steep upward trajectory for the adoption of inventory drones. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%. They're doing things that there's really not a lot of value to an individual, but to the business it's priceless,” said Bill Monk, vice president of distribution for GNC. Drones count pallets and cases, batch scan multiple SKUs in the same location, and provide a volumetric analysis of the slot's storage capacity, he explained. According to Wu, “robotics” and “autonomous drones” are not terms for the same technology. Drones operate in 3D space, whereas robots move on the ground. Flying an autonomous drone in 3D requires more complexity, but many of the sensors and computer vision functionality are broadly interchangeable, he clarified. This is not like a nine-month setup where you have to install all this infrastructure, fix it to the ceiling, and put up racking and other support items. Corvus provides software and drone maintenance as needed, offering warehouse personnel a hands-off solution. So customers can have us program inventory flyovers within a single or multiple time frames. “Being able to run inventory checks 24/7 without operator assistance has been a game changer,” said Austin Feagins, senior director of transformation and solution design at Staci Americas. His company provides third-party logistics and warehousing services for businesses. “The lights-out capability in the Corvus One system allows our inventory teams to correct discrepancies off-shift and pre-shift before production starts each day, limiting fulfillment delays and production impacts,” he explained. Feagins wants the 24/7 inventory surveillance option installed in his company's five U.S. buildings this year. Corvus' R&D stages evolved into a continuous cycle of refining the technology to make it work. “There's not been one magic unlock that just solved everything. However, much of the platform evolved around in-house coding, particularly in how they integrate software and hardware to achieve their unique autonomy in drone flying. According to Wu, Corvus' approach has developed a unique robot-as-a-service subscription-based model that is unmatched by competitors' solutions. The cost factor is a key part of that success. “The interesting thing is that the customer makes ROI in month one because it is cheaper than what they are currently paying to do this job,” he concluded. His main areas of focus are enterprise IT, Linux and open-source technologies. He is an esteemed reviewer of Linux distros and other open-source software.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. And the end of this stopwatch is nothing you want. Fresh coffee is all about aroma and intensity—the delicate notes of toffee or nectarine that make each bean distinct. It tastes instead acrid and flabby, like a cup of wet cardboard. I am also constantly testing out coffee to find the Best Coffee Subscriptions, and to give each brand a fair shake, I always drink those fresh in the optimal tasting window. Which means the rando special bag I bought for myself last Thursday often has to wait. And sometimes I can't manage to brew all my coffee within a few weeks of its roast date. Or is freezing just a new way to mess up coffee beans—by introducing frosty moisture, or tainting it with the smell of the frozen chicken and peas in your icebox? The answer, according to coffee experts and chemists alike, is that you're probably better off freezing coffee than letting warm air do its slow work. But this is only true if you do it correctly. What's more, frozen beans can in fact lead to better flavor on light-roast coffee in particular, according to at least one study—because it helps you get more consistent coffee grounds and therefore better flavor. Here's a quick rundown on how to keep your coffee fresh without also ruining it, and why frozen coffee sometimes trumps fresh. Believe it or not, there's such a thing as coffee that's too fresh. You probably don't want to brew coffee the day after it's roasted. But, alas, if you just leave the coffee in its bag, on the counter, it may start to go stale beginning a couple weeks later. You know that nice smell of fresh coffee beans? Those lovely aromatic compounds are exiting the beans, and dispersing into the air: That's why you can smell them. At the same time, oxygen is sneaking in to do its grim work, turning your beans to stale rust. Depending how it's stored, coffee can begin to degrade anywhere from two weeks to a month after roast date (i.e., the optimal window may just be a week or two for each bag). You can extend this a bit by storing the coffee in an airtight container. One that I particularly like (and that we recommend in our Gifts for Coffee Lovers guide) is the vacuum-sealed Fellow Atmos. Rather, do so just before the optimal flavor window. The science on the staying power of frozen coffee is somewhat thin, notes Christopher Hendon, a materials chemist at University of Oregon, whose research into coffee extraction and flavor has earned him the nickname “Dr. “My inclination is to think that if you freeze something, all the kinetic processes slow down a lot, and so you'd expect it to stale less quickly,” Hendon told WIRED in August. Those processes will still continue, albeit more slowly. But if your coffee is already starting to go stale? It'll still get a little more stale in the freezer. There are a few main principles to properly freezing your beans. The key to avoiding moisture and bad aromas is to store it correctly, so that the coffee isn't ruined by volatile temperatures, frost, or terrible terrible aromas from whatever you've got stored in your fridge. So, don't just stick your coffee bag straight into the freezer and use it like a coffee bag. And so an Atmos in the freezer is one good reusable solution. Ideally, you also want to avoid opening and closing your cleverly vacuum-sealed bag, then putting it back in the freezer. The reason is simple: You'll let in moist air from the outside, then this will freeze in your freezer bag. And too much moisture will change your coffee in some unknown way. (Note that Hendon is less worried about a small bit of moisture, since his research shows it reduces static and thus helps your coffee grind better.) One option is to use ziplock bags inside a container, such as the Atmos. Another, less wasteful option is a reusable zipper bag, like silicone Stasher bags, which have the added benefit of not being made out of plastic. This will also let you seal up your coffee in small doses, so you can pull out smaller quantities at a time without adulterating them. Carbon dioxide and other volatile aromatic compounds will still leave your coffee beans over time, even if you've effectively sealed it up. Your coffee will degrade unless it's much, much colder than your home freezer will ever get—getting stale in a matter of three to six months but probably getting some other version of freezer burn long before that. Coffee from fresh beans is always better, of course. Under most circumstances, light-roast coffee beans are difficult to grind evenly. And so they often don't grind as evenly or easily, if you don't have an excellent grinder that's designed well for light roast. (See WIRED's guide to the best coffee grinders.) But freezing light-roast beans can make them grind more evenly, according to a study by Dr. Hendon at the University of Oregon, published in Nature in 2016. “Our current understanding is that coffee, solid coffee—as in, like, coffee beans—undergoes what's known as a glass transition, which is a solid-to-solid phase transition,” Hendon told me this August by way of explanation. “The mechanical properties of the coffee itself are affected in some meaningful way: In this case, coffee goes from being maybe sort of spongy to being more brittle.” I encourage you to look at the pretty graphs in Hendon's article. But I also tested this myself using a device called the DiFluid Omni particle size analyzer and also WIRED's favorite coffee grinder, the Baratza Encore ESP. Starting with a bag of fresh (and delicious) light-roast Ethiopian Halo beans from Portland's Heart Coffee, I froze one ziplock bag of beans and ground it with the Encore ESP—then put the coffee grounds through particle-size analysis, collating the results across a number of samples and tests. I then used the same grinder setting on unfrozen beans. The results weren't dramatic, but they did back up Hendon's study: The frozen beans ground up a bit more consistently. In particular, freezing beans seemed to reduce the share of larger coffee grounds above 600 microns. This is fairly anecdotal confirmation, of course—but it did line up with Hendon's study. It also amounts to a surprising argument for freezing beans, especially if you have a hard time brewing your beans within their optimal flavor window otherwise.
