Some variants of the “MedBed” conspiracy theory also allege that it can reverse aging or regrow missing limbs. Conspiracists allege that MedBed technology is only available to the rich and well-connected, but that Trump may make it available to the public one day. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. In his Truth Social post, the deep-fake version of Trump says he is giving every American “guaranteed access” to the “advanced technology” and to MedBed hospitals, which do not exist. The video further alleges that more information on how to register for MedBed cards will be coming soon. Websites for MedBed cards do exist, but they are money-making scams meant to deceive people who believe the conspiracy theory. The president frequently shares news reports of himself on social media, but sharing an AI-generated video, showcasing a statement he has never actually made, bewildered a number of people online, leading some to question whether the post was a sign that Trump's mental acuity is declining. New polling indicates that a large bloc of Americans is concerned about the president's current cognitive state. According to an Economist/YouGov poll published earlier this month, only 40 percent of voters believe Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 50 percent say he does not. On the question of whether Trump's age or health is affecting his duties as president, 34 percent believe they are severely limiting what he can do, while another 27 percent say they are having little effect on his job performance. Just 26 percent believe Trump's age and health do not affect his handling of the presidency. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cannabis stocks are on a high after Donald Trump shared a video on Sunday promoting cannabis use for seniors and Medicaid coverage of CBD products. MSOS, an AdvisorShares Cannabis exchange-traded fund (ETF), also soared on Monday, after Trump posted the video. The video was produced by the Commonwealth Project, a group promoting cannabis use for senior healthcare, and praised Trump for his 2018 farm bill that legalized industrial hemp. Under Joe Biden's administration, the Department of Health and Human Services requested that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reclassify cannabis as a lower-risk substance. Marijuana is now classified as a Schedule I drug in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, which means it has no accepted medical use and has a high risk for abuse. But the Trump administration had been silent about decriminalizing marijuana until August, when Trump told reporters that his administration is “looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks”. “I've heard great things have to do with medical, and I've heard bad things having to do with just about everything else,” Trump said. “As a result, studying cannabis is challenging and not integrated into comprehensive medical care, depriving millions of Americans aged 65 and older of potential life-changing alternative therapies for medical ailments.” But it's unclear where Terrance Cole, Trump's DEA administrator, stands on reclassifying cannabis. Advocates pointed out that upon Cole's appointment in July, he did not mention cannabis reclassification among his priorities, instead focusing on cracking down on fentanyl.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel has held hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya in its torture camps for nine months. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, has lost about 55 pounds since Israeli forces abducted him in December, and is suffering from a serious case of scabies, according to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), which visited him last week. Abu Safiya described the violence perpetrated by prison guards during frequent cell searches,” PHRI posted on X. “Since the report's publication, our organization has visited more than 25 of them and gathered additional testimonies about ongoing physical violence, repeated cell raids, lack of food and medical treatment, and months of detention in dirty clothes.” All detained health care workers are “currently being held without charge, some for more than a year,” according to the group, which called for their immediate release. Israeli forces targeted Kamal Adwan Hospital long before the military abducted Abu Safiya in December. A year before his abduction, in December of 2023, Israeli forces conducted their first raid on the hospital and abducted its then-director, Dr. Ahmed Kahlout, according to a new documentary, “The Disappearance of Dr. Abu Safiya,” produced by Al Jazeera Fault Lines. He spoke out about Israel's genocide, the miltiary's attacks on Kamal Adwan Hospital, and pleaded for help from the international community. On October 25, 2024, Israeli forces raided the hospital again, and beat and interrogated more than 40 staff members, including Abu Safiya, according to DropSite News. The soldiers told him not to speak with journalists. At about 6 a.m., Israeli forces demanded to see Abu Safiya. Video captured him walking over rubble to the tank, wearing his white coat. Abu Safiya has been detained in Israel's torture camps without charge ever since. Numerous human rights groups have demanded his release. Israel has launched a yearslong assault on Gaza's hospitals, health care workers, and patients. Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed more than 1,700 medical staff, attacked close to 40 hospitals, and abducted hundreds of health care workers. Israel's blockade has deprived doctors of necessary medical supplies, forcing them to perform operations, including amputations, without anesthesia. Those held in Israel's prisons, where soldiers routinely torture Palestinians, have included “irreplaceable consultants and specialists in essential specialities like General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Orthopaedics Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Cardiology, Paediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology,” according to a report released last year by Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), an organization that tracks Israel's systematic and brutal attacks on Gaza's health care system. “Every healthcare worker who was interviewed by HWW following their release from detention in Israel described being subjected to severe pain and suffering while detained, in acts that amounted to inhumane treatment and torture,” the group wrote. Health care workers told HWW that they had been beaten; subjected to deafening music, sleep deprivation, and extreme cold; sexually assaulted with foreign objects; sexually humiliated; threatened with rape; and hung from ceilings. One nurse said that they were taken to a “10 x 6 metre room with four large loudspeakers and an air conditioner blasting extremely cold air, along with large fans.” (Truthout is using they/them pronouns to identify the individual victim as their gender is not shared in the report.) A paramedic told HWW when soldiers removed their blindfold, they saw at least 20 people in diapers, hanging from a warehouse ceiling. Another paramedic said he was hung from the ceiling and electrocuted. “They put me in an overall that had electricity wires around it and put, like a headband with wires on my head,” they said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Four people were killed and eight others injured in the attack during a Sunday morning service, police said. • The gunman was “take(n) down” by officers within minutes. Investigators identified him as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, who served with the Marines and was an Iraq War veteran. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has brought in one of its “world-renowned” specialized rapid response teams to investigate the church shooting and fire, officials said in a news conference Monday. These teams can include explosives specialists, bomb technicians, forensic chemists and canine handlers. “They have been used all over the world, and they come from places as far as California, Hawaii, and they're here in Michigan now,” ATF acting special agent in charge James Deir said. Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye described the church attack as an “evil act” but said the township would move forward. This does not define Grand Blanc and who we are,” Renye said during a news conference. “We are a community, and I am confident that together we're going to build a stronger community due to this incident.” Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were found at the scene of the attack, according to James Deir, acting special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Michigan. “The FBI is investigating this as an act of targeted violence, and we are continuing to work to determine a motive,” said FBI acting special agent in charge Ruben Coleman. Investigators are working around the clock to follow up on leads, including public tips, Coleman said. Everyone has been accounted for following Sunday morning's mass shooting at a Michigan church, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said Monday. Gretchen Whitmer said her “heart is breaking by another mass shooting in a place that is supposed to be defined by togetherness.” These are places that we go to feel connected, to feel safe, to be together,” the governor said Monday during an update on Sunday's attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township. “But today, this place has been shattered by bullets and broken glass. And this might be a familiar pain, but it hurts all the same every time.” Whitmer also said she spoke with President Donald Trump, who shared his condolences Sunday. Authorities are holding a news conference at the Grand Blanc Township Police Department to provide an update on the investigation into Sunday's shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel that left four people dead. Federal and local agencies will provide updates, authorities said. Brandt Malone has been been going to the LDS church in Grand Blanc Township for many years, he told CNN. “The hardest thing for our community right now is feeling like that security blanket has been ripped away,” Malone said. CNN's Leigh Waldman spoke with Jeff Caryl on Monday morning. Caryl, who lives about four houses down from the church, said he heard what he initially thought were firecrackers on Sunday morning, but it turned out to be gunfire. “If you're a good human being, you don't pick on churches and schools and it's just disturbing to tie all that together.” Here's what the church looks like this morning: That driver was taken into a law enforcement vehicle. His identity and motive were not immediately clear. Four people were killed Sunday in the multipronged attack at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan. The gunman was killed in a shootout with police. Thomas Jacob Sanford, who authorities say was the gunman in Sunday morning's fatal shooting and fire at a Michigan church, was an Iraq War veteran and outdoorsman, according to military records and social media posts. At least four people were killed and eight injured. Sanford died during an exchange of gunfire with police, authorities said. Authorities did not immediately provide a motive for the attack. A Marine Corps spokesperson told CNN that Sanford served as a sergeant and received several medals for his service, which lasted from 2004 to 2008. He was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom for several months starting in the summer of 2007. Sanford graduated from Goodrich High School in 2004 and was recognized among other veteran alumni, according to an archived page from the school's website. A local news profile of Sanford from 2007 said he was deployed with the US Marine Corps to Japan before preparing to head for service in Iraq. Social media accounts linked to Sanford's family show he was married with at least one child, a young son. According to a GoFundMe page from 2015, the family was in need of donations to help pay for the medical care of Sanford's son, who was born with a rare genetic disorder. Kris Johns, Burton city council candidate, near Michigan's Grand Blanc Township, spoke with a potential voter on the campaign trail — just days before that individual carried out a deadly attack on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel. “What are your thoughts on guns?” Thomas Jacob Sanford — the US Marine and Iraq War veteran who died at the scene of Sunday's shooting and arson — asked Johns just one week ago, the Burton candidate recalled to CNN. At least four people were killed, and several others were wounded after an attacker rammed his car into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, during a Sunday service, before opening fire on worshippers and setting a fire that destroyed the building. Eight others were injured, including children, a source told CNN. Authorities said they believe they will find more victims after they secure the chapel, which is now a “total loss.” Up to seven people were still unaccounted for as authorities concluded search efforts on Sunday, a law enforcement source told CNN. Some suspected explosive devices linked to the incident were also found. It's unclear if any explosives were also used to start the fire, authorities said. A search of the perpetrator's residence is underway and authorities are working to obtain search warrants for digital media that may help shed light on a motive, a law enforcement source told CNN. As of Sunday afternoon, there have been at least 324 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people – not counting the shooter – are shot. Sunday's attack at the church in Michigan followed another mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier: Saturday night, a gunman opened fire on a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, killing three people and injuring at least eight others.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Church set ablaze on weekend when shooting attacks also took place in North Carolina, Texas and New Orleans. Don't already get First Thing in your inbox? At least four people were killed and eight others injured after a gunman opened fire at a Mormon church in Michigan and then set the building ablaze, authorities said. Two of the shooting victims died and eight others were hospitalised, officials said initially, while the gunman was shot dead by police. The police chief of Grand Blanc Township, William Renye, said a 40-year-old male suspect drove a vehicle through the front door of the church yesterday morning, got out and began firing an assault rifle at hundreds of church attenders. Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention, as revealed in a stark new court filing. Legal experts able to witness conditions made a barrage of allegations about deprivations, violations of legally agreed basic detention standards and humanitarian concerns at the only known Ice center currently holding families. At the facility in Dilley, a small town an hour south-west of San Antonio, children and their parents described a “prison-like environment” and said they lived in “cell-like trailers”. The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, announced yesterday that he is abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day, delivering the message in a social media video set to the strains of My Way. Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a Democrat but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were then dropped by the Trump administration in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids. What did he say about his decision to drop out? In his video statement, Adams said that it had been impossible for him to mount a winning campaign, blaming “constant media speculation about my future” and a decision by the city's campaign finance board to withhold millions of dollars in matching funds over suspicious donations. Israel has pressed on with its offensive in Gaza as Donald Trump claimed again to be on the brink of a breakthrough in ceasefire negotiations for the devastated territory. The indictment of the former FBI director James Comey is part of a concerted effort by Donald Trump to “rewrite history” in his favor, a former senior White House lawyer claimed yesterday. The Taliban yesterday freed a US citizen from an Afghan prison, weeks after they said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign tomorrow, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. Workers have described how months of “fear and intimidation” left them feeling like they had no choice but to depart. A successful challenge to the VRA would allow the Republican party to further cheat democracy by engaging in even more partisan gerrymandering. He writes: “We gave the web away to everyone. And yet the vast majority of media coverage of the climate crisis overlooks this critical sector, according to a new data analysis from Sentient Media. When two brothers called Johannes and Johann Adam Birkenstock began making shoes in a tiny hamlet near Frankfurt in the 1770s, they could never have imagined what they were starting. How did a brand described even by some of its fans as the world's ugliest shoe become one of the world's most popular? First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), along with its two related protocols, are no longer valid in Russia due to the refusal of the Council of Europe to provide Russia's representation in the organization's statutory bodies, according to a law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. At the same time, the Russian authorities will continue to combat human rights violations by applying national legislation in this area. "Denounce the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of November 26, 1987 and Protocols No. 2 of November 4, 1993 thereto, signed on behalf of the Russian Federation in Strasbourg on February 28, 1996," the newly-signed law reads. State Duma (the lower house of the Russian Parliament) Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin pointed out earlier that Russia's work in the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture "has been blocked by the Council of Europe itself, which has not allowed the election of a new Russian member to the committee since December 2023." The explanatory note to the bill stipulated that these "discriminatory circumstances" violate Russia's representative rights in the European Committee and undermine the mutual monitoring mechanism for compliance with international obligations in the field of torture prevention, "which is why it is proposed to denounce the said convention and its protocols." Russia, which has been a member of the Council of Europe since 1996, announced its intention to withdraw from it in 2022, after the organization's Committee of Ministers suspended Moscow's right to representation in the Council of Europe's statutory bodies. At that time, Russia notified the Council's secretary of its withdrawal and denunciation of the key document of the Council of Europe - the European Convention on Human Rights. Since that time, Moscow has been gradually denouncing the documents of the Council of Europe, as current circumstances make enforcing them impossible. At the same time, the Russian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they will not abandon their international obligations to combat crimes and human rights violations, actively enforcing national legislation in this sphere.</p>

MOSCOW, September 29. /TASS/. Although a war between Russia and Europe is unlikely, Russia should still stay vigilant, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

"Scenarios of a war with Russia in the next five years are peddled to people from every newsstand in Europe. It just cannot be," the politician wrote, adding that "the likelihood of a fatal accident happening always exists." So, he recommended being "on alert."

"And such a conflict is fraught with an absolutely real risk of escalating into a war using weapons of mass destruction," the senior Russian security official concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of the world's biggest investors are looking beyond a boom in artificial intelligence to longer-term spending by governments tackling geopolitical, technological and demographic pressures set to reshape markets over the next few years. Asset managers are spreading bets across infrastructure, energy transition, healthcare and defence, to capitalize on fiscal stimulus from governments, even as Wall Street debates whether the AI-powered rally in stocks is sustainable. As concerns over some countries' ballooning fiscal debts draw attention, many investors “underestimated the impact that (stimulus) could have on real and financial assets,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management. Hafele told the Reuters Global Markets Forum his firm, which oversees US$4.5-trillion in assets, is “investing thematically along with what governments are doing,” diversifying into areas such as power, resources, healthcare and defence. Europe's fiscal support is just as dramatic, with sentiment boosted by Germany's 500-billion-euro (US$586-billion) infrastructure fund exempt from its strict debt brake and NATO members' pledges to lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP. Nuclear power, energy infrastructure, biotech innovation and defence were industries that “cannot be ignored by the market,” he added, while warning, “At some point, we will need to deal with these debts.” A rise of nearly 14 per cent this year in the S&P 500 index has largely been powered by AI-related momentum, versus more modest gains of 9.5 per cent in Europe's benchmark STOXX 600. But the aerospace and defence index .SXPARO of the latter has surged almost 68 per cent, showing that fiscal priorities are lifting defence and industrial plays even in a broader market environment still dominated by AI. Saira Malik, chief investment officer at U.S. asset manager Nuveen, which manages $1.3 trillion in assets, expects equity gains to broaden beyond the U.S. tech-heavy trade to cyclical sectors, small-caps and value plays. outperformance is not the only game in town this year, thanks to a weaker dollar,” she said. Malik advised investors to stay balanced, but with a tilt toward U.S. markets. “I don't think investors should just own U.S. (assets) at the expense of everything else, but I would fully argue against betting against the U.S.” Both UBS and Nuveen stressed active management over passive bets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington has authorized specific instances where Ukraine can carry out long-range strikes within Russia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said on Sept. 28 in an interview with Fox News. "The answer is yes, use the ability to hit deep, there are no such things as sanctuaries," Kellogg replied when asked if it is U.S. President Donald Trump's position that Ukraine can conduct long-range strikes. President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly asked Trump to supply Kyiv with Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles during a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last week. The U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28. As Ukraine develops long-range missiles and drones of its own, Kyiv continues to rely on weapons provided by its allies to conduct such strikes, which often require authorization from the country supplying the missiles. In light of Russia's recent provocations, it is more important than ever to be careful not to make a "mistake" when facing Moscow, he said, adding that "this is a global issue, and we should react accordingly." Russia has intensified violations of the EU's and NATO's airspace in recent weeks. Moscow violated Polish airspace on Sept. 10, prompting Warsaw to shoot down Russian drones over its territory in a first for any NATO member in over three years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. As the U.S. allows Ukraine to conduct strikes deep within Russia, Washington is looking into providing Kyiv with additional weapons. As Russia continues to press along the front line with little progress and high losses, Kellogg noted that Moscow is not meeting its goals as it wages its war against Ukraine. Trump's position marks a shift from earlier in the year. The U.S. leader previously criticized Ukrainian strikes on infrastructure within Russian territory. In a letter published Aug. 22, Trump told Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban he was "very angry" about Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline. In recent weeks, Trump has instead increasingly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin as the U.S. fails to broker an end to Russia's war against Ukraine. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. Russia holds conscription drives twice a year, spring and fall. "The path Russia has chosen is that of a repressive, murderous state. Its denunciation of the convention only confirms that torture and inhuman treatment are systemic practices of the Kremlin," Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. Hungary blocked 12 Ukrainian media outlets in response to Kyiv's earlier ban on several foreign, including Hungarian, publications over Russian narratives, Hungarian Cabinet Minister Gergely Gulyas said on Sept. 29. "Russia's recent attack with more than 580 and over 40 missiles have once again underlined the importance of strengthening Ukraine's air defense," German Defense Minister Boris Pistoruis said. The largest number of injuries was reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where a Russian attack wounded 49 people. Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles. "There is growing evidence that Russia may have used tankers in the Baltic Sea to launch drones — the drones that caused major disruption in Northern Europe," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Even U.S. military action against Brazil, which Trump designated a major non-NATO ally in 2019, appears to be on the table. Put simply, the Bolsonaro trial was a triumph of U.S. democracy promotion. At the moment, democracy promotion is anathema in Washington. The Trump administration has made unprecedented cuts to democracy, human rights, and governance programs, including dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, slashing the State Department's democracy bureau, and freezing nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign assistance. Trump has said “there's no reason for USAID,” which he has called a “left-wing money-laundering scam.” These positions represent a wholesale retreat from the bipartisan post–Cold War liberal consensus positing that democracy promotion as a form of soft power could both benefit foreign countries and advance U.S. interests and principles. Bush's disastrous campaign to democratize the Middle East soured the American public on such policies, which in turn allowed Trump to position himself as an opponent of democracy promotion and foreign assistance more broadly. And even in Latin America, U.S. democracy promotion has a checkered history, beginning with President Woodrow Wilson's moralistic crusade to impose democracy on Mexico in 1914. After the Cold War, however, Washington embraced a softer and smarter approach in Latin America, nurturing fledgling democratic systems across the hemisphere by strengthening democratic governance, elections, human rights, and the rule of law, including reforming judicial institutions and criminal justice systems. But in the years to come, Trump's abandonment of democracy promotion will make it harder for civil society and opposition parties to dislodge the autocratic forces that once again have begun to take root in Latin America. Historically, USAID was at the core of U.S. democracy promotion in Latin America, administering programs designed to strengthen democratic institutions, including by advising on elections, encouraging a free press, and promoting civic education. Less well known is the work of the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-autonomous agency whose government funding is currently in legal limbo. Created in 1983 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration, with an eye toward bringing change to the communist world, the NED has long enjoyed bipartisan support. Throughout the 1990s, Washington prioritized judicial reforms intended to bolster the rule of law by training judges, prosecutors, and public defenders; helping law enforcement agencies build modern criminal investigative units; and offering fellowships for Latin American public servants to study at universities in the United States and intern at U.S. government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. But after almost every failed attempt, the coup plotters enjoyed amnesty, most famously in 1985, when Brazil underwent its last transition from dictatorship to democracy. Other Latin American countries that had suffered under military dictatorships vigorously prosecuted the perpetrators of human rights abuses, but Brazil did not follow suit. It was only in 2011 that Brazil organized a truth commission to chronicle human rights abuses the military committed between 1964 and 1985. Brazil's Federal Supreme Court has taken dramatic steps to expand the rights of historically marginalized communities including Afro-Brazilians, Indigenous people, and LGBTQ people. In 2014, prosecutors launched Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash, a money-laundering investigation that exposed a host of criminal activities, including bribery, tied to Petrobras, the state-run oil company. Nowhere has the strength of Brazil's judiciary been more evident than in the courts' bold confrontation of Bolsonaro and his illiberal agenda. Just months after Bolsonaro left office in 2023, the Superior Electoral Court, which oversees federal elections, prosecuted the former president for abuses of power linked to spreading misinformation about Brazil's electoral system. That conviction banned him from running for public office until 2030. In September, a panel of five judges on the Federal Supreme Court ruled 4–1 to convict Bolsonaro on five separate charges, including seeking to stage a coup, leading an armed criminal group, and attempting a violent abolition of the democratic rule of law—the first time the country has held coup plotters accountable. But until Trump's return to power, U.S. support for democracy in post-transition Brazil had been steadfast, and never more so than when democracy itself came under attack. After Bolsonaro supporters stormed Brasilia on January 8, 2023, an act that eerily mirrored the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, U.S. President Joe Biden telephoned Lula to affirm Washington's “unwavering support for Brazil's democracy.” At Biden's request, Lula visited the White House in February 2023 to discuss strengthening democratic institutions and values. Following that meeting, the United States and Brazil initiated a series of collaborative projects intended to deepen the quality of Brazilian democracy, including a USAID-sponsored program to combat racial discrimination against Afro-Brazilians and Indigenous communities. Of course, Brazil's justice system is hardly beyond reproach. Many of the corruption-related convictions and sentences that resulted from Operation Carwash have been overturned—including Lula's. This will result in fewer resources dedicated to upholding the rule of law. Indeed, many Latin American NGOs are bracing for a “civil society recession,” as groups that depend on U.S. assistance close shop. Among the consequences will be a shrinking of the civic arena, which could create an opening for nondemocratic actors such as China and Russia to expand their regional influence. For its part, Trump's intimidation campaign over Brazil's conviction of Bolsonaro will also likely discourage other Latin American countries from prosecuting their own antidemocratic leaders. Brazil's successful prosecution of Bolsonaro still offers Latin American countries a model to emulate. But it will be harder to do so without help from the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JULIAN GEWIRTZ served as Senior Director for China and Taiwan Affairs at the U.S. National Security Council. A great unanswered question of the second Trump administration has been how its outright rejection of the existing global order would affect China's international strategy. China traded tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States, but it otherwise remained content to sit back and accrue benefits from Trump's alienation of U.S. allies and withdrawal from international institutions. A few days later, flanked by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xi presided over a massive military parade in Beijing to show off China's fast-growing arsenal. Xi aims to establish China as the fulcrum of an emerging multipolar world, and he is advancing a new, more active diplomatic strategy to realize that goal. If this gambit succeeds, it will transform the international order from the inside out, placing China at center stage and undermining U.S. influence in ways that future American administrations may find difficult to reverse. Disagreements among the group's key members, such as a long-running border dispute between China and India, have tended to outweigh their areas of commonality. Eight months into Trump's second term, this reading is optimistic at best. The international order that the United States built and maintained for decades is coming to an end, and what follows is up for grabs. Many countries are competing for influence, and short-term, transactional dealmaking rather than long-term cooperation is becoming the new norm, ushering in a phase that one of us called “mercenary multipolarity” in Foreign Affairs. And as U.S. alliances fracture under Trump, rivals of the United States are collaborating in increasingly meaningful ways. Yet with the ultimate shape of this new order still undefined, Xi sees a window of opportunity to forge a China-centric world without directly taking on the United States by moving assertively into areas where Trump's “America first” policies leave openings. This project extends well beyond the optics of gathering global leaders in Chinese cities. While the U.S. president feuded with the leaders of Brazil and India, Xi addressed a virtual BRICS meeting hosted by Brasilia on the topic of “resisting protectionism” and welcomed Modi to China to shore up ties with these two key powers. While Trump imposes tariffs on much of the world and eliminates U.S. foreign assistance, Xi is courting the leaders of the developing world: Beijing announced cuts to Chinese tariffs on African goods in June and claimed in September that it would bolster efforts to reform the World Trade Organization to benefit developing countries' economic growth. And whereas Trump attacked climate change as “the greatest con job ever” and skipped a UN summit on the issue, Xi has set an emissions reduction goal that, although remarkably unambitious, has earned him plaudits in some quarters. Perhaps most worryingly for Washington, Xi's actions have made clear that this China-centric world will reward resistance to the United States. There is no better symbol of this promise than Xi's decision to give pride of place during the military parade in Beijing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose country has been under punishing sanctions for decades and has sent troops to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine. Xi similarly embraced other leaders who have pushed back against the United States in some way: Putin, Modi, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian all received a lavish welcome in China, too. China is now focused on being seen not as a disrupter but as the defender of the international order, putting a new spin on its long-standing effort to secure a privileged position in existing institutions and to boost its capacity to set norms and rules inside them. Until recently, China preferred the safer course of criticizing unpopular U.S. policies and focusing its activities in areas that attract limited international attention, such as development, culture, and peacekeeping. “China has all along acted as a staunch defender of world peace and security,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at the UN just a few days after Trump's speech. In September, Xi announced his Global Governance Initiative, which aims to put China's stamp on the United Nations system. It invokes the desire of many countries for a more “just and equitable” international order and makes China—rather than any other country or international body—the arbiter of what that new order will entail. Beijing is already advancing principles that work in its favor, such as an absolutist but selective conception of national sovereignty that it applies to itself but not to all countries, and marginalizing values that it sees as threatening, such as universal human rights. China has offered few details about how it would resolve disputes within or introduce reforms to international institutions, and it has no desire to foot more of the bill for costly UN programs. Paired with prominent if modest Chinese investments in UN bodies and their personnel, Trump's continued neglect, Xi hopes, will enable China to reshape these institutions to its liking. The scholars Sheena Chestnut Greitens, Isaac Kardon, and Cameron Waltz recently found, for instance, that China's internal security agencies have significantly increased their international policing partnerships and non-military security cooperation under the banner of the Global Security Initiative, especially in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific Islands but also in Africa and Latin America. As the United States steps back, China is quietly layering new kinds of partnerships on top of its already robust trade ties, with the aim that, over time, more countries will see Beijing—not Washington—as their most important relationship. But these moves would simply be too much at odds with the administration's “America first” ideology to gain traction. Ahead of his planned visit to China in 2026, Trump is focused on the optics of his personal relationship with Xi and on striking a bilateral deal—which, if prior negotiations are any guide, much of the world may judge as a good deal for China, even if Trump touts it as a win. Beijing may struggle to translate its grand aspirations into a real global realignment. Many countries understand that a China-centric world would come with strings attached, and Beijing may be unable to resist escalating its numerous territorial disputes in Asia or flexing its coercive capabilities. Time and again over the past decade, Beijing's actions—from punitive economic measures against major trading partners to maritime harassment of rival territorial claimants in the South China Sea—have invited pushback from countries that prize their autonomy. Now, those countries could resist China's order-shaping efforts by reducing their reliance on both Beijing and Washington. A more fragmented, anarchic world is not necessarily one that China will dominate. Missteps by China or resistance from other countries could well thwart Xi's designs. For the United States, such setbacks can buy time—until different leadership in Washington once again has a vision of the future built around more than looking out for itself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prior to the attack, Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz had issued a warning about a possible missile threat in the Karachev area. The Elektrodetal factory produces a range of electrical connectors for both military and industrial use. These components are employed in military equipment, aircraft, antennas, base stations, printed circuit boards, and various measuring systems. The strike reached a target approximately 240 kilometers (149 miles) away. Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles. Bryansk Oblast sits along Ukraine's northern border with Russia. Karachev is located about 115 kilometers (72 miles) from the border. Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine. On Sept. 28, Ukrainian HIMARS rockets reportedly struck a thermal power plant near the Russian city of Belgorod, Russian Telegram channels reported. Separately on Sept. 28, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed that it killed at least four Russian drone operators in the city of Melitopol in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast. An explosion rocked a guarded military base on an airfield in occupied Melitopol, destroying a Soviet-era UAZ-452 van and killing at least four operators, HUR claimed. Russia holds conscription drives twice a year, spring and fall. "The path Russia has chosen is that of a repressive, murderous state. Its denunciation of the convention only confirms that torture and inhuman treatment are systemic practices of the Kremlin," Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. Hungary blocked 12 Ukrainian media outlets in response to Kyiv's earlier ban on several foreign, including Hungarian, publications over Russian narratives, Hungarian Cabinet Minister Gergely Gulyas said on Sept. 29. "Russia's recent attack with more than 580 and over 40 missiles have once again underlined the importance of strengthening Ukraine's air defense," German Defense Minister Boris Pistoruis said. The largest number of injuries was reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where a Russian attack wounded 49 people. Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles. "There is growing evidence that Russia may have used tankers in the Baltic Sea to launch drones — the drones that caused major disruption in Northern Europe," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>
