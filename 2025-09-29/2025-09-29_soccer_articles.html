                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stateside, Trinity Rodman and the Washington Spirit clinched a playoff berth. Meanwhile, overseas Korbin Shrader came up huge for her new club OL Lyonnes against her old squad PSG. Trinity Rodman contributed two assists to Gift Monday's hat trick. Korbin Shrader shined in OL Lyonnes 6-1 win over PSG. Shader recorded a hat trick along with an assist to fellow USWNT player Lindsey Heaps. Heaps got on the scoreboard in the 58th minute with a header off a curling pass from Shrader. Shrader transferred from PSG in the summer, and in her second match and first start with her new club, she came up big. Two USWNT talents created magic in Gotham FC's 3-0 victory over the Portland Thorns. It was her third goal of the season after she returned from injury in late June. USWNT midfielder Jaedyn Shaw flipped a one-touch pass to a Lavelle cutting up field, and the Cincinnati native netted a left-footed shot past the Thorns goalkeeper's outstretched reach. In four matches, Shaw has contributed a goal and an assist. Now, the two stars continue to gear up for a playoff run as Gotham holds onto the No. Alyssa Thompson transferred to Chelsea FC in the Women's Super League from Angel City FC earlier this month. After recovering from an arm injury, the winger made her debut off the bench on Sept. 14. Thompson made her first start in the 4-0 win over West Ham on Sunday. She played 60 minutes after two 45-minute appearances as a substitute.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Cup, co-hosted in 2026 by US, is a Fifa competition Uefa is expected to avoid trying to block Israel from World Cup qualifying as the European governing body considers measures against the country's football association. Under plans being worked out by Uefa that are expected to be voted on by its executive committee (exco) this week, the Guardian understands Israel would be banned only from competitions that Uefa directly controls. This is done “in collaboration” with Fifa but only subject to the global governing body's approval. In the absence of a wider ban, however, Uefa would be in the unusual position of staging World Cup qualifiers for a country otherwise excluded. If Israel were blocked from Uefa's competitions, the spotlight would spring back to Fifa. Norway and Italy are due to face Israel in qualifying during the upcoming international break, which begins next Monday. Israel are third in their qualifying group, level on points with second-placed Italy, having played a game more, with the runners-up granted a place in the World Cup playoffs. Gravina's point was echoed by Norway's FA president, Lise Klaveness, who feels Israel should be banned. “A boycott would only result in Israel going to the World Cup instead of us. In general, we are now working for Israel to be sanctioned.” Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote. Insiders suggest that if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with very few members of Uefa's 19-strong exco expected to object. Uefa, even if it imposed a ban, would continue to be responsible for organising Israel's World Cup qualifiers, including providing match officials, security and other staff for their “home” games in Hungary. Maccabi Tel Aviv are due to play Dinamo Zagreb in their second Europa League tie on Thursday, and that game is expected to go ahead. It could, though, be Maccabi's final involvement in the competition. A replacement team would be sought, with the most likely possibility being Dynamo Kyiv, who lost in qualifying against Maccabi, though that would have a knock-on effect on the Conference League.</p>

The 2026 World Cup begins in Mexico City on June 11 and ends at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 19. One note: you must be a Verizon customer. "Our customers are very passionate about soccer and we're passionate about giving our customers the most incredible access to the things they love," Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland told USA TODAY. Coming in November: A sweepstakes giving hundreds of customers the chance to win "Golden Tickets" granting them on-field pitchside viewing access during the tournament. "So there are about 200 people who get (Golden Tickets with) free tickets to the match ... (and) we bring them down to the pitch to watch part of the game," Berland said. Winners will also get to experience meet and greet sessions with stars such as David Beckham, former USMNT goalkeeper and NBC Sports analyst Tim Howard, current USWNT players (and sisters) Alyssa and Gisele Thompson (Alyssa plays for Chelsea in the Women's Super League; Gisele for Angel City FC of the NWSL), Hirving "Chucky" Lozano (San Diego FC), and former Argentine and Manchester City star Sergio "Kun" Agüero. “For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that's on or off the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament," said Beckham in the news release. The soccer legend will be featured in Verizon's World Cup marketing campaign proclaiming that "no one gets you closer" to the action than Verizon. Hint: follow the company's accounts on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X and Facebook. More information about the Golden Tickets giveaway will be forthcoming, but chances to win will come through social media, retail and other mediums, according to Berland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolavip, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective. Winning the Champions League secures a place among Europe's elite. Only a select group of coaches have managed to lift both trophies. Their journeys reveal contrasting challenges—navigating club soccer's marathon of matches and thriving in the short, high-stakes burst of a global tournament. From legendary tacticians to unexpected innovators, these managers bridged two demanding worlds. Their success offers a rare glimpse into how adaptability and vision can shape the most enduring legacies. Marcello Lippi during the FIFA World Cup Germany 2006 Final match. His European triumph came during a dominant period for Italian soccer in the mid-1990s. His Juventus team was a powerhouse, though he also suffered three subsequent consecutive final defeats (1997, 1998, 2003). His greatest moment, however, arrived when he took charge of the national team. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, he guided the Italy national team through a tournament defined by resilience and unity, culminating in a dramatic final victory over France, again decided by penalties. This victory secured his place as a national hero and the first coach to claim both major trophies. Vicente del Bosque joined Lippi in this exclusive club four years later, achieving a remarkable run of success for both club and country. His initial European glory came during his tenure at Real Madrid at the beginning of the Galácticos era. He won the Champions League twice with the club, first in 2000 against Valencia and again in 2002 against Bayer Leverkusen, a final famously decided by Zinedine Zidane's spectacular volley. His second major title came when he managed the Spain national team. Marcello Lippi during the AFC Champions League Final 2nd leg match in 2013. A club coach has continuous access to his players, facilitating the implementation of complex systems, but must also manage massive transfer budgets and player turnover. Lippi's success with Juventus and Del Bosque's wins with Real Madrid were achieved through multi-year projects of dominance. The competition is a ruthless, single-elimination sprint over four weeks. The coach has minimal preparation time—gathering players who spend most of the year as rivals—and must simplify tactics for immediate effectiveness. Vicente Del Bosque during a Champions League game. The challenge here is less about sustained technical complexity and more about generating intense emotional unity and momentum. Del Bosque excelled at this, stepping in to manage the existing talent and philosophy of the Spanish team's “Golden Generation” to win in 2010. Furthermore, the opportunity itself is incredibly scarce. To win the World Cup, a coach must be appointed to one of the eight nations historically capable of lifting the trophy—a job that only comes around every four years. Lippi (Italy) and Del Bosque (Spain) had the perfect, yet highly rare, career trajectory: they achieved continental club dominance, which then earned them the opportunity to lead their respective elite national teams at precisely the moment a world-class generation of players peaked. This convergence of elite timing, tactical duality and managerial stature is why the list of winners remains so short.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many supporters of the U.S. Men's National Team would like nothing more than to place Christian Pulisic in bubble wrap until June 12, 2026. That's when the Americans will kick off their latest World Cup adventure, against an opponent to be determined in Los Angeles, at the tournament's draw in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5. Until then, the 27-year-old forward needs to excel for club and country, fill the net with goals, hone his talent and write another chapter in his incredible career. Which he certainly has done for A.C. Milan, lately. Since the Italian Serie A season kicked off last month, the Hershey, Pa. native has scored six goals and added two assists across seven matches. Heck, he also has recorded four goals and two assists in three appearances over nine days. He followed that up with a goal against Lecce in another 3-0 home win in a Coppa Italia encounter on Sept. 23. Pulisic tallied a goal and an assist in Milan's 2-1 home triumph over Napoli. Milan (4-1-0, 12 points) won its fourth successive Serie A match, taking over first place via goal differential past the defending champions (4-1-0, 12), plus six to plus five, respectively. I think it shows a lot for sure.” In fact, he has taken over the early Golden Boot lead with his four goals. Four players are tied for second place with three apiece - Nico Paz (Como), Riccardo Orsolini (Bologna), Kevin De Bruyne (Napoli) and Marcus Thuram (Inter). Yes, it's early, but still, not too shabby for any player, let alone an American. In life, a generation usually is measured by 20 or 25 years. In soccer, it is more like seven to 12 years because international careers don't always last longer than that. For example, Landon Donovan (2002-2014) and Clint Dempsey (2004-2017) were attacking dynamos during their prime years. They lead all USMNT players with 57 goals apiece. Pulisic is fifth with 31, behind Jozy Altidore (42) and Eric Wynalda (34). Donovan also is the all-time assist leader (58) With a couple of stellar performance, Pulisic could tie or even pass Wynalda, assuming he is called in for the USA's next two friendlies, against Ecuador in Austin, Texas (Oct. 10) and Australia in Commerce City, Colo (Oct. 14). If the USMNT is to be successful at next year's World Cup, the Americans will need superior performances by several players. Of course, in a competition such as the World Cup, no team can be a one-man show, except for such super-talented players as Pele, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. These players showed that they can bend steel with their bare feet. Pulisic isn't in their class, but few Americans should be complaining. There is no one else on the team in his class. Failing to get out of the group stage would be embarrassing; South Africa (2010) is the only country to pull off that rare, abysmal feat. As for Pulisic not playing during the summer friendlies and Concacaf Gold Cup and the kerfuffle that started in a he-said, he-said situation with U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino, and a soap opera ensued in which former USMNT stars voiced their opinion, should be in the past. This is a time to look ahead and enjoy what feats Christian Pulisic can perform with his feet (and sometimes with his head) for club and country. Let's face it, Pulisic has become an indispensable player not on just one team, but two. If he keeps a decent pace and remains healthy, U.S. soccer supporters could be in line for a memorable time come next summer.</p>

Many Americans are performing well for their club teams around the world, but four stand out: It's been a wild few weeks for Pulisic in Italy. The attacker followed up a two-goal performance against Udinese with a stellar showing Sunday against league leader (and defending champion) Napoli. "It sends a message for sure,” Pulisic said of his team's performance, per CBS Sports Golazo America. It does — but Pulisic's individual performance is sending a message, too. Juarez-born dual national Zendejas spent much of 2025 outside the USMNT looking in, but his nigh-unbelievable form with Club América in Mexico has brought him back into the fold for good. In a 4-1 win over Pumas UNAM on Saturday, he scored twice as América won the hotly contested Clasico Capitalino. He's worth keeping an eye on as the Liga MX season develops. Crystal Palace versus Liverpool was the headlining fixture of this Premier League weekend, and for good reason: Both teams entered the Saturday match unbeaten with plenty to prove. While many expected defending champion Liverpool to win, it was Palace that prevailed 2-1 thanks to an Eddie Nketiah goal on the last kick of the game. But Palace's defense, anchored by USMNT regular Richards, is arguably even more impressive. It's a three-man system that looks awfully similar to the one the USMNT experimented with successfully against Japan, and Richards looks fabulous within it. 21-year-old USMNT prospect Alex Freeman is the highest-scoring defender in Major League Soccer. Freeman scored arguably the most impressive goal of his 2025 campaign Sunday against FC Cincinnati. With just two minutes left and Cincinnati up 1-0 in the crucial Eastern Conference clash, Freeman found himself some space in the penalty box and headed in a gorgeous Tyrese Spicer cross to level the score.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How the game has evolved and what it means for players The European Court of Justice's landmark judgement presents players with more clarity and protection if they are thinking about terminating their contracts. Italian international goalkeeper Katja Schroffenegger signed for Como in 2024 but spent the best part of her first season recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. On 15 December 2025, FIFPRO will celebrate its 60th anniversary – six decades of supporting footballers worldwide. To honour this milestone, FIFPRO is planning a year of campaigns, content, and initiatives to commemorate previous achievements and push the global player union forward into the next 60 years. Players which competed in the FIFA Club World Cup after their domestic league season are among hundreds at the top of men's football who lack adequate offseason or preseason periods, increasing risks to player health and performance, according to the annual FIFPRO Player Workload Monitoring Report published in collaboration with Football Benchmark. Maheta Molango, FIFPRO board member, said: "This report gives you the factual evidence of what is happening in football. Chelsea, the FIFA Club World Cup winners, and runners-up Paris Saint-Germain were the hardest hit by the calendar crunch: after having their holiday period reduced to barely three weeks, Chelsea players had just 13 days for preseason, while PSG players got only seven days. These findings underscore the urgent need for common-sense player safeguards like those in a recently-published Consensus Study on Minimum Player Workload Safeguards, in which high-performance experts agreed players should receive 28 days offseason and a further 28 days preseason. The report also looks at recovery time in other sports and, for the first time, incorporates extreme heat as a growing factor for performance, health, and competition planning. Dr. Darren Burgess, chair of FIFPRO's High-Performance Advisory Network, said football should follow other sports in guaranteeing offseason breaks to protect players from injury and burnout. “Plus, not having 28 days as a minimum of preseason prevents players doing rigorous preparation for the season ahead. In other sports, the priority has been placed on player performance and player well-being, and the offseason break is a substantial part of that." While many players in football's pyramid lack competitive games, those at the elite level are often overburdened: the health risks for players become disproportionate to elite sports' inherent risks when they face sustained periods of two games per week, according to scientific research. The following were among players who experienced extreme fixture congestion with more than 50 games last season, many of which were with less than five days of recovery time: Recovery time after international windows is often less than 48 hours – a smaller break than experts recommend – even for South Americans facing long-haul travel back to European and U.S. clubs. Argentina's Enzo Fernandez exemplified this burden, accumulating 195 hours of travel during 29 journeys spanning 149,010 kilometres last season. Dr. Burgess emphasised that younger players need age-appropriate training loads, clear match exposure limits, and protected rest periods: "Growth plates, tendons, and ligaments remain vulnerable during these years, and excessive high-speed running or short recovery windows can lead to long-term structural damage,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teboho Mokoena is a player of South Africa whose case caused his country this setback South Africa's hopes of securing early control in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign has suffered a major setback after FIFA's Disciplinary Committee confirmed sanctions against the South African Football Association (SAFA) for fielding an ineligible player. The ruling on Monday, September 29, 2025, stems from South Africa's match against Lesotho on March 21, 2025, in which midfielder Teboho Mokoena featured, despite being ineligible under FIFA regulations. As a consequence, FIFA has awarded the match as a 3-0 victory to Lesotho, with South Africa losing the three points they had earned on the pitch. The decision means South Africa now drops three points in Group C, tightening an already competitive qualifying race. UDS players snubbed in awards ceremony despite winning University Games In addition to the forfeiture, SAFA has been fined approximately $11,000, while Mokoena himself has been issued with a warning. FIFA stressed that all parties were informed of the decision and that SAFA has ten days to request a detailed, motivated judgment, which could be appealed before the FIFA Appeal Committee. For Coach Hugo Broos and his side, the ruling is a bitter blow. South Africa had been building momentum, but the deduction not only dents their points tally but also shifts the pressure onto their remaining fixtures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZURICH (AP) — South Africa was stripped of a win in 2026 World Cup qualifying by FIFA on Monday and lost top spot in its group for fielding an ineligible player. FIFA's disciplinary ruling overturned a South Africa win against Lesotho in March, left Benin top with two rounds to go and gave Nigeria fresh hope of advancing to the finals tournament. South Africa has not played at a World Cup since hosting the 2010 edition. Ahead of decisive qualifying games resuming next week, FIFA said its disciplinary judges ordered South Africa to forfeit as a 3-0 loss what had been a 2-0 victory over Lesotho. South Africa selected Teboho Mokoena for the game in Polokwane when the midfielder should have served a one-game ban for getting yellow cards in two previous qualifying games. Motsepe also owns the Mamelodi Sundowns club that Mokoena plays for. FIFA also fined the federation 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,500) and Mokoena was formally warned. Without the three points, plus a negative five-goal swing in its goal difference, South Africa drops below new group leader Benin. The teams are tied on points, both three clear of Nigeria and Rwanda, but Benin's goal difference is one better than South Africa. South Africa completes the qualifying group against Zimbabwe on Oct. 10 and at home to Rwanda four days later. Zimbabwe's “home” game is being played in South Africa, at Durban, because it does not have a national stadium that meets CAF standards. Mokoena was picked last week in the preliminary squad for those games by coach Hugo Broos.</p>
