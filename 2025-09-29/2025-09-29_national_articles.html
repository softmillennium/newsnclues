The family confirmed Bill "Papa" Putman, his wife Barb, and their daughter-in-law Megan died in a statement shared on Instagram. Eight members of the family were together when a vehicle crashed into them Friday. "Noah is still sedated, but we are so grateful to see that he is responding to us with movement," a statement shared on Instagram read. "Gia underwent a craniotomy last night, and we are thankful to report that her care team shared some encouraging news, her brain pressure has gone down significantly." Eight members of the Putnam family were involved in a car crash on Sept. 26. The family asked for continued prayers as Noah and Gia recover. "Through it all, we continue to hold tightly to our faith, knowing that God has a plan and a purpose for everything. Even in the hardest moments, He is present, working in ways we may not yet understand," the family wrote. "Thank you all for the continued prayers, love, and support. We feel your strength and faith surrounding us. Please keep lifting Noah and Gia up as they heal." Authorities said a loaded commercial semi-truck heading southbound failed to make a stop and crashed into the family's Jeep, which was heading eastbound. Police arrested the driver, who is now awaiting charges. "We are asking the public to please pay more attention when driving," the Tuscola County Sheriff's Office said in a statement to the outlet. Fox News Digital reached out to authorities for additional information. "Meet the Putnams" aired for one season in 2017. The family – three generations – reside under one roof in Michigan. Their unconventional lifestyle was highlighted in the reality TV show, featuring their six-bedroom, two-bathroom accommodations and more. The series was not renewed for additional seasons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Affinity Partners is run by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. PIF, which was currently the largest insider stakeholder in Electronic Arts, will be rolling over its existing 9.9% investment in the company. “The Saudi PIF has been a very active player in the video gaming market since 2022, taking minority stakes in most scaled public video gaming publishers, and also outright purchases of companies like ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely,” he wrote. “The PIF has made its intentions to scale its gaming arm, Savvy Gaming Group, clear, and the EA deal would represent the biggest such move to date by some distance.” PIF is also a minority investor in Nintendo. If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted 52 cents. The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by “Strat-O-Matic” as a teenager during the 1960s. “Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future,” said Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. “I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.” One of EA's biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft for nearly $69 billion in 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified. This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake is also part of a newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the U.S. oversight of TikTok's social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven't been divulged yet. Silver Lake also bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9 billion deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9 billion buyout of personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returned to the stock market with publicly traded shares in 2018. By going private, EA will be able to retool operations without worrying about market reactions. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA's annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion. Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company thinks the proposed deal's $210 per share offer price may be falling short of EA's intrinsic value. “With Battlefield 6 about to launch and a pipeline that could add more than $2B in incremental bookings by FY28, the true earnings power of EA is only beginning to emerge,” he wrote. “In our view, this transaction is a self-serving, opportunistic move by management and the investor group,” he wrote. “Management has long been rumored to seek a sale around $200 per share, a level that may have been defensible in prior years but not in the current environment where visibility into growth, franchise momentum, and pipeline strength is far more robust. The board's decision to recommend a sale at $210 per share suggests a prioritization of near-term certainty and legacy over maximizing long-term shareholder value.” But Nick McKay of Freedom Capital Markets believes the offer makes sense for EA because share price appreciation is likely limited given that the success of its sports franchises and various live services streams are already mostly baked into the stock. “The financial backing and resources of the investor consortium should enable EA to increase its focus on long-term growth opportunities that may have been viewed as too risky or expensive as a public company,” he wrote in an analyst note.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump said he's “very confident” about a peace deal in Gaza as he greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for talks. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says President Trump is pushing a plan to end the Gaza conflict during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's White House visit Monday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday they've agreed to a plan to end the war in Gaza, but it's unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms. Trump on Monday laid out a 20-point plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war and establishing a postwar governance in the war-battered Palestinian territory. Trump's plan would establish a temporary governing board that would be headed by Trump and include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The plan does not require people to leave Gaza and calls for the war to end immediately if both sides accept it. It also calls for all remaining hostages to be released within 72 hours of Israel accepting the plan. “I think we are beyond very close,” Trump said at the start of a news conference with Netanyahu where he detailed the plan. “If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself,” Netanyahu said. Netanyahu earlier extended a formal apology to his Qatari counterpart for a recent military strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emirate that infuriated Arab leaders and triggered rare criticism by the U.S. of Israel. Netanyahu made the call to Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, as he met with Trump, according to the White House. “As a first step, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,” the White House said in a statement. “He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future.” The White House talks, and apology from Netanyahu, come at a tenuous moment. Israel is increasingly isolated, losing support from many countries that were long its steadfast allies. At home, Netanyahu's governing coalition appears more fragile than ever. And the White House is showing signs of impatience. As he welcomed Netanyahu to the White House, Trump responded affirmatively when asked by reporters whether he was confident a deal would be soon reached to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas. No senior Hamas officials were killed in the strike. The attack on an energy-rich Gulf nation hosting thousands of American troops, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas throughout the war and even before, was described by Trump as out of step with Israeli and U.S. interests. Qatar, meanwhile, condemned the strike as a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” as smoke rose over its capital, Doha. The White House said al Thani welcomed Netanyahu's “assurances” and emphasized “Qatar's readiness to continue contributing meaningfully to regional security and stability.” Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner of Netanyahu's, in a posting on X called the operation “an important, just and ethical attack.” “Ultimately the president knows when you get to a good deal, both sides are going to leave a little bit unhappy,” Leavitt told reporters. “Let us not delay a single minute more in doing what is necessary for this just peace to replace the unbearable reality of today,” Mansour said during a Security Council meeting on the Middle East. Trump joined forces with Netanyahu during Israel's brief war with Iran in June, ordering U.S. stealth bombers to strike three nuclear sites, and he's supported the Israeli leader during his corruption trial, describing the case as a “witch hunt.” But the relationship has become more tense lately. Trump was frustrated by Israel's failed strike this month on Hamas officials in Qatar. Last week, Trump vowed to prevent Israel from annexing the West Bank — an idea promoted by some of Netanyahu's hard-line governing partners. The international community opposes annexation, saying it would destroy hopes for a two-state solution. On Friday, Trump raised expectations for the meeting with Netanyahu, telling reporters the U.S. was “very close to a deal on Gaza.” The militant group has demanded Israel agree to end the war and withdraw from all of Gaza as part of any permanent ceasefire. It doesn't include the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which Trump appeared to endorse earlier this year. Hundreds of Palestinians, including many serving life sentences, will be released by Israel, according to the proposal. The plan also includes the establishment of an international security force to take over law enforcement in postwar Gaza, they said. A Palestinian committee of technocrats would oversee the civilian affairs of the strip, with power handed over later to a reformed Palestinian Authority, they said. A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The group has repeatedly rejected laying down arms and has linked its weapons to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.</p>

A weekend shooting that left three people dead and five others injured was "highly premeditated" and targeted a waterfront North Carolina restaurant, officials said. The popular spot is known locally not only as a waterfront bar and restaurant, but also as a filming location for "Safe Haven," the 2013 romantic thriller based on the Nicholas Sparks novel. Investigators allege that 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge positioned himself in a white, center-console boat just off the restaurant's deck before opening fire. It was highly premeditated," Police Chief Todd Coring said at a press briefing Sunday. Edge, an Oak Island resident and military veteran, has not yet entered a plea. He appeared for his first court hearing Monday afternoon, logging in by video at 2 p.m. from the neighboring sheriff's office jail. Prosecutors said in court that Edge used a .300 Blackout Sig Sauer rifle outfitted with a suppressor and scope, and also had a .380 handgun tucked in his waistband when he was arrested. Some of the rifle ammunition was tipped for maximum ballistic impact, authorities noted. Two deputies responded on a sheriff's department boat after the shooting, later spotting Edge as he walked to retrieve his boat trailer. Deputies moved in and apprehended him as he backed the trailer in to pull his vessel from the water. Officials said the attack may have originally been planned for Friday. Witnesses, prosecutors said, saw Edge with his boat lights off that night before he suddenly fled when approached. Coring said that he "self-identifies" as a veteran. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment. "We understand this suspect identifies as a combat veteran. In a 2024 federal lawsuit dismissed earlier this year, Edge made sweeping claims that included references to what he called "a Hate Crime (LGBQT toward a straight man (me)) who was raised as a straight male for (LGBTQ) purposes in an illegal pedophile sex ring." He also accused his parents of being "LGBQT White Supremacist Pedophiles" who falsified his birth certificate, drugged him and tried to profit from him, while tying his alleged mistreatment to the Iraq War, the Abu Ghraib scandal and the Jeffrey Epstein case. Judge Louise W. Flanagan ruled that Edge failed to state any viable constitutional or tort claims, noting that his filings were filled with extraordinary accusations but lacked legal grounding. The case was formally closed with all counts dismissed.

(Chris Seward/AP Photo) District Attorney Jon David said Sunday "a lot" of the victims were on vacation and were not Southport locals. "Sadly, a lot of the victims in this case appear to be not members of our community, but people who are here on vacation," David said. The filings also identify five victims by initials – JS, WP, JB, LB, and TL – tied to counts of attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. In addition to those victims, three others were fatally shot during the attack, though their names have not yet been publicly released. Nigel Max Edge was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted first-degree murder in connection with the shooting at American Fish Company restaurant in Southport, North Carolina, on Saturday Sept. 27, 2025. He could face additional charges, including the death penalty.

New York Mets team owner Steve Cohen addressed disappointed fans on Monday after the team suffered a dreadful collapse and missed the postseason. "Mets fans everywhere," Cohen wrote on X. You did your part by showing up and supporting the team. We will do a post-mortem and figure out the obvious and less obvious reasons why the team didn't perform up to your and my expectations. "We are all feeling raw emotions today. I know how much time and effort you have put into this team. Your emotions tell me how much you care and continues to motivate the organization to do better. Thank You to the best fans in sports." Minutes after the loss, first baseman Pete Alonso said he was going to opt out of his deal and test free agency. "There's some great guys in this clubhouse, there's some great people on the staff," he said. I've really appreciated and been nothing but full of gratitude every single day. Nothing's guaranteed, but we'll see what happens. New York Mets owner Steve Cohen stands on the field before a ceremony to honor first baseman Pete Alonso (not pictured) for breaking the Mets all time home run record before a game against the Atlanta Braves at Citi Field on Aug. 14, 2025. "I've loved being a Met, so hopefully they've appreciated me in the same (way)." The Mets got off to a hot start. New York was 45-24 on June 12, one of the best records in MLB at the time, and only went 38-55 the rest of the season to finish 83-79 after their latest crushing loss on Sunday evening. New York came into the 2025 season with the second-highest total payroll – more than $341 million – and the second-highest active roster payroll with $266.6 million, according to Spotrac. Juan Soto came over to the Mets from the New York Yankees on a 15-year deal reportedly worth $765 million.

Board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, based in Savannah, Georgia, explains why VO2 max and muscle mass are the main indicators of longevity. The key to a good workout could be sitting in your kitchen cabinet. A viral social media trend claims that taking a spoonful of honey and salt before hitting the gym provides an energy boost. Some say this combination mimics the effects of pre-workout supplements, which are meant to enhance physical performance and energy levels when exercising. TikTok creators and influencers have been filming themselves pouring honey onto a spoon, or even on the back of their hand, and sprinkling it with salt — many opting for natural options of both — and taking a dose before heading to the gym. Honey, a "rapidly digesting carbohydrate," and the sodium from salt could be beneficial as a workout booster, an expert says. In an interview with Fox News Digital, certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco confirmed that this strategy "does make sense" as a pre-workout boost. The combination mixes a "rapidly digesting carbohydrate" with sodium, both of which are thought to be "beneficial for an effective workout," the New Jersey-based nutritionist said. "It's usually suggested to eat a snack of carbohydrates (usually mixed with some protein or a bit of good fat) before a workout to help increase sustained energy and muscle re-building, so this is just saying to use honey as the carbohydrate/sugar," she said. The combination mixes a "rapidly digesting carbohydrate" with sodium, both of which are thought to be "beneficial for an effective workout," the nutritionist said. DeCicco believes this trend is most likely popular because honey is digested quickly into the bloodstream and breaks down easily. She does not, however, recommend consuming only honey and salt before a workout. "These types of snacks will work to provide energy throughout the entire workout," she said. "The snacks can be eaten one to two hours before a workout, and then the honey and salt directly before." The nutritionist also advises her clients to drink electrolytes before, during and after a workout to prevent dehydration, especially if it's a sweaty session. "Someone could also put a pinch of sea salt into water with some coconut water or fruit juice and reap the same benefit as the honey, minus the antioxidants found in honey," she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk appears for a court hearing. Defendants can waive that step, but Robinson's newly appointed attorney Kathryn Nester said her team did not intend to do so. Utah prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and plan to seek the death penalty. Both the defense and prosecution acknowledged at a brief hearing Monday that the amount of evidence that prosecutors have is “voluminous.” Robinson was not present for the hearing and appeared via audio from jail at his defense team's request. Judge Tony Graf set the next hearing for Oct. 30. Defense attorneys for Robinson and prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney's Office declined to comment after Monday's hearing. Authorities arrested Robinson when he showed up with his parents at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from the site of the shooting, to turn himself in. Prosecutors have since revealed incriminating text messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing. The assassination of Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism, has galvanized Republicans who have vowed to carry on Kirk's mission of moving American politics further right. Trump has declared Kirk a “martyr” for freedom and threatened to crack down on what he called the “radical left.” Workers across the U.S. have been punished or fired for speaking out about Kirk after his death, including teachers, public and private employees and media personalities — most notably Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show was suspended then reinstated by ABC. Kirk's political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through his podcast, social media and campus events. Many prominent Republicans are filling in at the upcoming campus events Kirk planned to attend, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Sen. Mike Lee at Utah State University on Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? October's “kitchen cabinet” tax will affect homebuyers and renters alike. Housing in America is about to get more expensive, thanks to new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that will take effect this Wednesday, October 1. These will join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have been driving up construction costs this year. Some companies stockpiled materials before the tariffs kicked in, creating a temporary buffer. But those inventories won't last forever, and the building industry faces a fundamental challenge: Each additional $1,000 in home construction costs prices out more than 115,000 potential home-buying families, according to NAHB. More than 770,000 people were officially counted as homeless last year, mortgage rates hover around 6.4 percent, and nearly 75 percent of American households can't afford a median-priced new home. Now, tariffs are pouring fuel on these already raging fires. When Trump slaps a 50 percent tariff on kitchen cabinets from abroad, American importers — not the foreign companies manufacturing the cabinets — pay that tax. If a developer was planning to install $15,000 worth of imported cabinets in a new home, they're now looking at an extra $7,500 in costs. That might sound small, but it represents $14 billion worth of materials in 2024 alone. A June study by the real estate firm Evernest found that tariffs could add anywhere from $26,180 to the cost of a new home in Oklahoma to over $100,000 in Hawaii. In expensive markets like California and Massachusetts, the additional costs from tariffs are estimated to exceed $60,000 per home. The Trump administration, for its part, maintains it holds no blame for whatever affordability crisis renters and homeowners might experience as a result of their trade decisions. “America's housing affordability was dramatically worsened by Joe Biden's open border policies that let tens of millions of illegal migrants walk into the country and overburden housing markets that were already grappling with cumbersome regulatory hurdles,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Vox. This uncertainty is in some ways more challenging for developers than the costs themselves. Developers planning projects months or years in advance suddenly confront moving targets for material prices, and this unpredictability is already showing up in construction data. Single-family housing starts fell to a near 2.5-year low in August, while permits — a leading indicator of future construction — dropped to levels not seen since April 2023. Anthony Hrusovsky of Chicago's Mavrek Development told the Chicago Tribune recently that tariffs “killed” negotiations with a major equity investor for a planned 25-story, 400-unit project. The tariffs introduced “a level of uncertainty around cost, which had previously been riskless in our eyes.” Gusto, a payroll services firm for small businesses, conducted an annual survey in August and September and found that 50 percent of companies thought tariffs had hurt their business this year, and 56 percent expected them to do so next year. Perhaps no material illustrates the tariff trap better than lumber. Last month, the Trump administration more than doubled its 14.5 percent tariff on Canadian lumber to a rate of 35 percent.The fact is that American sawmills simply don't produce enough lumber to meet domestic demand, and it takes time to ramp up production. So homebuilders will face higher costs whether they buy Canadian lumber with tariffs or American lumber from a market with limited supply. And those costs will trickle down to everyone else. Tariffs don't just hit new construction — they're expected to drive up renovation costs too. In effect, homeowners may become much less willing to invest in home improvements, potentially affecting property values and slowing the broader house renovation industry. That tightens an already competitive rental market and makes things more costly for tenants. Some would-be homebuyers, priced out by higher home costs and mortgage rates, also remain in the rental market longer, further increasing demand for apartments. Tariffs can drive up prices economy-wide, keeping interest rates — and mortgage costs — elevated. Trade uncertainty has already rattled the stock market and slowed economic growth in 2025. These tariff-driven cost increases are particularly maddening because they directly contradict the administration's stated housing goals. Trump has repeatedly pledged to make housing “affordable again” and has signed executive orders directing agencies to reduce regulations that drive up housing costs. But while deregulation might save money on development costs, tariffs are adding thousands of dollars per home. Even if the administration could eliminate 25 percent of regulatory costs — an optimistic scenario — that still might not fully offset the price increases from import taxes. Earlier this month, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that if current tariff levels remain steady, construction output could go down by 3.8 percent in the long run. And tariff levels are not remaining steady — they're about to increase. Another irony is that Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make mortgages cheaper, but his tariff policies make rate cuts less likely by fueling the inflation the Fed is trying to control. All of these contradictions become even starker when combined with the administration's immigration enforcement policies. More than one-third of construction workers are foreign-born, according to 2023 Census data, and in some states — like California and Texas — the share is much higher. The Trump administration's immigration raids have already started to affect construction sites, and reports reveal that other foreign-born workers have stopped showing up to work out of fear. A 2024 study examining the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program (which was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and removed roughly 400,000 people from the US) found that the average county lost about a year's worth of residential construction over four years following enforcement. “And so when you have net losses in those low-skilled occupations, it does lead to a slowdown overall.” ﻿This program is likely to hurt American workers — and the whole economy. Trump's prosecution of Rep. LaMonica McIver may be the most anti-democratic thing he's done since January 6.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pin Ni, an automobile executive identified in corporate documents as a member of the Chinese Communist Party, has donated roughly $45,000 to support New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill. In February, Pin cut a $30,000 check to One Giant Leap PAC, the super PAC supporting Sherril's bid for the governor's mansion, campaign finance records show. Between February 2022 and September 2024, meanwhile, Sherrill accepted $14,500 in donations from Pin through her congressional campaign account. Lu Guanqiu, the founder of Wanxiang Group and Pin's late father-in-law, received praise directly from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who said that his company is “in line with the Party Central Committee” and that he “always actively does what our Party committees and governments at all levels advocate.” Guanqiu's son, Lu Weiding, took over the company after his father's death in 2021. Additionally, federal campaign finance records reveal that Pin and Lu are massive donors to candidates and political committees across the country — primarily Democrats, but with some smaller contributions earmarked for Republicans. The donations made by Pin have raised legal concerns among some experts. Chinese law, for instance, typically forbids members of the CCP from holding foreign citizenship or permanent residency. To make campaign contributions, people must either be green card holders or citizens of the United States. “It's bad enough if Spanberger is taking illegal campaign donations from a foreign source, but outrageous that it's from a member of the Chinese Communist Party,” National Legal and Policy Center counsel Paul Kamenar told the Washington Free Beacon in reference to its reporting on Spanberger, noting that the group would file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. Those same policies could be beneficial for Wanxiang Group's bottom line. Recent polling indicates that, despite New Jersey's historically Democratic leanings, Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli is locked in a statistical tie with Sherrill as controversies mount for the Democrat. The Sherrill campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This image provided by Dartmouth in September 2025, depicts a text message exchange with the Therabot generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment. In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI “therapy” as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable. “The reality is millions of people are using these tools and they're not going back,” said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users' health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn't human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them. Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, said the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients. Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said. “This could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,” she said. That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said. Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. But even a single app can be tough to categorize. Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is “very muddy” about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there. Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick's website described its chatbot as “Your empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,” but now it's a “chatbot for self care.” Users can set up a “panic button” to call a trusted loved one if they are in crisis and the chatbot will “nudge” users to seek out a therapist if their mental health worsens. But it was never designed to be a suicide prevention app, Stephan said, and police would not be called if someone told the bot about thoughts of self-harm. Stephan said she's happy that people are looking at AI with a critical eye, but worried about states' ability to keep up with innovation. When Illinois users download the AI therapy app Ash, a message urges them to email their legislators, arguing “misguided legislation” has banned apps like Ash “while leaving unregulated chatbots it intended to regulate free to cause harm.” “Therapy is more than just word exchanges,” Treto said. In March, a Dartmouth College-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response. The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people. “The space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,” he said. Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples' thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not. The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective. Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers. “Not everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,” he said. The AP is solely responsible for all content.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police in Madagascar's capital fired teargas on Monday at thousands of people who returned to the streets for a third round of youth-led protests against water and power cuts, with many calling for the government's resignation. Inspired by the so-called “Gen Z” protests in Kenya and Nepal, the demonstrations are the largest the Indian Ocean Island has seen in years, and the most serious challenge President Andry Rajoelina has faced since his re-election in 2023. Authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Thursday after protests in the capital Antananarivo turned violent. Protesters on Monday gathered at a university in Antananarivo where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march through town, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed. In another part of town, police cleared rocks and telephone poles that protesters had used to barricade roads, and fired teargas to disperse the crowd, footage broadcast on Real TV showed. Many in the crowd called for the resignation of Prime Minister Christian Ntsay, his government, and Rajoelina. Gen Z Moroccans denounce government priorities in some of the largest protests in years The latest protests come after Rajoelina said on Sunday he would thoroughly review and reform the governance in the country. “If there have been mistakes, I recognize them, and I am now looking for ways to correct everything,” he said in a speech in the Anosibe neighborhood of Antananarivo, where some looting and vandalism took place on Friday. The protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign this month and have also used similar online organization tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina said on Monday he was dissolving the government following youth-led protests over water and power cuts in which the United Nations says at least 22 people have been killed and more than 100 injured. “We acknowledge and apologize if members of the government have not carried out the tasks assigned to them,” Rajoelina said in speech on state broadcaster Televiziona Malagasy (TVM). The president said he wanted to create space for dialog with young people, and promised measures to support businesses affected by looting. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the casualties include protesters and bystanders killed by members of the security forces, but also others killed in subsequent widespread violence and looting by individuals and gangs not associated with the protesters. Madagascar's ministry of foreign affairs rejected the casualty figures reported by the UN, saying the data did not come from competent national authorities “and are based on rumors or misinformation.” On Monday protesters gathered at a university where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march towards the city center, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed. Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd, after authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew last week. The protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign this month and have also used similar online organization tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation. Rajoelina first came to power in a 2009 coup. He stepped down in 2014 but became president again after winning the 2018 election, and secured a third term in a December 2023 poll that his challengers said was marred by irregularities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Video game maker Electronic Arts is going private in a $55 billion deal that's funded by Saudi Arabia and a Jared Kusher-backed investment firm. The company, which makes hits like “Madden NFL,” “The Sims,” and “Battlefield,” announced Monday that the consortium is led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Kushner's Affinity Partners. They are paying shareholders $210 per share — making it the largest buyout on record. The purchase is a 25% premium on Friday's closing price prior to reports of a buyout, first reported by the Wall Street Journal. “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a press release. Kushner said he's admired EA's “​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​— and now enjoys them with his ​kids — I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead.” The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027 and is subject to regulatory approval. EA, founded in 1982, has a broad portfolio of well-known hits, ranging from sports to first-person shooting games, including the eagerly awaited release of “Battlefield 6.” Last year, the company laid off 5% of its workforce, joining other video game companies that have reduced their headcount after experiencing a boom during the height of Covid-19 and changing consumer habits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — Rep. Byron Donalds's (R-FL) campaign for Florida governor received a boost on Monday with the endorsements of law enforcement leaders across the Sunshine State. Over a dozen sheriffs backed Donalds, one of two Republicans who have announced bids to succeed Gov. They include Miami-Dade County Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz, Hillsborough's Chad Chronister, Duval's T.K. Waters, Lee's Carmine Marceno, and Pasco's Chris Nocco. The governor has yet to endorse a successor, as his wife, Casey DeSantis, is rumored to be weighing her own bid for the office. “I know Congressman Donalds will stand with law enforcement as we work to keep Florida safe and will be innovative in his ideas to create jobs, improve education, and make our economy more competitive. Florida has been blessed to have a fantastic legacy of Governors with Governor Rick Scott and Governor Ron DeSantis. Other sheriffs who supported Donalds's bid for office this week included Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith, Brevard's Wayne Ivey, Collier's Kevin Rambosk, Hendry's Steve Whidden, Indian River's Eric Flowers, Jackson's Donnie Edenfield, Martin's John Budensiek, Monroe's Rick Ramsay, St. Lucie's  Richard Del Toro, and Wakulla's Jared Miller. Donalds is one of multiple leading House Republicans declining to run for reelection in the midterm elections. Instead, they are choosing to back away from national politics by mounting bids for offices in their home states. Donalds and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, who entered the race earlier this month, are the two Republicans challenging Democrat David Jolly to become Florida's next governor. A poll looking at where voters place Donalds in relation to Democratic candidates ahead of the general election gave the congressman an 8-point lead over Jolly, 49% to 41%. Of those surveyed in the poll, conducted in late August by the AIF Center for Political Strategy, 11% of Floridians remained undecided about their candidate. Jolly's campaign has touted a poll it commissioned in early September showing the Democrat in a statistical tie with Donalds and Renner, with nearly 20% of voters undecided. Jolly's internal polling also indicated that with over 13 months to go until the general election, the leading candidates lack name recognition. More than half the respondents reported they do not know who Donalds, Jolly, or Renner are, with Donalds receiving the highest name recognition rate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿Why are so many young men turning toward fatherhood? There is a real case of baby fever going around — and it's coming from America's young men. Fifty-seven percent of men 34 and under want to be parents now. Compare that to just 45 percent of women the same age who want to have a kid now, and it's a stat that turns antiquated notions of parenthood on its head. In a time where report after report tells us that men are in crisis, why do so many men want to turn to fatherhood? Phillip Maciak thinks the answer could be found on our television screens. He's a TV critic at the New Republic and teaches a course on fathers and in pop culture at Washington University in St. Louis. He's also the author of an upcoming book, titled Dad: A Pop History. “Largely Gen Z students have grown up in a time when dad is an adjective as much as a person,” he says. “I think it's a more malleable thing for them. The adaptability of fatherhood may sound like a new phenomenon, but according to Maciak, even our “traditional” picture of what it means to be a dad is fairly new. We see it changing rapidly and transforming every day.” How has our image of fatherhood changed over the decades? And what mirror does television hold up to us about the ways we parent? Maciak answers these questions on this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Maciak, edited for length and clarity. The dominance of this idea is a post-World War II thing. It was tied in with men's experience of returning from World War II to the suburbs. These television shows were both reflecting something about American culture and providing a model within American culture that tracks pretty closely to a kind of timeline of the evolution of this figure. What are the greatest hits of TV dads? He works all day and comes home at night, but when he comes home, it's very clear that his role as a father is of central importance to him. It tells us a lot about the idea of fatherhood in the 1950s as being an identity category for American men. You feel alienated in all these other realms of your life. But as a father, that's who you can be. They take an active role in co-parenting their children. All of the things that have happened to our understanding of Bill Cosby in the years since then are startling because Cliff Huxtable is such a good dad. If you had to pick a symbol from our pop culture moment right now, who is that dad? I think this feels like a particularly fraught year for the dad. For a long time, the dad as an archetype has been this kind of liberalizing figure, even when it applies to a politically conservative dad. It's a weird time for pop culture dads. Weapons, The Conjuring, and more have fueled a horror movie boom. How A/C, tax breaks, and hip-hop tilted America southward. The hidden reasons behind America's organ donation crisis. How should you relate to your favorite celebrity? ﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Realistically, however, there is little uncertainty about how this GOP-dominated Court will resolve two of them. But the Court's Republican majority rarely breaks with Trump. There's less mystery about how the Court will handle two other groups of cases, which concern election law and LGBTQ+ issues. Kagan's Republican colleagues repealed central provisions of the law, and misread other provisions of the law so egregiously that it is hard to believe they are acting in good faith. In its upcoming term, the Republican justices are widely expected to expand on this project — abolishing the Voting Rights Act's longstanding safeguards against racial gerrymandering. One of the few campaign finance laws that even most Republican judges have historically supported is a cap on donations to individual candidates. The Court seems poised to strike down bans on “conversion therapy,” where therapists try to suppress their patients' sexual orientation or gender identity. It's also likely to uphold state laws requiring student athletes to play on a sex-segregated team that aligns with their sex assigned at birth. Last term, the Court handed down a long string of temporary decisions handing significant victories to Donald Trump — including a decision permitting him to fire so many federal employees that many federal programs cease to function. If you've paid attention to US economic policy or business news these past several months, you're already familiar with the tariffs cases. Trump has imposed very high, and frequently changing, taxes on goods imported to the United States. Many federal judges have determined that these tariffs are illegal. Trump claims that the tariffs are permitted under a federal law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which enables the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” IEEPA, however, only permits the president to use this power “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.” Additionally, the Republican justices frequently struck down Biden-era policies that, in their words, involved questions of “vast ‘economic and political significance. In 2023, the Supreme Court shocked pretty much everyone who follows election law when it upheld a lower court decision requiring Alabama to redraw its congressional maps to include an additional Black-majority district. Now, however, it appears that Milligan was a one-off decision, and the Court's decision in that case was likely due to bad lawyering by Alabama's attorneys. So it's not hard to guess how this case will turn out. A decision abolishing those safeguards is likely to devastate Black representation in red states where voting is racially polarized — meaning that Black people overwhelmingly vote for Democrats while white voters similarly favor Republicans. In their infamous decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), the Republican justices held that corporations may spend unlimited amounts of money to influence US elections. That led to a proliferation of entities, such as super PACs, that can spend millions of dollars on behalf of a particular candidate, but which are at least nominally distinct from that candidate's campaign. In theory, super PACs are not supposed to coordinate their spending or messaging with the candidates they support. Direct donations to candidates, by contrast, are still capped; in the 2026 election cycle, congressional candidates may raise no more than $7,000 per donor. Political parties, meanwhile, may accept donations subject to a higher cap. Party committees like the Republican State Leadership Committee or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for example, may accept donations up to $44,300 per year. As the Supreme Court warned in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), “expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign might well have virtually the same value to the candidate as a contribution and would pose similar dangers of abuse.” If the DCCC, for example, can accept a $40,000 donation from a donor who wants to use that money to elect Joe Smith to Congress, and if the DCCC can work with Smith's campaign to determine how that money is spent, then the law might as well allow donors to give $40,000 directly to Smith's campaign. Given the Republican justices' hostility to campaign finance laws, it is likely that Republicans will get what they want. The Supreme Court is going to decide whether those laws violate either the Constitution or a federal ban on sex discrimination in education. Realistically, these would be tough cases for the trans community to win even if the Court were not dominated by conservative Republicans. In Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), the Court held that a federal law prohibiting “sex” discrimination by employers forbids anti-trans discrimination in the workplace. The Court reasoned that if an employer “intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth,” then it is treating workers differently based on their sex. But the Bostock framework does not apply to sports, because sports teams are one of the few areas where US law generally tolerates sex segregation. Sex discrimination is inherent in the very concept of a men's or women's sports team, so trans advocates cannot challenge exclusionary policies simply by pointing out that they engage in sex discrimination. And, of course, the Court is dominated by conservative Republicans who, in United States v. Skrmetti (2025), recently held that states may prohibit minors from receiving gender-affirming health care. So trans advocates face a difficult uphill climb in Little and B.P.J. About half of US states have laws restricting “conversion therapy,” a discredited method of counseling that attempts to turn LGBTQ+ patients cisgender or heterosexual. The Colorado law at issue in Chiles, for example, bars conversion therapy for patients under age 18, though it also exempts counselors who are “engaged in the practice of religious ministry.” As one federal appeals court explained, “every major medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional mental health organization opposes the use of conversion therapy.” The American Psychological Association, for example, says that it “‘puts individuals at a significant risk of harm' and is not effective in changing a person's gender identity or sexual orientation.” That said, Chiles does raise a difficult First Amendment question. On the one hand, it's not hard to imagine how a law prohibiting some forms of talk therapy implicates the constitutional guarantee of free speech. Will those examples be enough to persuade this Supreme Court that the Colorado law is a regulation of professional misconduct, and not an attack on free speech? But the justices will, at least, need to wrestle with how to distinguish speech by a lawyer or doctor from speech by a therapist. Nearly a quarter century ago, in Atkins v. Virginia (2002), a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican justices held that offenders with an intellectual disability may not be sentenced to death. They reasoned that these individuals have diminished mental capacity, at least as compared to nondisabled adults, and thus bear less moral responsibility for homicide crimes. Another decision three years later applied the same logic to juvenile offenders. Both decisions were met with mockery and derision from the Court's right flank, and that right flank now controls the Supreme Court. So the question in Hamm v. Smith is just how far these justices will go to roll back decisions like Atkins. The death row inmate at the heart of Smith, Joseph Clifton Smith, took several IQ tests where he scored slightly above 70. Courts often look at whether an inmate's IQ score is below 70 when determining if they are intellectually disabled, though the Supreme Court has held that other factors can support a finding that Smith has an intellectual disability. A second possibility is that the Court could overrule Atkins, thus permitting people who unquestionably are intellectually disabled to be killed by the state. Writing for the Republican justices in Bucklew v. Precythe (2019), Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to suggest that the past six decades of Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishments should be tossed out, and that courts should simply ask whether a particular form of punishment was considered too cruel in 1789. If Gorsuch gets his way, that would be a catastrophic event for all criminal defendants. Among other things, Gorsuch's approach would likely eliminate any constitutional concerns about disproportionate punishments. The specific legal issue before the Court in Bost is fairly low stakes: The Court will decide if the plaintiffs in this case — candidates for federal office — are permitted to bring a lawsuit seeking to toss out many ballots in states that permit voting by mail. Even if these plaintiffs prevail in the Supreme Court, though, that will only give them an opportunity to pursue their (entirely ridiculous) legal challenge in lower courts. The case is worth watching, however, because three of the Trumpiest judges in the country handed down a decision last year claiming that it is illegal for states to count mailed-in ballots that are mailed before Election Day, but that arrive afterward.The three Fifth Circuit judges' opinion in that case, known as Republican National Committee v. Wetzel, claims that an 1872 law setting the date for federal elections also prohibits states from counting ballots that arrive after that date, and somehow no one noticed this fact for the previous 152 years. Depending on what the Court says in Bost, that decision may wind up shutting down Wetzel as well. They will undoubtedly be joined by several more blockbuster cases, including multiple challenges to Trump's mass firings, attempts to cancel federal spending, and his aggressive use of federal law enforcement. Even without these additional cases, however, the 2025–'26 term is already shaping up to be extraordinarily consequential. October's “kitchen cabinet” tax will affect homebuyers and renters alike. ﻿This program is likely to hurt American workers — and the whole economy. The Democratic debate over whether “moderation” works is very confused. Trump's prosecution of Rep. LaMonica McIver may be the most anti-democratic thing he's done since January 6.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A single mother in Phoenix, she was trying to make ends meet and build a future, studying for her psychology degree. “It kind of gets (to be) so much that you can't ask somebody for help,” she told CNN. But she couldn't stop thinking about the money. She didn't stop to think much about the dangers or whether the offer was too good to be true — or legal. Her friend headed south, collected a group of migrants near the border, and drove back again. She was now involved in migrant smuggling, enlisted by a Mexican cartel recruiter through social media. An American operating entirely inside the United States, she was nevertheless extending the reach of cross-border gangs making money from trading people and drugs. CNN has spent six months investigating how the cartels recruit, how people get sucked in and how law enforcement is tackling the problem which can, at first glance, look as innocent as a young, licensed person taking a drive through the desert. The easy money kept coming for the young woman, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals but spoke with CNN by phone. For months, she reposted the same message on her own Snapchat story: “5-10k in a day lmk.” She helped to recruit scores of drivers who smuggled nearly 100 people north from the US-Mexico border, according to court documents. The risks became clear only when one of those drivers was stopped, she said. “That one guy I had on Snapchat messaged me like, ‘Hey, this person got pulled over, they got arrested, they're getting questioned, make sure you have everything off of your phone.' That's when I realized, OK, this is what's going on,” she said. It took federal investigators at least four months to flag her account, and she was arrested soon after. “To my knowledge it was one person that I would communicate with. But now … it could have been multiple people on one account … I truly have no clue who I was working for.” Experts believe the anonymous account was most likely run by an operative of the Sinaloa Cartel, which dominates smuggling routes through Arizona. Most of these anonymous accounts, authorities say, trace back to cartel-linked recruiters. Tech companies sporadically work with local police to track and deplatform harmful accounts, law enforcement sources say. The Drug Enforcement Agency, which specifically monitors narcotics smuggling nationwide, “works closely with numerous social media companies to strengthen their ability to combat drug trafficking on their platforms,” a spokesperson said. Without identifying specific platforms, the representative said that “while some companies have been highly receptive, others have been less engaged.” CNN reached out to several platforms that host smuggler recruitment material for comment. A TikTok spokesperson told CNN its teams use automated moderation technology to counter some of this material, which identifies harmful posts before they reach users' feeds; between January and March, the platform says it “proactively removed 95.6% of content which breached (TikTok's) policies on the trade or marketing of regulated goods.” The spokesperson also referenced an excerpt from the platform's community guidelines: “We respect human dignity and are committed to protecting people from exploitation. The platform told CNN it has been able to detect and remove thousands of pieces of such content and noted that it blocks search results associated with smuggler recruitment. Meta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Its community policies instruct users not to post content that “offers to provide or facilitate human smuggling” or “asks for human smuggling services.” The offers of cash for criminal work can pop into anyone's feed. Those recruited are usually young adults between 18 and 25, according to more than two dozen attorneys who represent accused smugglers and were interviewed for this story. Accused smugglers may be addicts, wannabe cartel foot soldiers, or straitlaced high schoolers, the lawyers said. Vicki Brambl, an assistant federal public defender in Tucson, Arizona, says certain risk factors—like a prior criminal history, drug use or growing up in a low-income household—can increase the likelihood someone will get involved with smuggling. But in one case, the son of a local cop was involved. “Anyone can be a target,” says Brambl, who's supervised dozens of smuggling cases. Many recruited to these networks, like the young woman in Phoenix, are desperate and see stacks of cash advertised on social media as either a way out or a risk worth taking; Brambl added many don't have the maturity or judgment to realize the dangers. The hundreds of social media posts advertising smuggling jobs analyzed by CNN show patterns and some veiled terminology. The word “smuggler” almost never appears; recruiters opt for terms like “drivers” or “choferes” or simply “taxis.” A taxi or car emoji can also put out a call for drivers, sometimes with chicken emojis to indicate “pollos,” Spanish slang used to refer to migrants. Emojis and coded language enable cartel-linked recruitment accounts to circumvent content moderation restrictions on mainstream social platforms, which have seen scattered attempts to clamp down on narco-related content. TikTok banned the hashtag #carteltok earlier this year, though it is almost never used by members of these stateside criminal networks. But the cartels do want the posts to be elevated into people's feeds, so many use hashtags, like #fyp (for you page) and #viral, in addition to tagged locations in population hubs along the US-Mexico border. After establishing communication on mainstream social platforms, the recruiter often moves the conversation to Meta's WhatsApp, with its end-to-end encryption and ability to track others in real time. Next, the smuggler travels hours or even days to coordinates sent by their anonymous recruiter — some from as far as New York or Seattle, law enforcement officers and recruiters in Arizona and Texas said. At the pickup location, often down a remote dirt road, lawyers said, a group of migrants jumps into the car. What happens next is up to chance: Some drivers make it to drop-off locations in Phoenix or Tucson, dodging license plate readers and checkpoints on desert highways saturated with police. It's possible to circumvent law enforcement — one active cartel recruiter boasted about having ‘bought off' three checkpoints and federal agencies have admitted several of their officers helped facilitate smuggling in recent years. Other drivers are arrested — collateral damage in a massive criminal enterprise they can only begin to grasp. The senior Sinaloa Cartel operative, whom CNN interviewed to better understand the inner workings of these cross-border networks, is responsible for directing the flow of migrants and drugs in southern Arizona. Several of his associates have been jailed since Trump took office. Earlier this month, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced 617 arrests and over $12 million in currency and asset seizures during a concentrated effort to dismantle Sinaloa Cartel operations in the US and abroad. The man, whose position CNN confirmed independently, said he could be arrested too, but that would not stop the business. “People are still going to bring things” into the US, he said, adding he thought the administration's focus was misguided. Years ago, he said, he began working for the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico, smuggling marijuana to feed his family. “No vale la pena,” he says: Cartel work isn't worth the risk. Nearing 9 p.m. in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, a team of counter-smuggling detectives was wrapping up for the night. The officer swung his undercover truck around, radioing his team to converge on a man who was depositing a $50 bill into the machine. “Police, don't move!” one of the officers yelled, drawing his rifle. Police said its screen still showed a WhatsApp conversation about a group of “pollos” who had just crossed the border nearby. “We dipped because that pollo stopped answering and there was border patrol,” one of the man's associates told him, according to law enforcement. A detective walked him across the parking lot to say goodbye to his family, then guided him into a waiting squad car. The iPhone was bagged as evidence to be brought back to the Cochise County Sheriff's Office and searched for signs of his involvement with cross-border smuggling, like recruitment ads posted to social media. To evade law enforcement, smugglers have used repurposed school buses, fake border patrol trucks and other means to move their product, and only close inspections can distinguish these from the real thing. So, the patrols flag down suspicious vehicles and check them, one by one, harnessing a sophisticated network of license plate readers and other high-tech monitoring tools to suggest who might be out of place, like a college student, far from home, hoping for a quick payday after clicking on a post in a social media feed. Federal prosecutors levied smuggling charges against 431 people over the past six months in Arizona alone, Department of Justice data shows. Earlier this year, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and several other legislators introduced a bipartisan bill calling for a crackdown on cartels using social media to recruit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are refusing to back away from calling President Donald Trump and his allies “fascist,” as Republicans intensify warnings that the rhetoric is reckless and fuels political violence. Democratic lawmakers and leaders, however, have refused to walk away from the label, most typically associated with Nazi Germany, arguing that Trump's conduct in office leaves them no choice but to call it the way they see it. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on her book tour last week, compared Trump and his allies to “a communist dictatorship” for quashing dissent. That defiance was echoed about two weeks ago at a press conference in which Democrats denounced what they described as an assault on free expression, held after ABC suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for remarks about Kirk's assassination. “The First Amendment is how generations of Americans, from civil rights activists to labor organizers, American workers, LGBTQ+ activists, have fought for progress, and it is our power.” “We have no obligation to sugarcoat the gravity of this moment. The only way we save this nation is if the people of this country rise up in peaceful protest, if they mobilize all across America.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) was equally blunt in a House Oversight Committee hearing that same day. “We need to stand up against this fascist takeover,” she said. Democrats have steadily escalated their warnings about Trump by invoking the language of fascism. Back in 2022, then-President Joe Biden described Trump's governing philosophy as “semi-fascist.” By the next year, Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), her running mate, dropped any qualifiers, calling Trump a fascist outright. The message sharpened further in August 2025, when Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin delivered a fiery address at the party's summer meeting, declaring Trump represented not just partisan opposition but an existential threat. “This is not politics as usual, my friends,” Martin told the crowd. And we, each of you in this room, and all of the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.” “At this moment, I would advise any Democratic candidate or politician I work with not to use the word ‘fascist' or ‘dictator' in their jargon, especially after what has played out lately.” Even so, Democrats and their allies argue the president's actions aren't making it easier to hold back. They denounced Thursday's move by federal prosecutors to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime Trump target, as politically motivated and lacking merit. “But I think two wrongs don't make a right, and Democrats need to take the high road.” “If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you politically is a Nazi,” Vice President JD Vance told a crowd in North Carolina last Wednesday, a reference to both the ICE shooting in Dallas last week and Kirk's killing two weeks earlier as proof of rising risks. “Democrats aren't going to win next year by pouring gasoline on the fire.” The National Republican Congressional Committee recently cited polling showing liberals are more likely than conservatives to say political violence is sometimes justified. “For far too long, Democrats have excused riots, smeared conservatives as ‘fascists,' and winked at violent rhetoric from their own ranks,” spokesman Mike Marinella said. He said the same people now “screaming fascism” had implied Kirk deserved his fate. “No side in American politics has a monopoly on disturbed or misguided people,” Trump said. “But one part of our political community believes they have a monopoly on power, thought, and speech.</p>
