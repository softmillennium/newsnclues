                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts? Lewis Hamilton has withdrawn from a Pirelli tyre test after his beloved dog, Roscoe, was taken ill. Lewis Hamilton has shared an update with fans on the health of his much-loved dog, Roscoe, after withdrawing from a Pirelli tyre test due to the bulldog being admitted to hospital. Hamilton had been set to participate in Pirelli's testing of 2026 tyres at the Mugello Circuit in Italy on Friday, but the seven-time World Champion was replaced by Ferrari reserve driver Zhou Guanyu. I want to keep you all updated,” Hamilton wrote on Friday. “Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped. We don't know whether he will wake from this. Hamilton's post was met with well wishes from his followers, including former team mate George Russell who wrote: “Thinking of you mate.” Roscoe – who has his own Instagram account followed by 1.3 million fans – has been a regular fixture by Hamilton's side since 2013, with the Briton's beloved dog joining him at many Grands Prix over the years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts? Lewis Hamilton has announced the passing of his dog, Roscoe, following a health battle. Roscoe was recently admitted to hospital and placed in a coma after being treated for pneumonia, with Hamilton missing a Pirelli tyre test last week to be by his side. On Monday, Hamilton took to social media to share an emotional post confirming that Roscoe had died in his arms on Sunday evening. It comes five years after another of Hamilton's dogs, Coco, passed away. “After four days on life support, fighting with every bit of strength he had, I had to make the hardest decision of my life and say goodbye to Roscoe,” wrote Hamilton. “He never stopped fighting, right until the very end. Bringing Roscoe into my life was the best decision I ever made, and I will forever cherish the memories we created together. It is one of the most painful experiences and I feel a deep connection to everyone who has gone through the loss of a beloved pet. “Although it was so hard, having him was one of the most beautiful parts of life, to love so deeply and to be loved in return.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts? Max Verstappen kept himself busy between the Azerbaijan and Singapore Grands Prix with a successful GT3 race weekend at the Nurburgring. Max Verstappen added another note to his impressive motorsport CV by winning on his GT3 race debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife last weekend, as the Dutchman continues to explore endurance competition. Verstappen and Lulham took on the four-hour race in a Verstappen.com and Red Bull-liveried Ferrari 296 GT3, which was run by Swiss team Emil Frey Racing – the pair coming out on top in a field of 110 cars, of which 10 participated in the fastest category (SP9). “During my first two stints, the car was amazing. “After Qualifying, I knew the car would be good on a dry track. Everything went well in terms of traffic, and we didn't make any big mistakes. To win my debut race here is amazing.” As for what might come next in his growing endurance career, Verstappen added: “Of course, we really want to race the 24-hour race, here at the Nordschleife. If that's going to be next year, I don't know yet.</p>
