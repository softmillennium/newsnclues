                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto.com announced its strategic partnership with Sharps Technology, Inc. (STSS) to manage the latter's Solana-based digital asset treasury. STSS has been expanding its digital asset treasury strategy, with a clear focus on the Solana network. The partnership aims to maximize returns on STSS's Solana holdings while maintaining secure management. Crypto.com's platform will allow STSS to deploy a portion of its assets into Solana-native projects, contributing to the broader growth of the Solana ecosystem. The strategic collaboration marks a pivotal moment for Solana as both companies focus on fostering institutional involvement. This approach aligns with institutional needs for compliance, security, and liquidity access. Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, commented on the partnership, saying, “STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision.” He further emphasized that Crypto.com's infrastructure is uniquely suited for institutions looking to safely manage digital asset treasuries. The collaboration between STSS and Crypto.com will go beyond simple asset management. STSS plans to actively engage with Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, allocating capital into staking, liquidity provision, and validator support. These efforts are designed to strengthen the Solana network's infrastructure, increasing liquidity and supporting long-term growth. By generating yield through these strategies, STSS will also play a role in the sustainability of Solana's ecosystem. James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS, explained, “Partnering with Crypto.com provides us with institutional-grade tools and liquidity access to responsibly manage one of the largest Solana treasuries, while also contributing to the growth of the Solana ecosystem.” This move shows how institutional players are increasingly looking to capitalize on the blockchain's potential, integrating these assets into real-world financial strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's Hypurr non-fungible token (NFT) collection is changing hands at around $55,000 on Monday, Sept. 29, just one day after its deployment on HyperEVM, the ecosystem's Layer 1 (L1) blockchain. HYPE is currently trading at $46.94, up 6.3% on the day, according to CoinGecko. However, shortly after the airdrop, a threat actor reportedly stole eight Hypurr NFTs from compromised wallets, profiting approximately $400,000, according to blockchain analyst ZachXBT, who shared the news on Telegram. Despite this, enthusiasm around the NFT collection remains strong. Even before their official launch, Hypurr NFTs drew strong interest, trading on OTC markets for $30,000 to $60,000 throughout much of 2025. The Hypurr NFT launch underscores Hyperliquid's efforts to reward its early supporters, strengthen community engagement, and expand its ecosystem through new features. “Each NFT is unique and captures the different moods, hobbies, tastes, and quirks of the Hyperliquid community, as depicted by Hypurr.” Hyperliquid currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $5.86 billion, per DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid L1 boasts a TVL of $2.2 billion. The Hypurr NFT launch coincides with Hyperliquid's ongoing ecosystem expansion. Most recently, the project rolled out its native stablecoin USDH through Native Markets, following its successful bid to develop the asset. Currently, USDH, which is Hyperliquid's first dollar-pegged asset, has a market capitalization of $1.44 million. Hyperliquid also made headlines earlier this summer for, at one point, handling more Bitcoin (BTC) spot volume over a single weekend than both Coinbase and Bybit, highlighting its growing influence, The Defiant previously reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zhimin Qian pleads guilty after wallets with 61,000 bitcoins, currently worth over £5bn, seized from north London home A woman has been convicted for her role in a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud after what is thought to have been the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, 45, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. She stored the proceeds in bitcoin, but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices. Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring cryptocurrency that was criminal property and possessing it between October 2017 and April 2024. She had fled China using a bogus St Kitts and Nevis passport in 2017 and entered the UK, where a year later she attempted to launder the money by buying property with the help of Jian Wen, 43, a Chinese takeaway worker. Qian appeared in court aided by a Mandarin interpreter. While laundering the proceeds of the fraud, Wen drove around in a Mercedes and flew her son over from China 18 months later to attend a private school. Qian fled after police raided the Hamsptead property, known as the Manor House, and seized a safety deposit box containing digital wallets that held vast sums in bitcoin. Wen insisted she had no idea that the bitcoin came from the proceeds of fraud and claimed Qian had duped her. In January this year a judge ordered Wen to pay back more than £3m within three months or serve another seven years in jail. When our team located Zhimin Qian, she had been evading justice for five years, and her arrest triggered a complex investigation requiring evidence from multiple jurisdictions and the careful review of thousands of documents. “I am immensely proud of the investigation team and our partners who have worked tirelessly on this case.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, that partnership is entering a new phase as both countries commit to closer cooperation on digital assets—a gambit that could further entrench Washington and London at the vanguard of global finance, even as hubs like Singapore and Dubai emerge as formidable challengers. The new taskforce brings together both banks and crypto firms, underscoring how central digital assets have become to the future of markets. Stablecoins, blockchain infrastructure, and programmable digital securities are no longer fringe concepts. They are fast becoming the backbone of 21st-century financial innovation. In the US, Congress is advancing legislation to establish a stablecoin and digital asset framework. The fact that President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are engaging on the issue underscores their belief in how critical this technology will be. Likewise, England's main financial regulators—the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England—as well as Chancellor Reeves are actively creating regulatory frameworks and working groups. They have even taken the step of allowing at least six major banks to launch pilot programs for tokenized crypto deposits, while increasing collaboration with highly regulated markets like Singapore to assess the impact crypto can have on global trade. By aligning now, both countries can set a global precedent – encouraging others to work across borders to build a more efficient, accessible, and stable financial system. Recent discussions about joint digital sandboxes and shared oversight show how practical cooperation can take shape. Just as the UK's Faster Payments System redefined real-time settlement, and Wall Street pioneered financial instruments that reshaped markets, a joint effort on stablecoins and digital currencies could anchor the next era of global innovation. I write this as someone who has spent the past decade building OKX into one of the world's largest regulated crypto exchanges, with licensed operations across the US, EU, Middle East, and Asia. From this vantage point, I see how quickly digital assets are moving from the periphery of finance into the mainstream. History shows that financial leadership is sustained by openness to innovation. Properly regulated stablecoins and robust blockchain infrastructure are not threats to systemic stability; they are the new building blocks of trust in the digital economy. The opportunity is huge when it comes to stablecoins. Properly regulated, they create a bridge between traditional money and blockchain-based systems, offering trust at the core while unlocking efficiency at the edges. In the UK, regulators are moving toward high-quality backing requirements, though final rules remain under consultation. Stablecoins could become a reliable medium of exchange once these regimes are live. More importantly, by operating on blockchains, they can dramatically lower the cost of remittances, payroll, and B2B trade – giving companies of all sizes greater liquidity and competitiveness. Digital ledger technology is the foundation of this transformation. Together, stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure could reinvigorate financial systems in both countries, ensuring they remain leaders in the future of global finance. Chancellor Reeves and Treasury Secretary Bessent have laid out an aggressive 180-day sprint to identify the first areas of crypto collaboration. If London and Washington succeed, the entire world stands to benefit. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman has pleaded guilty to money laundering offences over the UK's biggest-ever cryptocurrency seizure of Bitcoin, currently worth more than £5bn. Chinese national Yadi Zhang, 47, who is also known as Zhimin Qian, was arrested in April last year after spending years on the run. Police first raided her £5m six-bedroom rented house near Hampstead Heath, in north London, on 31 October 2018. But it was another two and a half years before investigators discovered more than 61,000 Bitcoin in digital wallets - one of the biggest ever cryptocurrency seizures in the world. Crypto prices rally after Trump names Bitcoin and others for US strategic reserve Zhang was due to face trial at Southwark Crown Court but has pleaded guilty to charges of possessing criminal property and transferring criminal property on or before 23 April 2024. She appeared in the dock wearing glasses and a beige cardigan over an animal print blouse, nodding to confirm her identity before entering her pleas with the help of a Mandarin interpreter. Judge Sally-Ann Hales remanded Zhang in custody ahead of sentencing at a later date. Jian Wen, 43, was last year jailed for six years and eight months after being found guilty of one count of money laundering between October 2017 and January 2022 relating to 150 Bitcoin, now worth around £12.5m. Her trial heard Wen was not involved in the alleged fraud but was said to have acted as a "front person" to help disguise the source of the money, some of which had been used to buy cryptocurrency and smuggled out of China on laptops.</p>

The company reported total crypto and cash holdings of $11.6 billion, including 2,650,900 ETHvalued at $4,141 per token, 192 Bitcoin, $436 million in cash, and $157 million in "moonshot" equity investments such as Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS). 2 overall crypto treasury, behind Strategy Inc.

(NYSE: V). Support comes from prominent backers including ARK's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, and Galaxy Digital. Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, BitMine's chairman, said Ethereum remains the firm's primary treasury asset given its reliability and role as infrastructure for both AI and financial markets. Technical analysis: BMNR stock is compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, holding above its 20-day EMA at $51.85, with the 50-day EMA at $47.06 reinforcing support. BitMine's accumulation of more than 2% of Ethereum supply shifts the narrative from trading flows to structural ownership. By anchoring ETH on a public company balance sheet, the firm is effectively institutionalizing a portion of the asset that would otherwise circulate in open markets. This alters liquidity dynamics, raises the floor for scarcity, and creates a new vector for equity investors to gain indirect Ethereum exposure. For investors, BMNR is no longer just a mining or tech stock, it is evolving into a proxy vehicle for Ethereum's monetary base. Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?

Those who backed at the beginning enjoy huge gains in a historic decline. Hyperliquid has deployed 4,600 Hypurr NFTs on the mainnet HyperEVM. These NFTs pay tribute to early patrons of its November 2024 Genesis Event. The platform listed participants, core contributors, and Hyper Foundation as owners without requiring minting. This airdrop rewarded those who were early adopters, not requiring payment, which made Hypurr unique in comparison to most NFT launches, where you have to buy it directly. There was no step to be taken by the recipients; the NFTs were automatically given out after vetting to guarantee fairness and stop abuse. Over-the-counter sales before its launch were reportedly selling at high prices up to 88,000, which showed that there was a lot of demand even before trading started publicly. Insecurity issues arose when hackers stole eight Hypurr NFTs from compromised wallets and sold them for $400,000. The model of Hyperliquid in the Hypurr NFTs is an insight into how blockchain projects can enrich early adopters through meaningful rewards and create natural buzz without standard gatekeeping strategies such as fundraising and minting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Algorand Foundation has tapped Nikolaos Bougalis, a veteran cryptographer and former Ripple engineering lead, as its new chief technology officer, the company said in a press release Monday. Bougalis, who spent nearly a decade guiding development of the open-source XRP Ledger, will lead Algorand's engineering efforts and help advance its 2025 technical roadmap. Algorand's roadmap, unveiled in July, focuses on decentralization, Web3 adoption, enterprise use cases, and cutting-edge cryptography. Bougalis is expected to play a key role in aligning the foundation and Algorand Technologies around those goals. “Nik brings a wealth of experience in distributed systems, cryptography, and blockchain, as well as a demonstrated ability to foster collaborative development communities,” Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden said in the release. “He will help us double down on decentralization, performance, and security.” DL Holdings Spends $41M In Push to Become Hong Kong's Top Publicly Traded Bitcoin Miner The purchase brings DL's mining fleet to 5,195 machines, with a hashrate of 2.1 exahashes per second (EH/s).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This deal, acquired through RTX's Raytheon division, involves providing nine Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) radar systems to both the U.S. Army and Poland, marking Poland's first foray into employing this technology. The LTAMDS radar system is engineered to counteract sophisticated threats, including hypersonic weapons, boasting cutting-edge technology capable of delivering a full 360-degree surveillance radius to track multiple threats at once. Such advanced technology cements RTX's standing in next-gen defense systems, piquing the interest of several nations eager to adopt the radar technology, opening avenues for future revenue growth. With U.S. Department of Defense funding expected to hit $1.01 trillion for FY2026—steering focus towards modernization, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital transformation—fintech companies are becoming increasingly acknowledged as pivotal components in defense ecosystems. This burgeoning budget provides fertile ground for fintech to ease the burdens faced by defense industrial bases and supply chains, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Increased fintech innovations cut financial frictions for SMEs by broadening credit accessibility, reducing costs of capital, and amplifying transparency via improved risk assessment. This is particularly vital for SMEs embedded within defense supply chains that frequently encounter convoluted financing predicaments. The potential involvement of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in bolstering defense financial operations cannot be understated. The digital transformation in finance, which has been sped up by tools such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, is redefining the finance landscape, including procurement and supply chain financing. This evolution lays the groundwork for integrating crypto solutions into defense-related financial operations, facilitating faster, more transparent, and secure payment options. Such integration could refine the efficacy of defense financial operations, rendering them less vulnerable to geopolitical risks. Innovations from fintech can mitigate financial frictions, allowing SMEs to tackle financing complexities with renewed vigor. With stablecoins becoming increasingly integrated into payroll systems, they provide employees in inflation-sensitive regions clarity regarding salary values. Furthermore, fintech enables more seamless cross-border payments, simplifying processes for SMEs seeking to employ international contractors and manage offshore payroll services. The rise of USDC payroll solutions resonates well, attracting startups looking to entice global talent who prefer crypto compensation. This is critical in today's geopolitical climate where cryptocurrencies are often deemed as hedges against inflation and systemic risks. Looking ahead, several trends are set to redefine crypto payroll and financial management. There is an increasing inclination among startups to adopt hybrid models, amalgamating crypto with stablecoins for effective management of income fluctuations. By 2030, salaries could predominantly shift toward cryptocurrencies, with firms employing crypto treasury management strategies to enhance financial operations. In essence, the synthesis of escalating defense contracts, growing defense expenditures focused on technology, and fintech's validated capacity to facilitate SME financial access and resilience points to a transformative era.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion said its holdings have now surpassed 2.65 million ETH — worth around $10.8 billion — following its latest weekly acquisitions. BitMine bought approximately 234,846 ETH ($961.5 million) since its last update on Sept. 22, reporting its total crypto and cash holdings had reached $11.6 billion on Monday. The company's ETH holdings are equivalent to around 2.2% of Ethereum's current circulating supply, which sits at approximately 120.7 million ETH, according to The Block's price page. BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 838,730 ETH and 495,360 ETH, respectively, according to SER data. BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,031 BTC ($71.8 billion) — equivalent to more than 3% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply — following Strategy's latest acquisition announcement on Monday. Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH. "As we enter the final months of 2025, the two Supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto," Lee said in a statement. Naturally, Ethereum remains the premier choice given its high reliability and 100% uptime. These two powerful macro cycles will play out over decades. BitMine is now among the top-traded U.S. equities, with a five-day average daily volume of $2.6 billion as of Sept. 26. That ranks it 26th nationwide, just behind Marvell Technology and ahead of Visa, per Fundstrat and Statista data. "At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock," Lee, who is also co-founder of Fundstrat, said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's bull market still has room to run with a target range of $150,000-$300,000, analysts say. Bitcoin's (BTC) sudden drop to $108,000 last week made it a 13% drawdown from its $124,500 all-time high, sparking fears that the BTC price might have peaked. Despite this drawdown, some analysts argued that Bitcoin's bull market had not even started, citing its performance relative to gold. As Cointelegraph continues to report, both gold and US stock markets have posted repeated all-time highs, while Bitcoin remains stuck as liquidity games keep bulls away. Analysts were not worried about gold front-running Bitcoin, as analyst Milk Road Macro said, The comparative analysis showed that both gold/USD and BTC/USD pairs had formed rising wedge patterns, with gold breaking out to the upside in January. In March, “$BTC began to mimic gold's ‘rise → pause → last minute spike' pattern” highlighted in the green below, the analyst said, adding: Milk Road Macro further explained that while gold's breakout represented about a 10% gain, “Bitcoin has been known to outperform these percentage returns by 5-10x.” Related: A Bitcoin strategic reserve may be bad for BTC and USD: Crypto exec This points to a major price breakout for Bitcoin over the next few months. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant contributor XWIN Research Japan argues that Bitcoin is still in its bull market, based on several onchain metrics. It was trading at $112,233 at the time of writing, up 2.4% over the last 24 hours, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. “$BTC broke out of the down trend line overnight after squeezing all the late shorts,” said AlphaBTC in his latest analysis on X. An accompanying chart showed that a key area of interest for Bitcoin bulls was today's open at $112,000. The 24-hour Bitcoin liquidation heatmap showed that BTC price could target a large block of bid liquidity as it moves higher. There is over $612 million in ask orders between $112,350 and $114,000.

The launchpad enables individual investors to participate in transparent and fair token sales before they get listed on exchanges for public trading. Retail investors usually get access to early-stage tokens only after VCs, institutions, and other private participants have already invested. As a result, individual investors often face disadvantages in early crypto investing, where ICOs are typically restricted to insiders. It enables users to invest in trusted crypto presales alongside VCs and institutional investors. Additionally, the platform is based on Legion's merit-based token allocation, which rewards dedicated community members. Overall, Kraken Launch fosters a fair crypto fundraising environment that enhances token distribution and unlocks greater opportunities for passionate community members and everyday crypto investors. Let's highlight Kraken Launch's main features and how it excels as a new token sale launchpad. For client safety, the platform uses a compliance-focused fundraising approach, requiring crypto ICO projects to provide transparent details and adhere to MiCA standards, with no hidden terms. Retail investors benefit from a safe ICO investing experience thanks to Kraken's proven platform security and Legion's compliance-focused fundraising framework. They also receive transparent project information with no hidden allocations. For crypto project teams, Kraken Launch offers global distribution and greater liquidity through more inclusive capital formation. Through Legion's fair model, the ICO participation platform ensures presale tokens go to committed users who are more likely to support the project's long-term growth, rather than purely VCs and institutions that might only be interested in capital gains. Blockchain technology was built to democratize finance, promising inclusivity, fairness, and permissionless security. “Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow's financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” explained Brett McLain, Kraken's Head of Payments and Blockchain. Aligning with this vision, Legion co-founder Matt O'Connor added, “Crypto gave us the tools to rebuild capital markets from first principles. Additionally, Kraken Launch enforces a compliance-first approach to crypto fundraising based on Legion's model. In particular, this helps investors stay aligned with MiCA regulations. Featured ICO projects provide transparent tokenomics with no hidden round allocations. By leveraging the Legion score, Kraken's new launchpad platform provides a more community-driven fundraising environment compared to other platforms that lack the merit-based allocation system. As a result, Kraken Launch features early-stage cryptos with the most potential, supported by more committed token holders. What can you do now to prepare for the first few projects at Kraken Launch? Kraken Launch, in partnership with Legion, is making crypto fundraising more accessible, fairer, and transparent. By adopting a compliance-first approach, it is paving the way for increased regulatory approval in early crypto investing and ICO projects.

Sharps Technology (NASDAQ:STSS) has announced a strategic partnership with Crypto.com to enhance its digital asset treasury management capabilities, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. Through this collaboration, STSS will utilize Crypto.com's institutional-grade custody infrastructure and OTC desk for managing its digital assets. STSS partners with Crypto.com to manage its $400M Solana treasury, boosting institutional legitimacy for SOL ecosystem investments. This partnership represents a significant institutional advancement for the Solana ecosystem. Sharps Technology has accumulated an impressive 2 million SOL tokens (worth over $400 million) and is now leveraging Crypto.com's institutional infrastructure to manage this substantial treasury. The decision to use Crypto.com's custody solutions, OTC desk, and liquidity services indicates STSS is implementing sophisticated treasury management practices rather than merely holding SOL as a passive investment. The strategic importance lies in how STSS plans to deploy capital across Solana-native projects, which serves dual purposes: generating yield on their treasury while simultaneously improving liquidity throughout the Solana ecosystem. This creates a positive feedback loop where their investment activities directly strengthen the network they're invested in. Notably, Crypto.com's commitment to integrate several Solana projects represents significant validation, as it connects Solana to Crypto.com's massive user base of 150 million users. This integration will likely reduce friction for institutional capital entering the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians - addressing a critical infrastructure gap that has historically limited institutional participation. The collaboration positions STSS as one of the largest institutional Solana treasury holders, establishing them as a significant player in Solana's financial ecosystem. While the treasury strategy carries execution risks and exposure to SOL's price volatility, this partnership demonstrates a sophisticated approach to digital asset management that could become a blueprint for other corporations exploring similar strategies. STSS is an emerging leader in digital asset treasury management, with a bold vision to align traditional finance with the Solana ecosystem. The Company has previously announced plans to establish a Solana-focused digital asset treasury strategy and, to date has acquired more than 2 million SOL. As part of this collaboration, STSS intends to use Crypto.com's platform, including its institutional-grade custody infrastructure and OTC desk, which offers deep liquidity, competitive pricing, and discreet execution, to manage its digital asset treasury. This partnership underscores STSS's commitment to advancing the growth of the Solana network in close alignment with key Solana ecosystem players. The Company's Solana holdings are currently valued at over $400 million, with SOL trading above $200. By deploying a portion of this capital through Crypto.com into Solana-native projects, STSS aims to generate yield while simultaneously expanding liquidity across the Solana ecosystem. "STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision," said Eric Anziani, President and Chief Operating Officer of Crypto.com. "At STSS, we view our digital asset treasury not only as a balance sheet strategy, but as a commitment to advancing the future of open, efficient financial infrastructure," said James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS. This collaboration marks a pivotal step in aligning our long-term corporate strategy with innovation at the forefront of digital finance."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta introduces subscription model at £2.99 monthly following ICO guidance on consent or pay frameworks, setting UK apart from stricter EU regulations. Meta will introduce a subscription option for Facebook and Instagram users in the UK during the coming weeks, allowing them to access the platforms without personalised advertising for £2.99 per month on web browsers or £3.99 monthly on iOS and Android devices. Those who choose to pay will avoid having their personal information used for personalised advertising purposes. Users declining the subscription will continue using the services at no cost while receiving personalised advertisements, maintaining access to existing ad preference controls and privacy settings. Web purchases cost less than mobile subscriptions because Apple and Google charge fees through their respective app store purchasing policies. The guidance updated on January 23 confirmed publishers can implement consent or pay approaches provided they offer genuine choice and meet strict data protection requirements. The ICO framework differs substantially from positions taken by European Union regulators. Meta challenged that opinion through General Court litigation filed on June 27, 2024, presenting seven pleas alleging violations of fundamental rights and improper interpretation of GDPR provisions. The company launched similar subscription services across the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland in October 2023 at €9.99 monthly for web access and €12.99 for mobile applications. Those prices significantly exceeded the UK rates announced in September 2025. Research examining consent or pay implementations across Europe revealed substantial disparities between advertising revenue and subscription charges. A comprehensive report released in July 2025 documented that publishers earn approximately €0.24 per user monthly from tracking-based advertising, while pay options generate €3.24 per user monthly. The analysis found digital advertising accounts for roughly 10 percent of European press revenue, with programmatic advertising requiring personal data representing only 5 percent of total newspaper and magazine income. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office emphasized that fees must be "appropriate" and not "unreasonably high" to avoid effectively coercing users into consenting to data collection. The guidance recommends separating core service access fees from data protection opt-out charges. Where power imbalances exist between organisations and users, regulators expect companies to provide alternative options such as contextual advertising that does not require consent or payment. Publishers must ensure comparable core functionality regardless of whether users choose to consent or pay. While premium features may differ across options, the fundamental service should remain consistent to preserve genuine choice. Organisations must also comply with privacy by design obligations under Article 25(1) of the UK GDPR, ensuring data protection is integrated when designing services. Meta's announcement highlighted differences between UK and EU regulatory environments. The company stated that EU regulators continue requiring less personalised advertising experiences beyond legal requirements, creating worse outcomes for users and businesses. The UK approach allows clearer user choice while enabling personalised advertising tools to function as engines of growth and productivity. Privacy advocacy group noyb filed lawsuitsagainst German data protection authorities on June 17, 2025, over nearly four years of inaction on complaints about consent or pay systems implemented by news websites. The cases revealed significant administrative dysfunction and reluctance to take decisive action against established media companies using questionable consent mechanisms. UK news publishers began implementing consent or pay models following the ICO guidance. The Daily Mirror established pricing at £1.99 monthly for ad-free access with clear data collection options and partner information. Combined with UK GDPR requirements, organisations must secure valid consent to deliver personalised advertising relying on these technologies. Meta maintains that personalised advertisements help users discover relevant products and services while allowing businesses to reach interested customers. Studies indicate personalised ads boost revenue for companies displaying advertisements on Meta platforms, with every pound spent on ads driving an average £3.82 in revenues for UK businesses choosing to advertise. UK advertisers will continue running personalised advertising campaigns reaching users who select free, ad-supported access. The ICO guidance notes that children merit special protection regarding personal information due to potential lack of financial independence and limited understanding of processing activities. Services offered to children under 13 years old must comply with Article 8 UK GDPR. In most cases, funding models remain distinct from core services and should be subject to privacy settings disabled by default. The consent or pay model differs from "take it or leave it" approaches that condition service access solely on accepting data processing for personalised advertising. The ICO determined most take it or leave it approaches fail to comply with requirements for freely given consent because they provide no genuine choice. Consent or pay models differ by offering payment as an alternative to consent, though this raises separate issues when fees combine access to core services with charges for avoiding data sharing. These include access with contextual advertising targeted based on page content rather than user profiles, or menu options with different premium subscription tiers featuring additional functionality. Such approaches may address power imbalance concerns by ensuring users have meaningful choices beyond binary consent or payment decisions. The ICO stated that when organisations identify clear power imbalances with users, they should take additional steps demonstrating consent or pay models comply with data protection law. Power imbalances may exist where users have no realistic choice about whether to use services, particularly affecting existing users who may face significant barriers to switching providers. Factors indicating power imbalances include market position, network effects, switching costs, and data portability limitations. Recital 43 of the UK GDPR explains that consent should not be regarded as freely given if individuals have no genuine free choice or cannot refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. The phrase "without detriment" means individuals should not face unfair penalties for refusing or withdrawing consent. However, it does not mean consent becomes invalid due to any level of negative consequence. Articles 12 and 21 of the UK GDPR require organisations processing personal data for direct marketing purposes to demonstrate that individuals can exercise their right to object free of charge. The ICO guidance explains that direct marketing definitions include processing for personalised advertising purposes. Meta's implementation will notify UK users over 18 about their choice to subscribe for fee-based access without advertisements. The notification will be dismissible initially, allowing existing users time to consider options before decisions are required. Social media services remain personalised for subscribers, but their personal data will not be used to display advertisements. The Court of Justice of the European Union previously limited Meta's data use for advertising, requiring data minimisation principles even when users consent to personalised advertising. A Leipzig District Court awarded a Facebook user €5,000 compensation on July 4, 2025, for data protection violations involving Meta's Business Tools that track users across third-party websites. The UK regulatory environment appears increasingly divergent from European Union approaches. While digital advertising trade associations defend consent or pay models in EU consultations, arguing they provide genuine user autonomy, privacy advocates continue documenting concerns about coercive design and excessive pricing. The tension between commercial viability and privacy protection remains central to ongoing regulatory debates. The relatively low subscription pricing compared to European rates may influence user decisions and affect targeting reach for advertisers. The ICO's framework provides clearer parameters for implementing similar models while maintaining compliance with UK data protection law. Users selecting subscription options will not contribute to personalised advertising metrics, potentially impacting campaign optimisation and audience insights.

What: A subscription model priced at £2.99 monthly on web or £3.99 on mobile platforms allows users to access Facebook and Instagram without personalised advertising, while those declining subscriptions continue using services at no cost with advertisements. Where: The subscription option applies to users based in the United Kingdom, representing a departure from Meta's approach in European Union markets where pricing remains significantly higher. Why: The implementation follows ICO guidance establishing frameworks for consent or pay models, requiring organisations to demonstrate users can freely give consent while balancing commercial viability with privacy protection through appropriate fees, service equivalence, and privacy by design principles.</p>
