                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ghost hunters in this one are rumored to be cousins of the famed Ed and Lorraine Warren. Black Mandala has released the trailer and poster for the Australian production NIGHTFALL: A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION. Directed by Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens, who also co-star, from a script by McEwen, who served as cinematographer, it also features Selwyn G. Stevens, Selwyn R. Stevens, Lorenzo Marte and Bill McEwen. Paranormal investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth have built their careers confronting the unexplained across Northern Europe. But when a desperate call draws them to the isolated home of Elizabeth Blair, they encounter a presence unlike anything they have ever faced. Over the course of seven days, this force unravels their sanity, twists their perception of reality, and threatens to destroy their bond. “This is no ordinary haunting.

The post, which was made on TruthSocial, prompted an online furor among those familiar with conspiracy theories, because it promoted a particularly fringe one, even by the standards of an administration that has pushed anti-vaccine paranoia onto the public and advanced widespread falsehoods about a presidential election. At 10:19 p.m. Saturday, Donald Trump's account posted a 37-second video on TruthSocial. The video, which was A.I.-generated, was meant to look like a Fox News segment announcing the arrival of a medbed hospital—a kind of fantastical facility that uses advanced technology to more or less magically treat everything that ails the human body. Remarkably, the video included an A.I.-generated video of Trump himself talking; the promotion of this video from his account seemed, bafflingly, to make the announcement look legitimate. Trump has never posted anything like this before—an A.I.-generated version of him announcing news, giving life to a fringe conspiracy theory—on any of his accounts. It announced “the launch of America's first medbed hospital and a national medbed card for every citizen.” It showed B-roll shots of gleaming hospitals with futuristic-looking technology. An A.I.-generated version of Trump, speaking with low energy from the Resolute Desk, says, “Every American will soon receive their own medbed card. These facilities are safe, modern, and designed to return every citizen to full health and strength. This is the beginning of a new era in American health care.” An A.I.-generated version of Lara Trump, speaking as a Fox News host, then clarifies that there will first only be a limited number available and that registration details would be announced soon. To be abundantly clear, medbeds are not real. But per the conspiracy theory, a medbed is a kind of extremely advanced technology capable of healing the human body of literally everything, including natural aging. In the telling of the conspiracy theory, it may have an alien origin or a mystical origin or just be breathtakingly advanced science. A medbed has no limits to what it can do. Mostly, it comes from the QAnon world. For years, Q influencers have hyped it as a way to promise a kind of golden future on the other side of their revolution. At times, medbeds have also been useful for connected conspiracy theories, explaining how some figure—an assassinated John F. Kennedy, for example—who should have died long ago is still alive. Well, as with so many conspiracy theories, there are variations. Some people believe that medbed technology is in development but still somewhat theoretical, or that it's already here but being suppressed by evil actors—sometimes the cabal, sometimes the pharmaceutical industry, keen on keeping people sick. But some in the community believe that under Trump, it's being quietly tested and rolled out for the public. Does that mean there's a grift element? As the Daily Beast has detailed, some companies sell devices they describe as medbeds, invoking some kind of New Age healing promises or other nonsense science. These devices are advertised as having the ability to do some pretty miraculous things, including heal terminal cancer. There are also medbed clinics, where people can pay to receive quack treatments from people who claim to have working medbeds. Medbed theories, at their core, are deeply depressing, because they offer false hope to people with pretty desperate situations. At their least harmful, they're a way of making healthy people excited about some kind of futuristic golden age without suffering. At their most harmful, they encourage desperate people with debilitating or life-threatening medical conditions to turn away from legitimate medical science and possibly spend fortunes on useless woo-woo junk. Why on earth would Trump promote this? Trump does often promote QAnon content, but it typically doesn't involve anything as fantastical as medbeds. It's possible it was someone else who had control of his account, but we don't know. Sometimes, Trump appears to enjoy what he sees as hyperbolic, semi-trolling claims of his greatness, as when he reposts videos of him as a muscular wrestler or some other heroic figure; it's possible he or someone with account access thought this was harmless fun. If so, he underestimated the level at which conspiracy theorists actually buy into these ideas. It's also possible that he wants to continue to string along his QAnon supporters, some of whom are growing restless, particularly after Trump failed to expose Democrats and other “deep state” actors with Epstein's “client list.” Do we know where this video came from? No, but it's certainly not a Trump original. It's unclear how Trump himself stumbled upon this video, but one journalist found it on a couple of scam Instagram pages. Most of the community seems aware that it's A.I. and aren't being fooled into thinking it's a genuine Fox News segment. (That being said: Many people—often older people—do have a hard time discerning what is real and what is not with A.I.-generated content, so it is very likely that some people will encounter this video on Facebook and take it at face value.) But, judging by posts on TruthSocial and activity from known QAnon accounts on X, some see the post as a message from Trump that medbeds are indeed on their way, possibly thanks to advances from A.I. Others have other, convoluted theories about some play he's making related to A.I. So this post may actually cause sick people real harm? Trump deleted the video, limiting its harm to some degree, but some will choose to see the deletion not as a retraction but as part of the secret form of communication he uses for his most devoted followers. Trump has a huge audience, and he's a near-messianic figure for some of these people; even if the medbed post was meant as a joke—and nothing he has said or written has indicated it was—people will almost certainly latch onto this post as a coded message, telling them to turn away from the corrupt medical community and hold out for something better. For people facing life-threatening illnesses, such false hope can be deadly. Slate relies on advertising to support our journalism. If you value our work, please disable your ad blocker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here is a look at ghost towns of Montana. A group of believers and some folks who are just plain curious met in Butte over the weekend to discuss all things paranormal. It featured nearly two dozen speaking guests, ghost-busters, classes, lectures a séance and workshops. Elies Adams, president and founder of Bozeman Paranormal Society Among those attending was Justine LaBreche of Butte, who said it was something of a honeymoon present for her and her husband, Johnathan. She said she had just attended a discussion by Richard O'Connor of Clancy, with the Crop Circles Research Foundation Inc., on crop circles. “My mom and I, we both believe in spirits. Her husband said he was enjoying the conference and said it was good to have it at this time of year as Halloween approaches and the vibe is spooky. Among those at the show was Kathleen Johns, a psychic medium who was selling her book “Echoes of the Afterlife.“ Kathleen Johns, a psychic medium from Bozeman, holds a copy of her book "Echoes from the Afterlife" at the Big Sky Paranormal Conference on Saturday. She said she was going to speak later at the conference about “mediumship,” in which she delivers a message from someone on the afterlife to someone in the audience. Johns, who is based in Bozeman, said the messages from beyond are great, and that she has found that people in the afterlife do not hold on to grudges. She said she hoped to make “connections” on Saturday as the chateau, like many other buildings in Butte, is great for making connections with those not in this dimension. “I think people are just curious, they just want to know,” Johns said, adding statistics show that 75% of Americans believe they have had some kind of encounter with a dead loved one. “I don't generally run into skeptics in my work,” said Johns, whose grandmothers were also mediums. Elies Adams, president and founder of Bozeman Paranormal Society, which has been around for about 13 years, said they like coming to Butte. She said the conference was originally in Philipsburg, but they outgrew that location. She said they partnered with the Clark Chateau and moved it to Butte. When people ask her about paranormal activity in Montana she points out the state has a lot of history and a lot of ghost towns. Adams said the event brings people together to find out more about the paranormal, but "we want to make it where other paranormal enthusiasts learn from each other.” “A lot of people are like me, they want to know more about the paranormal and other aspects of the paranormal,” she said. “They want a scientific answer to everything,” Adams said. “It isn't a bad thing, it just tells you they are trying to get answers and trying to figure out what is going on.” Learn more about the Bozeman Paranormal Society at https://www.facebook.com/BozemanParanormal/ For more on Kathleen Johns and her book, go to www.KathleenJohns.com Elies Adams, president and founder of Bozeman Paranormal Society Here is a look at ghost towns of Montana.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A respected congressman has claimed that advanced alien beings could be hiding out in 'five or six' underwater UFO bases right off the US coast. Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee overseeing UFO reports, drew massive attention on social media after saying that he believed there were alien 'entities' currently living in deep-water areas on Earth. The September 17 clip posted on X has already been viewed more than 1.9 million times. During the sidewalk interview with Matt Laslo, reposted online by a UFO researcher who goes by the pseudonym Red Panda Koala, Burchett suggested that advanced alien beings or civilizations may have been hiding in Earth's oceans for generations. He added that there have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft around five or six specific deep-sea areas, which he found significant given how little is known about the ocean compared to the moon's surface. The congressman also noted that US Navy personnel have reported chasing these underwater craft that move at extraordinary speeds and far surpass the abilities of current US military technology. Despite these claims, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these underwater craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of alien bases. Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett (pictured) suggested in a viral clip online that there are alien beings in secret underwater bases near the US (Stock Image) Following the explosive revelations, Dr Michael Salla, an author and researcher focused on extraterrestrial phenomena, revealed where it's believed these UFO bases may be, singling out a region of the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. He added that he's also spoken to credible whistleblowers, including senior military and executive branch officials, who confirm the existence of underwater bases and advanced craft. Dr Salla highlighted that the US Navy operates a top-secret underwater facility he likened to Area 51 called AUTEC, which stands for the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center, right in this region of the Atlantic. 'So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water. So, there have been a lot of UFO sightings in that area,' he revealed. The submarine, capable of space travel, took him to an underwater city under a dome, resembling Dubai, with a large white pyramid. Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri recently revealed video of a US military drone striking an orb-shaped UFO with a missile, which bounced off and did not stop the craft 'We have naval personnel telling me we have these sightings, these underwater craft they're chasing that go hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we got is something that does maybe a little under forty miles an hour,' Burchett said in the interview with Laslo. 'So I got a lot of questions about that stuff.' By posting your comment you agree to our house rules. Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee, alien "entities" are already residing in Earth's deep waters. Burchett made the suggestion that intelligent alien entities or civilizations might have been lurking beneath the water for "millennia" in a now-viral video that was uploaded to X on September 17. “There have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft in about five or six specific deep sea areas,” Burchett stated in a sidewalk interview with Red Panda Koala, a UFO researcher and documentary maker. "[The underwater crafts] they're chasing are doing hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we've got is something that does maybe just a little bit under 40 miles an hour". "I've got a lot of questions about that stuff," he added. Despite these assertions, the public has not been provided with any substantiating proof, such as artifacts or unobscured video of these crafts. The claims are questioned, according to critics, because they are based on anecdotal stories from military personnel and lack peer-reviewed scientific data.

"So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater crafts coming into and leaving the water." Dr. Salla claimed to have spoken with two eyewitnesses, one of which was a US Army whistleblower who went by the moniker JP, who claimed to have visited these covert bases.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sitting US Congressman has ignited widespread debate with claims that aliens might not be arriving from faraway galaxies but could already be inhabiting Earth's oceans. Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee which reviews UFO reports, was filmed in a casual sidewalk interview with UFO researcher and documentary maker “Red Panda Koala” near the US Capitol. In the clip, posted to X on 17 September, Burchett proposed that alien entities may have established underwater bases in the Atlantic Ocean. “What if these are entities that are here on this earth, that have been on this earth for who knows how long, and we think they're coming from way out. The Congressman also claimed that US Navy personnel had reported multiple sightings of unidentified underwater craft at “five or six” specific ocean locations. “We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings … of these underwater crafts that they're chasing,” he added. “That's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water,” Salla explained during an appearance on the Redacted podcast on 19 September. While there is no verified evidence of extraterrestrial underwater bases, Burchett's remarks have added to a growing list of UFO-related claims made by US officials in recent years. His comments have since gone viral, fuelling speculation and renewed debate about what lies hidden beneath the oceans.

In recent weeks, a photo allegedly depicting a massive, disc-shaped object hovering hundreds of feet above the ground has sparked widespread debate and intrigue. The image was presented by Luis “Lue” Elizondo, a former U.S. Army counterintelligence officer and prominent figure in the UFO community, during a House Oversight and Accountability Committee meeting. However, what initially seemed like compelling evidence of extraterrestrial activity quickly unraveled into a case of mistaken identity, leading to significant scrutiny and skepticism. The image in question was reportedly captured by a civilian pilot and showed a silver-hued, disc-shaped object that was estimated to be between 600 and 1,000 feet in diameter. This revelation was shared during a panel titled “Science, National Security & Innovation,” where multiple speakers, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, were in attendance. Elizondo, who has been vocal about the need for transparency regarding UAPs, used the photo to call for a full declassification and scientific analysis of such occurrences. According to him, the image was provided by a private pilot just hours before the forum. « America's Invisible Bomber Fleet Doubles Overnight »: Second B-21 Arrives At Edwards While China's Air Defense Becomes Completely Useless The photo quickly attracted attention on social media platforms, particularly Reddit, where users began to scrutinize its authenticity. In the r/UFOs community, known for its openness to conspiracy theories, a user named mattperkins86 traced the image back to a satellite photo of two adjacent circular fields near Colorado Springs. The darker circle appeared to be a shadow of the lighter circle, suggesting a natural, terrestrial explanation rather than an extraterrestrial one. This discovery prompted ridicule and criticism of Elizondo's presentation, with some users expressing disbelief at what they perceived as a blatant oversight. These revelations underscored the importance of thorough investigation and verification in the pursuit of credible evidence. « China Turned 3,000 Dead Jets Into Zombies »: Soviet Fighters Attack Without Pilots While Taiwan's Missiles Can't Stop Them All Elizondo, who resigned from the Department of Defense in 2017 over bureaucratic challenges related to UAP investigations, has been a vocal advocate for the release of classified information on the subject. These missteps have raised questions about the credibility of his assertions and the broader movement for transparency. « China's Electromagnetic Catapult Launches 50 Jets »: Fujian Carrier Fires Stealth Fighters While U.S. Navy's Ford Class Remains Broken The recent incident has implications for the broader movement advocating for disclosure of UAP-related information. Critics argue that such blunders detract from the legitimate scientific inquiry and risk further stigmatizing the subject. As the search for answers persists, the challenge remains to balance skepticism with genuine inquiry, ensuring that future revelations are grounded in verifiable evidence. While the image ultimately proved to be a case of mistaken identity, it underscores the enduring intrigue and debate surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena. As researchers and enthusiasts continue to explore this enigmatic subject, one question remains: How can we ensure that the quest for knowledge is driven by evidence and scientific integrity, rather than sensationalism and speculation?
